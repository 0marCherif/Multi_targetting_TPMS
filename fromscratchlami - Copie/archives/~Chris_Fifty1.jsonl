This approach has achieved good empirical performance especially with recent transformer-based video architectures. While recently many works aim to design more advanced transformer architectures for action recognition, less effort has been made on how to train video transformers. In this work, we explore several training paradigms and present two findings. First, video transformers benefit from joint training on diverse video datasets and label spaces (e.g., Kinetics is appearance-focused while SomethingSomething is motion-focused). Second, by further co-training with images (as single-frame videos), the video transformers learn even better video representations. We term this approach as Co-training Videos and Images for Action Recognition (CoVeR). In particular, when pretrained on ImageNet-21K based on the TimeSFormer architecture, CoVeR improves Kinetics-400 Top-1 Accuracy by 2.4%, Kinetics-600 by 2.3%, and SomethingSomething-v2 by 2.3%. When pretrained on larger-scale image datasets following previous state-of-the-art, CoVeR achieves best results on Kinetics-400 (87.2%), Kinetics-600 (87.9%), Kinetics-700 (79.8%), SomethingSomething-v2 (70.9%), and Moments-in-Time (46.1%), with a simple spatio-temporal video transformer."}}

However, the training and inference costs of these large Transformer language models are prohibitive, thus necessitating more research in identifying more efficient variants. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective modification to the Transformer architecture inspired by the literature in statistical language modeling, by augmenting the model with n-grams that are constructed from a discrete latent representation of the text sequence. We evaluate our model, the N-Grammer on language modeling on the C4 data-set as well as text classification on the SuperGLUE data-set, and find that it outperforms several strong baselines such as the Transformer and the Primer. We open-source our model for reproducibility purposes in Jax."}}

Yet, the performance of these methods is heavily dependent on a carefully tuned learning rate schedule. We show that in many large-scale applications, augmenting a given optimizer with an adaptive tuning method of the step-size greatly improves the performance. More precisely, we maintain a global step-size scale for the update as well as a gain factor for each coordinate. We adjust the global scale based on the alignment of the average gradient and the current gradient vectors. A similar approach is used for updating the local gain factors. This type of step-size scale tuning has been done before with gradient descent updates. In this paper, we update the step-size scale and the gain variables with exponentiated gradient updates instead. Experimentally, we show that our approach can achieve compelling accuracy on standard models without using any specially tuned learning rate schedule. We also show the effectiveness of our approach for quickly adapting to distribution shifts in the data during training."}}

Understanding and Improving Multi-Task Generalization", "abstract": "Multi-task learning aims to solve multiple machine learning tasks at the same time, with good solutions being both generalizable and Pareto optimal. A multi-task deep learning model consists of a shared representation learned to capture task commonalities, and task-specific sub-networks capturing the specificities of each task. In this work, we offer insights on the under-explored trade-off between minimizing task training conflicts in multi-task learning and improving multi-task generalization, i.e. the generalization capability of the shared presentation across all tasks. The trade-off can be viewed as the tension between multi-objective optimization and shared representation learning: As a multi-objective optimization problem, sufficient parameterization is needed for mitigating task conflicts in a constrained solution space; However, from a representation learning perspective, over-parameterizing the task-specific sub-networks may give the model too many \u201ddegrees of freedom\u201d and impedes the generalizability of the shared representation. Specifically, we first present insights on understanding the parameterization effect of multi-task deep learning models and empirically show that larger models are not necessarily better in terms of multi-task generalization. A delicate balance between mitigating task training conflicts vs. improving generalizability of the shared presentation learning is needed to achieve optimal performance across multiple tasks. Motivated by our findings, we then propose the use of a under-parameterized self-auxiliary head alongside each task-specific sub-network during training, which automatically balances the aforementioned trade-off. As the auxiliary heads are small in size and are discarded during inference time, the proposed method incurs minimal training cost and no additional serving cost. We conduct experiments with the proposed self-auxiliaries on two public datasets and live experiments on one of the largest industrial recommendation platforms serving billions of users. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the predictive performance across multiple tasks in multi-task models."}}
