Recently, Heng & Jacob (2019) studied Metropolis HMC with couplings for unbiased Monte Carlo estimation, establishing a generic parallelizable scheme for HMC. However, in practice a different HMC method, multinomial HMC, is considered as the go-to method, e.g. as part of the no-U-turn sampler. In multinomial HMC, proposed states are not limited to end-points as in Metropolis HMC; instead points along the entire trajectory can be proposed. In this paper, we establish couplings for multinomial HMC, based on optimal transport for multinomial sampling in its transition. We prove an upper bound for the meeting time \u2013 the time it takes for the coupled chains to meet \u2013 based on the notion of local contractivity. We evaluate our methods using three targets: 1,000 dimensional Gaussians, logistic regression and log-Gaussian Cox point processes. Compared to Heng & Jacob (2019), coupled multinomial HMC generally attains a smaller meeting time, and is more robust to choices of step sizes and trajectory lengths, which allows re-use of existing adaptation methods for HMC. These improvements together paves the way for a wider and more practical use of coupled HMC methods."}}

Some prominent examples are constrained-to-unconstrained transformations of distributions for use in Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo and constructing flexible and learnable densities such as normalizing flows. We present Bijectors.jl, a software package for transforming distributions implemented in Julia, available at github.com/TuringLang/Bijectors.jl. The package provides a flexible and composable way of implementing transformations of distributions without being tied to a computational framework. \n\nWe demonstrate the use of Bijectors.jl on improving variational inference by encoding known statistical dependencies into the variational posterior using normalizing flows, providing a general approach to relaxing the mean-field assumption usually made in variational inference."}}
