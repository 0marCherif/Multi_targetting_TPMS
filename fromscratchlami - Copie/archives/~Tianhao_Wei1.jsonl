A major concern is safety, in another word, constraint satisfaction. State-wise constraints are one of the most common constraints in real-world applications and one of the most challenging constraints in Safe RL. Enforcing state-wise constraints is necessary and essential to many challenging tasks such as autonomous driving, robot manipulation. This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing approaches that address state-wise constraints in RL. Under the framework of State-wise Constrained Markov Decision Process (SCMDP), we will discuss the connections, differences, and trade-offs of existing approaches in terms of (i) safety guarantee and scalability, (ii) safety and reward performance, and (iii) safety after convergence and during training. We also summarize limitations of current methods and discuss potential future directions."}}

Energy function based methods have been introduced to address the problem. To ensure safety in the presence of control limits, we need to design an energy function that results in persistently feasible safe control at all system states. However, designing such an energy function for high-dimensional nonlinear systems remains challenging. Considering the fact that there are redundant dynamics in high dimensional systems with respect to the safety specifications, this paper proposes a novel approach called abstract safe control. We propose a system abstraction method that enables the design of energy functions on a low-dimensional model. Then we can synthesize the energy function with respect to the low-dimensional model to ensure persistent feasibility. The resulting safe controller can be directly transferred to other systems with the same abstraction, e.g., when a robot arm holds different tools. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a 7-DoF robot arm (14 states) both in simulation and real-world. Our method always finds feasible control and achieves zero safety violations in 500 trials on 5 different systems."}}

Safety index provides a handy way to evaluate the safety level of the system and derive the resulting safe control policies. However, designing safety index functions under control limits is difficult and requires a great amount of expert knowledge. This paper proposes a framework for synthesizing the safety index for general control systems using sum-of-squares programming. Our approach is to show that ensuring the non-emptiness of safe control on the safe set boundary is equivalent to a local manifold positiveness problem. We then prove that this problem is equivalent to sum-of-squares programming via the Positivstellensatz of algebraic geometry. We validate the proposed method on robot arms with different degrees of freedom and ground vehicles. The results show that the synthesized safety index guarantees safety and our method is effective even in high-dimensional robot systems."}}

However, due to the complexity of system dynamics, it is challenging and time-consuming to apply these methods directly to non-control-affine systems, which cover a large group of dynamic systems, such as UAVs and systems with data-driven Neural Network Dynamic Models (NNDMs). Although all dynamic systems can be written in control-affine forms through dynamic extension, it remains unclear how to optimally design a computationally efficient algorithm to safely control the extended system. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing an optimal approach to synthesize safe control for the extended system under the framework of energy-function-based safe control. The proposed method first extends the energy function and then performs hyperparameter optimization to maximize performance while guaranteeing safety. It has been theoretically proved that our method guarantees safety (forward invariance of the safe set) and performance (bounded tracking error and smoother trajectories). It has been numerically validated that the proposed method is computationally efficient for non-control-affine systems."}}

Existing methods are designed to verify the network before deployment, which are limited to relatively simple specifications and fixed networks. These methods are not ready to be applied to real-world problems with complex and/or dynamically changing specifications and networks. To effectively handle such problems, verification needs to be performed online when these changes take place. However, it is still challenging to run existing verification algorithms online. Our key insight is that we can leverage the temporal dependencies of these changes to accelerate the verification process. This paper establishes a novel framework for scalable online verification to solve real-world verification problems with dynamically changing specifications and/or networks. We propose three types of acceleration algorithms: Branch Management to reduce repetitive computation, Perturbation Tolerance to tolerate changes, and Incremental Computation to reuse previous results. Experiment results show that our algorithms achieve up to $100\\times$ acceleration, and thus show a promising way to extend neural network verification to real-world applications."}}
