Unfortunately, obtaining suitable QUBO forms in computer vision remains challenging and currently requires problem-specific analytical derivations. Moreover, such explicit formulations impose tangible constraints on solution encodings. In stark contrast to prior work, this paper proposes to learn QUBO forms from data through gradient backpropagation instead of deriving them. As a result, the solution encodings can be  chosen flexibly and compactly. Furthermore, our methodology is general and virtually independent of the specifics of the target problem type. We demonstrate the advantages of learnt  QUBOs on the diverse problem types of graph matching, 2D point cloud alignment and 3D rotation estimation. Our results are competitive with the previous quantum state of the art while requiring much fewer logical and physical qubits, enabling our method to scale to larger problems. The code and the new dataset are available at https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/QuAnt/."}}

Audits have revealed rampant biases that could lead to harm, when services are used by developers and researchers. We focus on temporal auditing, replicating experiments originally conducted three years ago. We document the changes observed over time, relating this to the growing awareness of structural oppression and the need to align technology with social values. While we document some positive changes in the services\u2019 behaviors, such as increased accuracy in the use of gender-related tags overall, we also replicate findings concerning larger error rates for images of Black individuals. In addition, we find cases of increased use of inferential tags (eg, emotions), which are often sensitive. The analysis underscores the difficulty in following changes in services\u2019 behaviors over time, and the need for more oversight of such services."}}

For the first time in the literature, these two problems are solved jointly and synergetically without relying on any training data, which brings advantages for identifying similar arbitrary objects in compound 3D scenes and matching them. For joint reasoning, we first rephrase graph matching as a rigid point set registration problem operating on spectral graph embeddings. Consequently, we utilise efficient convex semidefinite program relaxations for aligning points in Hilbert spaces and add coupling constraints to model the mutual dependency and exploit synergies between both tasks. We outperform state of the art in challenging cases with non-perfectly matching and noisy graphs, and we show successful applications on real compound scenes with multiple 3D elements. Our source code and data are publicly available."}}
