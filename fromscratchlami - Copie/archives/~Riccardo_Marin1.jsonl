However, while several efforts have been devoted to the design of new convolutional architectures, pooling or positional encoding schemes, relatively little focus has been spent on modeling pairwise problems such as signal transfer, graph isomorphism and subgraph correspondence tasks. With this paper, we anticipate the need for a convenient framework to deal with problems that revolve around the notion of a map among graphs, and focus in particular on the challenging subgraph alignment scenario. We claim that, first and foremost, the representation of a map plays a central role in how these problems should be modeled -- be it a map inference problem or a simpler signal transport task. Taking the hint from recent work in geometry processing, we propose the adoption of a spectral representation for maps that is compact, easy to compute, permutation-equivariant, easy to plug into learning pipelines, and especially effective for a wide range of situations, most notably when dealing with subgraph alignment problems. We further report for the first time a surprising phenomenon where the partiality arising in subgraph alignment is manifested in the structure of the map coefficients, even in the absence of exact isomorphism, and which is consistently observed over different families of graphs."}}

Existing works often consider different benchmarks and evaluation settings, hindering comparison and, therefore, scientific progress. In this work, we start by providing an extensive overview of the possible approaches to solving the task, comparing the current state-of-the-art and baselines via a unified evaluation framework. Our findings show that while graph-tailored approaches have a clear edge on some distributions, easily adapted few-shot learning methods generally perform better. \nIn fact, we show that it is sufficient to equip a simple metric learning baseline with a state-of-the-art graph embedder to obtain the best overall results. We then show that straightforward additions at the latent level lead to substantial improvements by introducing i) a task-conditioned embedding space ii) a MixUp-based data augmentation technique. Finally, we release a highly reusable codebase to foster research in the field, offering modular and extensible implementations of all the relevant techniques."}}

Different from existing works that represent deformation fields by training a general-purpose neural network, we advocate for an approximation based on mesh-free methods. By letting the network learn deformation parameters at a sparse set of positions in space (nodes), we reconstruct the continuous deformation field in a closed-form with guaranteed smoothness. With this reduction in degrees of freedom, we show significant improvement in terms of data-efficiency thus enabling limited supervision. Furthermore, our approximation provides direct access to first-order derivatives of deformation fields, which facilitates enforcing desirable regularization effectively. Our resulting model has high expressive power and is able to capture complex deformations. We illustrate its effectiveness through state-of-the-art results across multiple deformable shape matching benchmarks.

Typical issues faced by geometry processing algorithms include the variety of discrete representations for 3D data (point clouds, polygonal or tet-meshes and voxels), or the type of deformation this data may undergo. Powerful approaches to address these issues come from looking at the spectral decomposition of canonical differential operators, such as the Laplacian, which provides a rich, informative, robust, and invariant representation of the 3D objects. The focus of this tutorial is on computational spectral geometry. We will offer a different perspective on spectral geometric techniques, supported by recent successful methods in the graphics and 3D vision communities and older but notoriously overlooked results. We will discuss both the \u201cforward\u201d path typical of spectral geometry pipelines (e.g. computing Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a given shape) with its widespread applicative relevance, and the inverse path (e.g. recovering a shape from given Laplacian eigenvalues, like in the classical \u201chearing the shape of the drum\u201d problem) with its ill-posed nature and the benefits showcased on several challenging tasks in graphics and geometry processing."}}

At the same time, several fields demand methods working in scarcity of data. This problem is even more complex when the samples have varying structures, as in the case of graphs. Graph representation learning techniques have recently proven successful in a variety of domains. Nevertheless, the employed architectures perform miserably when faced with data scarcity. On the other hand, few-shot learning allows employing modern deep learning models in scarce data regimes without waiving their effectiveness. In this work, we tackle the problem of few-shot graph classification, showing that equipping a simple distance metric learning baseline with a state-of-the-art graph embedder allows to obtain competitive results on the task.While the simplicity of the architecture is enough to outperform more complex ones, it also allows straightforward additions. To this end, we show that additional improvements may be obtained by encouraging a task-conditioned embedding space. Finally, we propose a MixUp-based online data augmentation technique acting in the latent space and show its effectiveness on the task."}}

In this work, we propose to automate tissue dissection tasks by introducing a convolutional neural network, called BA-Net, to predict the location of attachment points between adjacent tissues. BA-Net identifies the attachment areas from a single partial view of the deformed surface, without any a-priori knowledge about their location. The proposed method guarantees a very fast prediction time, which makes it ideal for intra-operative applications. Experimental validation is carried out on both simulated and real world phantom data of soft tissue manipulation performed with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). The obtained results demonstrate that BA-Net provides robust predictions at varying geometric configurations, material properties, distributions of attachment points and grasping point locations. The estimation of attachment points provided by BA-Net improves the simulation of the anatomical environment where the system is acting, leading to a median simulation error below 5 mm in all the tested conditions. BA-Net can thus further support an ARS by providing a more robust test bench for the robotic actions intra-operatively, in particular when replanning is needed. The method and collected dataset are available at https://gitlab.com/altairLab/banet."}}

In particular, simulation boundary conditions cannot be determined from pre-operative modalities, but their correct definition is essential to improve the PBM predictive capability. In this work, we introduce a pipeline that provides an up-to-date estimate of boundary conditions, starting from the pre-operative model of patient anatomy and the displacement undergone by points visible from an intra-operative vision sensor. The presented pipeline is experimentally validated in realistic conditions on an ex vivo pararenal fat tissue manipulation.
