While the robots of many swarm systems communicate via optical links, the underlying channels and their impact on swarm performance are poorly understood. This paper models the optical channel of a widely used robotic platform, the e-puck. It proposes SwarmCom, a mobile ad-hoc network for mobile robots. SwarmCom has a detector that, with the help of the channel model, was designed to adapt to the environment and nearby robots. Experiments with groups of up to 30 physical e-pucks show that (i) SwarmCom outperforms the state-of-the-art infra-red communication software\u2014libIrcom\u2014in range (up to 3 times further), bit error rate (between 50 and 63% lower), or throughput (up to 8 times higher) and that (ii) the maximum number of communication channels per robot is relatively low, which limits the load per robot even for high-density swarms. Using channel coding, the bit error rate can be further reduced at the expense of throughput. SwarmCom could have profound implications for swarm robotics, contributing to system understanding and reproducibility, while paving the way for novel applications."}}

Here, we propose a novel swarm robotic system for autonomous harvesting of cereal crops such as wheat and barley. In contrast to existing agricultural swarm robotic systems, we intend to use small autonomous versions of traditional agricultural vehicles, in an attempt to narrow the skills gap for future end-users."}}

The policies are fully decentralized and can be executed on anonymous, oblivious agents with chirality, but no sense of orientation. The agents require only 4 ternary digits of information. We prove that a group of agents, irrespective of initial positions, will almost surely reach a Pareto optimal configuration in finite time. For one of the control policies, computer simulations show that groups of up to 20 agents consistently reach Pareto optimal configurations, whereas groups of 1000 agents, given the same amount of time, improve the compactness of their configurations on average by 89.20%. The policy also copes well with sensory noise up to a level of 50%. We also present an experimental validation using 6 physical 3D M-Block modules, demonstrating the feasibility of the stochastic control approach in practice."}}

We consider the problem of multirobot coverage with the objective of minimizing the mission time, which depends on the number of turns taken by the robots. To solve this problem, we first partition the environment into ranks which are long thin rectangles the width of the robot's coverage tool. Our novel partitioning heuristic produces a set of ranks which minimizes the number of turns. Next, we solve a variant of the multiple travelling salesperson problem (m-TSP) on the set of ranks to minimize the robots' mission time. The resulting coverage plan is guaranteed to cover the entire environment. We present coverage plans for a robotic vacuum using real maps of 25 indoor environments and compare the solutions to paths planned without the objective of minimizing turns. Turn minimization reduced the number of turns by 6.7% and coverage time by 3.8% on average for teams of 1-5 robots."}}

To fairly balance the workload, each agent should be assigned a set of tasks which take a similar amount of time to complete. The completion time depends on the time needed to travel between tasks which depends on the order of tasks. We formulate the task assignment problem as the minimum Hamiltonian partition problem (MHPP) for m agents, which is equivalent to the minmax multiple traveling salesperson problem (m-TSP). While the MHPP's cost function depends on the order of tasks, its solutions are similar to solutions of the average Hamiltonian partition problem (AHPP) whose cost function is order-invariant. We prove that the AHPP is NP-hard and present an effective heuristic, AHP, for solving it. AHP improves a partitions of a graph using a series of transfer and swap operations which are guaranteed to improve the solution's quality. The solution generated by AHP is used as an initial partition for an algorithm, AHP-mTSP, which solves the combined task assignment and routing problems to near optimality. For n tasks and m agents, each iteration of AHP is O(n^2) and AHP-mTSP has an average run-time that scales with n^2.11 m^0.33. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our approach found approximately 10% better solutions for large problems in a similar run-time."}}

The novelty of our proposed solution is that it is applicable to extremely simple robots that lack run-time computation or storage. The solution requires only a single bit of information per robot-whether or not another robot is present in its line of sight. Computer simulations show that our deterministic controller, which was obtained through off-line optimization, achieves around 71-76% coverage in a test scenario with no robot redundancy, which corresponds to a 26-39% reduction of the area that is not covered, when compared to an optimized random walk. A moderately lower level of performance was observed in 20 experimental trials with 25 physical e-puck robots. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same controller can be used in environments of different dimensions and even to navigate a maze. The controller provides a baseline against which one can quantify the performance improvements that more advanced and expensive techniques may offer. Moreover, due to its simplicity, it could potentially be implemented on swarms of sub-millimeter-sized robots. This would pave the way for new applications in micro-medicine."}}

A particular challenge is to make them move efficiently in 3D without compromising the scalability of the system. This paper proposes decentralized and fully reactive controllers for pose control of 3D modular reconfigurable robots. The robots operate in liquid environments, and move by routing fluid through themselves. Each module uses only two bits of sensory information per face. Additionally, the modules can use up to five bits of information that are exchanged via shared power lines. We prove that robots of convex shape are guaranteed to reach a goal object with a preferred orientation. Using computer simulations of Modular Hydraulic Propulsion robots, all controllers are assessed for different environments, system sizes and noise, and their performances compared against a centralized controller. Given the simplicity of the solutions, modules could be realized at scales below a millimeter-cube, where robots of high spatial resolution could perform accurate movements in 3D liquid environments."}}

We develop a method for mobile robots to maintain a belief of each other's positions using locally available information. They can use their belief to plan paths with high probabilities of reconnection. This approach also works for subteams cooperatively searching for a robot or group of robots that they would like to reconnect with. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem which is solved using a branch-and-bound approach. We present simulation results showing the effectiveness of this strategy at reconnecting teams of up to five robots and compare the results to two other strategies."}}
