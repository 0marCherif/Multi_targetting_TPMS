Along with the attack-defense arms race, adversarial training is the most effective against adversarial examples.\nHowever, we find inequality phenomena occur during the $l_{\\infty}$-adversarial training, that few features dominate the prediction made by the adversarially trained model. We systematically evaluate such inequality phenomena by extensive experiments and find such phenomena become more obvious when performing adversarial training with increasing adversarial strength (evaluated by $\\epsilon$). We hypothesize such inequality phenomena make $l_{\\infty}$-adversarially trained model less reliable than the standard trained model when few ``important features\" are influenced. To validate our hypothesis, we proposed two simple attacks that either perturb or replace important features with noise or occlusion. Experiments show that $l_{\\infty}$-adversarially trained model can be easily attacked when the few important features are influenced. \nOur work shed light on the limitation of the practicality of $l_{\\infty}$-adversarial training."}}

However, FAT often suffers from Catastrophic Overfitting (CO), which results in poor robustness performance. CO describes the phenomenon that model robust accuracy can decrease dramatically and suddenly during the training of FAT. Many effective techniques have been developed to prevent CO and improve the model robustness from different perspectives. However, these techniques adopt inconsistent training settings and require different training costs, i.e, training time and memory costs, resulting in an unfair comparison. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive study of more than 10 FAT methods in terms of adversarial robustness and training costs. We revisit the effectiveness and efficiency of FAT techniques in preventing CO from the perspective of model local nonlinearity and propose an effective Lipschitz regularization method for FAT. Furthermore, we explore the effect of data augmentation and weight averaging in FAT and propose a simple yet effective auto weight averaging method to improve robustness further. By assembling these techniques, we propose a FGSM-based fast adversarial training method equipped with Lipschitz regularization and Auto Weight averaging, abbreviated as FGSM-LAW. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method."}}

In this work, we show by simply using a laser beam that DNNs are easily fooled. To this end, we propose a novel attack method called Adversarial Laser Beam (AdvLB), which enables manipulation of laser beam's physical parameters to perform adversarial attack. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in both digital- and physical-settings. We further empirically analyze the evaluation results and reveal that the proposed laser beam attack may lead to some interesting prediction errors of the state-of-the-art DNNs. We envisage that the proposed AdvLB method enriches the current family of adversarial attacks and builds the foundation for future robustness studies for light."}}

However, in terms of visual perception of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the ability for recognizing abstract objects (visual objects with lost information) is still a challenge. In this work, we investigate this issue from an adversarial viewpoint: will the performance of DNNs decrease even for the images only losing a little information? Towards this end, we propose a novel adversarial attack, named AdvDrop, which crafts adversarial examples by dropping existing information of images. Previously, most adversarial attacks add extra disturbing information on clean images explicitly. Opposite to previous works, our proposed work explores the adversarial robustness of DNN models in a novel perspective by dropping imperceptible de-tails to craft adversarial examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AdvDrop by extensive experiments, and show that this new type of adversarial examples is more difficult to be defended by current defense systems."}}
