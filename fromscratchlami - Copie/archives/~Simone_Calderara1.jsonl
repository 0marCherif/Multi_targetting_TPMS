In this work, we introduce a novel framework to tackle this problem with conditional computation. We equip each convolutional layer with task-specific gating modules, selecting which filters to apply on the given input. This way, we achieve two appealing properties. Firstly, the execution patterns of the gates allow to identify and protect important filters, ensuring no loss in the performance of the model for previously learned tasks. Secondly, by using a sparsity objective, we can promote the selection of a limited set of kernels, allowing to retain sufficient model capacity to digest new tasks. Existing solutions require, at test time, awareness of the task to which each example belongs to. This knowledge, however, may not be available in many practical scenarios. Therefore, we additionally introduce a task classifier that predicts the task label of each example, to deal with settings in which a task oracle is not available. We validate our proposal on four continual learning datasets. Results show that our model consistently outperforms existing methods both in the presence and the absence of a task oracle. Notably, on Split SVHN and Imagenet-50 datasets, our model yields up to 23.98% and 17.42% improvement in accuracy wrt competing methods."}}

However, one of the main problems of  DDPMs is their large computational cost, which is due to the chain of sampling steps. In this paper, we argue that one of the reasons why DDPMs need a long sampling chain is due to an exposure bias problem, similar to the analogous problem in autoregressive text generation. Specifically, we note that there is a discrepancy between training and  testing, since the former is conditioned on the ground truth samples, while the latter is conditioned on the previously generated results. In order to alleviate this problem, we propose a very simple but effective training protocol modification, consisting in perturbing the ground truth samples to simulate the inference time prediction errors.  We empirically show that the proposed input perturbation leads to a significant improvement of the sample quality and to smoother sampling chains, with a drastic acceleration of the inference time. For instance, in all the tested benchmarks, we observed an acceleration over a state-of-the-art DDPM of 12.5 times."}}

These methods collect samples from previously encountered data distributions in a small memory buffer; subsequently, they repeatedly optimize on the latter to prevent catastrophic forgetting. This work draws attention to a hidden pitfall of this widespread practice: repeated optimization on a small pool of data inevitably leads to tight and unstable decision boundaries, which are a major hindrance to generalization. To address this issue, we propose Lipschitz-DrivEn Rehearsal (LiDER), a surrogate objective that induces smoothness in the backbone network by constraining its layer-wise Lipschitz constants w.r.t. replay examples. By means of extensive experiments, we show that applying LiDER delivers a stable performance gain to several state-of-the-art rehearsal CL methods across multiple datasets, both in the presence and absence of pre-training. Through additional ablative experiments, we highlight peculiar aspects of buffer overfitting in CL and better characterize the effect produced by LiDER.

The goal is to estimate what a person would pay attention to while driving, and which part of the scene around the vehicle is more critical for the task. To this end we propose a new computer vision model based on a multi-branch deep architecture that integrates three sources of information: raw video, motion and scene semantics. We also introduce DR(eye)VE, the largest dataset of driving scenes for which eye-tracking annotations are available. This dataset features more than 500,000 registered frames, matching ego-centric views (from glasses worn by drivers) and car-centric views (from roof-mounted camera), further enriched by other sensors measurements. Results highlight that several attention patterns are shared across drivers and can be reproduced to some extent. The indication of which elements in the scene are likely to capture the driver's attention may benefit several applications in the context of human-vehicle interaction and driver attention analysis."}}

Despite its importance in different application settings, designing a novelty detector is utterly complex due to the unpredictable nature of novelties and its inaccessibility during the training procedure, factors which expose the unsupervised nature of the problem. In our proposal, we design a general unsupervised framework where we equip a deep autoencoder with a parametric density estimator that learns the probability distribution underlying the latent representations with an autoregressive procedure. We show that a maximum likelihood objective, optimized in conjunction with the reconstruction of normal samples, effectively acts as a regularizer for the task at hand, by minimizing the differential entropy of the distribution spanned by latent vectors. In addition to providing a very general formulation, extensive experiments of our model on publicly available datasets deliver on-par or superior performances if compared to state-of-the-art methods in one-class and in video anomaly detection settings. Differently from our competitors, we remark that our proposal does not make any assumption about the nature of the novelties, making our work easily applicable to disparate contexts."}}

To this end, a two-branched convolutional encoder network is employed to jointly estimate the object class and its 6-DoF pose in the scene. We then propose a new formulation of an approximated differentiable renderer to re-project the 3D object on the image according to its predicted pose; in this way the alignment error between the observed and the re-projected object silhouette can be measured. Since the renderer is differentiable, it is possible to back-propagate through it to correct the estimated pose at test time in an online learning fashion. Eventually we show how to leverage the classification branch to profitably re-project a representative model of the predicted class (i.e. a medoid) instead. Each object in the scene is processed independently and novel viewpoints in which both objects arrangement and mutual pose are preserved can be rendered.

Specifically, the task requires the capability to predict the identity of a given vehicle, given a dataset of known associations, collected from different views and surveillance cameras. Generally, it can be cast as a ranking problem: given a probe image of a vehicle, the model needs to rank all database images based on their similarities w.r.t the probe image. In line with recent research, we devise a metric learning model that employs a supervision based on local constraints. In particular, we leverage pairwise and triplet constraints for training a network capable of assigning a high degree of similarity to samples sharing the same identity, while keeping different identities distant in feature space. Eventually, we show how vehicle tracking can be exploited to automatically generate a weakly labelled dataset that can be used to train the deep network for the task of vehicle re-identification.

Moreover, temporal continuity in the detection phase gains more importance when scene cluttering introduces the challenging problems of occluded targets. For the purpose, we propose a deep network architecture that jointly extracts people body parts and associates them across short temporal spans. Our model explicitly deals with occluded body parts, by hallucinating plausible solutions of not visible joints. We propose a new end-to-end architecture composed by four branches (visible heatmaps, occluded heatmaps, part affinity fields and temporal affinity fields) fed by a time linker feature extractor. To overcome the lack of surveillance data with tracking, body part and occlusion annotations we created the vastest Computer Graphics dataset for people tracking in urban scenarios by exploiting a photorealistic videogame. It is up\u00a0to now the vastest dataset (about 500.000 frames, almost 10 million body poses) of human body parts for people tracking in urban scenarios. Our architecture trained on virtual data exhibits good generalization capabilities also on public real tracking benchmarks, when image resolution and sharpness are high enough, producing reliable tracklets useful for further batch data association or re-id modules."}}

However, the driving task is extremely complex and a deep understanding of drivers' behavior is still lacking. Several researchers are now investigating the attention mechanism in order to define computational models for detecting salient and interesting objects in the scene. Nevertheless, most of these models only refer to bottom up visual saliency and are focused on still images. Instead, during the driving experience the temporal nature and peculiarity of the task influence the attention mechanisms, leading to the conclusion that real life driving data is mandatory. In this paper we propose a novel and publicly available dataset acquired during actual driving. Our dataset, composed by more than 500,000 frames, contains drivers' gaze fixations and their temporal integration providing task-specific saliency maps. Geo-referenced locations, driving speed and course complete the set of released data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset of this kind and can foster new discussions on better understanding, exploiting and reproducing the driver's attention process in the autonomous and assisted cars of future generations."}}
