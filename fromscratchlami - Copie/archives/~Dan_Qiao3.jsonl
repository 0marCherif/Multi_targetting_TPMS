This paper develops a novel saturated Nussbaum function to relax such limitations and proposes a Nussbaum function based control scheme for the consensus problem of multi-agent systems with arbitrary non-identical unknown control directions and safe control progress. First, a novel type of the Nussbaum function with different frequencies is proposed in the form of saturated time-elongation functions, which provides a more smooth and safer transient performance of the control progress. Furthermore, the novel Nussbaum function is employed to design distributed adaptive control algorithms for linearly parameterized multi-agent systems to achieve average consensus cooperatively without dramatic control shocks. Then, under the undirected connected communication topology, all the signals of the closed-loop systems are proved to be bounded and asymptotically convergent. Finally, two comparative numerical simulation examples are carried out to verify the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed approach with smaller control shock amplitudes than traditional Nussbaum methods."}}
