To address the task, we first argue the importance of both diversity and purity of examples in the episodic memory of continual learning models. To balance diversity and purity in the episodic memory, we propose a novel strategy to manage and use the memory by a unified approach of label noise aware diverse sampling and robust learning with semi-supervised learning.

Prevalent scenario of continual learning, however, assumes disjoint sets of classes as tasks and is less realistic rather artificial. Instead, we focus on 'blurry' task boundary; where tasks shares classes and is more realistic and practical. To address such task, we argue the importance of diversity of samples in an episodic memory. To enhance the sample diversity in the memory, we propose a novel memory management strategy based on per-sample classification uncertainty and data augmentation, named Rainbow Memory (RM). With extensive empirical validations on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets, we show that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy in blurry continual learning setups, outperforming state of the arts by large margins despite its simplicity.

We argue that it is less realistic as the streamed data would have no notion of task boundary in real-world data. Here, we take a step forward to investigate more realistic online continual learning \u2013 learning continuously changing data distribution without explicit task boundary, which we call boundary-free setup. As there is no clear boundary of tasks, it is not obvious when and what information in the past to be preserved as a better remedy for the stability-plasticity dilemma. To this end, we propose a scheduled transfer of previously learned knowledge. We further propose a data-driven balancing between the knowledge in the past and the present in learning objective. Moreover, since it is not straight-forward to use the previously proposed forgetting measure without task boundaries, we further propose a novel forgetting measure based on information theory that can capture forgetting. We empirically evaluate our method on a Gaussian data stream, its periodic extension, which assumes periodic data distribution frequently observed in real-life data, as well as the conventional disjoint task-split. Our method outperforms prior arts by large margins in various setups, using four popular benchmark datasets \u2013 CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet and ImageNet."}}

Further, the learning objective of self-supervised learning, which pulls positive pairs closer and repels negative pairs, also resembles metric-based meta-learning. Metric-based meta-learning is one of the most successful meta-learning methods, which learns to minimize the distance between representations from the same class. \nOne notable aspect of metric-based meta-learning, however, is that it is widely interpreted as a set-level problem since the inference of discriminative class prototypes (or set representations) from few examples is crucial for the performance of downstream tasks. Motivated by this, we propose Set-SimCLR, a novel self-supervised set representation learning framework for targeting UML problem. Specifically, our Set-SimCLR learns a set encoder on top of instance representations to maximize the agreement between two sets of augmented samples, which are generated by applying stochastic augmentations to a given image. We theoretically analyze how our proposed set representation learning can potentially improve the generalization performance at the meta-test. We also empirically validate its effectiveness on various benchmark datasets, showing that Set-SimCLR largely outperforms both UML and instance-level self-supervised learning baselines."}}

Specifically, we argue the importance of both diversity and purity of examples in the episodic memory of continual learning models. To balance diversity and purity in the memory, we propose to combine a novel memory management strategy and robust learning. Specifically, we propose a metric to balance the trade-off between diversity and purity in the episodic memory with noisy labels. We then refurbish or apply unsupervised learning by splitting noisy examples into multiple groups using the Gaussian mixture model for addressing label noise.
