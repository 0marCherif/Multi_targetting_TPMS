At the same time, physical properties of the optical components hinder their application since they introduce a number of limitations, such as easily saturated activation functions as well as the existence of various noise sources. As a result, photonic DL models are especially challenging to be trained and deployed, compared with regular DL models, since traditionally used methods do not take into account the aforementioned constraints. To overcome these limitations and motivated by the fact that the information lost in one layer cannot be easily recovered when gradient-descent based algorithms are employed, we propose a novel training method for photonic neuromorphic architectures that is capable of taking into account a wide range of limitations of the actual hardware, including noise sources and easily saturated activation mechanisms. Compared to existing works, the proposed method takes a more holistic view of the training process, focusing both on the initialization process, as well as on the actual weight updates. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a variety of different problems and photonic neural network (PNN) architectures, including a noisy photonic recurrent neural network evaluated on high-frequency time series forecasting and a deep photonic feed-forward setup consisting of a transmitter, noisy channel, and receiver, which is used as an intensity modulation/direct detection system (IM/DD)."}}

In this paper, we propose a Variational Neural Network-based version of a Voxel Pseudo Image Tracking (VPIT) method for 3D Single Object Tracking. The Variational Feature Generation Network of the proposed Variational VPIT computes features for target and search regions and the corresponding uncertainties, which are later combined using an uncertainty-aware cross-correlation module in one of two ways: by computing similarity between the corresponding uncertainties and adding it to the regular cross-correlation values, or by penalizing the uncertain feature channels to increase influence of the certain features. In experiments, we show that both methods improve tracking performance, while penalization of uncertain features provides the best uncertainty quality."}}

This allows for improving the accuracy of the smaller network. However, directly transferring the knowledge between enormous feature maps, as they are extracted from convolutional layers, is not straightforward. In this work, we propose an efficient mutual information-based approach for transferring the knowledge between feature maps extracted from different networks. The proposed method employs an efficient Neural Bag-of-Features formulation to estimate the joint and marginal probabilities and then optimizes the whole pipeline in an end-to-end manner. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a lightweight, fully convolutional neural network architecture, which aims toward high-resolution analysis and targets photonic neural network accelerators."}}

These issues can have a significant impact on the quality of life of citizens. On-street parking systems have been designed to this end aiming at ensuring that parking spaces will be available for the local population, while also providing easy access to parking for people visiting the city center. However, these systems are often affected by illegal parking, providing incorrect information regarding the availability of parking spaces. Even though this can be mitigated using sensors for detecting the presence of cars in various parking sectors, the cost of these implementations is usually prohibiting large. In this paper, we investigate an indirect way of predicting parking violations at a fine-grained level, equipping such parking systems with a valuable tool for providing more accurate information to citizens. To this end, we employed a Deep Learning (DL)-based model to predict fine-grained parking violation rates for on-street parking systems. Moreover, we developed a data augmentation and smoothing technique for further improving the accuracy of DL models under the presence of missing and noisy data. We demonstrate, using experiments on real data collected in Thessaloniki, Greece, that the developed system can indeed provide accurate parking violation predictions."}}

Indeed, there has been a plethora of DL-based trading methods proposed in recent years. Despite the success of these methods, they typically rely on a very restricted set of information, usually employing only price-related information. As a result, they ignore sentiment-related information, which can have a profound impact and be a strong predictor of various assets, such as cryptocurencies. The contribution of this paper is multifold. First, we examine whether the use of sentiment information, as extracted by various online sources, including news articles, is beneficial when training DL agents for trading. Then, given the difficulty of training reliable sentiment extractors for financial applications, we evaluate the impact of using different DL models as sentiment extractors, as well as employ an unsupervised training pipeline for further improving their performance. Finally, we propose an effective multisource sentiment fusion approach that can improve the performance over the rest of the evaluated approaches. The conducted experiments have been performed using several different configurations and models, ranging from multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to provide a reliable evaluation of sentiment-aware DL-based trading strategies providing evidence that sentiment information might be a stronger predictor compared to the information provided by the actual price time series for Bitcoin."}}
