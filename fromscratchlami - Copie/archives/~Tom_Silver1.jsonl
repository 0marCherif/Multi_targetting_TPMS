Recent work has shown how to enable such bilevel planning by learning abstract models in the form of symbolic operators and neural samplers. In this work, we show that existing symbolic operator learning approaches fall short in many robotics domains where a robot's actions tend to cause a large number of irrelevant changes in the abstract state. This is primarily because they attempt to learn operators that exactly predict all observed changes in the abstract state. To overcome this issue, we propose to learn operators that `choose what to predict' by only modelling changes necessary for abstract planning to achieve specified goals. Experimentally, we show that our approach learns operators that lead to efficient planning across 10 different hybrid robotics domains, including 4 from the challenging BEHAVIOR-100 benchmark, while generalizing to novel initial states, goals, and objects."}}

We are interested in two questions: (1) To what extent can LLMs solve PDDL planning problems on their own? (2) How and to what extent can LLMs be used to guide AI planners? Recent work by Valmeekam et al. (2022) presents negative evidence for (1) in the classic blocks world domain. We confirm this finding, but expand the inquiry to 18 domains and find more mixed results with a few clear successes. For (2), we propose a simple mechanism for using good-but-imperfect LLM outputs to aid a heuristic-search planner. We also find that the LLM performance is due not only to syntactic pattern matching, but also to its commonsense understanding of English terms that appear in the PDDL."}}

Hierarchical approaches, such as task and motion planning (TAMP), address these challenges by decomposing decision-making into two or more levels of abstraction. In a setting where demonstrations and symbolic predicates are given, prior work has shown how to learn symbolic operators and neural samplers for TAMP with manually designed parameterized policies. Our main contribution is a method for learning parameterized polices in combination with operators and samplers. These components are packaged into modular neuro-symbolic skills and sequenced together with search-then-sample TAMP to solve new tasks. In experiments in four robotics domains, we show that our approach --- bilevel planning with neuro-symbolic skills --- can solve a wide range of tasks with varying initial states, goals, and objects, outperforming six baselines and ablations."}}

One way to alleviate this challenge is to perform bilevel planning with abstractions, where a high-level search for abstract plans is used to guide planning in the original transition space. In this paper, we develop a novel framework for learning state and action abstractions that are explicitly optimized for both effective (successful) and efficient (fast) bilevel planning. Given demonstrations of tasks in an environment, our data-efficient approach learns relational, neuro-symbolic abstractions that generalize over object identities and numbers. The symbolic components resemble the STRIPS predicates and operators found in AI planning, and the neural components refine the abstractions into actions that can be executed in the environment. Experimentally, we show across four robotic planning environments that our learned abstractions are able to quickly solve held-out tasks of longer horizons than were seen in the demonstrations, and can even outperform the efficiency of abstractions that we manually specified. We also find that as the planner configuration varies, the learned abstractions adapt accordingly, indicating that our abstraction learning method is both \"task-aware\" and \"planner-aware.\" Code: https://tinyurl.com/predicators-release"}}

In this work, we address these challenges with Neuro-Symbolic Relational Transition Models (NSRTs), a novel class of models that are data-efficient to learn, compatible with powerful robotic planning methods, and generalizable over objects. NSRTs have both symbolic and neural components, enabling a bilevel planning scheme where symbolic AI planning in an outer loop guides continuous planning with neural models in an inner loop. Experiments in four robotic planning domains show that NSRTs can be learned after only tens or hundreds of training episodes, and then used for fast planning in new tasks that require up to 60 actions and involve many more objects than were seen during training."}}

A generalized plan can be learned from a few training examples and applied to an entire domain of problems. Generalized planning approaches perform well in discrete AI planning problems that involve large numbers of objects and extended action sequences to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for learning features, abstractions, and generalized plans for continuous robotic task and motion planning (TAMP) and examine the unique difficulties that arise when forced to consider geometric and physical constraints as a part of the generalized plan. Additionally, we show that these simple generalized plans learned from only a handful of examples can be used to improve the search efficiency of TAMP solvers."}}

Inspired by human curiosity, we propose goal-literal babbling (GLIB), a simple and general method for exploration in such problems. GLIB samples relational conjunctive goals that can be understood as specific, targeted effects that the agent would like to achieve in the world, and plans to achieve these goals using the transition model being learned. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that exploration with GLIB will converge almost surely to the ground truth model. Experimentally, we find GLIB to strongly outperform existing methods in both prediction and planning on a range of tasks, encompassing standard PDDL and PPDDL planning benchmarks and a robotic manipulation task implemented in the PyBullet physics simulator.

In this work, we address this challenge by learning to predict a small set of objects that, taken together, would be sufficient for finding a plan. We propose a graph neural network architecture for predicting object importance in a single inference pass, thus incurring little overhead while greatly reducing the number of objects that must be considered by the planner. Our approach treats the planner and transition model as black boxes, and can be used with any off-the-shelf planner. Empirically, across classical planning, probabilistic planning, and robotic task and motion planning, we find that our method results in planning that is significantly faster than several baselines, including other partial grounding strategies and lifted planners. We conclude that learning to predict a sufficient set of objects for a planning problem is a simple, powerful, and general mechanism for planning in large instances.

However, the long-horizon goal-based problems found in classical planning lead to sparse rewards for RL, making direct application inefficient. In this paper, we propose to leverage domain-independent heuristic functions commonly used in the classical planning literature to improve the sample efficiency of RL. These classical heuristics act as dense reward generators to alleviate the sparse-rewards issue and enable our RL agent to learn domain-specific value functions as residuals on these heuristics, making learning easier. Correct application of this technique requires consolidating the discounted metric used in RL and the non-discounted metric used in heuristics. We implement the value functions using Neural Logic Machines, a neural network architecture designed for grounded first-order logic inputs. We demonstrate on several classical planning domains that using classical heuristics for RL allows for good sample efficiency compared to sparse-reward RL. We further show that our learned value functions generalize to novel problem instances in the same domain."}}
