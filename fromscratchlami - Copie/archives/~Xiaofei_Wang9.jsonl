In this work, we propose DiariST, the first streaming ST and SD solution. It is built upon a neural transducer-based streaming ST system and integrates token-level serialized output training and t-vector, which were originally developed for multi-talker speech recognition. Due to the absence of evaluation benchmarks in this area, we develop a new evaluation dataset, DiariST-AliMeeting, by translating the reference Chinese transcriptions of the AliMeeting corpus into English. We also propose new metrics, called speaker-agnostic BLEU and speaker-attributed BLEU, to measure the ST quality while taking SD accuracy into account. Our system achieves a strong ST and SD capability compared to offline systems based on Whisper, while performing streaming inference for overlapping speech. To facilitate the research in this new direction, we release the evaluation data, the offline baseline systems, and the evaluation code."}}

One way to reduce the effect of noise interference is to employ a preprocessing module that conducts speech enhancement, and then feed the enhanced speech to an ASR backend. In this work, instead of suppressing background noise with a conventional cascaded pipeline, we employ a noise-robust representation learned by a refined self-supervised framework for noisy speech recognition. We propose to combine a reconstruction module with contrastive learning and perform multi-task continual pre-training on noisy data. The reconstruction module is used for auxiliary learning to improve the noise robustness of the learned representation and thus is not required during inference. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our model substantially reduces the word error rate (WER) for the synthesized noisy LibriSpeech test sets, and yields around 4.1/7.5% WER reduction on noisy clean/other test sets compared to data augmentation. For the real-world noisy speech from the CHiME-4 challenge (1-channel track), we have obtained the state of the art ASR performance without any denoising front-end. Moreover, we achieve comparable performance to the best supervised approach reported with only 16% of labeled data."}}

Due to the difficulty in acquiring real conversation data with high-quality human transcriptions, a na\\\"ive simulation of multi-talker speech by randomly mixing multiple utterances was conventionally used for model training. In this work, we propose an improved technique to simulate multi-talker overlapping speech with realistic speech overlaps, where an arbitrary pattern of speech overlaps is represented by a sequence of discrete tokens. With this representation, speech overlapping patterns can be learned from real conversations based on a statistical language model, such as N-gram, which can be then used to generate multi-talker speech for training. In our experiments, multi-talker ASR models trained with the proposed method show consistent improvement on the word error rates across multiple datasets."}}

In this paper, we propose a three-stage training scheme for the CSS model that can leverage both supervised data and extra large-scale unsupervised real-world conversational data. The scheme consists of two conventional training approaches---pre-training using simulated data and ASR-loss-based training using transcribed data---and a novel continuous semi-supervised training between the two, in which the CSS model is further trained by using real data based on the teacher-student learning framework. We apply this scheme to an array-geometry-agnostic CSS model, which can use the multi-channel data collected from any microphone array. Large-scale meeting transcription experiments are carried out on both Microsoft internal meeting data and the AMI meeting corpus. The steady improvement by each training stage has been observed, showing the effect of the proposed method that enables to leverage real conversational data for CSS model training."}}

The E2E SA-ASR is a joint model that was recently proposed for speaker counting, multi-talker speech recognition, and speaker identification from monaural audio that contains overlapping speech. Although the E2E SA-ASR model originally does not estimate any time-related information, we show that the start and end times of each word can be estimated with sufficient accuracy from the internal state of the E2E SA-ASR by adding a small number of learnable parameters. Similar to the target-speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD)-based diarization method, the E2E SA-ASR model is applied to estimate speech activity of each speaker while it has the advantages of (i) handling unlimited number of speakers, (ii) leveraging linguistic information for speaker diarization, and (iii) simultaneously generating speaker-attributed transcriptions. Experimental results on the LibriCSS and AMI corpora show that the proposed method achieves significantly better diarization error rate than various existing speaker diarization methods when the number of speakers is unknown, and achieves a comparable performance to TS-VAD when the number of speakers is given in advance. The proposed method simultaneously generates speaker-attributed transcription with state-of-the-art accuracy."}}

This paper proposes VarArray, an array-geometry-agnostic speech separation neural network model. The proposed model is applicable to any number of microphones without retraining while leveraging the nonlinear correlation between the input channels. The proposed method adapts different elements that were proposed before separately, including transform-average-concatenate, conformer speech separation, and inter-channel phase differences, and combines them in an efficient and cohesive way. Large-scale evaluation was performed with two real meeting transcription tasks by using a fully developed transcription system requiring no prior knowledge such as reference segmentations, which allowed us to measure the impact that the continuous speech separation system could have in realistic settings. The proposed model outperformed a previous approach to array-geometry-agnostic modeling for all of the geometry configurations considered, achieving asclite-based speaker-agnostic word error rates of 17.5% and 20.4% for the AMI development and evaluation sets, respectively, in the end-to-end setting using no ground-truth segmentations."}}

Unlike existing streaming multi-talker ASR models using multiple output branches, the t-SOT model has only a single output branch that generates recognition tokens (e.g., words, subwords) of multiple speakers in chronological order based on their emission times. A special token that indicates the change of ``virtual'' output channels is introduced to keep track of the overlapping utterances. Compared to the prior streaming multi-talker ASR models, the t-SOT model has the advantages of less inference cost and a simpler model architecture. Moreover, in our experiments with LibriSpeechMix and LibriCSS datasets, the t-SOT-based transformer transducer model achieves the state-of-the-art word error rates by a significant margin to the prior results. For non-overlapping speech, the t-SOT model is on par with a single-talker ASR model in terms of both accuracy and computational cost, opening the door for deploying one model for both single- and multi-talker scenarios."}}

Our framework, named t-SOT-VA, capitalizes on independently developed two recent technologies; array-geometry-agnostic continuous speech separation, or VarArray, and streaming multi-talker ASR based on token-level serialized output training (t-SOT). To combine the best of both technologies, we newly design a t-SOT-based ASR model that generates a serialized multi-talker transcription based on two separated speech signals from VarArray. We also propose a pre-training scheme for such an ASR model where we simulate VarArray's output signals based on monaural single-talker ASR training data. Conversation transcription experiments using the AMI meeting corpus show that the system based on the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional ones.

Our model is based on token-level serialized output training (t-SOT) which was recently proposed to transcribe multi-talker speech in a streaming fashion. To further recognize speaker identities, we propose an encoder-decoder based speaker embedding extractor that can estimate a speaker representation for each recognized token not only from non-overlapping speech but also from overlapping speech. The proposed speaker embedding, named t-vector, is extracted synchronously with the t-SOT ASR model, enabling joint execution of speaker identification (SID) or speaker diarization (SD) with the multi-talker transcription with low latency. We evaluate the proposed model for a joint task of ASR and SID/SD by using LibriSpeechMix and LibriCSS corpora. The proposed model achieves substantially better accuracy than a prior streaming model and shows comparable or sometimes even superior results to the state-of-the-art offline SA-ASR model."}}

A common application scenario is transcribing a meeting conversation recorded by a microphone array. Prior studies explored various deep learning models for time-frequency mask estimation, followed by a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) filter to improve the automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. The performance of these methods is fundamentally upper-bounded by MVDR\u2019s spatial selectivity. Recently, the all deep learning MVDR (ADL-MVDR) model was proposed for neural beamforming and demonstrated superior performance in a target speech extraction task using pre-segmented input. In this paper, we further adapt ADL-MVDR to the CSS task with several enhancements to enable end-to-end neural beamforming. The proposed system achieves significant word error rate reduction over a baseline spectral masking system on the LibriCSS dataset. Moreover, the proposed neural beamformer is shown to be comparable to a state-of-the-art MVDR-based system in real meeting transcription tasks, including AMI, while showing potentials to further simplify the run-time implementation and reduce the system latency with frame-wise processing."}}
