In existing works, it is common to use a shared backbone to extract features for both things (countable classes such as vehicles) and stuff (uncountable classes such as roads). This, however, fails to capture the rich relations among them, which can be utilized to enhance visual understanding and segmentation performance. To address this short-coming, we propose a novel Panoptic, Instance, and Semantic Relations (PISR) module to exploit such contexts. First, we generate panoptic encodings to summarize key features of the semantic classes and predicted instances. A Panoptic Relational Attention (PRA) module is then applied to the encodings and the global feature map from the backbone. It produces a feature map that captures 1) the relations across semantic classes and instances and 2) the relations between these panoptic categories and spatial features. PISR also automatically learns to focus on the more important instances, making it robust to the number of instances used in the relational attention module. Moreover, PISR is a general module that can be applied to any existing panoptic segmentation architecture. Through extensive evaluations on panoptic segmentation benchmarks like Cityscapes, COCO, and ADE20K, we show that PISR attains considerable improvements over existing approaches."}}

Research in deep anomaly detection methods has progressed slowly. One reason may be that most papers simultaneously introduce new representation learning techniques and new anomaly scoring approaches. The goal of this work is to improve this methodology by providing ways of separately measuring the effectiveness of the representation learning and anomaly scoring. This work makes two methodological contributions. The first is to introduce the notion of Oracle anomaly detection for quantifying the information available in a learned latent representation. The second is to introduce Oracle representation learning, which produces a representation that is guaranteed to be sufficient for accurate anomaly detection. These two techniques help researchers to separate the quality of the learned representation from the performance of the anomaly scoring mechanism so that they can debug and improve their systems. The methods also provide an upper limit on how much open category detection can be improved through better anomaly scoring mechanisms. The combination of the two oracles gives an upper limit on the performance that any open category detection method could achieve. This work introduces these two oracle techniques and demonstrates their utility by applying them to several leading open category detection methods."}}

Given an overall budget on the amount of training data, we also derive the optimal allocation of samples between the mixture and the clean data sets. Experiments on synthetic and standard benchmark datasets evaluate the regimes in which the algorithm can be effective and provide a baseline for further advancements. In addition, for the situation when an upper bound for $\\alpha$ is not available, we employ nine different anomaly proportion estimators, and run experiments on both synthetic and standard benchmark data sets to compare their performance."}}
