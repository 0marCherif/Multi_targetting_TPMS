It has been shown (Li et al., 2013) that classic scale-free networks (Barab\u00e1si and Albert, 1999,\nBarab\u00e1si, 2009) are insecure against attacks of as small as O(log n) many nodes. This poses a natural and fundamental question: Can we introduce a second player Bob to prevent Alice from global cascading failure of the networks? We proposed a game in networks. We say that a network has an equilibrium game if the second player Bob has a strategy to balance the cascading influence of attacks by the adversary player Alice. It was shown that networks of the preferential attachment model (Barab\u00e1si and Albert, 1999) fail to have equilibrium games, that random graphs of the Erd\u00f6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model (Erd\u00f6s and R\u00e9nyi, 1959, Erd\u00f6s and R\u00e9nyi, 1960) have, for which randomness is the mechanism, and that homophyly networks (Li et al., 2013) have equilibrium games, for which homophyly and preferential attachment are the underlying mechanisms. We found that some real networks have equilibrium games, but most real networks fail to have. We anticipate that our results lead to an interesting new direction of network theory, that is, equilibrium games in networks."}}

The arising signed graphs typically contain a clear community structure in the sense that the graph can be partitioned into a small number of polarized communities, each defining a sparse cut and indivisible into smaller polarized sub-communities. We provide a local clustering oracle for signed graphs with such a clear community structure, that can answer membership queries, i.e., \"Given a vertex $v$, which community does $v$ belong to?\", in sublinear time by reading only a small portion of the graph. Formally, when the graph has bounded maximum degree and the number of communities is at most $O(\\log n)$, then with $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}\\operatorname{poly}(1/\\varepsilon))$ preprocessing time, our oracle can answer each membership query in $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}\\operatorname{poly}(1/\\varepsilon))$ time, and it correctly classifies a $(1-\\varepsilon)$-fraction of vertices w.r.t. a set of hidden planted ground-truth communities. Our oracle is desirable in applications where the clustering information is needed for only a small number of vertices. Previously, such local clustering oracles were only known for unsigned graphs; our generalization to signed graphs requires a number of new ideas and gives a novel spectral analysis of the behavior of random walks with signs. We evaluate our algorithm for constructing such an oracle and answering membership queries on both synthetic and real-world datasets, validating its performance in practice."}}

It has received great attention in the last decade and the balanced case, i.e., assuming all clusters have large size, has been well studied. However, our understanding of SBM with unbalanced communities (arguably, more relevant in practice) is still very limited. In this paper, we provide a simple SVD-based algorithm for recovering the communities in the SBM with communities of varying sizes. We improve upon a result of Ailon, Chen and Xu [ICML 2013] by removing the assumption that there is a large interval such that the sizes of clusters do not fall in. Under the planted clique conjecture, the size of the clusters that can be recovered by our algorithm is nearly optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors) when the probability parameters are constant. As a byproduct, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm with sublinear query complexity for a clustering problem with a faulty oracle, which finds all clusters of size larger than $\\tilde{\\Omega}({\\sqrt{n}})$ even if $\\Omega(n)$ small clusters co-exist in the graph.

In their seminal work, Goldreich and Ron [STOC 2009; SICOMP 2011] show that the graph properties that allow constant-query proximity-oblivious testing in the bounded-degree model are precisely the properties that can be expressed as a generalised subgraph freeness (GSF) property that satisfies the non-propagation condition. It is left open whether the non-propagation condition is necessary. Indeed, calling properties expressible as a generalised subgraph freeness property GSF-local properties, they ask whether all GSF-local properties are non-propagating. We give a negative answer by exhibiting a property of graphs that is GSF-local and propagating. Hence in particular, our property does not admit a POT, despite being GSF-local. We prove our result by exploiting a recent work of the authors which constructed a first-order (FO) property that is not testable [SODA 2021], and a new connection between FO properties and GSF-local properties via neighbourhood profiles."}}
