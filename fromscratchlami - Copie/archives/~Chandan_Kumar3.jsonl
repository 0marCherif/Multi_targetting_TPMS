A very thick layer of Al2O3 (250 nm) is deposited using e-beam evaporation (10-6 mbar). MoO2 is deposited using the thermal evaporation over the ZnO thin film and the achieved thickness is of 25nm. Top and bottom Al contacts were deposited using thermal evaporation and of 50nm and 80nm respectively. Device is characterized in the form of back gate ZnO Thin film transistor (TFT), illuminated from the front side. The UV detection property of the device is performed under the illumination of UV lamp (Puv = 650\u03bcW) with wavelength of 365nm. The results obtained with the Vds versus Ids plot shows the significant improvement in the drain current with UV exposure."}}

If Signal strength at the receiving antenna is very weak then there must be required a device that increase the strength of the received signal (power), known as Amplifier. Output of an amplifier is always stronger than its input. So amplifiers are the simplest yet one of the most important parts of electronic circuits. This is why the designing of amplifiers is crucial in analog circuit designing. This paper investigated to minimize the area of a two stage amplifier using modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) method considering other constraints. The total transistor area obtain using MPSO in this paper is 2.61\u00d710 <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-10</sup>  m <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>  and it is the best of my knowledge, also the power dissipation is much lesser, 1492 \u03bcW.
