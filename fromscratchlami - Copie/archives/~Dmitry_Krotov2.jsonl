HNs are conventionally described by a neural network with two layers connected by a matrix of synaptic weights. However, it is not well known that the Hopfield framework generalizes to systems in which many neuron layers and synapses work together as a unified Hierarchical Associative Memory (HAM) model: a single network described by memory retrieval dynamics (convergence to a fixed point) and governed by a global energy function. In this work we introduce a universal abstraction for HAMs using the building blocks of neuron layers (nodes) and synapses (edges) connected within a hypergraph. We implement this abstraction as a software framework, written in JAX, whose autograd feature removes the need to derive update rules for the complicated energy-based dynamics. Our framework, called HAMUX (HAM User eXperience), enables anyone to build and train hierarchical HNs using familiar operations like convolutions and attention alongside activation functions like Softmaxes, ReLUs, and LayerNorms. HAMUX is a powerful tool to study HNs at scale, something that has never been possible before. We believe that HAMUX lays the groundwork for a new type of AI framework built around dynamical systems and energy-based associative memories."}}

Building on work using Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM) to connect a core neural circuit with the powerful Transformer model, we create a modified Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) that is a strong continual learner. We find that every component of our MLP variant translated from biology is necessary for continual learning. Our solution is also free from any memory replay or task information, and introduces novel methods to train sparse networks that may be broadly applicable."}}

At the same time, the architectural development in the transformer world is mostly driven by empirical findings, and  the theoretical understanding of their architectural building blocks is rather limited. In contrast, Dense Associative Memory models or Modern Hopfield Networks have a well-established theoretical foundation, but have not yet demonstrated truly impressive practical results. We propose a transformer architecture that replaces the sequence of feedforward transformer blocks with a single large Associative Memory model. Our novel architecture, called Energy Transformer (or ET for short), has many of the familiar architectural primitives that are often used in the current generation of transformers. However, it is not identical to the existing architectures. The sequence of transformer layers in ET is purposely designed to minimize a specifically engineered energy function, which is responsible for representing the relationships between the tokens. As a consequence of this computational principle, the attention in ET is different from the conventional attention mechanism.  In this work, we introduce the theoretical foundations of ET, explore it's empirical capabilities using the image completion task, and obtain strong quantitative results on the graph anomaly detection task."}}

At its core it consists of a population of Kenyon cells, which receive inputs from multiple sensory modalities. These cells are inhibited by the anterior paired lateral neuron, thus creating a sparse high dimensional representation of the inputs. In this work we study a mathematical formalization of this network motif and apply it to learning the correlational structure between words and their context in a corpus of unstructured text, a common natural language processing (NLP) task. We show that this network can learn semantic representations of words and can generate both static and context-dependent word embeddings. Unlike conventional methods (e.g., BERT, GloVe) that use dense representations for word embedding, our algorithm encodes semantic meaning of words and their context in the form of sparse binary hash codes. The quality of the learned representations is evaluated on word similarity analysis, word-sense disambiguation, and document classification. It is shown that not only can the fruit fly network motif achieve performance comparable to existing methods in NLP, but, additionally, it uses only a fraction of the computational resources (shorter training time and smaller memory footprint).

We propose a simple duality between this dense associative memory and neural networks commonly used in deep learning. On the associative memory side of this duality, a family of models that smoothly interpolates between two limiting cases can be constructed. One limit is referred to as the feature-matching mode of pattern recognition, and the other one as the prototype regime. On the deep learning side of the duality, this family corresponds to feedforward neural networks with one hidden layer and various activation functions, which transmit the activities of the visible neurons to the hidden layer. This family of activation functions includes logistics, rectified linear units, and rectified polynomials of higher degrees. The proposed duality makes it possible to apply energy-based intuition from associative memory to analyze computational properties of neural networks with unusual activation functions - the higher rectified polynomials which until now have not been used in deep learning. The utility of the dense memories is illustrated for two test cases: the logical gate XOR and the recognition of handwritten digits from the MNIST data set. "}}

They can do pattern completion, store a large number of memories, and can be described using a recurrent neural network with a degree of biological plausibility and rich feedback between the neurons. At the same time, up until now all the models of this class have had only one hidden layer, and have only been formulated with densely connected network architectures, two aspects that hinder their machine learning applications. This paper tackles this gap and describes a fully recurrent model of associative memory with an arbitrary large number of layers, some of which can be locally connected (convolutional), and a corresponding energy function that decreases on the dynamical trajectory of the neurons' activations. The memories of the full network are dynamically \"assembled\" using primitives encoded in the synaptic weights of the lower layers, with the \"assembling rules\" encoded in the synaptic weights of the higher layers. In addition to the bottom-up propagation of information, typical of commonly used feedforward neural networks, the model described has rich top-down feedback from higher layers that help the lower-layer neurons to decide on their response to the input stimuli."}}
