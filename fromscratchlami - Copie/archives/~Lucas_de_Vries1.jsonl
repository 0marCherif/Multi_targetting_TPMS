For this purpose, we present a novel approach to perform infarct core segmentation using CT perfusion (CTP) source data, without ordinary deconvolution analysis. We propose the use of transformers to encode sequential CTP scans in spatial attention maps, which we subsequently use for infarct core segmentation. We report new top results on the ISLES 2018 challenge test data set for infarct core segmentation. This work presents a primary benchmark for infarct core segmentation from CTP source data using transformers."}}
