Convolutional neural network (CNN)architectures with downstream and upstream propagation flow are popular for segmentation in medical diagnosis. However, due to performing spatial downsampling and upsampling in multiple stages, information loss is inexorable. On the contrary, connecting layers densely on high spatial resolution is computationally expensive. In this work, we devise a Loose Dense Connection Strategy to connect neurons in subsequent layers with reduced parameters. On top of that, using a m-way Tree structure for feature propagation we propose Receptive Field Chain Network (RFC-Net) that learns high resolution global features on a compressed computational space. Our experiments demonstrates that RFC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on Kvasir and CVC-ClinicDB benchmarks for Polyp segmentation."}}

If the third party is not fully trusted, it is desirable to obfuscate the nature of the inputs and outputs, so that the third party can not easily determine what specific task is being performed. Provably secure protocols for leveraging an untrusted party exist but are too computational demanding to run in practice. We instead explore a different strategy of fast, heuristic security that we call Connectionist Symbolic Pseudo Secrets. By leveraging Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR), we create a neural network with a pseudo-encryption style defense that empirically shows robustness to attack, even under threat models that unrealistically favor the adversary."}}

We believe that it is important to leverage both the hierarchical structure of complex tasks and to use expert supervision whenever possible to solve such tasks. This work introduces an interpretable hierarchical agent framework by combining planning and semantic goal directed reinforcement learning. We assume access to certain spatial and haptic predicates and construct a simple and powerful semantic goal space. These semantic goal representations are more interpretable, making expert supervision and intervention easier. They also eliminate the need to write complex, dense reward functions thereby reducing human engineering effort. We evaluate our framework on a robotic block manipulation task and show that it performs better than other methods, including both sparse and dense reward functions. We also suggest some next steps and discuss how this framework makes interaction and collaboration with humans easier."}}

Recurrent neural nets have been successful in processing sequences for a number of tasks; however, they are known to be both ineffective and computationally expensive when applied to very long sequences. Compression-based methods have demonstrated more robustness when processing such sequences -- in particular, an approach pairing the Lempel-Ziv Jaccard Distance (LZJD) with the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm has shown promise on long sequence problems (up to $T=200,000,000$ steps) involving malware classification. Unfortunately, use of LZJD is limited to discrete domains. To extend the benefits of LZJD to a continuous domain, we investigate the effectiveness of a deep-learning analog of the algorithm, the Lempel-Ziv Network. While we achieve successful proof of concept, we are unable to improve meaningfully on the performance of a standard LSTM across a variety of datasets and sequence processing tasks. In addition to presenting this negative result, our work highlights the problem of sub-par baseline tuning in newer research areas."}}

Despite its achievements, deploying Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based RL is expensive in terms of time and power due to the large number of episodes required to train agents with high dimensional image representations. Additionally, at the interference the large energy footprint of deep neural networks can be a major drawback. Embedded edge devices as the main platform for deploying RL applications are intrinsically resource-constrained and deploying deep neural network-based RL on them is a challenging task. As a result, reducing the number of actions taken by the RL agent to learn desired policy, along with the energy-efficient deployment of RL, is crucial. In this article, we propose Energy Efficient Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (E2HRL), which is a scalable hardware architecture for RL applications. E2HRL utilizes a cross-layer design methodology for achieving better energy efficiency, smaller model size, higher accuracy, and system integration at the software and hardware layers. Our proposed model for RL agent is designed based on the learning hierarchical policies, which makes the network architecture more efficient for implementation on mobile devices. We evaluated our model in three different RL environments with different level of complexity. Simulation results with our analysis illustrate that hierarchical policy learning with several levels of control improves RL agents training efficiency and the agent learns the desired policy faster compared to a non-hierarchical model. This improvement is specifically more observable as the environment or the task becomes more complex with multiple objective subgoals. We tested our model with different hyperparameters to achieve the maximum reward by the RL agent while minimizing the model size, parameters, and required number of operations. E2HRL model enables efficient deployment of RL agent on resource-constraint-embedded devices with the proposed custom hardware architecture that is scalable and fully parameterized with respect to the number of input channels, filter size, and depth. The number of processing engines (PE) in the proposed hardware can vary between 1 to 8, which provides the flexibility of tradeoff of different factors such as latency, throughput, power, and energy efficiency. By performing a systematic hardware parameter analysis and design space exploration, we implemented the most energy-efficient hardware architectures of E2HRL on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA and NVIDIA Jetson TX2. Comparing the implementation results shows Jetson TX2 boards achieve 0.1 \u223c 1.3 GOP/S/W energy efficiency while Artix-7 FPGA achieves 1.1 \u223c 11.4 GOP/S/W, which denotes 8.8\u00d7 \u223c 11\u00d7 better energy efficiency of E2HRL when model is implemented on FPGA. Additionally, compared to similar works our design shows better performance and energy efficiency."}}

In this paper, we introduce a novel method for backdoor detection that extracts features from pre-trained DNN's weights using independent vector analysis (IVA) followed by a machine learning classifier. In comparison to other detection techniques, this has a number of benefits, such as not requiring any training data, being applicable across domains, operating with a wide range of network architectures, not assuming the nature of the triggers used to change network behavior, and being highly scalable. We discuss the detection pipeline, and then demonstrate the results on two computer vision datasets regarding image classification and object detection. Our method outperforms the competing algorithms in terms of efficiency and is more accurate, helping to ensure the safe application of deep learning and AI."}}
