To solve these issues, we start by proposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief distribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the diversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to iteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively reducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we update our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling. Importantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved confounders may exist).

We develop the foundations and machinery for valid inferences over C-DAGs about the clusters of variables at each layer of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy - L1 (probabilistic), L2 (interventional), and L3 (counterfactual). In particular, we prove the soundness and completeness of d-separation for probabilistic inference in C-DAGs.

A prompt and efficient assessment of ECG exams in environments such as Emergency Rooms (ERs) can significantly enhance the chances of survival for high-risk patients. Despite the presence of numerous works on ECG classification, most of these studies have concentrated on one-dimensional ECG signals, which are commonly found in publicly available ECG datasets. Nevertheless, the practical relevance of such methods is limited in hospital settings, where ECG exams are usually stored as images. In this study, we have developed an artificial intelligence-driven screening system specifically designed to analyze 12-lead ECG images. Our proposed method has been trained on an extensive dataset comprising 99,746 12-lead ECG exams collected from the ambulatory section of a tertiary hospital. The primary goal was to precisely classify the exams into three classes: Normal (N), Atrial Fibrillation (AFib), and Other (O). The evaluation of our approach yielded AUROC scores of 93.2%, 99.2%, and 93.1% for N, AFib, and O, respectively. To further validate our approach, we conducted evaluations using the 2018 China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) database. In this evaluation, we achieved AUROC scores of 91.8%, 97.5%, and 70.4% for the classes N, AFib, and O, respectively. Additionally, we assessed our method using 1,074 exams acquired in the ER and obtained AUROC values of 98.3%, 98.0%, and 97.7% for the classes N, AFib, and O, respectively. Furthermore, we developed and deployed a system with a trained model within the ER of a tertiary hospital for research purposes. This system automatically retrieves newly captured ECG chart images from the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) within the ER. These images undergo necessary preprocessing steps and serve as input for our proposed classification method. This comprehensive approach established an efficient and versatile end-to-end framework for ECG classification. The results of our study highlight the potential of leveraging artificial intelligence in the screening of ECG exams, offering a promising solution for the rapid assessment and prioritization of patients in the ER."}}

Besides, with the advances in sensor technology, dynamic time-evolving data have become more common. In this context, one point of interest is a better understanding of the information flow within and between networks. Thus, we aim to infer Granger causality (G-causality) between networks\u2019 time series. In this case, the straightforward application of the well-established vector autoregressive model is not feasible. Consequently, we require a theoretical framework for modeling time-varying graphs. One possibility would be to consider a mathematical graph model with time-varying parameters (assumed to be random variables) that generates the network. Suppose we identify G-causality between the graph models\u2019 parameters. In that case, we could use it to define a G-causality between graphs. Here, we show that even if the model is unknown, the spectral radius is a reasonable estimate of some random graph model parameters. We illustrate our proposal\u2019s application to study the relationship between brain hemispheres of controls and children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We show that the G-causality intensity from the brain\u2019s right to the left hemisphere is different between ASD and controls."}}
