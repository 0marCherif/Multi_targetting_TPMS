To well distinguish the actions, especially those with complicated spatio-temporal interactions, correctly locating the prominent motion areas is of crucial importance. However, most motion information in existing videos are difficult to label and training a model with good motion representations with supervision will thus require a large amount of human labour for annotation. In this paper, we address this problem by self-supervised learning. Specifically, we propose to learn Motion from Static Images (MoSI). The model learns to encode motion information by classifying pseudo motions generated by MoSI. We furthermore introduce a static mask in pseudo motions to create local motion patterns, which forces the model to additionally locate notable motion areas for the correct classification. We demonstrate that MoSI can discover regions with large motion even without fine-tuning on the downstream datasets. As a result, the learned motion representations boost the performance of tasks requiring understanding of complex scenes and motions, ie, action recognition. Extensive experiments show the consistent and transferable improvements achieved by MoSI. Codes will be soon released."}}

In this work, we focus on the application scenarios where unlabeled data are continuously fed into the category discovery system. We refer to it as the {\\bf Continuous Category Discovery} ({\\bf CCD}) problem, which is significantly more challenging than the static setting. A common challenge faced by novel category discovery is that different sets of features are needed for classification and category discovery: class discriminative features are preferred for classification, while rich and diverse features are more suitable for new category mining. This challenge becomes more severe for dynamic setting as the system is asked to deliver good performance for known classes over time, and at the same time continuously discover new classes from unlabeled data. To address this challenge, we develop a framework of {\\bf Grow and Merge} ({\\bf GM}) that works by alternating between a growing phase and a merge phase: in the growing phase, it increases the diversity of features through a continuous self-supervised learning for effective category mining, and in the merging phase, it merges the grown model with a static one to ensure satisfying performance for known classes. Our extensive studies verify that the proposed GM framework is significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art approaches for continuous category discovery."}}

To address this gap, we propose $\\textit{Relational Language-Image Pre-training}$ (RLIP), a strategy for contrastive pre-training that leverages both entity and relation descriptions. To make effective use of such pre-training, we make three technical contributions: (1) a new $\\textbf{Par}$allel entity detection and $\\textbf{Se}$quential relation inference (ParSe) architecture that enables the use of both entity and relation descriptions during holistically optimized pre-training; (2) a synthetic data generation framework, Label Sequence Extension, that expands the scale of language data available within each minibatch; (3) ambiguity-suppression mechanisms, Relation Quality Labels and Relation Pseudo-Labels, to mitigate the influence of ambiguous/noisy samples in the pre-training data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of these contributions, collectively termed RLIP-ParSe, for improved zero-shot, few-shot and fine-tuning HOI detection performance as well as increased robustness to learning from noisy annotations.
