The network is trained using a measure of consistency of extracted data with existing databases as a form of noisy supervision. Our architecture combines the ability of constraint-based information extraction systems to easily incorporate domain knowledge and constraints with the ability of deep neural networks to leverage large amounts of data to learn complex features. Boosting the existing parser's precision, the system led to large improvements over a mature and highly tuned constraint-based production information extraction system used at Bloomberg for financial language text."}}

We describe a two-step framework that achieves these two goals in a robust, fast, online, and unsupervised manner. First, we adapt stable principal component pursuit to detect anomalies for each road segment. This allows us to pinpoint traffic anomalies early and precisely in space. Then we group the road-level anomalies across time and space into meaningful anomaly events using a simple graph expansion procedure. These events can be easily clustered, visualized, and analyzed by urban planners. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system using 7 weeks of anonymized and aggregated cellular location data in Dallas-Fort Worth. We suggest potential opportunities for urban planners and policy makers to use our methodology to make informed changes. These applications include real-time re-routing of traffic in response to abnormally high traffic, or identifying candidates for high-impact infrastructure projects."}}

Prototypes for this bifurcation depend upon several parameters, and the dynamics displayed by these systems is intricate. The core of this paper is a numerical investigation of the bifurcations in one prototypical family. It presents extensive diagrams of bifurcations of equilibrium points and periodic orbits that are close to singular Hopf bifurcation. In addition, parameters are determined where there is a tangency between invariant manifolds that are important in the appearance of mixed-mode oscillations in systems near singular Hopf bifurcation. One parameter of the prototype is identified as the primary bifurcation parameter, and the paper presents a catalogue of bifurcation sequences that occur as the primary bifurcation parameter is varied. These results are applied to estimating the parameters for the onset of mixed-mode oscillations in a model of chemical oscillations."}}

Locally invariant slow manifolds along which motion occurs on the slow time scale are a prominent feature of slow-fast systems. This paper introduces a rigorous numerical method to compute enclosures of the slow manifold of a slow-fast system with one fast and two slow variables. A triangulated first order approximation to the two dimensional invariant manifold is computed \u201calgebraically.\u201d Two translations of the computed manifold in the fast direction that are transverse to the vector field are computed as the boundaries of an initial enclosure. The enclosures are refined to bring them closer to each other by moving vertices of the enclosure boundaries one at a time. As an application we use the method to prove the existence of tangencies of invariant manifolds in the problem of singular Hopf bifurcation and to give bounds on the location of one such tangency."}}
