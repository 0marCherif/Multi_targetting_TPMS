Due to the intrinsic mathematical difficulty of symbolic integration, neural temporal point process models either constrain the intensity function to an integrable functional form or apply certain numerical methods. However, the former type of model has limited expressive power, and the latter type of model suffers additional numerical errors and high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce automatic integration with neural point process models, a new paradigm for efficient, closed-form nonparametric inference of temporal point process characterized by any intensity function. We test the model against a variety of synthetic temporal point process datasets and show that the model can better capture inter-event intensity changes than state-of-the-art methods. We also identify certain model settings that would lead the MLE estimator for the temporal point process to be inconsistent."}}

Existing neural point process models are only temporal and are limited in spatial inference. We propose a family of deep sequence models that integrate spatiotemporal point processes with deep neural networks. Our novel Neural Spatiotemporal Point Process model is flexible, efficient,  and can accurately predict irregularly sampled events.  The key construction of our approach is based on space-time separation of temporal intensity function and time-conditioned spatial density function, which is approximated by kernel density estimation. We validate our model on the synthetic spatiotemporal Hawkes process and self-correcting process. On many benchmark spatiotemporal event forecasting datasets, our model demonstrates superior performances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first neural point process model that can jointly predict the continuous space and time of events. "}}
