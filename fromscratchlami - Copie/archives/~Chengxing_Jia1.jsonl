Prior works mainly concentrate on the policy change cross episodes, ignoring the fact that teammates may suffer from sudden policy change within an episode, which might lead to miscoordination and poor performance. We formulate the problem as an open Dec-POMDP, where we control some agents to coordinate with uncontrolled teammates, whose policies could be changed within one episode. Then we develop a new framework Fast teammates adaptation (Fastap) to address the problem. Concretely, we first train versatile teammates' policies and assign them to different clusters via the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP). Then, we train the controlled agent(s) to coordinate with the sampled uncontrolled teammates by capturing their identifications as context for fast adaptation. Finally, each agent applies its local information to anticipate the teammates' context for decision-making accordingly. This process proceeds alternately, leading to a robust policy that can adapt to any teammates during the decentralized execution phase. We show in multiple multi-agent benchmarks that Fastap can achieve superior performance than multiple baselines in stationary and non-stationary scenarios. "}}

An active research topic on this problem is ad hoc teamwork, which improves agents' coordination ability in zero-shot settings. However, previous works can only solve the problem of a single agent's coordination with different teams, which is not in line with arbitrary group-to-group coordination in complex multi-agent scenarios. Moreover, they commonly suffer from limited adaptation ability within an episode in a zero-shot setting. To address these problems, we introduce the Coordination Scheme Probing (CSP) approach that applies a disentangled scheme probing module to represent and classify the newly arrived teammates beforehand with limited pre-collected episodic data and makes multi-agent control accordingly. To achieve generalization, CSP learns a meta-policy with multiple sub-policies that follow distinguished coordination schemes in an end-to-end fashion and automatically reuses it to coordinate with unseen teammates. Empirically, we show that the proposed method achieves remarkable performance compared to existing ad hoc teamwork and policy generalization methods in various multi-agent cooperative scenarios."}}

Previous multi-task MARL approaches require costly interactions to simultaneously learn or fine-tune policies in different tasks. However, the situation that an agent should generalize to multiple tasks with only offline data from limited tasks is more in line with the needs of real-world applications. Since offline multi-task data contains a variety of behaviors, an effective data-driven approach is to extract informative latent variables that can represent universal skills for realizing coordination across tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Offline MARL algorithm to Discover coordInation Skills (ODIS) from multi-task data. ODIS first extracts task-invariant coordination skills from offline multi-task data and learns to delineate different agent behaviors with the discovered coordination skills. Then we train a coordination policy to choose optimal coordination skills with the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. We further demonstrate that the discovered coordination skills can assign effective coordinative behaviors, thus significantly enhancing generalization to unseen tasks. Empirical results in cooperative MARL benchmarks, including the StarCraft multi-agent challenge, show that ODIS obtains superior performance in a wide range of tasks only with offline data from limited sources."}}
