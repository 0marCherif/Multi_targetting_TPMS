Although recent studies have made progress in the theoretical understanding of contrastive learning, the investigation of how to characterize the clusters of the learned representations is still limited. In this paper, we aim to elucidate the characterization from theoretical perspectives. To this end, we consider a kernel-based contrastive learning framework termed Kernel Contrastive Learning (KCL), where kernel functions play an important role when applying our theoretical results to other frameworks. We introduce a formulation of the similarity structure of learned representations by utilizing a statistical dependency viewpoint. We investigate the theoretical properties of the kernel-based contrastive loss via this formulation. We first prove that the formulation characterizes the structure of representations learned with the kernel-based contrastive learning framework. We show a new upper bound of the classification error of a downstream task, which explains that our theory is consistent with the empirical success of contrastive learning. We also establish a generalization error bound of KCL. Finally, we show a guarantee for the generalization ability of KCL to the downstream classification task via a surrogate bound."}}

In this paper, we demonstrate the use of the conformal prediction framework to construct reliable and trustworthy predictors for detecting railway signals. Our approach is based on a novel dataset that includes images taken from the perspective of a train operator and state-of-the-art object detectors. We test several conformal approaches and introduce a new method based on conformal risk control. Our findings demonstrate the potential of the conformal prediction framework to evaluate model performance and provide practical guidance for achieving formally guaranteed uncertainty bounds."}}

Ideally, a ML model should work well independently of these shifts, for example, by learning a domain-invariant representation. However, common ML losses do not give strong guarantees on how consistently the ML model performs for different domains, in particular, whether the model performs well on a domain at the expense of its performance on another domain. In this paper, we build new theoretical foundations for this problem, by contributing a set of mathematical relations between classical losses for supervised ML and the Wasserstein distance in joint space (i.e. representation and output space). We show that classification or regression losses, when combined with a GAN-type discriminator between domains, form an upper-bound to the true Wasserstein distance between domains. This implies a more invariant representation and also more stable prediction performance across domains. Theoretical results are corroborated empirically on several image datasets. Our proposed approach systematically produces the highest minimum classification accuracy across domains, and the most invariant representation."}}

Given an unlabeled dataset and the number of clusters, our method directly groups the dataset into the given number of clusters in the original space. We use a conditional discrete probability distribution defined by a deep neural network as a statistical model. Our strategy is first to estimate the cluster labels of unlabeled data points selected from a high-density region, and then to conduct semi-supervised learning to train the model by using the estimated cluster labels and the remaining unlabeled data points. Lastly, by using the trained model, we obtain the estimated cluster labels of all given unlabeled data points. The advantage of our method is that it does not require key conditions. Existing clustering methods with deep neural networks assume that the cluster balance of a given dataset is uniform. Moreover, it also can be applied to various data domains as long as the data is expressed by a feature vector. In addition, it is observed that our method is robust against outliers. Therefore, the proposed method is expected to perform, on average, better than previous methods. We conducted numerical experiments on five commonly used datasets to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}
