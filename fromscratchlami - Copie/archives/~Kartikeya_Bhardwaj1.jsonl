Training-free model-agnostic defenses have recently gained popularity due to their speed, ease of deployment, and ability to work across many DNNs. To this end, a new technique has emerged for mitigating attacks on image classification DNNs, namely, preprocessing adversarial images using super resolution - upscaling low-quality inputs into high-resolution images. This defense requires running both image classifiers and super resolution models on constrained autonomous systems. However, super resolution incurs a heavy computational cost. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the following question: Does the robustness of image classifiers suffer if we use tiny super resolution models? To answer this, we first review a recent work called Super-Efficient Super Resolution (SESR) [1] that achieves similar or better image quality than prior art while requiring 2 \u00d7 to 330 \u00d7 fewer Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. We demonstrate that despite being orders of magnitude smaller than existing models, SESR achieves the same level of robustness as significantly larger networks. Finally, we estimate end-to-end performance of super resolution-based defenses on a commercial Arm Ethos-U55 micro-NPU. Our findings show that SESR achieves nearly 3 \u00d7 higher FPS than a baseline while achieving similar robustness."}}

To address this question, we propose a new paradigm called Restructurable Activation Networks (RANs) that manipulate the amount of non-linearity in models to improve their hardware-awareness and efficiency. First, we propose RAN-explicit (RAN-e) -- a new hardware-aware search space and a semi-automatic search algorithm -- to replace inefficient blocks with hardware-aware blocks. Next, we propose a training-free model scaling method called RAN-implicit (RAN-i) where we theoretically prove the link between network topology and its expressivity in terms of number of non-linear units. We demonstrate that our networks achieve state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at different scales and for several types of hardware. For example, compared to EfficientNet-Lite-B0, RAN-e achieves a similar accuracy while improving Frames-Per-Second (FPS) by 1.5x on Arm micro-NPUs. On the other hand, RAN-i demonstrates up to 2x reduction in #MACs over ConvNexts with a similar or better accuracy. We also show that RAN-i achieves nearly 40% higher FPS than ConvNext on Arm-based datacenter CPUs. Finally, RAN-i based object detection networks achieve a similar or higher mAP and up to 33% higher FPS on datacenter CPUs compared to ConvNext based models. The code to train and evaluate RANs and the pretrained networks are available at https://github.com/ARM-software/ML-restructurable-activation-networks."}}

However, most super resolution deep networks are computationally very expensive. In this paper, we propose Super-Efficient Super Resolution (SESR) networks that establish a new state-of-the-art for efficient super resolution. Our approach is based on linear overparameterization of CNNs and creates an efficient model architecture for SISR. With theoretical analysis, we uncover the limitations of existing overparameterization methods and show how the proposed method alleviates them. Detailed experiments across six benchmark datasets demonstrate that SESR achieves similar or better image quality than state-of-the-art models while requiring 2x to 330x fewer Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. As a result, SESR can be used on constrained hardware to perform x2 (1080p to 4K) and x4 (1080p to 8K) SISR. Towards this, we estimate hardware performance numbers for a commercial Arm mobile-Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for 1080p to 4K (x2) and 1080p to 8K (x4) SISR. Our results highlight the challenges faced by super resolution on AI accelerators and demonstrate that SESR is significantly faster (e.g., 6x-8x higher FPS) than existing models on mobile-NPU. Finally, SESR outperforms prior models by 1.5x-2x in latency on Arm CPU and GPU when deployed on a real mobile device. The code for this work is available at https://github.com/ARM-software/sesr."}}
