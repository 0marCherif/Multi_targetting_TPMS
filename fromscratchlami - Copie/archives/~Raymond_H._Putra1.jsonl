In some of those tasks, it is insufficient for the individual agents to take relevant actions, but those actions should also have diversity. We propose the approach of using the determinant of a positive semidefinite matrix to approximate the action-value function in reinforcement learning, where we learn the matrix in a way that it represents the relevance and diversity of the actions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach allows the agents to learn a nearly optimal policy approximately ten times faster than baseline approaches in benchmark tasks of multi-agent reinforcement learning. The proposed approach is also shown to achieve the performance that cannot be achieved with conventional approaches in partially observable environment with exponentially large action space."}}

Recently, there has been a significant progress in developing efficient algorithms for learning the kernel matrix that characterizes a DPP. Here, we propose a dynamic DPP, which is a DPP whose kernel can change over time, and develop efficient learning algorithms for the dynamic DPP. In the dynamic DPP, the kernel depends on the subsets selected in the past, but we assume a particular structure in the dependency to allow efficient learning. We also assume that the kernel has a low rank and exploit a recently proposed learning algorithm for the DPP with low-rank factorization, but also show that its bottleneck computation can be reduced from O ( M 2 K ) time to O ( M K 2 ) time, where M is the number of items under consideration, and K is the rank of the kernel, which can be set smaller than M by orders of magnitude."}}

The algorithms based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are known to achieve high accuracy for noisy and sparse data but suffer from high computational cost. We find that the bottleneck of the HMM-based map-matching is in the shortest path search for calculating transition probabilities. We propose a technique to truncate the shortest path search before finding all the shortest paths in the HMM-based map-matching without losing accuracy. We run the one-to-many shortest path search on the reversed network and terminate the search based on the log likelihood of the Viterbi algorithm. Computational experiments show that the proposed approaches can reduce the computational cost by a factor of at least 5.4."}}

A state-of-the-art approach for this problem is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We propose a particular transition probability between latent road segments by the use of the number of turns in addition to the travel distance between the latent road segments. We use inverse reinforcement learning to estimate the importance of the number of turns relative to the travel distance. This estimated importance is incorporated in the transition probability of the HMM. We show, through numerical experiments, that the error of map-matching can be reduced substantially with the proposed transition probability."}}

In microblogging services, many short messages are posted every day and some of them represent replies or forwarded messages between users. We extract such conversational messages to link the users as a user network and regard the strongly-connected components in the network as indicators of user communities. However, using all of the microblog data for user community extraction is too costly and requires too much storage space when decomposing strongly-connected components. In contrast, using sampled data may miss some user connections and thus divide one user community into pieces. In this paper, we propose a method for user community reconstruction using the lexical similarity of the messages and the user's link information between separate communities."}}
