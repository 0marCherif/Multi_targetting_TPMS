Using low-quality and mismatched images as references will impair the output results. To overcome these issues, we propose the Headshot Image Super-Resolution with Multiple Exemplars network (HIME) method. Compared with previous methods, our network can effectively handle the misalignment between the input and the reference without requiring facial priors and learn the aggregated reference set representation in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, to reconstruct more detailed facial features, we propose a correlation loss that provides a rich representation of the local texture in a controllable spatial range. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only has significantly fewer computation cost than recent exemplar-guided methods but also achieves better qualitative and quantitative performance."}}

Video signals are transmitted over lossy channels, resulting in low-quality received signals. To restore videos on recipient edge devices in real-time, we introduce an efficient video restoration network, EVRNet. EVRNet efficiently allocates parameters inside the network using alignment, differential, and fusion modules. With extensive experiments on video restoration tasks (deblocking, denoising, and super-resolution), we demonstrate that EVRNet delivers competitive performance to existing methods with significantly fewer parameters and MACs. For example, EVRNet has 260\u00d7 fewer parameters and 958\u00d7 fewer MACs than enhanced deformable convolution-based video restoration network (EDVR) for 4\u00d7 video super-resolution while its SSIM score is 0.018 less than EDVR. We also evaluated the performance of EVRNet under multiple distortions on unseen dataset to demonstrate its ability in modeling variable-length sequences under both camera and object motion."}}

The proposed method consists of three modules. The first one is a DCNN-based age group classifier which classifies a given face image into age groups. The second module is a collection of DCNN-based regressors which compute the fine-grained age estimate corresponding in each age class. Finally, any erroneous age prediction is corrected using an error-correcting mechanism. Experimental evaluations on three publicly available datasets for age estimation show that the proposed approach is able to reliably estimate the age; in addition, the coarse-to-fine strategy and the error correction module significantly improve the performance."}}

Vehicle reidentification is particularly challenging due to variations in viewpoint, illumination and occlusion. Moreover, the reality of multiple vehicles having the same make and model hinders the design of traditional deep network-based solutions. In this work, we leverage an attention-based model which learns to focus on different parts of a vehicle by conditioning the feature maps on visible key-points. We use triplet embedding to reduce the dimensionality of the features obtained from the ensemble of networks trained using different datasets. To address the problem of anomaly detection, we design an unsupervised algorithm to detect and localize anomalies in traffic scenes. To handle moving cameras, we use the results obtained from tracking to generate anomaly proposals which are then filtered in successive steps. We show the effectiveness of our method on the Nvidia AI City vehicle re-identification dataset, where we obtain mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 60.78% placing us at the 8th position out of 84 participating teams. In addition, we achieved the S3 score of 22.07% for vehicle anomaly detection."}}

In this paper, we present an iterative method for Keypoint Estimation and Pose prediction of unconstrained faces by Learning Efficient H-CNN Regressors (KEPLER) for addressing the unconstrained face alignment problem. Recent state-of-the-art methods have shown improvements in facial keypoint detection by employing Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). Although a simple feed forward neural network can learn the mapping between input and output spaces, it does not learn the inherent structural dependencies that well. We present a novel architecture called H-CNN (Heatmap-CNN) acting on an N-dimensional input image which captures informative structured global and local features and thus favors accurate keypoint detecion in in-the wild face images. H-CNN is jointly trained on the visibility, fiducials and 3D-pose of the face. As the iterations proceed, the error decreases making the gradients small and thus requiring efficient training of deep networks to mitigate this. KEPLER performs global corrections in pose and fiducials for the first four iterations followed by local corrections at a later stage. As a by-product, KEPLER also provides robust estimate of 3D pose (pitch, yaw and roll) of the face. We also show that without using any 3D information, KEPLER outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods for alignment on challenging datasets such as AFW [1] and AFLW [2]."}}

This degrades the performance of facial verification, recognition and modeling that rely on accurate detection of landmarks. To the best of our knowledge, there is no dataset consisting of low resolution face images along with their annotated landmarks, making supervised training infeasible. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised approach to predict landmarks on low resolution images by learning them from labeled high resolution images. The objective of this work is to show that predicting landmarks directly on low resolution images is more effective than the current practice of aligning images after rescaling or superresolution. In a two-step process, the proposed approach first learns to generate low resolution images by modeling the distribution of target low resolution images. In the second stage, the model learns to predict landmarks for target low resolution images from generated low resolution images. With extensive experimentation, we study the impact of the various design choices and also show that prediction of landmarks directly in low resolution, improves performance on the critical task of face verification in low resolution images. As a byproduct, the proposed method also achieves state of the art land mark detection results for high resolution images."}}

However, existing eye-based frameworks a) perform authentication and Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) independently and b) involve significant pre-processing steps to extract the iris region. Here, we introduce a joint framework for EA and PAD using periocular images. While a deep Multitask Learning (MTL) network can perform both the tasks, MTL suffers from the forgetting effect since the training datasets for EA and PAD are disjoint. To overcome this, we propose Eye Authentication with PAD (EyePAD), a distillation-based method that trains a single network for EA and PAD while reducing the effect of forgetting. To further improve the EA performance, we introduce a novel approach called EyePAD++ that includes training an MTL network on both EA and PAD data, while distilling the'versatility'of the EyePAD network through an additional distillation step. Our proposed methods outperform the SOTA in PAD and obtain near-SOTA performance in eye-to-eye verification, without any pre-processing. We also demonstrate the efficacy of EyePAD and EyePAD++ in user-to-user verification with PAD across network backbones and image quality."}}
