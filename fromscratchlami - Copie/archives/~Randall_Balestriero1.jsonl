To do so, we first demonstrate how information-theoretic quantities can be obtained for deterministic networks as an alternative to the commonly used unrealistic stochastic networks assumption. Next, we relate the VICReg objective to mutual information maximization and use it to highlight the underlying assumptions of the objective. Then, we derive a generalization bound for VICReg, providing generalization guarantees for downstream supervised learning tasks and presenting novel self-supervised learning methods derived from a mutual information maximization objective that outperform existing methods in terms of performance. This work provides a new information-theoretic perspective on self-supervised learning and Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization in particular and guides the way for improved transfer learning via information-theoretic self-supervised learning objectives."}}

However, recent studies have shown that the effects of DA can be highly class dependent: augmentation strategies that improve average accuracy may significantly hurt the accuracies on a minority of individual classes, e.g. by as much as $20\\%$ on ImageNet. In this work, we explain this phenomenon from the perspective of interactions among class-conditional distributions. We find that most affected classes are inherently ambiguous, co-occur, or involve fine-grained distinctions. By using the higher-quality multi-label ImageNet annotations, we show the negative effects of data augmentation on per-class accuracy are significantly less severe."}}

Yet in practice, engineers face issues such as instability in tuning optimizers and collapse of representations during training. Such challenges motivate the need for a theory to shed light on the complex interplay between the choice of data augmentation, network architecture, and training algorithm. We study such an interplay with a precise analysis of generalization performance on both pretraining and downstream tasks in a theory friendly setup, and highlight several insights for SSL practitioners that arise from our theory.\n"}}

In fact, despite the dire need for such methods e.g. to assess the quality of a trained model, to compare models, to interpret decisions, the community at large still relies on crude approximations. For example, computing the decision boundary of a model, say on a 2d slice of their input space, is done through gradient descent and sampling with dichotomy search. In this paper, we lean on the rich theory of Continuous Piece-Wise Linear (CPWL) DNs to provide, for the first time, a method that provably produces the exact geometry (CPWL partition) and decision boundary of any DN employing nonlinearities such as ReLU, Leaky-ReLU, and max-pooling. Using the proposed method, we are able to not only visualize the decision boundary but also obtain its spanning space, i.e., we can sample arbitrarily many inputs that provably lie on the model's decision boundary, up to numerical precision. We explore how such methods can be used to interpret architectural choices, e.g., using convolutional architectures instead of fully-connected neural networks."}}

Third, we derive a novel generalization bound based on our IT understanding of SSL methods, providing generalization guarantees for the downstream supervised learning task. As a result of this bound, along with our unified view of SSL, we can compare the different approaches and provide general guidelines to practitioners. Consequently, our derivation and insights can contribute to a better understanding of SSL and transfer learning from a theoretical and practical perspective.\n\n"}}

The main reason for that pitfall actually comes from JE-SSL's core principle of not employing any input reconstruction. Without any visual clue, it becomes extremely cryptic to judge the quality of a learned representation without having access to a labelled dataset. We hope to correct those limitations by providing a single --theoretically motivated-- criterion that reflects the quality of learned JE-SSL representations: their effective rank. Albeit simple and computationally friendly, this method ---coined {\\em RankMe}--- allows one to assess the performance of JE-SSL representations, even on different downstream datasets, without requiring any labels, training or parameters to tune. Through thorough empirical experiments involving hundreds of repeated training episodes, we demonstrate how RankMe can be used for hyperparameter selection with nearly no loss in final performance compared to the current selection method that involve dataset labels. We hope that RankMe will facilitate the use of JE-SSL in domains with little or no labeled data."}}

However, even today's best models can fail to recognize an object when its pose, lighting, or background varies. While existing benchmarks surface examples challenging for models, they do not explain why such mistakes arise. To address this need, we introduce ImageNet-X\u2014a set of sixteen human annotations of factors such as pose, background, or lighting the entire ImageNet-1k validation set as well as a random subset of 12k training images. Equipped with ImageNet-X, we investigate 2,200 current recognition models and study the types of mistakes as a function of model\u2019s (1) architecture, e.g. transformer vs. convolutional, (2) learning paradigm, e.g. supervised vs. self-supervised, and (3) training procedures, e.g., data augmentation. Regardless of these choices, we find models have consistent failure modes across ImageNet-X categories. We also find that while data augmentation can improve robustness to certain factors, they induce spill-over effects to other factors. For example, color-jitter augmentation improves robustness to color and brightness, but surprisingly hurts robustness to pose. Together, these insights suggest to advance the robustness of modern vision models, future research should focus on collecting additional data and understanding data augmentation schemes. Along with these insights, we release a toolkit based on ImageNet-X to spur further study into the mistakes image recognition systems make."}}

To date, only limited progress has been made understanding why BN boosts DN learning and inference performance; work has focused exclusively on showing that BN smooths a DN's loss landscape. In this paper, we study BN theoretically from the perspective of function approximation; we exploit the fact that most of today's state-of-the-art DNs are continuous piecewise affine (CPA) splines that fit a predictor to the training data via affine mappings defined over a partition of the input space (the so-called ``linear regions''). We demonstrate that BN is an unsupervised learning technique that -- independent of the DN's weights or  gradient-based learning -- adapts the geometry of a DN's spline partition to match the data. BN provides a ``smart initialization'' that boosts the performance of DN learning, because it adapts even a DN initialized with random weights to align its spline partition with the data. We also show that the variation of BN statistics between mini-batches introduces a dropout-like random perturbation to the partition boundaries and hence the decision boundary for classification problems. This per mini-batch perturbation reduces overfitting and improves generalization by increasing the margin between the training samples and the decision boundary. "}}

We show that in the formulation of all these methods is an overlooked prior to learn features that enable uniform clustering of the data. While this prior has led to remarkably semantic representations when pretraining on class-balanced data, such as ImageNet, we demonstrate that it can hamper performance when pretraining on class-imbalanced data. By moving away from conventional uniformity priors and instead preferring power-law distributed feature clusters, we show that one can improve the quality of the learned representations on real-world class-imbalanced datasets. To demonstrate this, we develop an extension of the Masked Siamese Networks (MSN) method to support the use of arbitrary features priors."}}

Modern methods in SSL, which form representations based on known or constructed relationships between samples, have been particularly effective at this task. Here, we aim to extend this framework to incorporate algorithms based on kernel methods where embeddings are constructed by linear maps acting on the feature space of a kernel. In this kernel regime, we derive methods to find the optimal form of the output representations for contrastive and non-contrastive loss functions. This procedure produces a new representation space with an inner product denoted as the induced kernel which generally correlates points which are related by an augmentation in kernel space and de-correlates points otherwise. We analyze our kernel model on small datasets to identify common features of self-supervised learning algorithms and gain theoretical insights into their performance on downstream tasks."}}
