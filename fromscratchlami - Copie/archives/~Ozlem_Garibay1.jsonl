In this paper, we propose a novel classification algorithm that improves fairness, while maintaining accuracy of the predictions. Utilizing the embedding layer of a pre-trained classifier for the protected attributes, the network uses an attention layer to distract the classification from depending on the protected attribute in its predictions. We compare our model with six state-of-the-art methodologies proposed in fairness literature, and show that the model is superior to those methods in terms of minimizing bias while maintaining accuracy."}}

This question becomes more relevant as these algorithms become more pervasive in many aspects of our lives and our society. While the main objective of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms is traditionally to increase accuracy, the AI community is gradually focusing more on evaluating and developing algorithms to ensure fairness. This work explores the usefulness of adversarial learning, explicitly generative adversarial networks (GAN), in addressing the problem of fairness. We show that the proposed model is able to produce synthetic tabular data to augment the original dataset in order to improve demographic parity, while maintaining data utility. In doing so, our work increases algorithmic fairness while maintaining accuracy."}}

Here, we show that the Na\u00efve Utility Calculus generative model is capable of competing with leading models in intent recognition and action prediction when observing stag-hunt, a simple multiplayer game where agents must infer each other\u2019s intentions to maximize rewards. Moreover, we show the model is the first with the capacity to out-compete human observers in intent recognition after the first round of observation."}}

In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network for tabular data generation. The model includes two phases of training. In the first phase, the model is trained to accurately generate synthetic data similar to the reference dataset. In the second phase we modify the value function to add fairness constraint, and continue training the network to generate data that is both accurate and fair. We test our results in both cases of unconstrained, and constrained fair data generation. In the unconstrained case, i.e. when the model is only trained in the first phase and is only meant to generate accurate data following the same joint probability distribution of the real data, the results show that the model beats state-of-the-art GANs proposed in the literature to produce synthetic tabular data. Also, in the constrained case in which the first phase of training is followed by the second phase, we train the network and test it on four datasets studied in the fairness literature and compare our results with another state-of-the-art pre-processing method, and present the promising results that it achieves. Comparing to other studies utilizing GANs for fair data generation, our model is comparably more stable by using only one critic, and also by avoiding major problems of original GAN model, such as mode-dropping and non-convergence, by implementing a Wasserstein GAN."}}

Unlike in biological spreading, the existence of a reinforcement effect in social contagion necessitates considering the complexity of individuals in the systems. Although many studies acknowledged the heterogeneity of the individuals in their adoption of information, there are no studies that take into account the individuals\u2019 uncertainty during their adoption decision-making. This resulted in less than optimal modeling of social contagion dynamics in the existence of phase transition in the final adoption size versus transmission probability. We employed the Inverse Born Problem (IBP) to represent probabilistic entities as complex probability amplitudes in edge-based compartmental theory, and demonstrated that our novel approach performs better in the prediction of social contagion dynamics through extensive simulations on random regular networks."}}

Since poorly designed algorithms that ignore the fairness criterion in sensitive attributes (e.g., age, race, and gender) may generate or strengthen bias towards specific groups, researchers try to improve the fairness of AI algorithms without compromising their accuracy. Although many studies focused on the optimization of the trade-off between fairness and accuracy in recent years, understanding the sources of unfairness in decision-making is an essential challenge. To tackle this problem, researchers proposed fair causal learning approaches, which enable us to model cause and effects knowledge structure, to discover the sources of the bias, and to prevent unfair decision-making by amplifying transparency and explainability of AI algorithms. These studies consider fair causal learning problems based on the assumption that the underlying probabilistic model of the world is known; whereas, it is well-known that humans do not obey the classical probability rules in making decisions due to emotional changes, subconscious feelings, and subjective biases, and this yields uncertainty in underlying probabilistic models. In this study, we aim to introduce quantum Bayesian approach as a candidate for fair decision-making in causal learning, motivated by the human decision-making literature in cognitive science. We demonstrated that quantum Bayesian perspective creates well-performing fair decision rules under high uncertainty on the well-known COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) data set."}}

Considering the uncertainty about policies, health risks, financial difficulties, etc. the online media, specially the Twitter platform, is experiencing a high volume of activity related to this pandemic. Among the hot topics, the polarized debates about unconfirmed medicines for the treatment and prevention of the disease have attracted significant attention from online media users. In this work, we present a stance data set, COVID-CQ, of user-generated content on Twitter in the context of COVID-19. We investigated more than 14 thousand tweets and manually annotated the opinions of the tweet initiators regarding the use of \"chloroquine\" and \"hydroxychloroquine\" for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, COVID-CQ is the first data set of Twitter users' stances in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the largest Twitter data set on users' stances towards a claim, in any domain. We have made this data set available to the research community via GitHub. We expect this data set to be useful for many research purposes, including stance detection, evolution and dynamics of opinions regarding this outbreak, and changes in opinions in response to the exogenous shocks such as policy decisions and events."}}

Effective and sustainable vector control measures must be deployed to keep A. aegypti numbers under control. The distribution of A. Aegypti is subject to spatial and climatic constraints. Using agent-based modeling, we model the population dynamics of A. aegypti subjected to the spatial and climatic constraints of a neighborhood in the Key West. Satellite imagery was used to identify vegetation, houses (CO2 zones) both critical to the mosquito lifecycle. The model replicates the seasonal fluctuation of adult population sampled through field studies and approximates the population at a high of 986 (95% CI: [979, 993]) females and 1031 (95% CI: [1024, 1039]) males in the fall and a low of 316 (95% CI: [313, 319]) females and 333 (95% CI: [330, 336]) males during the winter. We then simulate two biological vector control strategies: 1) Wolbachia infection and 2) Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal gene (RIDL). Our results support the probability of sustained Wolbachia infection within the population for two years after the year of release. egies, our approach provides a realistic simulation environment consisting of male and female Aedes aegypti, breeding spots, vegetation and CO2 sources."}}
