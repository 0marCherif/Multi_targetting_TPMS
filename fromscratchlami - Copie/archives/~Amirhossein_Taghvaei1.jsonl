Part I of the survey is focussed on the feedback particle filter (FPF) algorithm, its derivation based on optimal transportation theory, and its relationship to the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the conventional sequential importance sampling-resampling (SIR) particle filters. The central numerical problem of FPF -- to approximate the solution of the Poisson equation -- is described together with the main solution approaches. An analytical and numerical comparison with the SIR particle filter is given to illustrate the advantages of the CIPS approach. Part II of the survey is focussed on adapting these algorithms for the problem of reinforcement learning. The survey includes several remarks that describe extensions as well as open problems in this subject."}}

The learning problem is formulated as a stochastic policy optimization problem, aiming to minimize the output prediction error. This formulation provides a direct bridge between data-driven optimal control and, its dual, optimal filtering. Our contributions are twofold. Firstly, we conduct a thorough convergence analysis of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, adopted for the filtering problem, accounting for biased gradients and stability constraints. Secondly, we carefully leverage a combination of tools from linear system theory and high-dimensional statistics to derive bias-variance error bounds that scale logarithmically with problem dimension, and, in contrast to subspace methods, the length of output trajectories only affects the bias term."}}

Dynamical flows in respective environments incur losses manifested as entropy production. In this work we consider a rudimentary model of an overdamped stochastic thermodynamic system in an anisotropic temperature heat bath, and analyze the problem to minimize entropy production while driving the system between thermodynamic states in finite time. It is noted that entropy production in a fully isotropic temperature field, can be expressed as the Wasserstein W <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> length of the path traversed by the thermodynamic state of the system. In the presence of an anisotropic temperature field, the mechanism of entropy production is substantially more complicated as, besides dissipation, it entails seepage of energy between the ambient heat sources by way of the system dynamics. We show that, in this case, the entropy production can be expressed as the solution of a suitably constrained and generalized Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) problem. In contrast to the situation in standard OMT, entropy production may not be identically zero, even when the thermodynamic state remains unchanged. Physically, this is due to the fact that maintaining a Non-Equilibrium Steady State (NESS), incurs an intrinsic entropic cost. As already noted, NESSs are the hallmark of life and living systems by necessity operate away from equilibrium. Thus our problem of minimizing entropy production appears of central importance in understanding biological processes, such as molecular motors and motor proteins, and on how such processes may have evolved to optimize for available usage of resources."}}

This paper formalizes and utilizes such a mapping to consider learning the optimal (steady-state) Kalman gain when process and measurement noise statistics are unknown. Specifically, building on the duality between synthesizing optimal control and estimation gains, the filter design problem is formalized as direct policy learning. In this direction, the duality is used to extend existing theoretical guarantees of direct policy updates for Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to establish global convergence of the Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm for the estimation problem\u2013while addressing subtle differences between the two synthesis problems. Subsequently, a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) approach is adopted to learn the optimal Kalman gain without the knowledge of noise covariances. The results are illustrated via several numerical examples."}}

At the same time, anisotropy is a root cause of incurred losses manifested as entropy production. In this work we consider a rudimentary model of an overdamped stochastic thermodynamic system in an anisotropic temperature heat bath, and study minimum entropy production when driving the system between thermodynamic states in finite time. While entropy production in isotropic temperature environments can be expressed in terms of the length (in the Wasserstein-2 metric) traversed by the thermodynamic state of the system, anisotropy complicates substantially the mechanism of entropy production since, besides dissipation, seepage of energy between ambient anisotropic heat sources by way of the system dynamics is often a major contributing factor. A key result of the paper is to show that in the presence of anisotropy, minimization of entropy production can once again be expressed via a modified Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) problem. However, in contrast to the isotropic situation that leads to a classical OMT problem and a Wasserstein length, entropy production may not be identically zero when the thermodynamic state remains unchanged (unless one has control over non-conservative forces); this is due to the fact that maintaining a Non-Equilibrium Steady-State (NESS) incurs an intrinsic entropic cost that can be traced back to a seepage of heat between heat baths. As alluded to, NESSs represent hallmarks of life, since living matter by necessity operates far from equilibrium. Therefore, the question studied herein, to characterize minimal entropy production in anisotropic environments, appears of central importance in biological processes and on how such processes may have evolved to optimize for available usage of resources."}}
