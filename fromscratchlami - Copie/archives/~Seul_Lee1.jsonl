Yet, this is a challenging problem, and the previous graph generative methods either fail to capture the permutation-invariance property of graphs or cannot sufficiently model the complex dependency between nodes and edges, which is crucial for generating real-world graphs such as molecules. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel score-based generative model for graphs with a continuous-time framework. Specifically, we propose a new graph diffusion process that models the joint distribution of the nodes and edges through a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Then, we derive novel score matching objectives tailored for the proposed diffusion process to estimate the gradient of the joint log-density with respect to each component, and introduce a new solver for the system of SDEs to efficiently sample from the reverse diffusion process. We validate our graph generation method on diverse datasets, on which it either achieves significantly superior or competitive performance to the baselines. Further analysis shows that our method is able to generate molecules that lie close to the training distribution yet do not violate the chemical valency rule, demonstrating the effectiveness of the system of SDEs in modeling the node-edge relationships.

However, a well-known problem of existing works on molecule generation is that the generated molecules highly resemble those in the training set. Models that do not require training molecules such as RL-based models circumvent this problem, but they lack information about existing molecules. In this paper, we propose Molecular Out-of-distribution Generation (MOG), a novel framework that explicitly generates OOD molecules with respect to given molecules by combining two aspects of energy-based models (EBMs): generation and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. This can be done by introducing multiple energy pivots to Langevin dynamics in generation and increase energy instead of minimizing it. We also utilize a property predictor to provide the property gradient of molecules to the modified Langevin dynamics. To validate the ability to explore the chemical space beyond the known molecular distribution, we experiment with MOG to generate molecules of high absolute values of docking score, which is the affinity score based on a physical binding simulation between a target protein and a given molecule. Docking score is a strong proxy to drug activity unlike penalized logP or QED and requires stronger exploration as it is nonlinear to local molecular structures and has many local optima. MOG is able to generate molecules with high docking scores compared to existing methods. Moreover, we further show the energy-increasing strategy based on EBMs can be universally applied to existing models and enhance their resulting novelty."}}

Yet, they mostly focus on capturing information from the nodes considering their connectivity, and not much work has been done in representing the edges, which are essential components of a graph. However, for tasks such as graph reconstruction and generation, as well as graph classification tasks for which the edges are important for discrimination, accurately representing edges of a given graph is crucial to the success of the graph representation learning. To this end, we propose a novel edge representation learning framework based on Dual Hypergraph Transformation (DHT), which transforms the edges of a graph into the nodes of a hypergraph. This dual hypergraph construction allows us to apply message-passing techniques for node representations to edges. After obtaining edge representations from the hypergraphs, we then cluster or drop edges to obtain holistic graph-level edge representations. We validate our edge representation learning method with hypergraphs on diverse graph datasets for graph representation and generation performance, on which our method largely outperforms existing graph representation learning methods. Moreover, our edge representation learning and pooling method also largely outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification, not only because of its accurate edge representation learning, but also due to its lossless compression of the nodes and removal of irrelevant edges for effective message-passing."}}
