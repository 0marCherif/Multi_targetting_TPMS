To relate the severity to changes in brain morphometry, there is a growing interest in replacing these categories with a continuous severity scale that longitudinal MRIs are mapped onto via deep learning algorithms. However, existing methods based on supervised learning require large numbers of samples and those that do not, such as self-supervised models, fail to clearly separate the disease effect from normal aging. Here, we propose to explicitly disentangle those two factors via weak-supervision. In other words, training is based on longitudinal MRIs being labelled either normal or diseased so that the training data can be augmented with samples from disease categories that are not of primary interest to the analysis. We do so by encouraging trajectories of controls to be fully encoded by the direction associated with brain aging. Furthermore, an orthogonal direction linked to disease severity captures the residual component from normal aging in the diseased cohort. Hence, the proposed method quantifies disease severity and its progression speed in individuals without knowing their condition. We apply the proposed method on data from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N =632 ). We then show that the model properly disentangled normal aging from the severity of cognitive impairment by plotting the resulting disentangled factors of each subject and generating simulated MRIs for a given chronological age and condition. Moreover, our representation obtains higher balanced accuracy when used for two downstream classification tasks compared to other pre-training approaches.

The performance of the downstream task generally improves when these latent representations are explicitly associated with factors of interest. For example, we derived such a representation for capturing brain aging by applying self-supervised learning to longitudinal MRIs and then used the resulting encoding to automatically identify diseases accelerating the aging of the brain. We now propose a refinement of this representation by replacing the linear modeling of brain aging with one that is consistent in local neighborhoods in the latent space. Called Longitudinal Neighborhood Embedding (LNE), we derive an encoding so that neighborhoods are age-consistent (i.e., brain MRIs of different subjects with similar brain ages are in close proximity of each other) and progression-consistent, i.e., the latent space is defined by a smooth trajectory field where each trajectory captures changes in brain ages between a pair of MRIs extracted from a longitudinal sequence. To make the problem computationally tractable, we further propose a strategy for mini-batch sampling so that the resulting local neighborhoods accurately approximate the ones that would be defined based on the whole cohort.\n\nWe evaluate LNE on three different downstream tasks: (1) to predict chronological age from T1-w MRI of 274 healthy subjects participating in a study at SRI International; (2) to distinguish Normal Control (NC) from Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) and stable Mild Cognitive Impairment (sMCI) from progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment (pMCI) based on T1-w MRI of 632 participants of the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); and (3) to distinguish no-to-low from moderate-to-heavy alcohol drinkers based on fractional anisotropy derived from diffusion tensor MRIs of 764 adolescents recruited by the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Across the three data sets, the visualization of the smooth trajectory vector fields and superior accuracy on downstream tasks demonstrate the strength of the proposed method over existing self-supervised methods in extracting information related to brain aging, which could help study the impact of substance use and neurodegenerative disorders.

Large longitudinal MRI datasets have revealed such deterioration, in part, by applying machine and deep learning to predict diagnosis. A popular approach is to apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract informative features from each visit of the longitudinal MRI and then use those features to classify each visit via Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Such modeling neglects the progressive nature of the disease, which may result in clinically implausible classifications across visits. To avoid this issue, we propose to combine features across visits by coupling feature extraction with a novel longitudinal pooling layer and enforce consistency of the classification across visits in line with disease progression. We evaluate the proposed method on the longitudinal structural MRIs from three neuroimaging datasets: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=404), a dataset composed of 274 normal controls and 329 patients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), and 255 youths from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). In all three experiments our method is superior to other widely used approaches for longitudinal classification thus making a unique contribution towards more accurate tracking of the impact of conditions on the brain.

Confounders affect the relationship between input data (e.g., brain MRIs) and output variables (e.g., diagnosis). Improper modeling of those relationships often results in spurious and biased associations. Traditional machine learning and statistical models minimize the impact of confounders by, for example, matching data sets, stratifying data, or residualizing imaging measurements. Alternative strategies are needed for state-of-the-art deep learning models that use end-to-end training to automatically extract informative features from large set of images. In this article, we introduce an end-to-end approach for deriving features invariant to confounding factors while accounting for intrinsic correlations between the confounder(s) and prediction outcome. The method does so by exploiting concepts from traditional statistical methods and recent fair machine learning schemes. We evaluate the method on predicting the diagnosis of HIV solely from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs), identifying morphological sex differences in adolescence from those of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), and determining the bone age from X-ray images of children. The results show that our method can accurately predict while reducing biases associated with confounders. The code is available at https://github.com/qingyuzhao/br-net."}}

Analyzing this data via machine learning generally requires a large number of ground-truth labels, which are often missing or expensive to obtain. Reducing the need for labels, we propose a self-supervised strategy for representation learning named Longitudinal Neighborhood Embedding (LNE). Motivated by concepts in contrastive learning, LNE explicitly models the similarity between trajectory vectors across different subjects. We do so by building a graph in each training iteration defining neighborhoods in the latent space so that the progression direction of a subject follows the direction of its neighbors. This results in a smooth trajectory field that captures the global morphological change of the brain while maintaining the local continuity. We apply LNE to longitudinal T1w MRIs of two neuroimaging studies: a dataset composed of 274 healthy subjects, and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=632). The visualization of the smooth trajectory vector field and superior performance on downstream tasks demonstrate the strength of the proposed method over existing self-supervised methods in extracting information associated with normal aging and in revealing the impact of neurodegenerative disorders.

To interpret the decision process of a trained classifier, existing techniques typically rely on saliency maps to quantify the voxel-wise or feature-level importance for classification through partial derivatives. Despite providing some level of localization, these maps are not human-understandable from the neuroscience perspective as they do not inform the specific meaning of the alteration linked to the brain disorder. Inspired by the image-to-image translation scheme, we propose to train simulator networks that can warp a given image to inject or remove patterns of the disease. These networks are trained such that the classifier produces consistently increased or decreased prediction logits for the simulated images. Moreover, we propose to couple all the simulators into a unified model based on conditional convolution. We applied our approach to interpreting classifiers trained on a synthetic dataset and two neuroimaging datasets to visualize the effect of the Alzheimer's disease and alcohol use disorder. Compared to the saliency maps generated by baseline approaches, our simulations and visualizations based on the Jacobian determinants of the warping field reveal meaningful and understandable patterns related to the diseases."}}

While these techniques normalize feature distributions by standardizing with batch statistics, they do not correct the influence on features from extraneous variables or multiple distributions. Such extra variables, referred to as metadata here, may create bias or confounding effects (e.g., race when classifying gender from face images). We introduce the Metadata Normalization (MDN) layer, a new batch-level operation which can be used end-to-end within the training framework, to correct the influence of metadata on feature distributions. MDN adopts a regression analysis technique traditionally used for preprocessing to remove (regress out) the metadata effects on model features during training. We utilize a metric based on distance correlation to quantify the distribution bias from the metadata and demonstrate that our method successfully removes metadata effects on four diverse settings: one synthetic, one 2D image, one video, and one 3D medical image dataset."}}

However, existing deep learning methods applied to rs-fMRI either neglect the functional dependency between different brain regions in a network or discard the information in the temporal dynamics of brain activity. To overcome those shortcomings, we propose to formulate functional connectivity networks within the context of spatio-temporal graphs. We train a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) on short sub-sequences of the BOLD time series to model the non-stationary nature of functional connectivity. Simultaneously, the model learns the importance of graph edges within ST-GCN to gain insight into the functional connectivities contributing to the prediction. In analyzing the rs-fMRI of the Human Connectome Project (HCP, N = 1,091) and the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA, N = 773), ST-GCN is significantly more accurate than common approaches in predicting gender and age based on BOLD signals. Furthermore, the brain regions and functional connections significantly contributing to the predictions of our model are important markers according to the neuroscience literature."}}
