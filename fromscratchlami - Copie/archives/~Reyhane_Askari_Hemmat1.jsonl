A central obstacle in the optimization of such games is the rotational dynamics that hinder their convergence. Existing methods typically employ intuitive, carefully hand-designed mechanisms for controlling such rotations. In this paper, we take a novel approach to address this issue by casting min-max optimization as a physical system. We leverage tools from physics to introduce LEAD (Least-Action Dynamics), a second-order optimizer for min-max games. Next, using Lyapunov stability theory and spectral analysis, we study LEAD's convergence properties in continuous and discrete-time settings for bilinear games to demonstrate linear convergence to the Nash equilibrium. Finally, we empirically evaluate our method on synthetic setups and CIFAR-10 image generation to demonstrate improvements over baseline methods."}}

We propose a new version control system for experiments, which can significantly improve the organization of research projects in machine learning as well as the efficiency of hyperparameter optimization. The entire tool is built with the goals of promoting reproducibility, fair benchmarking of different machine learning models, and providing a platform for the research of black-box optimization algorithms."}}
