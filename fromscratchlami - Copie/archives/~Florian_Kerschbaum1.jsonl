This has opened the door to new attacks that can have serious privacy implications. One such attack, the Membership Inference Attack (MIA), exposes whether or not a particular data point was used to train a model. A growing body of literature uses Differentially Private (DP) training algorithms as a defence against such attacks. However, these works evaluate the defence under the restrictive assumption that all members of the training set, as well as non-members, are independent and identically distributed. This assumption does not hold for many real-world use cases in the literature. Motivated by this, we evaluate membership inference with statistical dependencies among samples and explain why DP does not provide meaningful protection (the privacy parameter \u03f5 scales with the training set size n) in this more general case. We conduct a series of empirical evaluations with off-the-shelf MIAs using training sets built from real-world data showing different types of dependencies among samples. Our results reveal that training set dependencies can severely increase the performance of MIAs, and therefore assuming that data samples are statistically independent can significantly underestimate the performance of MIAs."}}

Such a dataset benefits the downstream tasks as natural training is much faster than adversarial training, and demonstrates that the desired property of robustness is transferable between models and data. In this work, we propose a principled, tri-level optimization to formulate the robust dataset learning problem. We show that, under an abstraction model that characterizes robust vs. non-robust features, the proposed method provably learns a robust dataset. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, and TinyImageNet demostrate the effectiveness of our algorithm with different network initializations and architectures."}}

This makes DNNs vulnerable to backdoor attacks, in which the third party maliciously injects hidden functionalities in the model at training time. Removing a backdoor is challenging because although the defender has access to a clean, labeled dataset, they only have limited computational resources which are a fraction of the resources required to train a model from scratch. We propose Feature Grinding as an efficient, randomized backdoor sanitation technique against seven contemporary backdoors on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Feature Grinding requires at most six percent of the model's training time on CIFAR-10 and at most two percent on ImageNet for sanitizing the surveyed backdoors. We compare Feature Grinding with five other sanitation methods and find that it is often the most effective at decreasing the backdoor's success rate while preserving a high model accuracy. Our experiments include an ablation study over multiple parameters for each backdoor attack and sanitation technique to ensure a fair evaluation of all methods. Models suspected of containing a backdoor can be Feature Grinded using limited resources, which makes it a practical defense against backdoors that can be incorporated into any standard training procedure."}}

The hosted (source) model is susceptible to model stealing attacks, where an adversary derives a surrogate model from API access to the source model. For post hoc detection of such attacks, the provider needs a robust method to determine whether a suspect model is a surrogate of their model. We propose a fingerprinting method for deep neural network classifiers that extracts a set of inputs from the source model so that only surrogates agree with the source model on the classification of such inputs. These inputs are a subclass of transferable adversarial examples which we call conferrable adversarial examples that exclusively transfer with a target label from a source model to its surrogates. We propose a new method to generate these conferrable adversarial examples. We present an extensive study on the irremovability of our fingerprint against fine-tuning, weight pruning, retraining, retraining with different architectures, three model extraction attacks from related work, transfer learning, adversarial training, and two new adaptive attacks. Our fingerprint is robust against distillation, related model extraction attacks, and even transfer learning when the attacker has no access to the model provider's dataset. Our fingerprint is the first method that reaches a ROC AUC of 1.0 in verifying surrogates, compared to a ROC AUC of 0.63 by previous fingerprints. "}}

In many cases, it is desirable that the authors of such documents remain anonymous: Search logs can reveal sensitive details about a user, critical articles or messages about a company or government might have severe or fatal consequences for a critic, and negative feedback in customer surveys might negatively impact business relations if they are identified. Simply removing personally identifying information from a document is, however, insufficient to protect the writer's identity: Given some reference texts of suspect authors, so-called authorship attribution methods can reidentfy the author from the text itself. One of the most prominent models to represent documents in many common text mining and information retrieval tasks is the vector space model where each document is represented as a vector, typically containing its term frequencies or related quantities. We therefore propose an automated text anonymization approach that produces synthetic term frequency vectors for the input documents that can be used in lieu of the original vectors. We evaluate our method on an exemplary text classification task and demonstrate that it only has a low impact on its accuracy. In contrast, we show that our method strongly affects authorship attribution techniques to the level that they become infeasible with a much stronger decline in accuracy. Other than previous authorship obfuscation methods, our approach is the first that fulfills differential privacy and hence comes with a provable plausible deniability guarantee."}}
