In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model to capture the joint distribution of molecules and their properties. Our model assumes an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space. Conditional on the latent vector, the molecule and its properties are modeled by a molecule generation model and a property regression model respectively.  To search for molecules with desired properties,  we propose a sampling with gradual distribution shifting (SGDS) algorithm, so that after learning the model initially on the training data of existing molecules and their properties, the proposed algorithm gradually shifts the model distribution towards the region supported by molecules with desired values of properties. Our experiments show that our method achieves very strong performances on various molecule design tasks."}}

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model to capture the joint distribution of molecules and their properties. Our model assumes an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space. Given the latent vector sampled from the latent space EBM, both molecules and molecular properties are conditionally sampled via a top-down molecule generator model and a property regression model respectively. The EBM in a low dimensional latent space allows our model to capture complex chemical rules implicitly but efficiently and effectively. Due to the joint modeling with chemical properties, molecule design can be conveniently and naturally achieved by conditional sampling from our learned model given desired properties, in both single-objective and multi-objective optimization settings. The latent space EBM, top-down molecule generator, and property regression model are learned jointly by maximum likelihood, while optimization of properties is accomplished by gradual shifting of the model distribution towards the region supported by molecules with high property values. Our experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models on various molecule design tasks. "}}

We propose to learn an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a top-down generative model such that the EBM in the low dimensional latent space is able to be learned efficiently and adapt to each task rapidly. Furthermore, the energy term couples a continuous latent vector and a symbolic one-hot label. Such coupling formulation allows the model to be learned in an unsupervised manner when the labels are unknown. Our model is learned unsupervisedly in the meta-training phase and evaluated semi-supervisedly in the meta-test phase. We evaluate our model on widely used benchmarks for few-shot meta-learning, Omniglot, and Mini-ImageNet. Our model achieves competitive or superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art meta-learning models."}}

Of note, this new visual task requires understanding multimodal cues with perspective-taking to identify which object is being referred to. To tackle this problem, we introduce YouRefIt, a new crowd-sourced dataset of embodied reference collected in various physical scenes; the dataset contains 4,195 unique reference clips in 432 indoor scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first embodied reference dataset that allows us to study referring expressions in daily physical scenes to understand referential behavior, human communication, and human-robot interaction. We further devise two benchmarks for image-based and video-based embodied reference understanding. Comprehensive baselines and extensive experiments provide the very first result of machine perception on how the referring expressions and gestures affect the embodied reference understanding. Our results provide essential evidence that gestural cues are as critical as language cues in understanding the embodied reference."}}
