We present a novel approach to model object fragmentation using an attributed stochastic grammar. This grammar abstracts fragment states as node variables and captures causal transitions in object fragmentation through production rules. We devise a probabilistic framework to learn this grammar from human demonstrations. The planning process for object cutting involves inferring an optimal parse tree of desired fragments using the learned grammar, with parse tree productions corresponding to cutting actions. We employ \\ac{mcts} to efficiently approximate the optimal parse tree and generate a sequence of executable cutting actions. The experiments demonstrate the efficacy in planning for object-cutting tasks, both in simulation and on a physical robot. The proposed approach outperforms several baselines by demonstrating superior generalization to novel setups, thanks to the compositionality of the grammar"}}

To address this issue, our work introduces a part-level reconstruction approach that reassembles objects using primitive shapes. This enables us to precisely replicate the observed physical scenes and simulate robot interactions with both rigid and articulated objects. By segmenting reconstructed objects into semantic parts and aligning primitive shapes to these parts, we assemble them as CAD models while estimating kinematic relations, including parent-child contact relations, joint types, and parameters. Specifically, we derive the optimal primitive alignment by solving a series of optimization problems, and estimate kinematic relations based on part semantics and geometry. Our experiments demonstrate that part-level scene reconstruction outperforms object-level reconstruction by accurately capturing finer details and improving precision. These reconstructed part-level interactive scenes provide valuable kinematic information for various robotic applications; we showcase the feasibility of certifying mobile manipulation planning in these interactive scenes before executing tasks in the physical world."}}

Here, we address this challenging problem by reconstructing a functionally equivalent and interactive scene from RGB-D data streams, where the objects within are segmented by a dedicated 3D volumetric panoptic mapping module and subsequently replaced by part-based articulated CAD models to afford finer-grained robot interactions. The object functionality and contextual relations are further organized by a graph-based scene representation that can be readily incorporated into robots\u2019 action specifications and task definition, facilitating their long-term task and motion planning in the scenes. In the experiments, we demonstrate that (i) our panoptic mapping module outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in recognizing and segmenting scene entities, (ii) the geometric and physical reasoning procedure matches, aligns, and replaces object meshes with best-fitted CAD models, and (iii) the reconstructed functionally equivalent and interactive scenes are physically plausible and naturally afford actionable interactions; without any manual labeling, they are seamlessly imported to ROS-based robot simulators and VR environments for simulating complex robot interactions."}}
