This paper explores interpretable DRL via representing policy by Differentiable Inductive Logic Programming (DILP) and provides a theoretical and empirical study of DILP-based policy learning from an optimization perspective. We first identified a fundamental fact that DILP-based policy learning should be solved as a constrained policy optimization problem. We then proposed to use Mirror Descent for policy optimization (MDPO) to deal with the constraints of DILP-based policies. We derived the closed-form regret bound of MDPO with function approximation, which is helpful to the design of DRL frameworks. Moreover, we studied the convexity of DILP-based policy to further verify the benefits gained from MDPO. Empirically, we experimented MDPO, its on-policy variant, and 3 mainstream policy learning methods, and the results verified our theoretical analysis."}}

In comparison with existing GCNs which cannot fully utilize relational information of multiple types, we propose a relation-aware graph convolutional network (ERGCN), which is equipped with both entity convolution and relation convolution to learn the entity embeddings and relation embeddings simultaneously. The role discrimination and translation property of knowledge graphs are adopted in the entity convolutional process to incorporate the relation information. To facilitate the relation convolution, we construct quadruples to model the connection between a pair of relations thus to determine their neighborhood, which also enables the relation convolution to be conducted in an efficient way. Thereafter, AERGCN, the alignment framework based on ERGCN, is developed for multi-relational network alignment tasks. Anchors are used to supervise the objective function, which aims at minimizing the distances between anchors and to generate new cross-network triplets to build a bridge between different knowledge graphs at the level of triplet to improve the performance of alignment. Experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed solutions outperform the competitive baselines in terms of link prediction, entity alignment, and relation alignment."}}

However, most existing work either focuses on short sequence forecasting or makes predictions predominantly with time domain features, which is not effective at removing noises with irregular frequencies in MTS. Therefore, we propose WaveForM, an end-to-end graph enhanced Wavelet learning framework for long sequence FORecasting of MTS. WaveForM first utilizes Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to represent MTS in the wavelet domain, which captures both frequency and time domain features with a sound theoretical basis. To enable the effective learning in the wavelet domain, we further propose a graph constructor, which learns a global graph to represent the relationships between MTS variables, and graph-enhanced prediction modules, which utilize dilated convolution and graph convolution to capture the correlations between time series and predict the wavelet coefficients at different levels. Extensive experiments on five real-world forecasting datasets show that our model can achieve considerable performance improvement over different prediction lengths against the most competitive baseline of each dataset."}}

Though promising performance has been achieved by leveraging Graph Neural Network (GNN) models to encode the molecular structures of medications or/and DDI, we observe that existing models are still defective: 1) to differentiate medications with similar molecules but different functionality; or/and 2) to properly capture the unintended reactions between drugs in the embedding space. To alleviate this limitation, we propose Carmen, a cautiously designed graph embedding-based MR framework. Carmen consists of four components, including patient representation learning, context information extraction, a context-aware GNN, and DDI encoding. Carmen incorporates the visit history into the representation learning of molecular graphs to distinguish molecules with similar topology but dissimilar activity. Its DDI encoding module is specially devised for the non-transitive interaction DDI graphs. The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Carmen achieves remarkable performance improvement over state-of-the-art models and can improve the safety of recommended drugs with a proper DDI graph encoding."}}

To address these challenges, we proposed to explore the category hierarchy knowledge graph of POIs via an attention mechanism to learn the robust representations of POIs even when there is insufficient data. We also proposed a spatial-temporal decay LSTM and a Discrete Fourier Series-based periodic attention to better facilitate the capturing of the personalized behavior pattern. Extensive experiments on two commonly adopted real-world location-based social networks (LBSNs) datasets proved that the inclusion of the aforementioned modules helps to boost the performance of next and next new POI recommendation tasks significantly. Specifically, our model in general outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin."}}

Current work focuses on: 1) designing the embedding as an unsupervised learning task to explicitly preserve the structural connectivity in the network or 2) generating the embedding as a by-product during the supervised learning of a specific discriminative task in a deep neural network. In this paper, we aim to take advantage of these two lines of research in the view of multi-output learning. That is, we propose a generative adversarial network embedding (GANE) model to adapt the generative adversarial framework to achieve the network embedding learning during the specific machine learning tasks. GANE has a generator to generate link edges, and a discriminator to distinguish the generated link edges from real connections (edges) in the network. Wasserstein-1 distance is adopted to train the generator to gain better stability. GANE is further extended by utilizing the pairwise connectivity of vertices to preserve the structural information in the original network. Experiments with real-world network data sets demonstrate that our models constantly outperform state-of-the-art solutions with significant improvements for the tasks of link prediction, clustering, and network alignment."}}

To generalize VIN to spatially variant MDPs, we propose Universal Value Iteration Networks (UVIN). In comparison with VIN, UVIN automatically learns a flexible but compact network structure to encode the transition dynamics of the problems and support the differentiable planning module. We evaluate UVIN with both spatially invariant and spatially variant tasks, including navigation in regular maze, chessboard maze, and Mars, and Minecraft item syntheses. Results show that UVIN can achieve similar performance as VIN and its extensions on spatially invariant tasks, and significantly outperforms other models on more general problems."}}

Besides the challenges of user incentives, and diversified data sources and quality, the requirement of sharing spatial-temporal data drives the privacy concerns of contributors as one of the top priorities in the design and implementation of a sound crowdsourcing platform. In this paper, FollowMe is introduced as a use case of mobile crowd sensing platform to explain possible design guidelines and solutions to address these challenges. The incentive mechanisms are discussed according to both the quantity and quality of users' contributions. Then, a k-anonymity based solution is applied to protect contributors' privacy in both scenarios of trustworthy and untrustworthy crowdsourcers. Thereafter, a reputation-based filtering solution is proposed to detect fake or malicious reports, and finally a density-based clustering algorithm is introduced to find hotspots which can help the prediction of future events. Although FollowMe is designed for a virtual world of the popular mobile game Pok\u00e9mon Go, the solutions and discussions are supposed to be applicable to more complex applications sharing spatial-temporal data about users."}}
