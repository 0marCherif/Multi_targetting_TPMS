In this paper, we present a new approach for tone mapping of high dynamic range (HDR) images using edge-preserving filter. We pose it as a variational problem and derive an optimal solution. We compare the results with some of the existing tone mapping algorithms and show that our algorithm compresses the high dynamic range better while preserving the details and avoiding common artefacts. We use an online dynamic range independent metric for analysing the results by the proposed and existing operators and to detect the deviation from the reference HDR image."}}

However, the problem of computing the reflection symmetry map for a given image containing objects exhibiting reflection symmetry has received a very little attention. The symmetry map enables us to represent the pixels in the image using a score depending on the probability of each of them having a symmetric counterpart. In this work, we attempt to compute the 2-D reflection symmetry map. We pose the problem of generating the symmetry map as an intra-image dense symmetric pixels correspondence problem, which we solve efficiently using a randomized algorithm by observing the reflection symmetry coherency present in the image. We introduce an application of symmetry map called symmetry preserving image stylization."}}

Reflection symmetry is quite prevalent in both natural and man-made objects and is an essential cue in understanding and grouping the objects in natural scenes. Existing algorithms for estimating superpixels do not preserve the reflection symmetry of an object which leads to different sizes and shapes of superpixels across the symmetry axis. In this work, we propose an algorithm to over-segment an image through the propagation of reflection symmetry evident at the pixel level to superpixel boundaries. In order to achieve this goal, we first find the reflection symmetry in the image and represent it by a set of pairs of pixels which are mirror reflections of each other. We partition the image into superpixels while preserving this reflection symmetry through an iterative algorithm. We compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art superpixel generation methods and show the effectiveness in preserving the size and shape of superpixel boundaries across the reflection symmetry axes. We also present two applications, symmetry axes detection and unsupervised symmetric object segmentation, to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}

It has been studied extensively in robotics as a problem of motion planning, actuator control and obstacle avoidance. However, the task of developing a generalized framework for assembly robust to structural variants remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we tackle this problem using a recurrent graph learning framework considering inter-part relations and the progressive update of the part pose. Our network can learn more plausible predictions of shape structure by accounting for priorly assembled parts. Compared to the current state-of-the-art, our network yields up to 10% improvement in part accuracy and up to 15% improvement in connectivity accuracy on the PartNet [23] dataset. Moreover, our resulting latent space facilitates exciting applications such as shape recovery from the point-cloud components. We conduct extensive experiments to justify our design choices and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."}}

The main challenge is to handle outliers, missing parts, and perturbations from the perfect reflection symmetry. We propose a descriptor-free approach, in which, we pose the problem of reflection symmetry detection as an optimization problem and provide a closed-form solution.

In this work, we detect the intrinsic reflective symmetry in triangle meshes where we have to find the intrinsically symmetric point for each point of the shape. We establish correspondences between functions defined on the shapes by extending the functional map framework and then recover the point-to-point correspondences. Previous approaches using the functional map for this task find the functional correspondences matrix by solving a non-linear optimization problem which makes them slow. In this work, we propose a closed form solution for this matrix which makes our approach faster. We find the closed-form solution based on our following results. If the given shape is intrinsically symmetric, then the shortest length geodesic between two intrinsically symmetric points is also intrinsically symmetric. If an eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator for the given shape is an even (odd) function, then its restriction on the shortest length geodesic between two intrinsically symmetric points is also an even (odd) function. The sign of a low-frequency eigenfunction is the same on the neighboring points. Our method is invariant to the ordering of the eigenfunctions and has the least time complexity. We achieve the best performance on the SCAPE dataset and comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods on the TOSCA dataset."}}

We formulate an optimization framework in which the problem of establishing the correspondences amounts to solving a linear assignment problem and the problem of determining the reflection symmetry transformation amounts to solving an optimization problem on a smooth Riemannian product manifold. The proposed approach estimates the symmetry from the geometry of the points and is descriptor independent. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on the standard benchmark dataset and achieve the state-of-theart performance. We further show the robustness of our approach by varying the amount of distortion in a perfect reflection symmetry pattern where we perturb each point by a different amount of perturbation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by applying it to the problem of 2-D (two-dimensional) and 3-D reflection symmetry detection along with comparisons."}}
