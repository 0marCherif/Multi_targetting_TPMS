Sensitivity analysis allows to assess the influence, e.g., of each neuron or weight on the final network output. In particular various feature selection and pruning strategies are based on this capability. In this paper, we will present a new approximative sensitivity-based training algorithm yielding robust neural networks with generalization capabilities comparable to its exact analytical counterpart, yet much faster."}}

To solve this problem, we propose a\u00a0novel method CS-UID based on\u00a0the\u00a0theory of\u00a0Unconstrained Influence Diagrams (UIDs).

Reliable solutions require, however, also sufficient generalization capabilities of the formed networks and an easy interpretation of their function. These characteristics are strongly related to less sensitive networks with an optimized network structure. In this paper, we will introduce a new pruning technique called SCGSIR that is inspired by the fast method of scaled conjugate gradients (SCG) and sensitivity analysis. Network sensitivity inhibited during training impacts efficient optimization of network structure. Experiments performed so far yield promising results outperforming the reference techniques when considering both their ability to find networks with optimum architecture and improved generalization."}}

In this paper, we will introduce a general framework for sensitivity control in neural networks of the back-propagation type (BP-networks) with an arbitrary number of hidden layers. Experiments performed so far confirm that sensitivity inhibition with an enforced internal representation significantly improves generalization. A transparent network structure formed during training supports an easy architecture optimization, too."}}

In the first part of this paper, we determine the strict upper bound on the size of the GS-DAG with respect to the size of the UID being solved. In the second part, we introduce a new type of GS-DAG multinode, which reduces the number of edges of the GS-DAGs significantly. This has a huge impact on the evaluation of the GS-DAGs, because the number of edges heavily influences the number of computed and stored potential tables. The results presented in this article are also of a great importance from the point of view of approximation methods, which appeared recently and try to outperform the GS-DAG approach with an unknown complexity (until now)."}}

The unconstrained version of this model (UID) drops the restriction of linear order- ing of decisions. It adds expressiveness to the model, but it brings an exponential growth of complexity of the already computationally intensive algorithm for optimal ID evalua- tion. In this article, we present the first application for ex- act UID solving: Guido. We present the techniques we used to fight the computational complexity and how they affect the performance of the application."}}
