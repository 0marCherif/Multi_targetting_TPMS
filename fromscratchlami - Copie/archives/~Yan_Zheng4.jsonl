In this work, we propose Neural Volumetric Mesh Generator (NVMG), which can generate novel and high-quality volumetric meshes. Unlike the previous 3D generative model for point cloud, voxel, and implicit surface, volumetric mesh is a ready-to-use representation in industry with details on both the surface and interior. Generating this kind of highly-structured data thus brings a great challenge. To tackle this problem, we first propose to use a diffusion-based generative model to generate voxelized shapes with realistic shape and topology information. With the voxelized shape, we can simply obtain a tetrahedral mesh as a template. Further, we use a voxel-conditional neural network to predict the surface conditioned on the voxels, and progressively project the tetrahedral mesh to the predicted surface under regularization. As shown in the experiments, without any post-processing, our pipeline can generate high-quality artifact-free volumetric and surface meshes."}}

Unlike the previous 3D generative model for point cloud, voxel, and implicit surface, the volumetric mesh representation is a ready-to-use representation in industry with details on both the surface and interior. Generating this such highly-structured data thus brings a significant challenge. We first propose a diffusion-based generative model to tackle this problem by generating voxelized shapes with close-to-reality outlines and structures. We can simply obtain a tetrahedral mesh as a template with the voxelized shape. Further, we use a voxel-conditional neural network to predict the smooth implicit surface conditioned on the voxels, and progressively project the tetrahedral mesh to the predicted surface under regularization. The regularization terms are carefully designed so that they can (1) get rid of the defects like flipping and high distortion; (2) force the regularity of the interior and surface structure during the deformation procedure for a high-quality final mesh. As shown in the experiments, our pipeline can generate high-quality artifact-free volumetric and surface meshes from random noise or a reference image without any post-processing. Compared with the state-of-the-art voxel-to-mesh deformation method, we show more robustness and better performance when taking generated voxels as input."}}
