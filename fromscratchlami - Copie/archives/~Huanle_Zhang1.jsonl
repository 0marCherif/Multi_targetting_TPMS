In this paper, we propose FedTuning, an automatic FL hyper-parameter tuning algorithm tailored to applications' diverse system requirements of FL training. FedTuning is lightweight and flexible, achieving an average of 41% improvement for different training preferences on time, computation, and communication compared to fixed FL hyper-parameters.  "}}
