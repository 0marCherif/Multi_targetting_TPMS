Although existing works have gained much success with both statistical and neural-based solutions, little is known about the human decision process while performing this kind of complex cognitive task. Considering recent advances in human-inspired model design for NLP tasks, it is necessary to investigate the human reading and judging behavior in sentiment classification and adopt these findings to reconsider the sentiment analysis problem. In this paper, we carefully design a lab-based user study in which users\u2019 fine-grained reading behaviors during microblog sentiment classification are recorded with an eye-track device. Through systematic analysis of the collected data, we look into the differences between human and machine attention distributions and the differences in human attention while performing different tasks. We find that (1) sentiment judgment is more like an auxiliary task of content comprehension for humans. (2) people have different reading behavior patterns while reading microblog posts with varying labels of sentiment. Based on these findings, we build a human behavior-inspired sentiment prediction model for microblog posts. Experiment results on public-available benchmarks show that the proposed classification model outperforms existing solutions over 2.13% in terms of macro F1-score by introducing behavior features. Our findings may bring insight into the research of designing more effective and explainable sentiment analysis methods."}}

However, little is known about what happens in human brain during reading comprehension and how these cognitive activities can affect information retrieval process. Additionally, with the advances in brain imaging techniques such as electroencephalogram (EEG), it is possible to collect brain signals in almost real time and explore whether it can be utilized as feedback to facilitate information acquisition performance. In this paper, we carefully design a lab-based user study to investigate brain activities during reading comprehension. Our findings show that neural responses vary with different types of reading contents, i.e., contents that can satisfy users\u2019 information needs and contents that cannot. We suggest that various cognitive activities, e.g., cognitive loading, semantic-thematic understanding, and inferential processing, underpin these neural responses at the micro-time scale during reading comprehension. From these findings, we illustrate several insights for information retrieval tasks, such as ranking models construction and interface design. Besides, with the emerging of portable EEG-based applications, we suggest the possibility of detecting reading comprehension status for a proactive real-world system. To this end, we propose a Unified framework for EEG-based Reading Comprehension Modeling\u00a0(UERCM). To verify its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments based on EEG features for two reading comprehension tasks: answer sentence classification and answer extraction. Results show that it is feasible to improve the performance of two tasks with brain signals. These findings imply that brain signals are valuable feedback for enhancing human-computer interactions during reading comprehension."}}

During this procedure, modeling users' satisfaction status plays an essential part in improving their experiences with the systems. In this paper, we aim to explore the benefits of using Electroencephalography (EEG) signals for satisfaction modeling in interactive information access system design. Different from existing EEG classification tasks, the arisen of satisfaction involves multiple brain functions, such as arousal, prototypicality, and appraisals, which are related to different brain topographical areas. Thus modeling user satisfaction raises great challenges to existing solutions. To address this challenge, we propose BTA, a Brain Topography Adaptive network with a multi-centrality encoding module and a spatial attention mechanism module to capture cognitive connectives in different spatial distances. We explore the effectiveness of BTA for satisfaction modeling in two popular information access scenarios, i.e., search and recommendation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of introducing brain topography adaptive strategy in satisfaction modeling. Furthermore, we also conduct search result re-ranking task and video rating prediction task based on the satisfaction inferred from brain signals on search and recommendation scenarios, respectively. Experimental results show that brain signals extracted with BTA help improve the performance of interactive information access systems significantly."}}

Traditionally, click is usually treated as a positive implicit feedback signal of relevance or usefulness, while non-click is regarded as a signal of irrelevance or uselessness. However, there are many cases where users satisfy their information need with the contents shown on the Search Engine Result Page (SERP). This raises the problem of measuring the usefulness of non-click results and modeling user satisfaction in such circumstances. For a long period, understanding non-click results is challenging owing to the lack of user interactions. In recent years, the rapid development of neuroimaging technologies constitutes a paradigm shift in various industries, e.g., search, entertainment, and education. Therefore, we benefit from these technologies and apply them to bridge the gap between the human mind and the external search system in non-click situations. To this end, we analyze the differences in brain signals between the examination of non-click search results in different usefulness levels. Inspired by these findings, we conduct supervised learning tasks to estimate the usefulness of non-click results with brain signals and conventional information (i.e., content and context factors). Furthermore, we devise two re-ranking methods, i.e., a Personalized Method (PM) and a Generalized Intent modeling Method (GIM), for search result re-ranking with the estimated usefulness. Results show that it is feasible to utilize brain signals to improve usefulness estimation performance and enhance human-computer interactions by search result re-ranking."}}

With the maturity of the Brain-Machine Interface(BMI), we build an efficient and effective communication system between human beings and search engines based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, called Brain Machine Search Interface (BMSI)system. The BMSI system provides functions including query reformulation and search result interaction. In our system, users can perform search tasks without having to use the mouse and keyboard. Therefore, it is useful for application scenarios in which hand-based interactions are infeasible, e.g, for users with severe neuromuscular disorders. Besides, based on brain signals decoding, our system can provide abundant and valuable user-side context information (e.g., real-time satisfaction feedback, extensive context information, and a clearer description of information needs) to the search engine, which is hard to capture in the previous paradigm. In our implementation, the system can decode user satisfaction from brain signals in real-time during the interaction process and re-rank the search results list based on user satisfaction feedback.The demo video is available at http://www.thuir.cn/group/YQLiu/videos/BMSISystem.html"}}

Traditionally, click is usually treated as a positive implicit feedback signal of relevance or usefulness, while non-click (especially non-click after examination) is regarded as a signal of irrelevance or uselessness. However, there are many cases where users do not click on any search results but still satisfy their information need with the contents of the results shown on the Search Engine Result Page (SERP). This raises the problem of measuring result usefulness and modeling user satisfaction in \"Zero-click\" search scenarios. Previous works have solved this issue by (1) detecting user satisfaction for abandoned SERP with context information and (2) considering result-level click necessity with external assessors' annotations. However, few works have investigated the reason behind non-click behavior and estimated the usefulness of non-click results. A challenge for this research question is how to collect valuable feedback for non-click results. With neuroimaging technologies, we design a lab-based user study and reveal differences in brain signals while examining non-click search results with different usefulness levels. The findings in significant brain regions and electroencephalogram~(EEG) spectrum also suggest that the process of usefulness judgment might involve similar cognitive functions of relevance perception and satisfaction decoding.
