Through this competition, we aimed to promote the development of algorithms that use human feedback as channels to learn the desired behavior. We describe the competition and provide an overview of the top solutions. We conclude by discussing the impact of the competition and future directions for improvement."}}

Both traditional software-based methods and statistical systems have been successful in protecting against cheating, but recent advances in the automatic generation of content, such as images or speech, threaten the video game industry; they could be used to generate artificial gameplay indistinguishable from that of legitimate human players. To better understand this threat, we begin by reviewing the current state of multiplayer video game cheating, and then proceed to build a proof-of-concept method, GAN-Aimbot. By gathering data from various players in a first-person shooter game we show that the method improves players' performance while remaining hidden from automatic and manual protection mechanisms. By sharing this work we hope to raise awareness on this issue and encourage further research into protecting the gaming communities."}}

It is a known fact that a speaker recognition model doesn\u2019t always benefit from pseudo labels due to their unreliability. In this work, we observe that a speaker recognition network tends to model the data with reliable labels faster than those with unreliable labels. This motivates us to study a loss-gated learning (LGL) strategy, which extracts the reliable labels through the fitting ability of the neural network during training. With the proposed LGL, our speaker recognition model obtains a 46.3% performance gain over the system without it. Further, the proposed self-supervised speaker recognition with LGL trained on the VoxCeleb2 dataset without any labels achieves an equal error rate of 1.66% on the VoxCeleb1 original test set."}}

Such method follows the supervised learning paradigm and it strongly depends on the distribution of the data. In our paper, we show how combining behavioural cloning with human-in-the-loop training solves some of its flaws and provides an agent task-specific corrections to overcome tricky situations while speeding up the training time and lowering the required resources. To do this, we introduce a novel approach that allows an expert to take control of the agent at any moment during a simulation and provide optimal solutions to its problematic situations. Our experiments show that this approach leads to better policies both in terms of quantitative evaluation and in human-likeliness."}}

Existing methods narrow the issues to the rate-distortion trade-off between compression and reconstruction. We argue that a good reconstruction model does learn high capacity latents that encode more details, however, its use is hindered by two major issues: the prior is random noise which is completely detached from the posterior and allow no controllability in the generation; mean-field variational inference doesn't enforce hierarchy structure which makes the task of recombining those units into plausible novel output infeasible. As a result, we develop a system that learns a hierarchy of disentangled representation together with a mechanism for recombining the learned representation for generalization. This is achieved by introducing a minimal amount of inductive bias to learn controllable prior for the VAE. The idea is supported by here developed transitive information theory, that is, the mutual information between two target variables could alternately be maximized through the mutual information to the third variable, thus bypassing the rate-distortion bottleneck in VAE design. In particular, we show that our model, named SemafoVAE (inspired by the similar concept in computer science), could generate high-quality examples in a controllable manner, perform smooth traversals of the disentangled factors and intervention at a different level of representation hierarchy."}}

The speaker encoder is trained to extract a fixed-size speaker embedding from a spoken utterance of various length. Contrastive learning is a typical self-supervised learning technique. However, the quality of the speaker encoder depends very much on the sampling strategy of positive and negative pairs. It is common that we sample a positive pair of segments from the same utterance. Unfortunately, such poor-man's positive pairs (PPP) lack necessary diversity for the training of a robust encoder. In this work, we propose a multi-modal contrastive learning technique with novel sampling strategies. By cross-referencing between speech and face data, we study a method that finds diverse positive pairs (DPP) for contrastive learning, thus improving the robustness of the speaker encoder. We train the speaker encoder on the VoxCeleb2 dataset without any speaker labels, and achieve an equal error rate (EER) of 2.89\\%, 3.17\\% and 6.27\\% under the proposed progressive clustering strategy, and an EER of 1.44\\%, 1.77\\% and 3.27\\% under the two-stage learning strategy with pseudo labels, on the three test sets of VoxCeleb1. This novel solution outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods by a large margin, at the same time, achieves comparable results with the supervised learning counterpart. We also evaluate our self-supervised learning technique on LRS2 and LRW datasets, where the speaker information is unknown. All experiments suggest that the proposed neural architecture and sampling strategies are robust across datasets."}}
