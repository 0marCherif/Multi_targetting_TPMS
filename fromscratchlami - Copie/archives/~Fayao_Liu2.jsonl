Although significant advances have been made by deep neural networks, the performance is far from satisfactory as only per-point translational motion is considered, neglecting the constraints of the rigid motion in local regions. To address the issue, we propose to introduce the motion consistency to force the smoothness among neighboring points. In addition, constraints on the rigidity of the local transformation are also added by sharing unique rigid motion parameters for all points within each local region. To this end, a high-order CRFs based relation module (Con-HCRFs) is deployed to explore both point-wise smoothness and region-wise rigidity. To empower the CRFs to have a discriminative unary term, we also introduce a position-aware flow estimation module to be incorporated into the Con-HCRFs. Comprehensive experiments on FlyingThings3D and KITTI show that our proposed framework (HCRF-Flow) achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms previous approaches substantially."}}

Previous long-tailed recognition methods commonly focus on data augmentation of tailed classes or re-balancing strategy to give more attention to tailed classes during training. However, due to the limited training images for tailed classes, the diversity of augmented images are still restricted, which results in poor feature representations.  In this work, we argue that there are common latent features between the head and tailed classes that can be used to give better feature representation. We propose to learn a set of semantic and class-agnostic latent features shared by the head and tailed classes. Then, we implicitly enrich the training sample diversity via leveraging semantic data augmentation for the commonality features. We evaluate our methods on several popular long-tailed datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance consistently."}}

It aims to transfer the pose of a source mesh to a target mesh and keep the identity (e.g., body shape) of the target mesh. Some previous works require key point annotations to build reliable correspondence between the source and target meshes, while other methods do not consider any shape correspondence between sources and targets, which leads to limited generation quality. In this work, we propose a correspondence-refinement network to achieve the 3D pose transfer for both human and animal meshes. The correspondence between source and target meshes is first established by solving an optimal transport problem. Then, we warp the source mesh according to the dense correspondence and obtain a coarse warped mesh. The warped mesh will be better refined with our proposed Elastic Instance Normalization, which is a conditional normalization layer and can help to generate high-quality meshes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed architecture can effectively transfer the poses from source to target meshes and produce better results with satisfied visual performance than state-of-the-art methods."}}

In this paper, we first investigate the deficiency of the existing curve detection methods and then propose a novel Conditional Spatial Expansion (CSE) mechanism to improve the performance of curve detection. Instead of regarding the curve text detection as a polygon regression or a segmentation problem, we formulate it as a sequence prediction on the spatial domain. CSE starts with a seed arbitrarily chosen within a text region and progressively merges neighborhood regions based on the extracted local features by a CNN and contextual information of merged regions. The CSE is highly parameterized and can be seamlessly integrated into existing object detection frameworks. Enhanced by the data-dependent CSE mechanism, our curve text detection system provides robust instance-level text region extraction with minimal post-processing. The analysis experiment shows that our CSE can handle texts with various shapes, sizes, and orientations, and can effectively suppress the false-positives coming from text-like textures or unexpected texts included in the same RoI. Compared with the existing curve text detection algorithms, our method is more robust and enjoys a simpler processing flow. It also creates a new state-of-art performance on curve text benchmarks with F-measurement of up to 78.4%."}}

However, data labeling for pixel-wise segmentation is tedious and costly. Moreover, a trained model can only make predictions within a set of pre-defined classes. In this paper, we present CANet, a class-agnostic segmentation network that performs few-shot segmentation on new classes with only a few annotated images available. Our network consists of a two-branch dense comparison module which performs multi-level feature comparison between the support image and the query image, and an iterative optimization module which iteratively refines the predicted results. Furthermore, we introduce an attention mechanism to effectively fuse information from multiple support examples under the setting of k-shot learning. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 show that our method achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union score of 55.4% for 1-shot segmentation and 57.1% for 5-shot segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin of 14.6% and 13.2%, respectively."}}

Hashing has proven a valuable tool for large-scale information retrieval. We propose a column generation based binary code learning framework for data-dependent hash function learning. Given a set of triplets that encode the pairwise similarity comparison information, our column generation based method learns hash functions that preserve the relative comparison relations within the large-margin learning framework. Our method iteratively learns the best hash functions during the column generation procedure. Existing hashing methods optimize over simple objectives such as the reconstruction error or graph Laplacian related loss functions, instead of the performance evaluation criteria of interest\u2014multivariate performance measures such as the AUC and NDCG. Our column generation based method can be further generalized from the triplet loss to a general structured learning based framework that allows one to directly optimize multivariate performance measures. For optimizing general ranking measures, the resulting optimization problem can involve exponentially or infinitely many variables and constraints, which is more challenging than standard structured output learning. We use a combination of column generation and cutting-plane techniques to solve the optimization problem. To speed-up the training we further explore stage-wise training and propose to optimize a simplified NDCG loss for efficient inference. We demonstrate the generality of our method by applying it to ranking prediction and image retrieval, and show that it outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing methods."}}

Compared with depth estimation using multiple images such as stereo depth perception, depth from monocular images is much more challenging. Prior work typically focuses on exploiting geometric priors or additional sources of information, most using hand-crafted features. Recently, there is mounting evidence that features from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) set new records for various vision applications. On the other hand, considering the continuous characteristic of the depth values, depth estimation can be naturally formulated as a continuous conditional random field (CRF) learning problem. Therefore, here we present a deep convolutional neural field model for estimating depths from single monocular images, aiming to jointly explore the capacity of deep CNN and continuous CRF. In particular, we propose a deep structured learning scheme which learns the unary and pairwise potentials of continuous CRF in a unified deep CNN framework. We then further propose an equally effective model based on fully convolutional networks and a novel superpixel pooling method, which is about 10 times faster, to speedup the patch-wise convolutions in the deep model. With this more efficient model, we are able to design deeper networks to pursue better performance. Our proposed method can be used for depth estimation of general scenes with no geometric priors nor any extra information injected. In our case, the integral of the partition function can be calculated in a closed form such that we can exactly solve the log-likelihood maximization. Moreover, solving the inference problem for predicting depths of a test image is highly efficient as closed-form solutions exist. Experiments on both indoor and outdoor scene datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art depth estimation approaches."}}

The current state of the art approaches to this challenge either deal with only one of these two problems; for example FAB-MAP (viewpoint invariance) or SeqSLAM (appearance-invariance), or use extensive training within the test environment, an impractical requirement in many application scenarios. In this paper we significantly improve the viewpoint invariance of the SeqSLAM algorithm by using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to generate synthetic viewpoints. Our approach is different to other deep learning approaches in that it does not rely on the ability of the CNN network to learn invariant features, but only to produce\u201cgood enough\u201d depth images from day-time imagery only. We evaluate the system on a new multi-lane day-night car dataset specifically gathered to simultaneously test both appearance and viewpoint change. Results demonstrate that the use of synthetic viewpoints improves the maximum recall achieved at 100% precision by a factor of 2.2 and maximum recall by a factor of 2.7, enabling correct place recognition across multiple road lanes and significantly reducing the time between correct localizations."}}
