Our architecture is an integration of a graph-constrained relational GAN and a conditional GAN, where a previously generated layout becomes the next input constraint, enabling iterative refinement. A surprising discovery of our research is that a simple non-iterative training process, dubbed component-wise GT-conditioning, is effective in learning such a generator. The iterative generator further allows us to improve a metric of choice via meta-optimization techniques by controlling when to pass which input constraints during iterative refinement. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluation based on the three standard metrics demonstrate that the proposed system makes significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art, even competitive against the ground-truth floorplans, designed by professional architects.

This is an exciting and unexplored area of indoor localization research, where we present a rich dataset with 53 hours of inertial sensor data and the associated ground truth locations. We developed a solution, dubbed neural inertial localization (NILoc) which 1) uses a neural inertial navigation technique to turn inertial sensor history to a sequence of velocity vectors; then 2) employs a transformer-based neural architecture to find the device location from the sequence of velocities. We only use an IMU sensor, which is energy efficient and privacy preserving compared to WiFi, cameras, and other data sources. Our approach is significantly faster and achieves competitive results even compared with state-of-the-art methods that require a floorplan and run 20 to 30 times slower. We share our code, model and data at https://sachini.github.io/niloc."}}

Given smartphone sensor data through day-to-day activities from a single user over a month, our WiFi SfM algorithm estimates smartphone motion tra-jectories and the structure of the environment represented as a WiFi radio map. The approach 1) establishes frame-to-frame correspondences based on WiFi fingerprints while exploiting our repetitive behavior patterns; 2) aligns trajectories via bundle adjustment; and 3) trains a self-supervised neural network to extract further motion constraints. We have col-lected 235 hours of smartphone data, spanning 38 days of daily activities in a university campus. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over the competing methods with qualitative evaluations of the estimated motions and quantitative evaluations of indoor localization accuracy based on the reconstructed WiFi radio map. The WiFi SfM technology will potentially allow digital mapping companies to build better radio maps automatically by asking users to share WiFi/IMU sensor data in their daily activities."}}
