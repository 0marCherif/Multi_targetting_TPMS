Despite a large number of existing works, solving the data association problem in any MC-MOT pipeline is arguably one of the most challenging tasks. Developing a robust MC-MOT system, however, is still highly challenging due to many practical issues such as inconsistent lighting conditions, varying object movement patterns, or the trajectory occlusions of the objects between the cameras. To address these problems, this work, therefore, proposes a new Dynamic Graph Model with Link Prediction (DyGLIP) approach to solve the data association task. Compared to existing methods, our new model offers several advantages, including better feature representations and the ability to recover from lost tracks during camera transitions. Moreover, our model works gracefully regardless of the overlapping ratios between the cameras. Experimental results show that we outperform existing MC-MOT algorithms by a large margin on several practical datasets. Notably, our model works favorably on online settings but can be extended to an incremental approach for large-scale datasets."}}

However, such systems are built on GPU platforms and mostly deploy heavy deep network architectures. Given a high-performance heavy network as a teacher, this work presents a simple and elegant teacher-student learning paradigm, namely ShrinkTeaNet, to train a portable student network that has significantly fewer parameters and competitive accuracy against the teacher network. Far apart from prior teacher-student frameworks mainly focusing on accuracy and compression ratios in closed-set problems, our proposed teacher-student network is proved to be more robust against open-set problem, i.e. large-scale face recognition. In addition, this work introduces a novel Angular Distillation Loss for distilling the feature direction and the sam- ple distributions of the teacher\u2019s hypersphere to its student. Then ShrinkTeaNet framework can efficiently guide the student\u2019s learning process with the teacher\u2019s knowledge presented in both intermediate and last stages of the feature embedding. Evaluations on LFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB, IJB-B and IJB-C Janus, and MegaFace with one million distractors have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed approach to learn robust student networks which have satisfying accuracy and compact sizes. Our ShrinkTeaNet is able to support the light-weight architecture achieving high performance with 99.77% on LFW and 95.64% on large-scale Megaface protocols."}}

AAM models have ability to represent face images through synthesis using a controllable parameterized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model. However, the accuracy and robustness of the synthesized faces of AAMs are highly depended on the training sets and inherently on the generalizability of PCA subspaces. This paper presents a novel Deep Appearance Models (DAMs) approach, an efficient replacement for AAMs, to accurately capture both shape and texture of face images under large variations. In this approach, three crucial components represented in hierarchical layers are modeled using the Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM) to robustly capture the variations of facial shapes and appearances. DAMs are therefore superior to AAMs in inferencing a representation for new face images under various challenging conditions. The proposed approach is evaluated in various applications to demonstrate its robustness and capabilities, i.e. facial super-resolution reconstruction, facial off-angle reconstruction or face frontalization, facial occlusion removal and age estimation using challenging face databases, i.e. Labeled Face Parts in the Wild, Helen and FG-NET. Comparing to AAMs and other deep learning based approaches, the proposed DAMs achieve competitive results in those applications, thus this showed their advantages in handling occlusions, facial representation, and reconstruction."}}

The proposed method models facial structures and the longitudinal face-aging process of given subjects coherently across video frames. The approach is optimized using a long-term reward, Reinforcement Learning function with deep feature extraction from Deep Convolutional Neural Network. Unlike previous age-progression methods that are only able to synthesize an aged likeness of a face from a single input image, the proposed approach is capable of age-progressing facial likenesses in videos with consistently synthesized facial features across frames. In addition, the deep reinforcement learning method guarantees preservation of the visual identity of input faces after age-progression. Results on videos of our new collected aging face AGFW-v2 database demonstrate the advantages of the proposed solution in terms of both quality of age-progressed faces, temporal smoothness, and cross-age face verification."}}

The proposed SDAP is optimized using tractable log-likelihood objective functions with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based deep feature extraction. Instead of applying a fixed aging development path for all input faces and subjects, SDAP is able to provide the most appropriate aging development path for individual subject that optimizes the reward aging formulation. Unlike previous methods that can take only one image as the input, SDAP further allows multiple images as inputs, i.e. all information of a subject at either the same or different ages, to produce the optimal aging path for the given subject. Finally, SDAP allows efficiently synthesizing in-the-wild aging faces. The proposed model is experimented in both tasks of face aging synthesis and cross-age face verification. The experimental results consistently show SDAP achieves the state-of-the-art performance on numerous face aging databases, i.e. FG-NET, MORPH, aging faces in the wild (AGFW), and cross-age celebrity dataset (CACD). Furthermore, we also evaluate the performance of SDAP on large-scale Megaface challenge to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed solution."}}

In order to efficiently address the problem, this work first decomposes the aging process into multiple short-term stages. Then, a novel generative probabilistic model, named Temporal Non-Volume Preserving (TNVP) transformation, is presented to model the facial aging process at each stage. Unlike Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which requires an empirical balance threshold, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), an intractable model, our proposed TNVP approach guarantees a tractable density function, exact inference and evaluation for embedding the feature transformations between faces in consecutive stages. Our model shows its advantages not only in capturing the non-linear age related variance in each stage but also producing a smooth synthesis in age progression across faces. Our approach can model any face in the wild provided with only four basic landmark points. Moreover, the structure can be transformed into a deep convolutional network while keeping the advantages of probabilistic models with tractable log-likelihood density estimation. Our method is evaluated in both terms of synthesizing age-progressed faces and cross-age face verification and consistently shows the state-of-the-art results in various face aging databases, i.e. FG-NET, MORPH, AginG Faces in the Wild (AGFW), and Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD).

This work presents a novel approach named Multiple Scale Region-based Fully Convolutional Networks (MSRFCN) to robustly detect and classify human hand regions under various challenging conditions, e.g. occlusions, illumination, low-resolutions. In this approach, the whole image is passed through the proposed fully convolutional network to compute score maps. Those score maps with their position-sensitive properties can help to efficiently address a dilemma between translation-invariance in classification and detection. The method is evaluated on the challenging hand databases, i.e. the Vision for Intelligent Vehicles and Applications (VIVA) Challenge, Oxford hand dataset and compared against various recent hand detection methods. The experimental results show that our proposed MS-FRCN approach consistently achieves the state-of-the-art hand detection results, i.e. Average Precision (AP)/Average Recall (AR) of 95.1%/94.5% at level 1 and 86.0% / 83.4% at level 2, on the VIVA challenge. In addition, the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results for left/right hand and driver/passenger classification tasks on the VIVA database with a significant improvement on AP/AR of ~7% and ~13% for both classification tasks, respectively.

This paper presents a deep model approach for face age progression that can efficiently capture the non-linear aging process and automatically synthesize a series of age-progressed faces in various age ranges. In this approach, we first decompose the long-term age progress into a sequence of short-term changes and model it as a face sequence. The Temporal Deep Restricted Boltzmann Machines based age progression model together with the prototype faces are then constructed to learn the aging transformation between faces in the sequence. In addition, to enhance the wrinkles of faces in the later age ranges, the wrinkle models are further constructed using Restricted Boltzmann Machines to capture their variations in different facial regions. The geometry constraints are also taken into account in the last step for more consistent age-progressed results. The proposed approach is evaluated using various face aging databases, i.e. FGNET, Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD) and MORPH, and our collected large-scale aging database named AginG Faces in the Wild (AGFW). In addition, when ground-truth age is not available for input image, our proposed system is able to automatically estimate the age of the input face before aging process is employed."}}
