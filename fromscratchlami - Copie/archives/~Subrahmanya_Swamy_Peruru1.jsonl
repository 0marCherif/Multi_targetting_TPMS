In particular, we consider a generalized interference model called the k-tolerant conflict graph model and design an efficient approximation for the well-known Max-Weight scheduling algorithm. A notable feature of this work is that the proposed method do not require labelled data set (NP-hard to compute) for training the neural network. Instead, we design a loss function that utilises the existing greedy approaches and trains a GCN that improves the performance of greedy approaches. Our extensive numerical experiments illustrate that using our GCN approach, we can significantly (4\u201320%) improve the performance of the conventional greedy approach."}}

Our algorithms resolve collisions among pairs of conflicting nodes by assigning a master-slave hierarchy. When the master-slave hierarchy is chosen randomly, our algorithm matches the throughput performance of the maximal scheduling policies, with a complexity and delay that do not scale with network size. When the master-slave hierarchy is chosen based on the network topology, the throughput performance of our algorithm is characterized by a parameter of the conflict graph called the master-interference degree. For commonly used conflict graph topologies, our results lead to the best known throughput guarantees among the algorithms that have O(1) delay and complexity. Numerical results indicate that our algorithms out-perform the existing O(1) complexity algorithms like Q-CSMA."}}

However, the problem of computing these fugacities is NP-hard. In this work, we derive estimates of the fugacities by using a framework called the regional free energy approximations. In particular, we derive explicit expressions for approximate fugacities corresponding to any feasible service rate vector. We further prove that our approximate fugacities are exact for the class of chordal graphs. A distinguishing feature of our work is that the regional approximations that we propose are tailored to conflict graphs with small cycles, which is a typical characteristic of wireless networks. Numerical results indicate that the fugacities obtained by the proposed method are quite accurate and significantly outperform the existing Bethe approximation based techniques."}}
