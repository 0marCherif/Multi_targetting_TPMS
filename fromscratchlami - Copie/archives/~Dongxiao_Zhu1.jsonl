In each epoch, the true gradient of the loss function is estimated using a mini-batch sampled from the training set and model parameters are then updated with the mini-batch gradients. Although the latter provides an unbiased estimation of the former, they are subject to substantial variances derived from the size and number of sampled mini-batches, leading to noisy and jumpy updates. To stabilize such undesirable variance in estimating the true gradients, we propose In-Training Representation Alignment (ITRA) that explicitly aligns feature distributions of two different mini-batches with a matching loss in the SGD training process. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the desirable effects of the matching loss on feature representation learning: (1) extracting compact feature representation; (2) reducing over-adaption on mini-batches via an adaptively weighting mechanism; and (3) accommodating to multi-modalities. Finally, we conduct large-scale experiments on both image and text classifications to demonstrate its superior performance to the strong baselines."}}

However, the interpretability of ViTs has not kept pace with their promising performance. While there has been a surge of interest in developing {\\it post hoc} solutions to explain ViTs' outputs, these methods do not generalize to different downstream tasks and various transformer architectures. Furthermore, if ViTs are not properly trained with the given data and do not prioritize the region of interest, the {\\it post hoc} methods would be less effective. Instead of developing another {\\it post hoc} approach, we introduce a novel training procedure that inherently enhances model interpretability. Our interpretability-aware ViT (IA-ViT) draws inspiration from a fresh insight: both the class patch and image patches consistently generate predicted distributions and attention maps. IA-ViT is composed of a feature extractor, a predictor, and an interpreter, which are trained jointly with an interpretability-aware training objective. Consequently, the interpreter simulates the behavior of the predictor and provides a faithful explanation through its single-head self-attention mechanism. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IA-ViT in several image classification tasks, with both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of model performance and interpretability.

Additionally, we design an auxiliary boundary-induced label regression task coupled with the main prostate segmentation task to address the unclear boundary issue in CT images. We demonstrate that this design significantly improves the quality of the CT-based prostate segmentation task over other competing methods, resulting in substantially improved performance, i.e., higher Dice Similarity Coefficient, lower Hausdorff Distance, and Average Symmetric Surface Distance, on both private and public CT image datasets.

Trustworthy AI entails the intentional design to ensure equity and mitigate potential biases. To advance trustworthy AI in global health, we convened a workshop on Fairness in Machine Intelligence for Global Health (FairMI4GH). The event brought together a global mix of experts from various disciplines, community health practitioners, policymakers, and more. Topics covered included managing AI bias in socio-technical systems, AI's potential impacts on global health, and balancing data privacy with transparency. Panel discussions examined the cultural, political, and ethical dimensions of AI in global health. FairMI4GH aimed to stimulate dialogue, facilitate knowledge transfer, and spark innovative solutions. Drawing from NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, it provided suggestions for handling AI risks and biases. The need to mitigate data biases from the research design stage, adopt a human-centered approach, and advocate for AI transparency was recognized. Challenges such as updating legal frameworks, managing cross-border data sharing, and motivating developers to reduce bias were acknowledged. The event emphasized the necessity of diverse viewpoints and multi-dimensional dialogue for creating a fair and ethical AI framework for equitable global health."}}

However, recent studies have indicated that SAM exhibits subpar performance on 3D medical image segmentation tasks. In addition to the domain gaps between natural and medical images, disparities in the spatial arrangement between 2D and 3D images, the substantial computational burden imposed by powerful GPU servers, and the time-consuming manual prompt generation impede the extension of SAM to a broader spectrum of medical image segmentation applications. To address these challenges, in this work, we introduce a novel method, AutoSAM Adapter, designed specifically for 3D multi-organ CT-based segmentation. We employ parameter-efficient adaptation techniques in developing an automatic prompt learning paradigm to facilitate the transformation of the SAM model's capabilities to 3D medical image segmentation, eliminating the need for manually generated prompts. Furthermore, we effectively transfer the acquired knowledge of the AutoSAM Adapter to other lightweight models specifically tailored for 3D medical image analysis, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on medical image segmentation tasks. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the AutoSAM Adapter as a critical foundation for effectively leveraging the emerging ability of foundation models in 2D natural image segmentation for 3D medical image segmentation."}}

However, the success of the Transformer model has not yet been duly explained. Current explanation techniques, which dissect either the self-attention mechanism or gradient-based attribution, do not necessarily provide a faithful explanation of the inner workings of Transformers due to the following reasons: first, attention weights alone without considering the magnitudes of feature values are not adequate to reveal the self-attention mechanism; second, whereas most Transformer explanation techniques utilize self-attention module, the skip-connection module, contributing a significant portion of information flows in Transformers, has not yet been sufficiently exploited in explanation; third, the gradient-based attribution of individual feature does not incorporate interaction among features in explaining the model's output. In order to tackle the above problems, we propose a novel Transformer explanation technique via attentive class activation tokens, aka, AttCAT, leveraging encoded features, their gradients, and their attention weights to generate a faithful and confident explanation for Transformer's output. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of AttCAT, which generalizes well to different Transformer architectures, evaluation metrics, datasets, and tasks, to the baseline methods.

The problem is particularly salient in medical imaging based diagnosis system that appears to be accurate but fails when tested in new hospitals/datasets. Recent studies indicate the system might learn shortcut and non-relevant features instead of generalizable features, so-called good features. We hypothesize that adversarial training can eliminate shortcut features whereas saliency guided training can filter out non-relevant features; both are nuisance features accounting for the performance degradation on OOD test sets. With that, we formulate a novel model training scheme for the deep neural network to learn good features for classification and/or detection tasks ensuring a consistent generalization performance on OOD test sets. The experimental results qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the superior performance of our method using the benchmark CXR image data sets on classification tasks."}}
