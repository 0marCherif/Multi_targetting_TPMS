Despite significant progress in multimodal architecture design, the field lacks comprehensive regularization methods. This paper introduces PowMix, a versatile embedding space regularizer that builds upon the strengths of unimodal mixing-based regularization approaches and introduces novel algorithmic components that are specifically tailored to multimodal tasks. PowMix is integrated before the fusion stage of multimodal architectures and facilitates intra-modal mixing, such as mixing text with text, to act as a regularizer. PowMix consists of five components: 1) a varying number of generated mixed examples, 2) mixing factor reweighting, 3) anisotropic mixing, 4) dynamic mixing, and 5) cross-modal label mixing. Extensive experimentation across benchmark MSA datasets and a broad spectrum of diverse architectural designs demonstrate the efficacy of PowMix, as evidenced by consistent performance improvements over baselines and existing mixing methods. An in-depth ablation study highlights the critical contribution of each PowMix component and how they synergistically enhance performance. Furthermore, algorithmic analysis demonstrates how PowMix behaves in different scenarios, particularly comparing early versus late fusion architectures. Notably, PowMix enhances overall performance without sacrificing model robustness or magnifying text dominance. It also retains its strong performance in situations of limited data. Our findings position PowMix as a promising versatile regularization strategy for MSA. Code will be made available."}}

By contrast, masking-based methods optimize a saliency map directly in the image space or learn it by training another network on additional data. In this work we introduce Opti-CAM, combining ideas from CAM-based and masking-based approaches. Our saliency map is a linear combination of feature maps, where weights are optimized per image such that the logit of the masked image for a given class is maximized. We also fix a fundamental flaw in two of the most common evaluation metrics of attribution methods. On several datasets, Opti-CAM largely outperforms other CAM-based approaches according to the most relevant classification metrics. We provide empirical evidence supporting that localization and classifier interpretability are not necessarily aligned."}}

Exploiting unlabeled data through the use of transductive inference methods such as label propagation has been shown to improve the performance of few-shot learning significantly. Label propagation infers pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by utilizing a constructed graph that exploits the underlying manifold structure of the data. However, a limitation of the existing label propagation approaches is that the positions of all data points are fixed and might be sub-optimal so that the algorithm is not as effective as possible. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm that adapts the feature embeddings of the labeled data by minimizing a differentiable loss function optimizing their positions in the manifold in the process. Our novel algorithm, Adaptive Anchor Label Propagation, outperforms the standard label propagation algorithm by as much as 7% and 2% in the 1-shot and 5-shot settings respectively. We provide experimental results highlighting the merits of our algorithm on four widely used few-shot benchmark datasets, namely miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CUB and CIFAR-FS and two commonly used backbones, ResNet12 and WideResNet-28-10.

However, the vast majority of such methods are evaluated on perfectly class-balanced benchmarks. It has been shown that they undergo remarkable drop in performance under a more realistic, imbalanced setting. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm to address imbalanced transductive few-shot learning, named Adaptive Manifold. Our method exploits the underlying manifold of the labeled support examples and unlabeled queries by using manifold similarity to predict the class probability distribution per query. It is parameterized by one centroid per class as well as a set of graph-specific parameters that determine the manifold. All parameters are optimized through a loss function that can be tuned towards class-balanced or imbalanced distributions. The manifold similarity shows substantial improvement over Euclidean distance, especially in the 1-shot setting. Our algorithm outperforms or is on par with other state of the art methods in three benchmark datasets, namely miniImageNet, tieredImageNet and CUB, and three different backbones, namely ResNet-18, WideResNet-28-10 and DenseNet-121. In certain cases, our algorithm outperforms the previous state of the art by as much as 4.2%."}}
