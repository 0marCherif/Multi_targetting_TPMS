On the other hand, deep multi-view stereo methods can quickly reconstruct scene geometry via direct network inference. Point-NeRF combines the advantages of these two approaches by using neural 3D point clouds, with associated neural features, to model a radiance field. Point-NeRF can be rendered efficiently by aggregating neural point features near scene surfaces, in a ray marching-based rendering pipeline. Moreover, Point-NeRF can be initialized via direct inference of a pre-trained deep network to produce a neural point cloud; this point cloud can be finetuned to surpass the visual quality of NeRF with 30X faster training time. Point-NeRF can be combined with other 3D reconstruction methods and handles the errors and outliers in such methods via a novel pruning and growing mechanism. The experiments on the DTU, the NeRF Synthetics , the ScanNet and the Tanks and Temples datasets demonstrate Point-NeRF can surpass the existing methods and achieve the state-of-the-art results."}}

This is an extremely challenging problem that requires modeling complex light transport, and disentangling HDR lighting from material and geometry with only a partial LDR observation of the scene. We tackle this problem using two novel components: 1) a holistic scene reconstruction method that estimates reflectance and parametric 3D lighting, and 2) a neural rendering framework that re-renders the scene from our predictions. We use physically-based light representations that allow for intuitive editing, and infer both visible and invisible light sources. Our neural rendering framework combines physically-based direct illumination and shadow rendering with deep networks to approximate global illumination. It can capture challenging lighting effects, such as soft shadows, directional lighting, specular materials, and interreflections. Previous single image inverse rendering methods usually entangle lighting and geometry and only support applications like object insertion. Instead, by combining parametric 3D lighting estimation with neural scene rendering, we demonstrate the first automatic method for full scene relighting from a single image, including light source insertion, removal, and replacement."}}

In contrast, classical 3D reconstruction methods can handle large-scale scenes but do not produce realistic renderings. We propose NeRFusion, a method that combines the advantages of NeRF and TSDF-based fusion techniques to achieve efficient large-scale reconstruction and photo-realistic rendering. We process the input image sequence to predict per-frame local radiance fields via direct network inference. These are then fused using a novel recurrent neural network that incrementally reconstructs a global, sparse scene representation in real-time at 22 fps. This global volume can be further fine-tuned to boost rendering quality.

Previous methods that perform 3D stylization on point clouds or meshes are sensitive to geometric reconstruction errors for complex real-world scenes. Instead, we propose to stylize the more robust radiance field representation. We find that the commonly used Gram matrix-based loss tends to produce blurry results without faithful brushstrokes, and introduce a nearest neighbor-based loss that is highly effective at capturing style details while maintaining multi-view consistency. We also propose a novel deferred back-propagation method to enable optimization of memory-intensive radiance fields using style losses defined on full-resolution rendered images. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our method outperforms baselines by generating artistic appearance that more closely resembles the style image.
