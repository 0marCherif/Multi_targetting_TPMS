Automated medical coding approaches have been developed using machine learning methods, such as deep neural networks. Nevertheless, automated medical coding is still challenging because of complex code association, noise in lengthy documents, and the imbalanced class problem. We propose a novel neural network, called the Multitask Balanced and Recalibrated Neural Network, to solve these issues. Significantly, the multitask learning scheme shares the relationship knowledge between different coding branches to capture code association. A recalibrated aggregation module is developed by cascading convolutional blocks to extract high-level semantic features that mitigate the impact of noise in documents. Also, the cascaded structure of the recalibrated module can benefit learning from lengthy notes. To solve the imbalanced class problem, we deploy focal loss to redistribute the attention on low- and high-frequency medical codes. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms competitive baselines on a real-world clinical dataset called the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III)."}}

Since image registration is in general an ill-defined problem, the usefulness of inductive biases of symmetricity, inverse consistency and topology preservation has been widely accepted by the research community. However, while many deep learning registration methods enforce these properties via loss functions, no prior deep learning registration method fulfills all of these properties by construct. Here, we propose a novel multi-resolution registration architecture which is by construct symmetric, inverse consistent, and topology preserving. We also develop an implicit layer for memory efficient inversion of the deformation fields. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art registration accuracy on two datasets."}}

Various texts such as biomedical literature, drug reviews, and user posts on social media and medical forums contain a wealth of information about ADEs. Recent studies have applied word embedding and deep learning -based natural language processing to automate ADE detection from text. However, they did not explore incorporating explicit medical knowledge about drugs and adverse reactions or the corresponding feature learning. This paper adopts the heterogenous text graph which describes relationships between documents, words and concepts, augments it with medical knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System, and proposes a concept-aware attention mechanism which learns features differently for the different types of nodes in the graph. We further utilize contextualized embeddings from pretrained language models and convolutional graph neural networks for effective feature representation and relational learning. Experiments on four public datasets show that our model achieves performance competitive to the recent advances and the concept-aware attention consistently outperforms other attention mechanisms."}}

Commonly, algorithms that predict interventional future outcome trajectories take a fixed sequence of future treatments as input. This excludes scenarios where the policy is unknown or a counterfactual analysis is needed. To handle these limitations, we develop a joint model for treatments and outcomes, which allows for the estimation of treatment policies and effects from sequential treatment--outcome data. It can answer interventional and counterfactual queries about interventions on treatment policies, as we show with a realistic semi-synthetic simulation study. This abstract is based on work that is currently under review (Anonymous)."}}

We introduce a simple and generally applicable fix to adjust for the confounder with covariate adjustment regression, which improves the ability of CKA and RSA to reveal functional similarity and also retains the intuitive invariance properties of the original similarity measures. We show that deconfounding the similarity metrics increases the resolution of detecting functionally similar neural networks across domains. Moreover, in real-world applications, deconfounding improves the consistency between CKA and domain similarity in transfer learning, and increases the correlation between CKA and model out-of-distribution accuracy similarity."}}

It builds a contextualized graph embedding model for adverse drug event detection. We employ different convolutional graph neural networks and pre-trained contextualized embeddings as the building blocks. Experimental results show that our methods can improve the performance by comparing recent ADE detection models, suggesting that a text graph can capture causal relationships and dependency between different entities in a document."}}

In addition, those works are either fragmented in content or only focus on specific techniques adopted in this area but neglect the holistic perspective of the entire technical routes. Hence, in this paper, we review from the perspective of researchers who try to take the first step on this topic. We review the recent representative works in the EEG-based emotion recognition research and provide a tutorial to guide the researchers to start from the beginning. The scientific basis of EEG-based emotion recognition in the psychological and physiological levels is introduced. Further, we categorize these reviewed works into different technical routes and illustrate the theoretical basis and the research motivation, which will help the readers better understand why those techniques are studied and employed. At last, existing challenges and future investigations are also discussed in this paper, which guides the researchers to decide potential future research directions."}}
