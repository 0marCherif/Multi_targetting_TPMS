In this work we investigate a core problem with the use of distributed workers in such systems. Further, we investigate the dramatic differences in performance between the popular Adam gradient descent algorithm and the simplest form of stochastic gradient descent. These investigations produce a stable, low-bandwidth learning algorithm that achieves 100\\% usage of all connected CPUs under typical conditions."}}

One shortcoming of these black-box methods is that they must collect information about the structure of the return function at every update, and can often employ only information drawn from a distribution centered around the current parameters. As a result, when these algorithms are distributed across many machines, a significant portion of total runtime may be spent with many machines idle, waiting for a final return and then for an update to be calculated. In this work we introduce a novel method to use older data in finite difference algorithms, which produces a scalable algorithm that avoids significant idle time or wasted computation."}}

We provide a reinterpretation of exploration which can be applied to any online learning method. We come to this definition by approaching exploration from a new direction. After finding that concepts of exploration created to solve simple Markov decision processes with Dynamic Programming are no longer broadly applicable, we reexamine exploration. Instead of extending the ends of dynamic exploration procedures, we extend their means. That is, rather than repeatedly sampling every state-action pair possible in a process, we define the act of modifying an agent to itself be explorative. The resulting definition of exploration can be applied in infinite problems and non-dynamic learning methods, which the dynamic notion of exploration cannot tolerate. To understand the way that modifications of an agent affect learning, we describe a novel structure on the set of agents: a collection of distances (see footnote 7) $d_{a} \\in A$, which represent the perspectives of each agent possible in the process. Using these distances, we define a topology and show that many important structures in Reinforcement Learning are well behaved under the topology induced by convergence in the agent space."}}

This paper proves that while the gradients are different, they converge as the dimension of the vector under optimization increases."}}
