In this work, we benchmark NMT between English and five African LRL pairs (Swahili, Amharic, Tigrigna, Oromo, Somali [SATOS]). We collected the available resources on the SATOS languages to evaluate the current state of NMT for LRLs. Our evaluation, comparing a baseline single language pair NMT model against semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and multilingual modeling, shows significant performance improvements both in the En-LRL and LRL-En directions. In terms of averaged BLEU score, the multilingual approach shows the largest gains, up to +5 points, in six out of ten translation directions. To demonstrate the generalization capability of each model, we also report results on multi-domain test sets. We release the standardized experimental data and the test sets for future works addressing the challenges of NMT in under-resourced settings, in particular for the SATOS languages."}}

Recently, adapting MNMT to a LRL has shown to greatly improve performance. In this work, we explore the problem of adapting an MNMT model to an unseen LRL using data selection and model adaptation. In order to improve NMT for LRL, we employ perplexity to select HRL data that are most similar to the LRL on the basis of language distance. We extensively explore data selection in popular multilingual NMT settings, namely in (zero-shot) translation, and in adaptation from a multilingual pre-trained model, for both directions (LRL-en). We further show that dynamic adaptation of the model's vocabulary results in a more favourable segmentation for the LRL in comparison with direct adaptation. Experiments show reductions in training time and significant performance gains over LRL baselines, even with zero LRL data (+13.0 BLEU), up to +17.0 BLEU for pre-trained multilingual model dynamic adaptation with related data selection. Our method outperforms current approaches, such as massively multilingual models and data augmentation, on four LRL."}}

However, NMT systems are limited in translating low-resourced languages, due to the significant amount of parallel data that is required to learn useful mappings between languages. In this work, we show how the so-called multilingual NMT can help to tackle the challenges associated with low-resourced language translation. The underlying principle of multilingual NMT is to force the creation of hidden representations of words in a shared semantic space across multiple languages, thus enabling a positive parameter transfer across languages. Along this direction, we present multilingual translation experiments with three languages (English, Italian, Romanian) covering six translation directions, utilizing both recurrent neural networks and transformer (or self-attentive) neural networks. We then focus on the zero-shot translation problem, that is how to leverage multi-lingual data in order to learn translation directions that are not covered by the available training material. To this aim, we introduce our recently proposed iterative self-training method, which incrementally improves a multilingual NMT on a zero-shot direction by just relying on monolingual data. Our results on TED talks data show that multilingual NMT outperforms conventional bilingual NMT, that the transformer NMT outperforms recurrent NMT, and that zero-shot NMT outperforms conventional pivoting methods and even matches the performance of a fully-trained bilingual system."}}

In particular, if translations have to fit some given layout, quality should not only be measured in terms of adequacy and fluency, but also length. Exemplary cases are the translation of document files, subtitles, and scripts for dubbing, where the output length should ideally be as close as possible to the length of the input text. This paper addresses for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the problem of controlling the output length in NMT. We investigate two methods for biasing the output length with a transformer architecture: i) conditioning the output to a given target-source length-ratio class and ii) enriching the transformer positional embedding with length information. Our experiments show that both methods can induce the network to generate shorter translations, as well as acquiring interpretable linguistic skills."}}

We investigate here a zero-shot translation in a particularly lowresource multilingual setting. We propose a simple iterative training procedure that leverages a duality of translations directly generated by the system for the zero-shot directions. The translations produced by the system (sub-optimal since they contain mixed language from the shared vocabulary), are then used together with the original parallel data to feed and iteratively re-train the multilingual network. Over time, this allows the system to learn from its own generated and increasingly better output. Our approach shows to be effective in improving the two zero-shot directions of our multilingual model. In particular, we observed gains of about 9 BLEU points over a baseline multilingual model and up to 2.08 BLEU over a pivoting mechanism using two bilingual models. Further analysis shows that there is also a slight improvement in the non-zero-shot language directions."}}

Our approach allows to extend an initial model for a given language pair to cover new languages by adapting its vocabulary as long as new data become available (i.e., introducing new vocabulary items if they are not included in the initial model). The parameter transfer mechanism is evaluated in two scenarios: i) to adapt a trained single language NMT system to work with a new language pair and ii) to continuously add new language pairs to grow to a multilingual NMT system. In both the scenarios our goal is to improve the translation performance, while minimizing the training convergence time. Preliminary experiments spanning five languages with different training data sizes (i.e., 5k and 50k parallel sentences) show a significant performance gain ranging from +3.85 up to +13.63 BLEU in different language directions. Moreover, when compared with training an NMT model from scratch, our transfer-learning approach allows us to reach higher performance after training up to 4% of the total training steps."}}
