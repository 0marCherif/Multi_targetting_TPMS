It helps achieve diverse and high-quality responses by selecting an answer from a small pool of generated candidates. The current state-of-the-art ranking methods mainly use an encoding paradigm called Cross-Encoder, which separately encodes each context-candidate pair and ranks the candidates according to their fitness scores. However, Cross-Encoder repeatedly encodes the same lengthy context for each candidate, resulting in high computational costs. Poly-Encoder addresses the above problems by reducing the interaction between context and candidates, but with a price of performance drop. In this work, we develop a new paradigm called Uni-Encoder, that keeps the full attention over each pair as in Cross-Encoder while only encoding the context once, as in Poly-Encoder. Uni-Encoder encodes all the candidates with the context in one forward pass. We use the same positional embedding for all candidates to ensure they are treated equally and design a new attention mechanism to avoid confusion. Our Uni-Encoder can simulate other ranking paradigms using different attention and response concatenation methods. Extensive experiments show that our proposed paradigm achieves new state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets with high computational efficiency. For instance, it improves R10@1 by 2.9% with an approximately 4X faster inference speed on the Ubuntu V2 dataset."}}

Attention mechanisms have recently proven to be successful in handling the aforementioned challenges to some degree. However previous designs fail to capture inherent inter-dependencies between the attended features; leading to restricted interactions between the attention blocks. In this paper, we propose a new attention module called Cross-Correlated Attention (CCA); which aims to overcome such limitations by maximizing the information gain between different attended regions. Moreover, we also propose a novel deep network that makes use of different attention mechanisms to learn robust and discriminative representations of person images. The resulting model is called the Cross-Correlated Attention Network (CCAN). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CCAN comfortably outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms by a tangible margin.\n\nModeling the inherent spatial relations between different attended regions within the deep architecture.

Due to the limited number of examples for training, the techniques developed for standard incremental learning cannot be applied verbatim to FSCIL. In this work, we introduce a distillation algorithm to address the problem of FSCIL and propose to make use of semantic information during training. To this end, we make use of word embeddings as semantic information which is cheap to obtain and which facilitate the distillation process. Furthermore, we propose a method based on an attention mechanism on multiple parallel embeddings of visual data to align visual and semantic vectors, which reduces issues related to catastrophic forgetting. Via experiments on MiniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 dataset, we establish new state-of-the-art results by outperforming existing approaches."}}

However, the success of the geometry constraints, posed in the embedding space, indicates that curved spaces might encode more structural information, leading to better discriminative power and hence richer representations. In this work, we investigate benefits of the curved space for analyzing anomalies or out-of-distribution objects in data. This is achieved by considering embeddings via three geometry constraints, namely, spherical geometry (with positive curvature), hyperbolic geometry (with negative curvature) or mixed geometry (with both positive and negative curvatures). Three geometric constraints can be chosen interchangeably in a unified design given the task at hand. Tailored for the embeddings in the curved space, we also formulate functions to compute the anomaly score. Two types of geometric modules (i.e., Geometric-in-One and Geometric-in-Two models) are proposed to plug in the original Euclidean classifier, and anomaly scores are computed from the curved embeddings. We evaluate the resulting designs under a diverse set of visual recognition scenarios, including image detection (multi-class OOD detection and one-class anomaly detection) and segmentation (multi-class anomaly segmentation and one-class anomaly segmentation). The empirical results show the effectiveness of our proposal through the consistent improvement over various scenarios."}}

In real-life scenarios, rain and haze, two often co-occurring common weather phenomena, can greatly degrade the clarity and quality of the scene images, leading to a performance drop in the visual applications, such as autonomous driving. However, jointly removing the rain and haze in scene images is ill-posed and challenging, where the existence of haze and rain and the change of atmosphere light, can both degrade the scene information. Current methods focus on the contamination removal part, thus ignoring the restoration of the scene information affected by the change of atmospheric light. We propose a novel deep neural network, named Asymmetric Dual-decoder U-Net (ADU-Net), to address the aforementioned challenge. The ADU-Net produces both the contamination residual and the scene residual to efficiently remove the rain and haze while preserving the fidelity of the scene information. Extensive experiments show our work outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin in both synthetic data and real-world data benchmarks, including RainCityscapes, BID Rain, and SPA-Data. For instance, we improve the state-of-the-art PSNR value by 2.26/4.57 on the RainCityscapes/SPA-Data, respectively. Codes will be made available freely to the research community."}}

A principal way of achieving few-shot learning is to realize an embedding where samples from different classes are distinctive. Recent studies suggest that embedding via hyperbolic geometry enjoys low distortion for hierarchical and structured data, making it suitable for few-shot learning. In this paper, we propose to learn a context-aware hyperbolic metric to characterize the distance between a point and a set associated with a learned set to set distance. To this end, we formulate the metric as a weighted sum on the tangent bundle of the hyperbolic space and develop a mechanism to obtain the weights adaptively, based on the constellation of the points. This not only makes the metric local but also dependent on the task in hand, meaning that the metric will adapt depending on the samples that it compares. We empirically show that such metric yields robustness in the presence of outliers and achieves a tangible improvement over baseline models. This includes the state-of-the-art results on five popular few-shot classification benchmarks, namely mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet, Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011(CUB), CIFAR-FS, and FC100."}}

To address this issue, we build an online counseling platform, which allows professional psychotherapists to provide free counseling services to those are in need. In exchange, we collect the counseling transcripts. Within a year of its operation, we manage to get one of the largest set of (675) transcripts of counseling sessions. To further leverage the valuable data we have, we label our dataset using both coarse- and fine-grained labels and use a set of pretraining techniques.
