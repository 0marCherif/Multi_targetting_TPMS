A User Study, Baseline, And Dataset", "abstract": "A variety of methods exist to explain image classification models. However, whether they provide any benefit to users over simply comparing various inputs and the model\u2019s respective predictions remains unclear. We conducted a user study (N=240) to test how such a baseline explanation technique performs against concept-based and counterfactual explanations. To this end, we contribute a synthetic dataset generator capable of biasing individual attributes and quantifying their relevance to the model. In a study, we assess if participants can identify the relevant set of attributes compared to the ground-truth. Our results show that the baseline outperformed concept-based explanations. Counterfactual explanations from an invertible neural network performed similarly as the baseline. Still, they allowed users to identify some attributes more accurately. Our results highlight the importance of measuring how well users can reason about biases of a model, rather than solely relying on technical evaluations or proxy tasks. We open-source our study and dataset so it can serve as a blue-print for future studies."}}

A popular approach is to backpropagate (BP) a custom relevance score using modified rules, rather than the gradient. We analyze an extensive set of modified BP methods: Deep Taylor Decomposition, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), Excitation BP, PatternAttribution, DeepLIFT, Deconv, RectGrad, and Guided BP. We find empirically that the explanations of all mentioned methods, except for DeepLIFT, are independent of the parameters of later layers. We provide theoretical insights for this surprising behavior and also analyze why DeepLIFT does not suffer from this limitation. Empirically, we measure how information of later layers is ignored by using our new metric, cosine similarity convergence (CSC). The paper provides a framework to assess the faithfulness of new and existing modified BP methods theoretically and empirically. "}}

Their interpretability is mostly limited to post-hoc methods which are not guaranteed to be faithful to the model. To elucidate a model\u2019s decision, we present a novel interpretable model based on an invertible deep convolutional network. Our model generates meaningful, faithful, and ideal counterfactuals. Using PCA on the classifier\u2019s input, we can also create \u201cisofactuals\u201d\u2013 image interpolations with the same outcome but visually meaningful different features. Counter- and isofactuals can be used to identify positive and negative evidence in an image. This can also be visualized with heatmaps. We evaluate our approach against gradient-based attribution methods, which we find to produce meaningless adversarial perturbations.  Using our method, we reveal biases in three different datasets. In a human subject experiment, we test whether non-experts find our method useful to spot spurious correlations learned by a model. Our work is a step towards more trustworthy explanations for computer vision."}}

For a given input sample, they assign a relevance score to each individual input variable, such as the pixels of an image. In this work, we adopt the information bottleneck concept for attribution. By adding noise to intermediate feature maps, we restrict the flow of information and can quantify (in bits) how much information image regions provide. We compare our method against ten baselines using three different metrics on VGG-16 and ResNet-50, and find that our methods outperform all baselines in five out of six settings. The method\u2019s information-theoretic foundation provides an absolute frame of reference for attribution values (bits) and a guarantee that regions scored close to zero are not necessary for the network's decision.

Bees may acquire unique memories throughout their lives. These experiences affect social interactions even over large time frames. Tracking and identifying all bees in the colony over their lifetimes therefore may likely shed light on the interplay of individual differences and colony behavior. This paper proposes a software pipeline based on two deep convolutional neural networks for the localization and decoding of custom binary markers that honeybees carry from their first to the last day in their life. We show that this approach outperforms similar systems proposed in recent literature. By opening this software for the public, we hope that the resulting datasets will help advancing the understanding of honeybee collective intelligence."}}
