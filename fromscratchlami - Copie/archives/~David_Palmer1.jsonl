Many of these methods, however, learn only closed surfaces and are unable to reconstruct shapes with boundary curves. We propose a hybrid shape representation that combines explicit boundary curves with implicit learned interiors. Using machinery from geometric measure theory, we parameterize currents using deep networks and use stochastic gradient descent to solve a minimal surface problem. By modifying the metric according to target geometry coming, e.g., from a mesh or point cloud, we can use this approach to represent arbitrary surfaces, learning implicitly defined shapes with explicitly defined boundary curves. We further demonstrate learning families of shapes jointly parameterized by boundary curves and latent codes."}}

The optimization problem maximizes the Bernoulli maximum likelihood function with an added nuclear norm regularization term. The dual problem has a particularly nice form, related to the well-known semidefinite program relaxation of the MaxCut problem. Using the primal-dual optimality conditions, we bound the entries and rank of the primal and dual solutions. Furthermore, we bound the optimal objective value and prove asymptotic consistency of the probability estimates of a slightly modified model under mild technical assumptions. Our experiments on synthetic RDPGs not only recover natural clusters, but also reveal the underlying low-dimensional geometry of the original data. We also demonstrate that the method recovers latent structure in the Karate Club Graph and synthetic U.S. Senate vote graphs and is scalable to graphs with up to a few hundred nodes."}}

This breadth is largely due to the expansive list of geometric primitives, e.g., splines, triangles, and hexahedra, joined with an ever-expanding variety of objectives one might want to achieve with them. With the recent increase in attention toward higher-order surfaces, we can expect a variety of challenges porting existing solutions that work on triangle meshes to work on these more complex geometry types. In this paper, we present a framework for solving many core geometry processing problems on higher-order surfaces. We achieve this goal through sum-of-squares optimization, which transforms nonlinear polynomial optimization problems into sequences of convex problems whose complexity is captured by a single degree parameter. This allows us to solve a suite of problems on higher-order surfaces, such as continuous collision detection and closest point queries on curved patches, with only minor changes between formulations and geometries."}}

A commonly used check for hex mesh validity evaluates mesh quality on the corners of the parameter domain of each hex, an insufficient condition that neglects invalidity elsewhere in the element, but is straightforward to compute. Hex mesh quality optimizations using this validity criterion suffer by being unable to detect invalidities in a hex mesh reliably, let alone fix them. We rectify these challenges by leveraging sum-of-squares relaxations to pinpoint invalidities in a hex mesh efficiently and robustly. Furthermore, we design a hex mesh repair algorithm that can certify validity of the entire hex mesh. We demonstrate our hex mesh repair algorithm on a dataset of meshes that include hexes with both corner and face-interior invalidities and demonstrate that where na\u00efve algorithms would fail to even detect invalidities, we are able to repair them. Our novel methodology also introduces the general machinery of sum-of-squares relaxation to geometry processing, where it has the potential to solve related problems."}}

A key challenge in extending these methods to three dimensions, however, is representation of field values. Whereas cross fields can be represented by tangent vector fields that form a linear space, the 3D analog\u2014an octahedral frame field\u2014takes values in a nonlinear manifold. In this work, we describe the space of octahedral frames in the language of differential and algebraic geometry. With this understanding, we develop geometry-aware tools for optimization of octahedral fields, namely geodesic stepping and exact projection via semidefinite relaxation. Our algebraic approach not only provides an elegant and mathematically sound description of the space of octahedral frames but also suggests a generalization to frames whose three axes scale independently, better capturing the singular behavior we expect to see in volumetric frame fields. These new odeco frames, so called as they are represented by orthogonally decomposable tensors, also admit a semidefinite program\u2013based projection operator. Our description of the spaces of octahedral and odeco frames suggests computing frame fields via manifold-based optimization algorithms; we show that these algorithms efficiently produce high-quality fields while maintaining stability and smoothness."}}
