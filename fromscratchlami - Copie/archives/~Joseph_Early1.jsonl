Existing MAS problems typically use uniform timesteps with observations for all agents. In this work, we analyse the problem of agent location imputation, specifically posed in environments with non-uniform timesteps and limited agent observability (~95% missing values). Our approach uses Long Short-Term Memory and Graph Neural Network components to learn temporal and inter-agent patterns to predict the location of all agents at every timestep. We apply this to the domain of football (soccer) by imputing the location of all players in a game from sparse event data (e.g., shots and passes). Our model estimates player locations to within ~6.9m; a ~62% reduction in error from the best performing baseline. This approach facilitates downstream analysis tasks such as player physical metrics, player coverage, and team pitch control. Existing solutions to these tasks often require optical tracking data, which is expensive to obtain and only available to elite clubs. By imputing player locations from easy to obtain event data, we increase the accessibility of downstream tasks."}}

Existing work assumes that human evaluators observe each step in a trajectory independently when providing feedback on agent behaviour. In this work, we remove this assumption, extending RM to capture temporal dependencies in human assessment of trajectories. We show how RM can be approached as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, where trajectories are treated as bags with return labels, and steps within the trajectories are instances with unseen reward labels. We go on to develop new MIL models that are able to capture the time dependencies in labelled trajectories. We demonstrate on a range of RL tasks that our novel MIL models can reconstruct reward functions to a high level of accuracy, and can be used to train high-performing agent policies."}}

Existing approaches that use machine learning with Earth observation data for LCC rely on fully-annotated and segmented datasets. Creating these datasets requires a large amount of effort, and a lack of suitable datasets has become an obstacle in scaling the use of LCC. In this study, we propose Scene-to-Patch models: an alternative LCC approach utilising Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) that requires only high-level scene labels. This enables much faster development of new datasets whilst still providing segmentation through patch-level predictions, ultimately increasing the accessibility of using LCC for different scenarios. On the DeepGlobe-LCC dataset, our approach outperforms non-MIL baselines on both scene- and patch-level prediction. This work provides the foundation for expanding the use of LCC in climate change mitigation methods for technology, government, and academia."}}
