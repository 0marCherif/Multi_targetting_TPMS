While many efforts have been made for statically measuring and evaluating urban vibrancy, there are few studies on the evolutionary process of urban vibrancy, yet we know little about the relationship between urban vibrancy evolution and sophisticated spatiotemporal dynamics. In this article, we make use of multi-sourced urban data to develop a data-driven framework, U-Evolve, to investigate urban vibrancy evolution. Specifically, we first exploit the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban areas to create multi-view time-dependent graphs. Then, we analyze the contextual features and graph patterns of multi-view time-dependent graphs in terms of informing future urban vibrancy variations. Our analysis validates the informativeness of multi-view time-dependent graphs for characterizing and informing future urban vibrancy evolution. After that, we construct a feature based model to forecast future urban vibrancy evolution and quantify each feature\u2019s importance. Moreover, to further enhance the forecasting effectiveness, we propose a graph learning based model to capture spatiotemporal autocorrelation of urban areas based on multi-view time-dependent graphs in an end-to-end manner. Finally, extensive experiments on two metropolises, Beijing and Shanghai, demonstrate the effectiveness of our forecasting models. The U-Evolve framework has also been deployed in the production environment to deliver real-world urban development and planning insights for various cities in China."}}

Market-Oriented Prospect Analysis for Entrepreneur Fundraising", "abstract": "In recent decades, innovation and entrepreneurship have become buzz words. With entrepreneurial projects emerging in large numbers every day, the common intention of all investors, i.e., putting every penny into good entrepreneurial projects, is becoming more difficult. In reality, traditional research with empirical results is not practical for analyzing these newly launched projects of small and micro enterprises before production and sale. Actually, the future market prospect is an important criterion for evaluating entrepreneurial projects. However, this direction has not been well explored due to the limitations of scenarios and technical challenges especially for these small and micro enterprises. In this paper, we construct an interesting study of exploiting the market prospect from the sales markets (i.e., E-commerce) to help evaluate newly-posted campaigns in crowdfunding. Specifically, we propose a novel <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Market-oriented Prospect Analysis with Transferring Attention (MoPa-A)</i> model which contains two learning modules, i.e., <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">HostTask Learning</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">GuestTask Learning</i> connected and enhanced by transferring attention.

An effective job description will help employers to identify the right talents for the job, and give a clear understanding to candidates of what their duties and qualifications for a particular position would be. However, due to the variation in experiences, it is always a challenge for both hiring managers and recruiters to decide what capabilities the job requires and prioritize them accordingly on the job description. Also, tedious and expensive human efforts are usually required to prepare a job description. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate how to automate the process to generate job descriptions with less human intervention. To this end, we propose an end-to-end capability-aware neural job description generation framework, namely Cajon, to facilitate the writing of job description. Specifically, we first propose a novel capability-aware neural topic model to distill the various capability information from the larger-scale recruitment data. Also, an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network is designed for enabling the job description generation. In particular, the capability-aware attention mechanism and copy mechanism are proposed to guide the generation process to ensure the generated job descriptions can comprehensively cover relevant and representative capability requirements for the job. Moreover, we propose a capability-aware policy gradient training algorithm to further enhance the rationality of the generated job description. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world recruitment data clearly show our Cajon framework can help to generate more effective job descriptions in an interpretable way. In particular, our Cajon framework has been deployed in Baidu as an intelligent tool for talent recruitment."}}

It is believed that organizational network analysis (ONA) can help the business be more effective. While considerable research efforts have been made for visualizing and analyzing relationships in organizational networks, it lacks a holistic way to model the complex social structures and rich semantic information of these networks. Indeed, employee behaviors can occur across different communication platforms, such as email and instant messaging systems, which naturally lead to the multiplex structure of organizational social networks. Meanwhile, it is also a challenge to model the impact of semantic information, such as employee attributes and organization charts, and the collaboration relationships of employees. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Multiplex Attentive Network Embedding (MANE) approach for modeling organizational social networks in a holistic way. Specifically, we first develop a multiple attributed random walk approach to jointly model multiple networks, with the integration of external work information. Then, we preserve the network structure by maximizing the probability of predicting the central node based on the surrounding context nodes. In particular, we introduce an attention mechanism to assign a weight to each context node in the training process, according to its attributed relation and structural relation with the central node by utilizing the k-core algorithm and the shortest path algorithm. In this way, the embedding results can be kept consistent with their structural relationships. Furthermore, to solve some department-level tasks, we introduce an attentive relational transition method to learn the representation of departments in the organizational networks. Finally, we evaluate the performance of MANE with extensive experiments on real-world data for three important talent management tasks, namely employee performance prediction, employee turnover prediction and department performance prediction. We also conduct a link prediction task to validate the effectiveness of employee embedding. Experimental results clearly show the effectiveness and interpretability of MANE for organizational network analysis."}}

Despite the large sizes, existing KGs are far from complete and comprehensive. In order to continuously enrich KGs, automatic knowledge construction and update mechanisms are usually utilized, which inevitably bring in plenty of noise. However, most existing knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods assume that all the triple facts in KGs are correct, and project both entities and relations into a low-dimensional space without considering noise and knowledge conflicts. This will lead to low-quality and unreliable representations of KGs. To this end, in this paper, we propose a general multi-task reinforcement learning framework, which can greatly alleviate the noisy data problem. In our framework, we exploit reinforcement learning for choosing high-quality knowledge triples while filtering out the noisy ones. Also, in order to take full advantage of the correlations among semantically similar relations, the triple selection processes of similar relations are trained in a collective way with multi-task learning. Moreover, we extend popular KGE models TransE, DistMult, ConvE and RotatE with the proposed framework. Finally, the experimental validation shows that our approach is able to enhance existing KGE models and can provide more robust representations of KGs in noisy scenarios."}}

The study of P-O fit is important for enhancing proactive talent management. While considerable efforts have been made in this direction, it still lacks a quantitative and holistic way for measuring P-O fit and its impact on talent management. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel data-driven neural network approach for dynamically modeling the compatibility in P-O fit and its meaningful relationships with two critical issues in talent management, namely talent turnover and job performance. Specifically, inspired by the practical management scenarios, we creatively propose a novel neural-network-based P-O fit model. We first designed three kinds of organization-aware compatibility features extraction layers for measuring P-O fit. Then, to capture the dynamic nature of P-O fit and its consequent impact, we further exploit an adapted Recurrent Neural Network with attention mechanism to model the temporal information of P-O fit. Finally, we compare our approach with a number of state-of-the-art baseline methods on real-world talent data. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness in terms of turnover and job performance prediction. Moreover, we show some interesting indicators of talent management through the visualizing some network layers."}}

Different from traditional closed set learning, CIL has two main challenges: (1) Novel class detection. The initial training data only contains incomplete classes, and streaming test data will accept unknown classes. Therefore, the model needs to not only accurately classify known classes, but also effectively detect unknown classes; (2) Model expansion. After the novel classes are detected, the model needs to be updated without re-training using the entire previous data. However, traditional CIL methods have not fully considered these two challenges. First, they are always restricted to single novel class detection within each phase and embedding confusion caused by unknown classes. Besides, they ignore the catastrophic forgetting of known categories in model update. To this end, we propose a semi-supervised style Class-Incremental Learning without Forgetting (CILF) method, which aims to learn adaptive embedding for processing novel class detection and model update in a unified framework. In detail, CILF designs to regularize classification with decoupled prototype based loss, which can improve the intra-class and inter-class structure significantly, and acquires a compact embedding representation for novel class detection in result. Then, CILF employs a learnable curriculum clustering operator to estimate the number of semantic clusters via fine-tuning the learned network, in which curriculum operator can adaptively learn the embedding in self-taught form. Therefore, CILF can detect multiple novel classes and mitigate the embedding confusion problem. Last, with the labeled streaming test data, CILF can update the network with robust regularization to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting. Consequently, CILF is able to iteratively perform novel class detection and model update. We verify the effectiveness of our model on four streaming classification tasks, and empirical studies show the superior performance of the proposed method."}}

Indeed, a personalized TV recommender system can greatly help users to obtain their preferred programs and assist TV and channel providers to attract more audiences. While di\ufb00erent methods have been proposed for TV recommendations, most of them neglect the mixture of watching groups behind an individual TV. In other words, there may be di\ufb00erent groups of audiences at di\ufb00erent times in front of a TV. For instance, watching groups of a TV may consist of children, wife and husband, husband, wife, etc in many US household. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Mixture Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (mPMF) model to learn the program preferences of televisions, which assumes that the preference of a given television can be regarded as the mixed preference of di\ufb00erent watching groups. Speci\ufb01cally, the latent vector of a television is drawn from a mixture of Gaussian and the mixture number is the estimated number of watching groups behind the television. To evaluate the proposed mPMF model, we conduct extensive experiments with many state-of-the-art baseline methods and evaluation metrics on a real-world data set.

Even with the help of newly available big data in the \ufb01eld of human resources, it is challenging to prospect the career development of talents in an effective manner, since the nature and structure of talent careers can change quickly. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel survival analysis approach to model the talent career paths, with a focus on two critical issues in talent management, namely turnover and career progression. Specifically, for modeling the talent turnover behaviors, we formulate the prediction of survival status at a sequence of time intervals as a multi-task learning problem by considering the prediction at each time interval as a task. Also, we impose the ranking constraints to model both censored and uncensored data, and capture the intrinsic properties exhibited in general lifetime modeling with non-recurrent and recurrent events. Similarly, for modeling the talent career progression, each task concerns the prediction of a relative occupational level at each time interval. The ranking constraints imposed on different occupational levels can help to reduce the prediction error. Finally, we evaluate our approach with several state-of-the-art baseline methods on real-world talent data. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models for predicting the turnover and career progression of talents."}}
