However, existing approaches that assume feature subsets to be independent are imperfect when considering the dependency between features. To address this limitation, we propose to incorporate the Gaussian copula, a powerful mathematical technique for capturing correlations between variables, into the current feature selection framework with no additional changes needed. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets, in terms of performance comparison and interpretability, demonstrate that our method is capable of capturing meaningful correlations."}}

The algorithm is de-signed for the offline setting, where the objective is to detect changes when all data are received. We only make weak moment assumptions on the inliers (uncorrupted data) to handle a large class of distributions. The robust scan statistic in the change detection algorithm is fashioned using mean estimators based on influence functions. We establish the consistency of the estimated change point indexes as the number of samples increases, and provide empirical evidence to support the consistency results."}}

Instead of directly maximizing cumulative expected reward, we need to balance between the total reward and fairness level. In this paper, we present a new insight in MAB with fairness and formulate the problem in the penalization framework, where rigorous penalized regret can be well defined and more sophisticated regret analysis is possible.  Under such a framework, we propose a hard-threshold UCB-like algorithm, which enjoys many merits including asymptotic fairness, nearly optimal regret, better tradeoff between reward and fairness. Both gap-dependent and gap-independent upper bounds have been established. Lower bounds are also given to illustrate the tightness of our theoretical analysis. Numerous experimental results corroborate the theory and show the superiority of our method over other existing methods."}}

SGEP plays an important role in statistical learning and has wide applications including, but not limited to, sparse principal component analysis, sparse canonical correlation analysis  and sparse Fisher discriminant analysis, etc. Due to the sparsity constraint, the solution of SGEP entails interesting properties from both numerical and statistical perspectives. In this paper, we provide a detailed sensitivity analysis for SGEP and establish the rate-optimal perturbation bound under the sparse setting. Specifically, we show that the bound is related to the perturbation/noise level and the recovery of the true support of the leading eigenvector as well. We also investigate the estimator of SGEP via imposing a non-convex regularization. Such estimator can achieve the optimal error rate and can recover the sparsity structure as well. Extensive numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings via using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based computational method."}}
