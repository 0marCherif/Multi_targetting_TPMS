However, the diversity of meta-path sampling has not been well guaranteed. Moreover, changes in user\u2019s reading preferences and paper\u2019s audiences in the short term are often overshadowed by long-term fixed trends. In this paper, we propose a paper recommendation model, called COMRec, where the diversity and dynamics are jointly exploited in HIN. To enhance the semantic diversity of meta-path, we propose a novel in-out degree sampling method that can comprehensively capture the diverse semantic relationships between different types of entities. To incorporate the dynamic changes into the recommended results, we propose a compensation mechanism based on the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-LSTM) to mine the dynamic trend. Extensive experiments results demonstrate that COMRec outperforms the representative baselines."}}

Recently, deep learning methods for popularity prediction advance traditional approaches that rely on hand-crafted features. However, existing approaches ignore the multi-source cascade that consists of multiple sub-cascades with different content but under the same topic. Different from single-source cascade, more cascading information can be observed from multi-source cascade and they are potentially correlated. How to correlate the diverse information and take advantage of them from both temporal and spatial aspects is critical for prediction. To this end, we propose a novel framework, called HEterogeneous Recurrent Integrated Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HERI-GCN). Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous cascade graph to model the multi-source cascade where time intervals are treated as heterogeneous time nodes. Besides, we propose a heterogeneous GCN to learn rich features from the multi-source cascade. RNN is organically integrated into the heterogeneous GCN to overcome the limited learning ability toward temporal and spatial data. We evaluate HERI-GCN through comparative experiments on three datasets. The experimental evaluation shows that HERI-GCN outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods."}}

Nevertheless, most of the available datasets have been published for nearly a decade, and their scale is not large enough. Moreover, they ignore the multiple posts originated by different users spontaneously under the same topic, these posts form a kind of multi-source information. This paper presents Wb-MSF, a large-scale dataset that contains multi-source information cascades and user followership. Different from existing datasets used in information diffusion tasks, Wb-MSF is the first multi-source information dataset, and further provides a followership network. Wb-MSF is crawled from a famous social platform Sina-Weibo and contains tens of millions of followership edges and tens of thousands of information cascades formed by millions of users. It can support information diffusion prediction problem. In this paper, our discussions and experiments including carrying out a statistical analysis of the dataset, and examining the difference between single-source and multi-source information and the effect of the followership network are based on this problem."}}
