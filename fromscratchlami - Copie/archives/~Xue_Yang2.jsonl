In this paper, we propose an effective approximate SkewIoU loss based on Gaussian modeling and Gaussian product, which mainly consists of two items. The first term is a scale-insensitive center point loss, which is used to quickly narrow the distance between the center points of the two bounding boxes. In the distance-independent second term, the product of the Gaussian distributions is adopted to inherently mimic the mechanism of SkewIoU by its definition, and show its alignment with the SkewIoU loss at trend-level within a certain distance (i.e. within 9 pixels). This is in contrast to recent Gaussian modeling based rotation detectors e.g. GWD loss and KLD loss that involve a human-specified distribution distance metric which require additional hyperparameter tuning that vary across datasets and detectors. The resulting new loss called KFIoU loss is easier to implement and works better compared with exact SkewIoU loss, thanks to its full differentiability and ability to handle the non-overlapping cases. We further extend our technique to the 3-D case which also suffers from the same issues as 2-D. Extensive results on various datasets with different base detectors show the effectiveness of our approach. "}}

Without any refinement, DCT-Mask directly generates high-resolution masks by compressed vectors. To further refine masks obtained by compressed vectors, we propose for the first time a compressed vector based multi-stage refinement framework.  However, the vanilla combination does not bring significant gains, because changes in some elements of the DCT vector will affect the prediction of the entire mask. Thus, we propose a simple and novel method named PatchDCT, which separates the mask decoded from a DCT vector into several patches and refines each patch by the designed classifier and regressor. Specifically, the classifier is used to distinguish mixed patches from all patches, and to correct previously mispredicted foreground and background patches. In contrast, the regressor is used for DCT vector prediction of mixed patches, further refining the segmentation quality at boundary locations. Experiments on COCO show that our method achieves 2.0\\%, 3.2\\%, 4.5\\% AP and 3.4\\%, 5.3\\%, 7.0\\% Boundary AP improvements over Mask-RCNN on COCO, LVIS, and Cityscapes, respectively. It also surpasses DCT-Mask by 0.7\\%, 1.1\\%, 1.3\\% AP and 0.9\\%, 1.7\\%, 4.2\\% Boundary AP on COCO, LVIS and Cityscapes. Besides, the performance of PatchDCT is also competitive with other state-of-the-art methods."}}

The cores of our method are weakly- and self-supervised learning, which predicts the angle of the object by learning the consistency of two different views. To our best knowledge, H2RBox is the first horizontal box annotation-based oriented object detector. Compared to an alternative i.e. horizontal box-supervised instance segmentation with our post adaption to oriented object detection, our approach is not susceptible to the prediction quality of mask and can perform more robustly in complex scenes containing a large number of dense objects and outliers. Experimental results show that H2RBox has significant performance and speed advantages over horizontal box-supervised instance segmentation methods, as well as lower memory requirements. While compared to rotated box-supervised oriented object detectors, our method shows very close performance and speed.

Recently, GAN inversion based inpainting methods propose to leverage semantic information in pretrained generator (e.g., StyleGAN) to solve the above issues. Different from feed-forward methods, they seek for a closest latent code to the corrupted image and feed it to a pretrained generator. However, inferring the latent code is either time-consuming or inaccurate. In this paper, we develop a dual-path inpainting network with inversion path and feed-forward path, in which inversion path provides auxiliary information to help feed-forward path. We also design a novel deformable fusion module to align the feature maps in two paths. Experiments on FFHQ and LSUN demonstrate that our method is effective in solving the aforementioned problems while producing more realistic results than state-of-the-art methods."}}

Each representation encounters problems that correspond to its characteristics, such as the boundary discontinuity, square-like problem, representation ambiguity, and isolated points, which lead to inaccurate detection. Although many effective strategies have been proposed for various representations, there is still no unified solution. Current detection methods based on Gaussian modeling have demonstrated the possibility of breaking this dilemma; however, they remain limited to OBB. To go further, in this paper, we propose a unified Gaussian representation called G-Rep to construct Gaussian distributions for OBB, QBB, and PointSet, which achieves a unified solution to various representations and problems. Specifically, PointSet or QBB-based objects are converted into Gaussian distributions, and their parameters are optimized using the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm. Then, three optional Gaussian metrics are explored to optimize the regression loss of the detector because of their excellent parameter optimization mechanisms. Furthermore, we also use Gaussian metrics for sampling to align label assignment and regression loss. Experimental results on several public available datasets, DOTA, HRSC2016, UCAS-AOD, and ICDAR2015 show the excellent performance of the proposed method for arbitrary-oriented object detection.

The mainstream rotation detectors use oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) or quadrilateral bounding boxes (QBBs) to represent the rotating objects. However, these methods suffer from the representation ambiguity for oriented object definition, which leads to suboptimal regression optimization and the inconsistency between the loss metric and the localization accuracy of the predictions. In this letter, we propose a representation invariance loss (RIL) to optimize the bounding box regression for the rotating objects in the remote sensing images. RIL treats multiple representations of an oriented object as multiple equivalent local minima and hence transforms bounding box regression into an adaptive matching process with these local minima. Next, the Hungarian matching algorithm is adopted to obtain the optimal regression strategy. Besides, we propose a normalized rotation loss to alleviate the weak correlation between different variables and their unbalanced loss contribution in OBB representation. Extensive experiments on remote sensing datasets show that our method achieves consistent and substantial improvement.

We argue that such a mechanism has fundamental limitations in building an effective regression loss for rotation detection, especially for high-precision detection with high IoU (e.g. 0.75). Instead, we propose to model the rotated objects as Gaussian distributions. A direct advantage is that our new regression loss regarding the distance between two Gaussians e.g. Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), can well align the actual detection performance metric, which is not well addressed in existing methods. Moreover, the two bottlenecks i.e. boundary discontinuity and square-like problem also disappear. We also propose an efficient Gaussian metric-based label assignment strategy to further boost the performance. Interestingly, by analyzing the BBox parameters' gradients under our Gaussian-based KLD loss, we show that these parameters are dynamically updated with interpretable physical meaning, which help explain the effectiveness of our approach, especially for high-precision detection. We extend our approach from 2-D to 3-D with a tailored algorithm design to handle the heading estimation, and experimental results on twelve public datasets (2-D/3-D, aerial/text/face images) with various base detectors show its superiority."}}

We first show that the boundary problem suffered in existing dominant regression-based rotation detectors, is caused by angular periodicity or corner ordering, according to the parameterization protocol. We also show that the root cause is that the ideal predictions can be out of the defined range. Accordingly, we transform the angular prediction task from a regression problem to a classification one. For the resulting circularly distributed angle classification problem, we first devise a Circular Smooth Label technique to handle the periodicity of angle and increase the error tolerance to adjacent angles. To reduce the excessive model parameters by Circular Smooth Label, we further design a Densely Coded Labels, which greatly reduces the length of the encoding. Finally, we further develop an object heading detection module, which can be useful when the exact heading orientation information is needed e.g. for ship and plane heading detection. We release our OHD-SJTU dataset and OHDet detector for heading detection. Extensive experimental results on three large-scale public datasets for aerial images i.e. DOTA, HRSC2016, OHD-SJTU, and face dataset FDDB, as well as scene text dataset ICDAR2015 and MLT, show the effectiveness of our approach."}}
