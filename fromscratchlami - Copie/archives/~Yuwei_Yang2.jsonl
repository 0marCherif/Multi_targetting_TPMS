Current deep approaches always represent and generate candidate molecules as a 1D string or a 2D graph, which rely on large measurement data from lab experiments for training. However, many disease targets in particular newly discovered ones do not have such data available.  In this paper, we propose \\method, which incorporates physicochemical knowledge into deep models, leading to unsupervised drug design. Specifically,  \\method directly models drug molecules in the geometric~(3D) space and performs geometric editing with the  knowledge guidance by self-training and simulated annealing in a purely training data free fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that GEKO outperforms baselines on all 12 targets with and without prior drug-target measurement data."}}

Existing work focuses on developing neural models to generate either molecular sequences or chemical graphs. However, it remains a big challenge to find novel and diverse compounds satisfying several properties. In this paper, we propose MARS, a method for multi-objective drug molecule discovery. MARS is based on the idea of generating the chemical candidates by iteratively editing fragments of molecular graphs. To search for high-quality candidates, it employs Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC) on molecules with an annealing scheme and an adaptive proposal. To further improve sample efficiency, MARS uses a graph neural network (GNN) to represent and select candidate edits, where the GNN is trained on-the-fly with samples from MCMC. Experiments show that MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance in various multi-objective settings where molecular bio-activity, drug-likeness, and synthesizability are considered. Remarkably, in the most challenging setting where all four objectives are simultaneously optimized, our approach outperforms previous methods significantly in comprehensive evaluations.

CatS inhibitors have been included in D3R-GC3 for both docking pose prediction and affinity ranking, and in D3R-GC4 for binding affinity ranking. The difficulties posed by CatS inhibitors in D3R mainly come from three aspects: large size, high flexibility and similar chemical structures. We have participated in GC4; our best submitted model, which employs a similarity-based alignment docking and Vina scoring protocol, yielded Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 of 0.23 for 459 binders in GC4. In our further explorations with machine learning, by curating a CatS specific training set, adopting a similarity-based constrained docking method as well as an arm-based fragmentation strategy which can describe large inhibitors in a locality-sensitive fashion, our best structure-based ranking protocol can achieve Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 of 0.52 for all binders in GC4. In this exploration process, we have demonstrated the importance of training data, docking approaches and fragmentation strategies in inhibitor-ranking protocol development with machine learning."}}
