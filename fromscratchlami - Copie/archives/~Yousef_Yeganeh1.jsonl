Although most medical centers conduct similar medical imaging tasks, their differences, such as specializations, number of patients, and devices, lead to distinctive data distributions. Data heterogeneity poses a challenge for FL and the personalization of the local models. In this work, we investigate an adaptive hierarchical clustering method for FL to produce intermediate semi-global models, so clients with similar data distribution have the chance of forming a more specialized model. Our method forms several clusters consisting of clients with the most similar data distributions; then, each cluster continues to train separately. Inside the cluster, we use meta-learning to improve the personalization of the participants\u2019 models. We compare the clustering approach with classical FedAvg and centralized training by evaluating our proposed methods on the HAM10k dataset for skin lesion classification with extreme heterogeneous data distribution. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance gain in heterogeneous distribution compared to standard FL methods in classification accuracy. Moreover, we show that the models converge faster if applied in clusters and outperform centralized training while using only a small subset of data."}}

Different methods in this area have been proposed to solve existing problems in the machine learning world. One of the common problems in machine learning that has received much attention in recent years is few-shot learning. Meta learning has been the natural solution to many few-shot learning problems. In this chapter, we introduce some background in meta learning. Then, we provide some examples of its applications in different areas, especially in medical imaging."}}

We hypothesize that the anatomic structure of layers and their high-frequency variation in OCT images make retinal OCT a fitting choice for extracting spectral domain features and combining them with spatial domain features. In this work, we present Y-Net, an architecture that combines the frequency domain features with the image domain to improve the segmentation performance of OCT images. The results of this work demonstrate that the introduction of two branches, one for spectral and one for spatial domain features, brings very significant improvement in fluid segmentation performance and allows outperformance as compared to the well-known U-Net model. Our improvement was 13% on the fluid segmentation dice score and 1.9% on the average dice score. Finally, removing selected frequency ranges in the spectral domain demonstrates the impact of these features on the fluid segmentation outperformance. Code: github.com/azadef/ynet"}}

A critical problem in FL, specifically in medical scenarios is to have a more accurate shared model which is robust to noisy and out-of distribution clients. In this work, we tackle the problem of statistical heterogeneity in data for FL which is highly plausible in medical data where for example the data comes from different sites with different scanner settings. We propose IDA (Inverse Distance Aggregation), a novel adaptive weighting approach for clients based on meta-information which handles unbalanced and non-iid data. We extensively analyze and evaluate our method against the well-known FL approach, Federated Averaging as a baseline."}}
