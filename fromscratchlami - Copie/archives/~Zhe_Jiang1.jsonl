However, the problem is non-trivial due to significant imagery noise and obstacles, complex spatial dependency on 3D terrains, spatial non-stationarity, and high computational cost. Existing machine learning approaches are mostly terrain-unaware and are prone to produce spurious results due to imagery noise and obstacles, requiring significant efforts in post-processing. Recently, several terrain-aware methods were proposed that incorporate complex spatial dependency (e.g., water flow directions on 3D terrains) but they assume that the inferred flood surface level is spatially stationary, making them insufficient for a large heterogeneous geographic area. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel spatial learning framework called hidden Markov forest, which decomposes a large heterogeneous area into local stationary zones, represents spatial dependency on 3D terrains via zonal trees (forest), and jointly infers the class map in different zonal trees with spatial regularization. We design efficient inference algorithms based on dynamic programming and multi-resolution filtering. Evaluations on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms baselines and our proposed computational refinement significantly reduces the time cost."}}

Given raster feature imagery and imperfect (weak) vector labels with location registration errors, our goal is to learn a deep learning model for pixel classification and refine vector labels simultaneously. The problem is important in many geoscience applications such as streamline delineation and road mapping from earth imagery, where annotating imperfect coarse vector labels is far more efficient than drawing precise labels. But the problem is challenging due to the misalignment of vector labels with raster feature pixels and the need to infer true vector label location while learning neural network parameters. Existing works on weakly supervised learning often focus on noise and errors in label semantics, assuming label locations to be either correct or irrelevant (e.g., identical and independently distributed). A few works exist on label registration errors, but these methods often focus on label misalignment on object segment boundaries at the pixel level without guaranteeing vector continuity. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a spatial learning framework based on Expectation-Maximization that iteratively updates deep neural network parameters while inferring true vector label locations. Specifically, inference of true vector locations is based on both the current pixel class predictions and the geometric properties of vectors. Evaluations on real-world high-resolution remote sensing datasets in National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) refinement show that the proposed framework outperforms baseline methods in classification accuracy and refined vector quality."}}

The only comprehensive surface water feature map of Alaska is the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). NHD features are often digitized representations of historic topographic map blue lines and may be outdated. Here we test deep learning methods to automatically extract surface water features from airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IfSAR) data to update and validate Alaska hydrographic databases. U-net artificial neural networks (ANN) and high-performance computing (HPC) are used for supervised hydrographic feature extraction within a study area comprised of 50 contiguous watersheds in Alaska. Surface water features derived from elevation through automated flow-routing and manual editing are used as training data. Model extensibility is tested with a series of 16 U-net models trained with increasing percentages of the study area, from about 3 to 35 percent. Hydrography is predicted by each of the models for all watersheds not used in training. Input raster layers are derived from digital terrain models, digital surface models, and intensity images from the IfSAR data. Results indicate about 15 percent of the study area is required to optimally train the ANN to extract hydrography when F1-scores for tested watersheds average between 66 and 68. Little benefit is gained by training beyond 15 percent of the study area. Fully connected hydrographic networks are generated for the U-net predictions using a novel approach that constrains a D-8 flow-routing approach to follow U-net predictions. This work demonstrates the ability of deep learning to derive surface water feature maps from complex terrain over a broad area."}}

Abstract Surface water is an irreplaceable resource for human survival and environmental sustainability. Accurate, finely detailed cartographic representations of hydrologic streamlines are critically important in various scientific domains, such as assessing the quantity and quality of present and future water resources, modeling climate changes, evaluating agricultural suitability, mapping flood inundation, and monitoring environmental changes. Conventional approaches to detecting such streamlines cannot adequately incorporate information from the complex three-dimensional (3D) environment of streams and land surface features. Such information is vital to accurately delineate streamlines. In recent years, high accuracy lidar data has become increasingly available for deriving both 3D information and terrestrial surface reflectance. This study develops an attention U-net model to take advantage of high-accuracy lidar data for finely detailed streamline detection and evaluates model results against a baseline of multiple traditional machine learning methods. The evaluation shows that the attention U-net model outperforms the best baseline machine learning method by an average F1 score of 11.25% and achieves significantly better smoothness and connectivity between classified streamline channels. These findings suggest that our deep learning approach can harness high-accuracy lidar data for fine-scale hydrologic streamline detection, and in turn produce desirable benefits for many scientific domains."}}

For example, in observation-based flood inundation mapping, there is a need to map the full flood extent on geographic terrains based on earth imagery that partially covers a region. Existing research mostly focuses on addressing incomplete or missing data through data cleaning and imputation or modeling missing values as hidden variables in the EM algorithm. These methods, however, assume that missing feature observations are rare and thus are ineffective in problems whereby the vast majority of feature observations are missing. To address this issue, we recently proposed a new approach that incorporates physics-aware structural constraint into the model representation. We design efficient learning and inference algorithms. This paper extends our recent approach by allowing feature values of samples in each class to follow a multi-modal distribution. Evaluations on real-world flood mapping applications show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in classification accuracy, and the multi-modal extension is more robust than our early single-modal version. Computational experiments show that the proposed solution is computationally efficient on large datasets."}}

The problem is important in societal applications such as flood extent mapping for disaster response and national water forecasting, but is challenging due to the noise, obstacles, and heterogeneity in feature maps, implicit spatial dependency between locations based on the contextual layer (e.g., gradient directions on a potential field), and the large number of sample locations. Existing work often assumes undirected spatial dependency, or directed dependency with a total order, and thus cannot reflect complex directed dependency with a partial order. In contrast, we recently proposed geographical hidden Markov tree, a probabilistic graphical model that generalizes the common hidden Markov model from a one-dimensional sequence to a two-dimensional map. Partial order class dependency is incorporated in the hidden class layer with a reverse tree structure. We also investigated computational algorithms for reverse tree construction, model parameter learning and class inference. This paper extends our recent model with overlaying class nodes between observation nodes and underlying hidden class nodes. The additional overlaying class layer makes the model more robust to large scale feature obstacles. We also proposed corresponding learning and inference methods. Extensive evaluations on real world datasets show that our models outperform multiple baselines in flood mapping applications, our algorithms are scalable on large data sizes, and the proposed extension enhances classification performance."}}

The problem has important applications in hydrology, planetary science, and biochemistry but is uniquely challenging for several reasons. First, the spatial extent of class segments follows surface contours in the topological space, regardless of their spatial shapes and directions. Second, the topological structure exists in multiple spatial scales based on different surface resolutions. Existing widely successful deep learning models for image segmentation are often not applicable due to their reliance on convolution and pooling operations to learn regular structural patterns on a grid. In contrast, we propose to represent surface topological structure by a contour tree skeleton, which is a polytree capturing the evolution of surface contours at different elevation levels. We further design a graph neural network based on the contour tree hierarchy to model surface topological structure at different spatial scales. Experimental evaluations based on real-world hydrological datasets show that our model outperforms several baseline methods in classification accuracy."}}

The performance of these models heavily relies on high-quality ground truth segment labels. Unfortunately, in many real-world problems, ground truth segment labels often have geometric annotation errors due to manual annotation mistakes, GPS errors, or visually interpreting background imagery at a coarse resolution. Such location errors will significantly impact the training performance of existing deep learning algorithms. Existing research on label errors either models ground truth errors in label semantics (assuming label locations to be correct) or models label location errors with simple square patch shifting. These methods cannot fully incorporate the geometric properties of label location errors. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a generic learning framework based on the EM algorithm to update deep learning model parameters and infer hidden true label locations simultaneously. Evaluations on a real-world hydrological dataset in the streamline refinement application show that the proposed framework outperforms baseline methods in classification accuracy (reducing the number of false positives by 67% and reducing the number of false negatives by 55%)."}}

Road safety features (e.g., concrete barriers, metal crash barriers, rumble strips) play an important role in preventing or mitigating vehicle crashes. Accurate maps of road safety features is an important component of safety management systems for federal or state transportation agencies, helping traffic engineers identify locations to invest in safety infrastructure. In current practice, mapping road safety features is largely done manually (e.g., observations on the road or visual interpretation of streetview imagery), which is both expensive and time consuming. In this article, we propose a deep learning approach to automatically map road safety features from streetview imagery. Unlike existing convolutional neural networks that classify each image individually, we propose to further add a recurrent neural network (long short-term memory) to capture geographic context of images (spatial autocorrelation effect along linear road network paths). Evaluations on real-world streetview imagery show that our proposed model outperforms several baseline methods."}}
