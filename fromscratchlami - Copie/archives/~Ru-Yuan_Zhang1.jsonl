However, most of the current neuro-symbolic models also rely on supervised learning and auxiliary annotations, different from human cognitive processes that are much dependent on the general cognitive abilities of entity and rule recognitions, rather than learning how to solve the specific tasks from examples. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic model by self-supervised contrastive learning (NS-SSCL) with unique and invariant representations of entities and rules in the perception and reasoning modules, respectively, to solve Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices (RPMs) and its variant, a typical type of visual reasoning task used to test human intelligence. The perception module parses each object into invariant representations of attributes. The reasoning module grounds the representations of object attributes to form the latent rule representations also through SSCL. Further, the relationships between the neural representations of object attributes and symbols used for rule reasoning are coherently mapped. Finally, the scene generation engine aggregates all attribute and rule representation distributions to produce a probabilistic representation of the target. NS-SSCL obtains state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised models to solve the RAVEN and V-PROM benchmarks, even better than most of the supervised models. The success of the proposed model suggests that construction of general cognitive abilities like humans may render the AI algorithms to solve complex tasks involving higher-level cognition such as abstract reasoning in a human-like manner."}}

Here, we leverage adversarial noise (AN) and adversarial interference (AI) images to quantify the consistency between neural representations and perceptual outcomes in the two systems. Humans can successfully recognize AI images as the same categories as their corresponding regular images but perceive AN images as meaningless noise. In contrast, CNNs can recognize AN images similar as corresponding regular images but classify AI images into wrong categories with surprisingly high confidence. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity evoked by regular and adversarial images in the human brain, and compare it to the activity of artificial neurons in a prototypical CNN\u2014AlexNet. In the human brain, we find that the representational similarity between regular and adversarial images largely echoes their perceptual similarity in all early visual areas. In AlexNet, however, the neural representations of adversarial images are inconsistent with network outputs in all intermediate processing layers, providing no neural foundations for the similarities at the perceptual level. Furthermore, we show that voxel-encoding models trained on regular images can successfully generalize to the neural responses to AI images but not A..."}}

Although working memory deficits have been well-documented in schizophrenia, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Conventional working memory theories attribute working memory deficits in schizophrenia to their reduced memory capacity, overlooking the potential roles of other memory components, such as precision. In this study, we take the approach of computational psychiatry and use computational modeling to uncover the major determinants of working memory deficits. We assess working memory performance of a large cohort of participants (60 schizophrenia patients and 61 demographic matched healthy controls) and evaluate multiple mainstream computational models of visual working memory. The variable precision model turns out to be the best model for both groups. We further find that the poorer performance of schizophrenia patients arises from heterogeneous distribution of memory resources when encoding items in memory. This resource allocation variability can also predict symptom severity in schizophrenia. Our study highlights the use of computational models in psychiatric researches."}}

Despite extensive studies of NCs in neurophysiology, little is known with respect to their role in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We characterize the effect of voxelwise NC by building voxel-encoding models and directly quantifying the amount of information in simulated multivariate fMRI data. In contrast to the detrimental effects of NC implied in neurophysiological studies, we find that voxelwise NCs can enhance information codes if NC is sufficiently strong. Our work highlights the important role of noise correlations in decipher population codes using fMRI."}}
