We learn this skill not via labeled examples, but simply by observing objects move. In this work, we propose an approach that observes unlabeled multi-view videos at training time and learns to map a single image observation of a complex scene, such as a street with cars, to a 3D neural scene representation that is disentangled into movable and immovable parts while plausibly completing its 3D structure. We separately parameterize movable and immovable scene parts via 2D neural ground plans. These ground plans are 2D grids of features aligned with the ground plane that can be locally decoded into 3D neural radiance fields. Our model is trained self-supervised via neural rendering. We demonstrate that the structure inherent to our disentangled 3D representation enables a variety of downstream tasks in street-scale 3D scenes using simple heuristics, such as extraction of object-centric 3D representations, novel view synthesis, instance segmentation, and 3D bounding box prediction, highlighting its value as a backbone for data-efficient 3D scene understanding models. This disentanglement further enables scene editing via object manipulation such as deletion, insertion, and rigid-body motion"}}

Motivated by the bird\u2019s-eye-view (BEV) representation commonly used in vision and robotics, we propose conditional neural groundplans, ground-aligned 2D feature grids, as persistent and memory-efficient scene representations. Our method is trained self-supervised from unlabeled multi-view observations using differentiable rendering, and learns to complete geometry and appearance of occluded regions. In addition, we show that we can leverage multi-view videos at training time to learn to separately reconstruct static and movable components of the scene from a single image at test time. The ability to separately reconstruct movable objects enables a variety of downstream tasks using simple heuristics, such as extraction of object-centric 3D representations, novel view synthesis, instance-level segmentation, 3D bounding box prediction, and scene editing. This highlights the value of neural groundplans as a backbone for efficient 3D scene understanding models."}}

Producing accurate, pixel--level labels required for this task is a tedious and time consuming process; however, producing approximate, coarse labels could take only a fraction of the time and effort. We investigate the relationship between the quality of labels and the performance of ConvNets for semantic segmentation. We create a very large synthetic dataset with perfectly labeled street view scenes. From these perfect labels, we synthetically coarsen labels with different qualities and estimate human--hours required for producing them. We perform a series of experiments by training ConvNets with a varying number of training images and label quality. We found that the performance of ConvNets mostly depends on the time spent creating the training labels. That is, a larger coarsely--annotated dataset can yield the same performance as a smaller finely--annotated one. Furthermore, fine--tuning coarsely pre--trained ConvNets with few finely-annotated labels can yield comparable or superior performance to training it with a large amount of finely-annotated labels alone, at a fraction of the labeling cost. We demonstrate that our result is also valid for different network architectures, and various object classes in an urban scene."}}
