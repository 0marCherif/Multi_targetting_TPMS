They rely on message passing that iteratively aggregates neighbour's features and often suffer performance degradation on non-homophilous graphs where useful information is hardly available in the local neighbourhood. In addition, earlier studies show that in some cases GNNs are even outperformed by Multi-Layer Perceptron, indicating insufficient exploitation of node feature information. Motivated by the two limitations, we propose ProtoGNN, a novel message passing framework that augments existing GNNs by effectively combining node features with structural information. ProtoGNN learns multiple class prototypes for each class from raw node features with the slot-attention mechanism. These prototype representations are then transferred onto the structural node features with explicit message passing to all non-training nodes irrespective of distance. This form of message passing, from training nodes to class prototypes to non-training nodes, also serves as a shortcut that bypasses local graph neighbourhoods and captures global information. ProtoGNN is a generic framework which can be applied onto any of the existing GNN backbones to improve node representations when node features are strong and local graph information is scarce. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that ProtoGNN brings performance improvement to various GNN backbones and achieves state-of-the-art on several non-homophilous datasets."}}

Other more expressive models either are computationally expensive or need preprocessing to extract structural features from the graph. In this work, we propose to make GNNs universal by guiding the learning process with exact isomorphism solver techniques which operate on the paradigm of $\\textit{Individualization and refinement}$ (IR), a method to artificially introduce asymmetry and further refine the coloring when 1-WL stops. Isomorphism solvers generate a search-tree of colorings whose leaves uniquely identify the graph. However, the tree grows exponentially large and needs hand-crafted pruning techniques which are not desirable from a learning perspective. We take a probabilistic view and approximate the search tree of colorings ( i.e. embeddings) by sampling multiple paths from root to leaves of the search-tree. To learn more discriminative representations, we guide the sampling process with $\\textit{particle filter}$ updates, a principled approach for sequential state estimation. Our algorithm is end-to-end differentiable, can be applied with any GNN as backbone and learns richer graph representations with only linear increase in runtime. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach consistently outperforms leading GNN models on both synthetic benchmarks for isomorphism detection as well as real-world datasets."}}

Though powerful, GCNs tend to suffer performance drop when the model gets deep. Previous works focus on PROPs to study and mitigate this issue, but the role of TRANs is barely investigated. In this work, we study performance degradation of GCNs by experimentally examining how stacking only TRANs or PROPs works. We find that TRANs contribute significantly, or even more than PROPs, to declining performance, and moreover that they tend to amplify node-wise feature variance in GCNs, causing variance inflammation that we identify as a key factor for causing performance drop. Motivated by such observations, we propose a variance-controlling technique termed Node Normalization (NodeNorm), which scales each node's features using its own standard deviation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of NodeNorm on addressing performance degradation of GCNs. Specifically, it enables deep GCNs to outperform shallow ones in cases where deep models are needed, and to achieve comparable results with shallow ones on 6 benchmark datasets. NodeNorm is a generic plug-in and can well generalize to other GNN architectures. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/miafei/NodeNorm."}}

It is time to introduce more challenging datasets to push the development of this field towards more comprehensive reasoning of text. In this paper, we introduce a new Reading Comprehension dataset requiring logical reasoning (ReClor) extracted from standardized graduate admission examinations. As earlier studies suggest, human-annotated datasets usually contain biases, which are often exploited by models to achieve high accuracy without truly understanding the text. In order to comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of models on ReClor, we propose to identify biased data points and separate them into EASY set while the rest as HARD set. Empirical results show that state-of-the-art models have an outstanding ability to capture biases contained in the dataset with high accuracy on EASY set. However, they struggle on HARD set with poor performance near that of random guess, indicating more research is needed to essentially enhance the logical reasoning ability of current models. "}}
