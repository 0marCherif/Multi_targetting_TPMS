This paper presents a Decision Support System, called DSSDDI, based on drug-drug interactions to support doctors prescribing decisions. DSSDDI contains three modules, Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) module, Medical Decision (MD) module and Medical Support (MS) module. The DDI module learns safer and more effective drug representations from the drug-drug interactions. To capture the potential causal relationship between DDI and medication use, the MD module considers the representations of patients and drugs as context, DDI and patients\u2019 similarity as treatment, and medication use as outcome to construct counterfactual links for the representation learning. Furthermore, the MS module provides drug candidates to doctors with explanations. Experiments on the chronic data collected from the Hong Kong Chronic Disease Study Project and a public diagnostic data MIMIC-III demonstrate that DSSDDI can be a reliable reference for doctors in terms of safety and efficiency of clinical diagnosis, with significant improvements compared to baseline methods. Source code of the proposed DSSDDI is publicly available at https://github.com/TianBian95/DSSDDI."}}

Despite their success, existing approaches are either limited to structure attacks or restricted to local information. This calls for a more general attack framework on graph classification, which faces significant challenges due to the complexity of generating local-node-level adversarial examples using the global-graph-level information. To address this \"global-to-local\" problem, we present a general framework CAMA to generate adversarial examples by manipulating graph structure and node features in a hierarchical style. Specifically, we make use of Graph Class Activation Mapping and its variant to produce node-level importance corresponding to the graph classification task. Then through a heuristic design of algorithms, we can perform both feature and structure attacks under unnoticeable perturbation budgets with the help of both node-level and subgraph-level importance. Experiments towards attacking four state-of-the-art graph classification models on six real-world benchmarks verify the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework."}}

While this task is common, more complex cases arise in practice\u2014can we cluster nodes better with some graph-level side information or in a weakly supervised manner as, for example, identifying potential fraud users in a social network given additional labels of fraud communities. This triggers an interesting problem which we define as Weakly Supervised Graph Clustering (WSGC). In this paper, we firstly discuss the various possible settings of WSGC, formally. Upon such discussion, we investigate a particular task of weakly supervised graph clustering by making use of the graph labels and node features, with the assistance of a hierarchical graph that further characterizes the connections between different graphs. To address this task, we propose Gaussian Mixture Graph Convolutional Network (GMGCN), a simple yet effective framework for learning node representations under the supervision of graph labels guided by a proposed consensus loss and then inferring the category of each node via a Gaussian Mixture Layer (GML). Extensive experiments are conducted to test the rationality of the formulation of weakly supervised graph clustering. The experimental results show that, with the assistance of graph labels, the weakly supervised graph clustering method has a great improvement over the traditional graph clustering method."}}

However, it is expensive to maintain the label quality for real-world graph datasets, which presents huge challenges for the learning algorithm to keep a good generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel robust learning objective dubbed pairwise interactions (PI) for the model, such as Graph Neural Network (GNN) to combat against noisy labels. Unlike classic robust training approaches that operate on the pointwise interactions between node and class label pairs, PI explicitly forces the embeddings for node pairs that hold a positive PI label to be close to each other, which can be applied to both labeled and unlabeled nodes. We design several instantiations for the PI labels based on the graph structure as well as node class labels, and further propose a new uncertainty-aware training technique to mitigate the negative effect of the sub-optimal PI labels. Extensive experiments on different datasets and GNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of PI, which also brings a promising improvement over the state-of-the-art methods."}}

Meanwhile, detecting rumors from such massive information in social media is becoming an arduous challenge. Therefore, some deep learning methods are applied to discover rumors through the way they spread, such as Recursive Neural Network (RvNN) and so on. However, these deep learning methods only take into account the patterns of deep propagation but ignore the structures of wide dispersion in rumor detection. Actually, propagation and dispersion are two crucial characteristics of rumors. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-directional graph model, named Bi-Directional Graph Convolutional Networks (Bi-GCN), to explore both characteristics by operating on both top-down and bottom-up propagation of rumors. It leverages a GCN with a top-down directed graph of rumor spreading to learn the patterns of rumor propagation; and a GCN with an opposite directed graph of rumor diffusion to capture the structures of rumor dispersion. Moreover, the information from source post is involved in each layer of GCN to enhance the influences from the roots of rumors. Encouraging empirical results on several benchmarks confirm the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches."}}
