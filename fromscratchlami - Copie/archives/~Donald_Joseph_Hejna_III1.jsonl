Imitation learning (IL) methods based on supervised learning are robust, but require optimal demonstrations, which are hard to collect. Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms promise to learn from sub-optimal data, but face optimization challenges especially with high-dimensional data. To bridge the gap between IL and RL, we introduce Distance Weighted Supervised Learning or DWSL, a supervised method for learning goal-conditioned policies from offline data. DWSL models the entire distribution of time-steps between states in offline data with only supervised learning, and uses this distribution to approximate shortest path distances. To extract a policy, we weight actions by their reduction in distance estimates. Theoretically, DWSL converges to an optimal policy constrained to the data distribution, an attractive property for offline learning, without any bootstrapping. Across all datasets we test, DWSL empirically maintains behavior cloning as a lower bound while still exhibiting policy improvement. In high-dimensional image domains, DWSL surpasses the performance of both prior goal-conditioned IL and RL algorithms.

Preference based RL algorithms seek to overcome these challenges by directly learning reward functions from human feedback. Unfortunately, prior work either requires an unreasonable number of queries implausible for any human to answer or overly restricts the class of reward functions to guarantee the elicitation of the most informative queries, resulting in models that are insufficiently expressive for realistic robotics tasks. Contrary to most works that focus on query selection to \\emph{minimize} the amount of data required for learning reward functions, we take an opposite approach: \\emph{expanding} the pool of available data by viewing human-in-the-loop RL through the more flexible lens of multi-task learning. Motivated by the success of meta-learning, we pre-train preference models on prior task data and quickly adapt them for new tasks using only a handful of queries. Empirically, we reduce the amount of online feedback needed to train manipulation policies in Meta-World by 20$\\times$, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a real Franka Panda Robot. Moreover, this reduction in query-complexity allows us to train robot policies from actual human users.

Difficulties in such settings are exacerbated in low data regimes where over-fitting stifles generalization and compounding errors hurt accuracy. In this work, we explore the use of an often unused source of auxiliary supervision: language. Inspired by recent advances in transformer-based models, we train agents with an instruction prediction loss that encourages learning temporally extended representations that operate at a high level of abstraction. Concretely, we demonstrate that instruction modeling significantly improves performance in planning environments when training with a limited number of demonstrations on the BabyAI and Crafter benchmarks. In further analysis we find that instruction modeling is most important for tasks that require complex reasoning, while understandably offering smaller gains in environments that require simple plans. Our benchmarks and code will be publicly released."}}
