This paper intends to explore other possible directions to effectively and efficiently reduce sparse training costs while preserving accuracy. To this end, we investigate two techniques, namely, layer freezing and data sieving. First, the layer freezing approach has shown its success in dense model training and fine-tuning, yet it has never been adopted in the sparse training domain. Nevertheless, the unique characteristics of sparse training may hinder the incorporation of layer freezing techniques. Therefore, we analyze the feasibility and potentiality of using the layer freezing technique in sparse training and find it has the potential to save considerable training costs. Second, we propose a data sieving method for dataset-efficient training, which further reduces training costs by ensuring only a partial dataset is used throughout the entire training process. We show that both techniques can be well incorporated into the sparse training algorithm to form a generic framework, which we dub SpFDE. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SpFDE can significantly reduce training costs while preserving accuracy from three dimensions: weight sparsity, layer freezing, and dataset sieving.

Meanwhile, the research of LTH in vision transformers (ViTs) is scarcely evaluated. In this paper, we first show that the conventional winning ticket is hard to find at the weight level of ViTs by existing methods. Then, we generalize the LTH for ViTs to input data consisting of image patches inspired by the input dependence of ViTs. That is, there exists a subset of input image patches such that a ViT can be trained from scratch by using only this subset of patches and achieve similar accuracy to the ViTs trained by using all image patches. We call this subset of input patches the em winning tickets, which represent a significant amount of information in the input data. We use a ticket selector to generate the winning tickets based on the informativeness of patches for various types of ViT, including DeiT, LV-ViT, and Swin Transformers. The experiments show that there is a clear difference between the performance of models trained with winning tickets and randomly selected subsets, which verifies our proposed theory. We elaborate on the analogical similarity between our proposed Data-LTH-ViTs and the conventional LTH to further verify the integrity of our theory.

However, it requires a large number of random numbers generated on the fly. This is not a trivial task on the hardware platforms such as FPGA and ASIC. The widely used solution is to introduce random number generators with extra hardware costs. In this paper, we innovatively propose to employ the stochastic property of DNN training process itself and directly extract random numbers from DNNs in a self-sufficient manner. We propose different methods to obtain random numbers from different sources in neural networks and a generator-free framework is proposed for low-precision DNN training on a variety of deep learning tasks. Moreover, we evaluate the quality of the extracted random numbers and find that high-quality random numbers widely exist in DNNs, while their quality can even pass the NIST test suite."}}

Considering the computation complexity, the internal data pattern of ViTs, and the edge device deployment, we propose a latency-aware soft token pruning framework, SPViT, which can be set up on vanilla Transformers of both flatten and hierarchical structures, such as DeiTs and Swin-Transformers (Swin). More concretely, we design a dynamic attention-based multi-head token selector, which is a lightweight module for adaptive instance-wise token selection. We further introduce a soft pruning technique, which integrates the less informative tokens chosen by the selector module into a package token rather than discarding them completely. SPViT is bound to the trade-off between accuracy and latency requirements of specific edge devices through our proposed latency-aware training strategy. Experiment results show that SPViT significantly reduces the computation cost of ViTs with comparable performance on image classification. Moreover, SPViT can guarantee the identified model meets the latency specifications of mobile devices and FPGA, and even achieve the real-time execution of DeiT-T on mobile devices. For example, SPViT reduces the latency of DeiT-T to 26 ms (26%\u221241% superior to existing works) on the mobile device with 0.25%\u22124% higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.

Pruning, a traditional model compression paradigm for hardware efficiency, has been widely applied in various DNN structures. Nevertheless, it stays ambiguous on how to perform exclusive pruning on the ViT structure. Considering three key points: the structural characteristics, the internal data pattern of ViT, and the related edge device deployment, we leverage the input token sparsity and propose a hardware-friendly soft pruning framework (HFSP), which can be set up on vanilla Transformers of both flatten and CNN-type structures, such as Pooling-based ViT (PiT). More concretely, we design a dynamic attention-based multi-head token selector, which is a lightweight module for adaptive instance-wise token selection. We further introduce a soft pruning technique to package the pruned tokens, which integrate the less informative tokens generated by the selector module into a package token, and participates in subsequent calculations rather than being discarded completely.  From a hardware standpoint, our framework is bound to the tradeoff between accuracy and specific hardware constraints through our proposed hardware-oriented progressive training, and all the operators embedded in the framework have been well-supported. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the computational costs of ViTs while maintaining comparable performance on image classification. For example, our method reduces the FLOPs of DeiT-S by over 42.6% while only sacrificing 0.46% top-1 accuracy. Moreover, our framework can guarantee the identified model to meet resource specifications of mobile devices and FPGA, and even achieve the real-time execution of DeiT-T on mobile platforms.
