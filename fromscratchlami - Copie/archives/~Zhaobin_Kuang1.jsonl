Existing work falls into two distinct categories: (i) reinforcement learning employs end-to-end policy learning with flexible factor representation, but does not precisely model the dynamics of asset prices or factors; (ii) continuous-time finance methods, in contrast, take advantage of explicitly modeled dynamics but pre-specify, rather than learn, factor representation. We propose FaLPO (factor learning portfolio optimization), a framework that interpolates between these two approaches. Specifically, FaLPO hinges on deep policy gradient to learn a performant investment policy that takes advantage of flexible representation for stochastic factors. Meanwhile, FaLPO also incorporates continuous-time finance models when modeling the dynamics. It uses the optimal policy functional form derived from such models and optimizes an objective that combines policy learning and model calibration. We prove the convergence of FaLPO, and provide performance guarantees via a finite-sample bound. On both synthetic and real-world portfolio optimization tasks, we observe that FaLPO outperforms five leading methods. Finally, we show that FaLPO can be extended to other decision-making problems with stochastic factors."}}

A major data source for PhV is large-scale longitudinal observational databases (LODs) such as electronic health records (EHRs) and medical insurance claim databases. Inspired by the Multiple Self-Controlled Case Series (MSCCS) model, arguably the leading method for ADE discovery from LODs, we propose baseline regularization, a regularized generalized linear model that leverages the diverse health profiles available in LODs across different individuals at different times . We apply the proposed method as well as MSCCS to the Marshfield Clinic EHR. Experimental results suggest that incorporating the heterogeneity among different patients and different times help to improve the performance in identifying benchmark ADEs from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership ground truth"}}

The simple closed-form screening rule is a necessary and sufficient condition for exactly recovering the blockwise structure of a solution under any given regularization parameters. With enough sparsity, the screening rule can be combined with various optimization procedures to deliver solutions efficiently in practice. The screening rule is especially suitable for large-scale exploratory data analysis, where the number of variables in the dataset can be thousands while we are only interested in the relationship among a handful of variables within moderate-size clusters for interpretability. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the efficiency and insights gained from the introduction of the screening rule."}}

Leveraging the patient-level temporal ordering information between numeric physiological measurements and various drug prescriptions provided in Electronic Health Records (EHRs), we propose a Continuous Self-controlled Case Series (CSCCS) model for CDR. As an initial evaluation, we look for drugs that can control Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG) level in our experiments. Applying CSCCS to the Marshfield Clinic EHR, well-known drugs that are indicated for controlling blood glucose level are rediscovered. Furthermore, some drugs with recent literature support for the potential effect of blood glucose level control are also identified."}}

Longitudinal observational data such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become an emerging data source for CDR. To address the high-dimensional, irregular, subject and time-heterogeneous nature of EHRs, we propose Baseline Regularization (BR) and a variant that extend the one-way fixed effect model, which is a standard approach to analyze small-scale longitudinal data. For evaluation, we use the proposed methods to search for drugs that can lower Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG) level in the Marshfield Clinic EHR. Experimental results suggest that the proposed methods are capable of rediscovering drugs that can lower FBG level as well as identifying some potential blood sugar lowering drugs in the literature."}}
