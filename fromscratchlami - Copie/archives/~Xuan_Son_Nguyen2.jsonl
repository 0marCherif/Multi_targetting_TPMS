Recently, by applying the theory of gyrogroups and gyrovector spaces that is a powerful framework for studying hyperbolic geometry, some works have attempted to build principled generalizations of Euclidean neural networks on matrix manifolds. However, due to the lack of many concepts in gyrovector spaces for the considered manifolds, e.g., the inner product and gyroangles, techniques and mathematical tools provided by these works are still limited compared to those developed for studying hyperbolic geometry. In this paper, we generalize some notions in gyrovector spaces for SPD and Grassmann manifolds, and propose new models and layers for building neural networks on these manifolds. We show the effectiveness of our approach in two applications, i.e., human action recognition and knowledge graph completion."}}

Recently, some SPSD neural networks have been proposed and shown promising performance. While these works share a common idea of generalizing some basic operations in deep neural networks (DNNs) to the SPSD manifold setting, their proposed generalizations are usually designed in an ad hoc manner. In this work, we make an attempt to propose a principled framework for building such generalizations. Our method is motivated by the success of hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) that have demonstrated impressive performance in a variety of applications. At the heart of HNNs is the theory of gyrovector spaces that provides a powerful tool for studying hyperbolic geometry. Here we consider connecting the theory of gyrovector spaces and the Riemannian geometry of SPSD manifolds. We first propose a method to define basic operations, i.e., binary operation and scalar multiplication in gyrovector spaces of (full-rank) Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. We then extend these operations to the low-rank SPSD manifold setting. Finally, we present an approach for building SPSD neural networks. Experimental evaluations on three benchmarks for human activity recognition demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework."}}

In this paper, we propose to exploit high-order statistics in the framework of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for skeleton-based hand gesture recognition. Our method is based on the Statistical Recurrent Units (SRU), an un-gated architecture that has been introduced as an alternative model for Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU). The SRU captures sequential information by generating recurrent statistics that depend on a context of previously seen data and by computing moving averages at different scales. The integration of high-order statistics in the SRU significantly improves the performance of the original one, resulting in a model that is competitive to state-of-the-art methods on the Dynamic Hand Gesture (DHG) dataset, and outperforms them on the First-Person Hand Action (FPHA) dataset."}}

Second, a general-purpose evaluation criterion, power of discrimination, for assessing the efficiency of a shape measure is proposed. The new measure ranges over the interval [0, 1] and produces the value 1 if and only if the measured shape is a perfect circle. The proposed measure is invariant with respect to translation, rotation and scaling transformations. Moreover, it is also robust against border distortion of shapes. It is theoretically well founded and can be extended to other problems of shape measurement. Our approach can deal with complex shapes composed of connected components that cannot be handled by classical contour-based methods. Several experiments show its good behavior and demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of our proposed measure. Finally, we also consider our proposed evaluation criterion for assessing different circularity measures."}}

We first develop a feature representation technique that encodes high-order statistics of local features in two levels, where single Gaussians are used to capture the distributions involved. To deal with the possible loss of information about the distribution of features caused by heterogeneous feature vectors when summarizing them, we use K-means clustering and Sparse Coding to construct some sets of feature vectors over which the summarization is performed. We then present two methods based on depth images and pose data for action recognition. In both methods, the proposed feature representation technique is applied to effectively obtain discriminative action descriptors. Experimental evaluation on the seven benchmark datasets, i.e., MSRAction3D, MSRGesture3D, DHA, SKIG, Florence, UTKinect, and HDM05, shows that our methods achieve very promising results on all the datasets."}}
