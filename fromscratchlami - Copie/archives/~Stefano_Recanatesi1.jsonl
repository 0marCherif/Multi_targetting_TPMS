At the same time, dimensionality reduction techniques generally uncover low-dimensional structures underlying these dynamics. What determines the dimensionality of activity in neural circuits? What is the functional role of dimensionality in behavior and task learning? In this work we address these questions using recurrent neural network (RNN) models. We find that, depending on the dynamics of the initial network, RNNs learn to increase and reduce dimensionality in a way that matches task demands. These findings shed light on fundamental dynamical mechanisms by which neural networks solve tasks with robust representations that generalize to new cases."}}
