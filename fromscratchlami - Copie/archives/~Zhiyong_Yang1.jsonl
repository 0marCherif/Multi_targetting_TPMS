We obtain Grassmannian Frame structure from the optimization and generalization of classification. This structure maximally separates features of every two classes on a sphere and does not require a larger feature dimension than the number of classes. Out of curiosity about the symmetry of Grassmannian Frame, we conduct experiments to explore if models with different Grassmannian Frames have different performance. As a result, we discover the Symmetric Generalization phenomenon. We provide a theorem to explain Symmetric Generalization of permutation. However, the question of why different directions of features can lead to such different generalization is still open for future investigation."}}

There are some studies aiming to solve long-tailed classification from the perspective of feature learning. Recent work proposes to learn the balanced representation by fixing the linear classifier as Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF), since they argue what matters in classification is the structure of the feature, instead of their directions. Holding a different view, in this paper, we show that features with fixed directions may be harmful to the generalization of models, even if it is completely symmetric. To avoid this issue, we propose Representation-Balanced Learning Framework (RBL), which introduces orthogonal matrices to learn directions while maintaining the geometric structure of ETF. Theoretically, our contributions are two-fold: 1). we point out that the feature learning of RBL is insensitive toward training set label distribution, it always learns a balanced representation space. 2). we provide a generalization analysis of proposed RBL through training stability. To analyze the stability of the parameter with orthogonal constraint, we propose a novel training stability analysis paradigm, Two-Parameter Model Stability. Practically, our method is extremely simple in implementation but shows great superiority on several benchmark datasets.\n"}}

Consequently, PAUC optimization has naturally attracted increasing attention in the machine learning community within the last few years. Nonetheless, most of the existing methods could only optimize PAUC approximately, leading to inevitable biases that are not controllable. Fortunately, a recent work presents an unbiased formulation of the PAUC optimization problem via distributional robust optimization. However, it is based on the pair-wise formulation of AUC, which suffers from the limited scalability w.r.t. sample size and a slow convergence rate, especially for TPAUC. To address this issue, we present a simpler reformulation of the problem in an asymptotically unbiased and instance-wise manner. For both OPAUC and TPAUC, we come to a nonconvex strongly concave min-max regularized problem of instance-wise functions. On top of this, we employ an efficient solver that enjoys a linear per-iteration computational complexity w.r.t. the sample size and a time-complexity of $O(\\epsilon^{-1/3})$ to reach a $\\epsilon$ stationary point. Furthermore, we find that the min-max reformulation also facilitates the theoretical analysis of generalization error as a byproduct. Compared with the existing results, we present new error bounds that are much easier to prove and could deal with hypotheses with real-valued outputs. Finally, extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}}

Different from previous uni-modal KGE approaches, multi-modal KGE can leverage expressive knowledge from a wealth of modalities (image, text, etc.), leading to more comprehensive representations of real-world entities. However, the critical challenge along this course lies in that the multi-modal embedding spaces are usually heterogeneous. In this sense, direct fusion will destroy the inherent spatial structure of different modal embeddings. To overcome this challenge, we revisit multi-modal KGE from a distributional alignment perspective and propose optimal transport knowledge graph embeddings (OTKGE). Specifically, we model the multi-modal fusion procedure as a transport plan moving different modal embeddings to a unified space by minimizing the Wasserstein distance between multi-modal distributions. Theoretically, we show that by minimizing the Wasserstein distance between the individual modalities and the unified embedding space, the final results are guaranteed to maintain consistency and comprehensiveness. Moreover, experimental results on well-established multi-modal knowledge graph completion benchmarks show that our OTKGE achieves state-of-the-art performance."}}

Following the convention of RS, existing methods exploit unique user representation in their model design. This paper focuses on a challenging scenario where a user has multiple categories of interests. Under this setting, we argue that the unique user representation might induce preference bias, especially when the item category distribution is imbalanced. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning (DPCML), with the hope of considering the commonly ignored minority interest of the user. The key idea behind DPCML is to include a multiple set of representations for each user in the system. Based on this embedding paradigm, user preference toward an item is aggregated from different embeddings by taking the minimum item-user distance among the user embedding set. Furthermore, we observe that the diversity of the embeddings for the same user also plays an essential role in the model. To this end, we propose a diversity control regularization term to accommodate the multi-vector representation strategy better. Theoretically, we show that DPCML could generalize well to unseen test data by tackling the challenge of the annoying operation that comes from the minimum value. Experiments over a range of benchmark datasets speak to the efficacy of DPCML."}}

While in many practical scenarios, it is inevitable that some test samples belong to unknown classes (open-set). To fix this issue, Open-Set Recognition (OSR), whose goal is to make correct predictions on both close-set samples and open-set samples, has attracted rising attention. In this direction, the vast majority of literature focuses on the pattern of open-set samples. However, how to evaluate model performance in this challenging task is still unsolved. In this paper, a systematic analysis reveals that most existing metrics are essentially inconsistent with the aforementioned goal of OSR: (1) For metrics extended from close-set classification, such as Open-set F-score, Youden's index, and Normalized Accuracy, a poor open-set prediction can escape from a low performance score with a superior close-set prediction. (2) Novelty detection AUC, which measures the ranking performance between close-set and open-set samples, ignores the close-set performance. To fix these issues, we propose a novel metric named OpenAUC. Compared with existing metrics, OpenAUC enjoys a concise pairwise formulation that evaluates open-set performance and close-set performance in a coupling manner. Further analysis shows that OpenAUC is free from the aforementioned inconsistency properties. Finally, an end-to-end learning method is proposed to minimize the OpenAUC risk, and the experimental results on popular benchmark datasets speak to its effectiveness."}}

Although various algorithms have been extensively studied for AUPRC optimization, the generalization is only guaranteed in the multi-query case. In this work, we present the first trial in the single-query generalization of stochastic AUPRC optimization. For sharper generalization bounds, we focus on algorithm-dependent generalization. There are both algorithmic and theoretical obstacles to our destination. From an algorithmic perspective, we notice that the majority of existing stochastic estimators are biased when the sampling strategy is biased, and is leave-one-out unstable due to the non-decomposability. To address these issues, we propose a sampling-rate-invariant unbiased stochastic estimator with superior stability. On top of this, the AUPRC optimization is formulated as a composition optimization problem, and a stochastic algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. From a theoretical perspective, standard techniques of the algorithm-dependent generalization analysis cannot be directly applied to such a listwise compositional optimization problem. To fill this gap, we extend the model stability from instancewise losses to listwise losses and bridge the corresponding generalization and stability. Additionally, we construct state transition matrices to describe the recurrence of the stability, and simplify calculations by matrix spectrum. Practically, experimental results on three image retrieval datasets on speak to the effectiveness and soundness of our framework."}}

Despite that AUC reflects the overall performance of the model, it is inconsistent with the expected performance in some application scenarios, where only a low False Positive Rate (FPR) is meaningful. To leverage high performance under low FPRs, we consider an alternative metric for multipartite ranking evaluating the True Positive Rate (TPR) at a given FPR, denoted as TPR@FPR. Unfortunately, the key challenge of direct  TPR@FPR optimization is two-fold: \\textbf{a)} the original objective function is not differentiable, making gradient backpropagation impossible; \\textbf{b)} the loss function could not be written as a sum of independent instance-wise terms, making mini-batch based optimization infeasible. \n     To address these issues, we propose a novel framework on top of the deep learning framework named \\textit{Cross-Batch Approximation for Multipartite Ranking (CBA-MR)}. In face of \\textbf{a)},  we propose a differentiable surrogate optimization problem where the instances having a short-time effect on FPR are rendered with different weights based on the random walk hypothesis. To tackle \\textbf{b)}, we propose a fast ranking estimation method, where the full-batch loss evaluation is replaced by a delayed update scheme with the help of an embedding cache.

These ordinal comparisons often come from human annotators, and sufficient comparisons induce the success of classical approaches. However, collecting a large number of labeled data is known as a hard task, and most of the existing work pay little attention to the generalization ability with insufficient samples. Meanwhile, recent progress in large margin theory discloses that rather than just maximizing the minimum margin, both the margin mean and variance, which characterize the margin distribution, are more crucial to the overall generalization performance. To address the issue of insufficient training samples, we propose a margin distribution learning paradigm for ordinal embedding, entitled Distributional Margin based Ordinal Embedding (DMOE). Precisely, we first define the margin for ordinal embedding problem. Secondly, we formulate a concise objective function which avoids maximizing margin mean and minimizing margin variance directly but exhibits the similar effect. Moreover, an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier based algorithm is customized to seek the optimal solution of DMOE effectively. Experimental studies on both simulated and realworld datasets are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}}

To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel multi-task learning method, which simultaneously learns latent task representations and a block-diagonal Latent Task Assignment Matrix (LTAM). Different from most of the previous work, pursuing the Block-Diagonal structure of LTAM (assigning latent tasks to output tasks) alleviates negative transfer via collaboratively grouping latent tasks and output tasks such that inter-group knowledge transfer and sharing is suppressed. This goal is challenging, since 1) our notion of Block-Diagonal Property extends the traditional notion for square matrices where the $i$-th column and the $i$-th column represents the same concept; 2) marginal constraints on rows and columns are also required for avoiding isolated latent/output tasks. Facing such challenges, we propose  a novel regularizer by means of an equivalent spectral condition realizing this generalized block-diagonal property. Practically, we provide a relaxation scheme which improves the flexibility of the model. With the objective function given, we then propose an alternating optimization method, which not only tells how negative transfer is alleviated in our method but also reveals an interesting connection between our method and the optimal transport problem.  Finally, the method is demonstrated on a simulation dataset, three real-world benchmark datasets and further applied to personalized attribute predictions."}}
