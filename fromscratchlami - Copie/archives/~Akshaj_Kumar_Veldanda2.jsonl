The proposed method is comprised of two parts: off-line training and on-line retraining. In the off-line training, a novelty detector and a shallow neural network are trained with clean validation data. During the on-line implementation, both models attempt to detect samples from the streaming data that differ from the validation data (i.e., flag likely-poisoned samples and possibly a few clean samples as false positives). An anomaly detector is used to purify the anomalous data by removing the clean samples. A binary support vector machine (SVM) is trained with the purified anomalous data and the clean validation data. RAID uses the SVM to detect poisoned inputs. To increase the accuracy as new anomalous data is being detected, the SVM is updated as well in real-time. It is shown that with updating, RAID can efficiently reduce the attack success rate while maintaining the classification accuracy against various types of backdoor attacks. The efficacy of RAID is compared against several state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, it is shown that RAID only requires a small clean validation dataset to achieve such performance, and therefore provides a practical and efficient approach."}}

Although sensitive attributes are typically assumed to be known during training, they may not be available in practice due to privacy and other logistical concerns. Recent work has sought to train fair models without sensitive attributes on training data. However, these methods need extensive hyper-parameter tuning to achieve good results, and hence assume that sensitive attributes are known on validation data. However, this assumption too might not be practical. Here, we propose a framework to train fair classifiers without access to sensitive attributes on either training or validation data. Instead, we generate pseudo sensitive attributes on the validation data by training a biased classifier and using the classifier\u2019s incorrectly (correctly) labeled examples as proxies for minority (majority) groups. Since fairness metrics like demographic parity, equal opportunity and subgroup accuracy can be estimated to within a proportionality constant even with noisy sensitive attribute information, we show theoretically and empirically that these proxy labels can be used to maximize fairness under average accuracy constraints. Key to our results is a principled approach to select the hyper-parameters of the biased classifier in a completely unsupervised fashion (meaning without access to ground truth sensitive attributes) that minimizes the gap between fairness estimated using noisy versus ground-truth sensitive labels."}}

In the pre-deployment stage, NNoculation retrains the BadNet with random perturbations of clean validation inputs to partially reduce the adversarial impact of a backdoor. Post-deployment, NNoculation detects and quarantines backdoored test inputs by recording disagreements between the original and pre-deployment patched networks. A CycleGAN is then trained to learn transformations between clean validation and quarantined inputs; i.e., it learns to add triggers to clean validation images. Backdoored validation images along with their correct labels are used to further retrain the pre-deployment patched network, yielding our final defense. Empirical evaluation on a comprehensive suite of backdoor attacks show that NNoculation outperforms all state-of-the-art defenses that make restrictive assumptions and only work on specific backdoor attacks, or fail on adaptive attacks. In contrast, NNoculation makes minimal assumptions and provides an effective defense, even under settings where existing defenses are ineffective due to attackers circumventing their restrictive assumptions."}}

Our defense is based on the intuition that the feature extraction layers of a backdoored network embed new features to detect the presence of a trigger and the subsequent classification layers learn to mispredict when triggers are detected. Therefore, to detect backdoors, the proposed defense uses two synergistic anomaly detectors trained on clean validation data: the first is a novelty detector that checks for anomalous features, while the second detects anomalous mappings from features to outputs by comparing with a separate classifier trained on validation data. The approach is evaluated on a wide range of backdoored networks (with multiple variations of triggers) that successfully evade state-of-the-art defenses. Additionally, we evaluate the robustness of our approach on imperceptible perturbations, scalability on large-scale datasets, and effectiveness under domain shift. This paper also shows that the defense can be further improved using data augmentation."}}
