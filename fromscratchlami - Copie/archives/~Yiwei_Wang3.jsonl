This type of model is usually with a complicated, non-smooth, and non-convex loss function landscape. However, when we train the model, simply using the first-order optimization algorithm like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) could acquire some good results, in both training and testing, albeit that SGD is known to not guarantee convergence for non-smooth and non-convex cases. Theoretically, it was previously proved that in training, SGD converges to the global optimum with probability $1 - \\epsilon$, but only for certain models and $\\epsilon$ depends on the model complexity. It was also observed that SGD tends to choose a flat minimum, which preserves its training performance in testing. In this paper, we first prove that SGD could iterate to the global optimum almost surely under arbitrary initial value and some mild assumptions on the loss function. Then, we prove that if the learning rate is larger than a value depending on the structure of a global minimum, the probability of converging to this global optimum is zero. Finally, we acquire the asymptotic convergence rate based on the local structure of the global optimum. "}}
