The problem and its solution amounts to controlling the spin of a rigid body via feedback, and is of practical importance, for example, in angular stabilization of a spacecraft with stochastic initial and terminal states. We clarify how this problem is an instance of the optimal mass transport (OMT) problem with bilinear prior drift. We deduce both static and dynamic versions of the Eulerian OMT, and provide analytical and numerical results for the synthesis of the optimal controller."}}

Generalizing the finite population deterministic models proposed in prior works for individual chiplet position dynamics, we derive a controlled mean field model for a continuum of chiplet population in the form of a nonlocal, nonlinear partial differential equation. The proposed model accounts for the stochastic forces as well as two different types of nonlocal interactions, viz. chiplet-to-chiplet and chiplet-to-electrode interactions. Both of these interactions are nonlinear functions of the electrode voltage input. We prove that the deduced mean field evolution can be expressed as the Wasserstein gradient flow of a Lyapunov-like energy functional. With respect to this functional, the resulting dynamics is a gradient descent on the manifold of joint population density functions with finite second moments that are supported on the position coordinates."}}

The proposed approach consists of reformulating the optimal control problem as a mixed integer quadratic problem (MIQP), which can be solved using well-established algorithms in the literature. Specifically, the given discretized hybrid control system is transformed into a mixed logical dynamical (MLD) system that, for the class of discretized hybrid control systems considered, gives rise to an MIQP. The MLD model is obtained through an intermediate step that transforms the discretized hybrid control system into a discrete-time control system."}}

In this paper, we explore applying mean field learning dynamics as a computational algorithm, rather than as an analytical tool. Specifically, we design a Sinkhorn regularized proximal algorithm to approximate the distributional flow from the learning dynamics in the mean field regime over weighted point clouds. In this setting, a contractive fixed point recursion computes the time-varying weights, numerically realizing the interacting Wasserstein gradient flow of the parameter distribution supported over the neuronal ensemble. An appealing aspect of the proposed algorithm is that the measure-valued recursions allow meshless computation. We demonstrate the proposed computational framework of interacting weighted particle evolution on binary and multi-class classification. Our algorithm performs gradient descent of the free energy associated with the risk functional."}}

The control objective is formulated in terms of steering the state PDFs from a prescribed initial probability measure towards a prescribed terminal probability measure with minimum control effort. For specificity, we use a univariate stochastic state model from the literature. Both the analysis and the computational steps for control synthesis as developed in this paper generalize for multivariate stochastic state dynamics given by generic nonlinear in state and non-affine in control models. We derive the conditions of optimality for the associated optimal control problem. This derivation yields a system of three coupled partial differential equations together with the boundary conditions at the initial and terminal times. The resulting system is a generalized instance of the so-called Schr\\\"{o}dinger bridge problem. We then determine the optimal control policy by training a physics-informed deep neural network, where the \"physics\" are the derived conditions of optimality. The performance of the proposed solution is demonstrated via numerical simulations on a benchmark colloidal self-assembly problem."}}

Such problems arise in several contexts in stochastic learning and control including Langevin sampling from an unnormalized prior, mean field neural network learning and Wasserstein gradient flows. The proposed algorithm comprises a two-layer alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The outer-layer ADMM generalizes the Euclidean consensus ADMM to the Wasserstein consensus ADMM, and to its entropy-regularized version Sinkhorn consensus ADMM. The inner-layer ADMM turns out to be a specific instance of the standard Euclidean ADMM.
