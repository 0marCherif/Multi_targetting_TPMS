Prevalent scenario of continual learning, however, assumes disjoint sets of classes as tasks and is less realistic rather artificial. Instead, we focus on 'blurry' task boundary; where tasks shares classes and is more realistic and practical. To address such task, we argue the importance of diversity of samples in an episodic memory. To enhance the sample diversity in the memory, we propose a novel memory management strategy based on per-sample classification uncertainty and data augmentation, named Rainbow Memory (RM). With extensive empirical validations on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets, we show that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy in blurry continual learning setups, outperforming state of the arts by large margins despite its simplicity.

Specifically, we re-examine the effectiveness of the standard convolutional block as a lightweight backbone architecture on face detection. Unlike the current tendency of lightweight architecture design, which heavily utilizes depthwise separable convolution layers, we show that heavily channel-pruned standard convolution layer can achieve better accuracy and inference speed when using a similar parameter size. This observation is supported by the analyses concerning the characteristics of the target data domain, face. Based on our observation, we propose to employ ResNet with a highly reduced channel, which surprisingly allows high efficiency compared to other mobile-friendly networks (e.g., MobileNet-V1,-V2,-V3). From the extensive experiments, we show that the proposed backbone can replace that of the state-of-the-art face detector with a faster inference speed. Also, we further propose a new feature aggregation method maximizing the detection performance. Our proposed detector EResFD obtained 80.4% mAP on WIDER FACE Hard subset which only takes 37.7 ms for VGA image inference in on CPU. Code will be available at https://github.com/clovaai/EResFD."}}

Compared to WSSS, WSIS requires instance-wise localization, which is difficult to extract from image-level labels. To tackle the problem, most WSIS approaches use off-the-shelf proposal techniques that require pre-training with instance or object level labels, deviating the fundamental definition of the fully-image-level supervised setting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach including two innovative components. First, we propose a semantic knowledge transfer to obtain pseudo instance labels by transferring the knowledge of WSSS to WSIS while eliminating the need for the off-the-shelf proposals. Second, we propose a self-refinement method to refine the pseudo instance labels in a self-supervised scheme and to use the refined labels for training in an online manner. Here, we discover an erroneous phenomenon, semantic drift, that occurred by the missing instances in pseudo instance labels categorized as background class. This semantic drift occurs confusion between background and instance in training and consequently degrades the segmentation performance. We term this problem as semantic drift problem and show that our proposed self-refinement method eliminates the semantic drift problem. The extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we achieve a considerable performance without off-the-shelf proposal techniques.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:(i) A new regression method estimating high dimensional image responses, which is not handled by existing regression algorithms, is proposed.(ii) The proposed regression method introduces a strategy to learn the latent space as well as the encoder and decoder so that the result of the regressed response in the latent space coincide with the corresponding response in the data space.(iii) The proposed regression is embedded into a generative model, and the whole procedure is developed by the variational autoencoder framework.

However, the problem has been considered as a subset of the object segmentation problem and less handled in the semantic segmentation field. Obviously, portrait segmentation has its unique requirements. First, because the portrait segmentation is performed in the middle of a whole process of many real-world applications, it requires extremely lightweight models. Second, there has not been any public datasets in this domain that contain a sufficient number of images with unbiased statistics. To solve the first problem, we introduce the new extremely lightweight portrait segmentation model SINet, containing an information blocking decoder and spatial squeeze modules. The information blocking decoder uses confidence estimates to recover local spatial information without spoiling global consistency. The spatial squeeze module uses multiple receptive fields to cope with various sizes of consistency in the image. To tackle the second problem, we propose a simple method to create additional portrait segmentation data which can improve accuracy on the EG1800 dataset. In our qualitative and quantitative analysis on the EG1800 dataset, we show that our method outperforms various existing lightweight segmentation models. Our method reduces the number of parameters from 2.1M to 86.9K (around 95.9% reduction), while maintaining the accuracy under an 1% margin from the state-of-the-art portrait segmentation method. We also show our model is successfully executed on a real mobile device with 100.6 FPS. In addition, we demonstrate that our method can be used for general semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset. The code and dataset are available in this https URL ."}}

We argue the accuracy of a lightweight model has been further limited by the design convention: a stage-wise configuration of the channel dimensions, which looks like a piecewise linear function of the network stage. In this paper, we study an effective channel dimension configuration towards better performance than the convention. To this end, we empirically study how to design a single layer properly by analyzing the rank of the output feature. We then investigate the channel configuration of a model by searching network architectures concerning the channel configuration under the computational cost restriction. Based on the investigation, we propose a simple yet effective channel configuration that can be parameterized by the layer index. As a result, our proposed model following the channel parameterization achieves remarkable performance on ImageNet classification and transfer learning tasks including COCO object detection, COCO instance segmentation, and fine-grained classifications.

While existing multi-scale face detectors extract feature maps with different scales from a single backbone network, our method generates the feature maps by iteratively reusing a shared lightweight and shallow backbone network. This iterative sharing of the backbone network significantly reduces the number of parameters, and also provides the abstract image semantics captured from the higher stage of the network layers to the lower-level feature map. The proposed idea is employed by various model architectures and evaluated by extensive experiments. From the experiments from WIDER FACE dataset, we show that the proposed face detector can handle faces with various scale and conditions, and achieved comparable performance to the more massive face detectors that few hundreds and tens times heavier in model size and floating point operations."}}
