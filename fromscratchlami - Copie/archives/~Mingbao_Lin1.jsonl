Nevertheless, a significant challenge of BNNs lies in handling discrete constraints while ensuring bit entropy maximization, which typically makes their weight optimization very difficult. Existing methods relax the learning using the sign function, which simply encodes positive weights into <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$+1$</tex-math></inline-formula> s, and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$-1$</tex-math></inline-formula> s otherwise. Alternatively, we formulate an angle alignment objective to constrain the weight binarization to <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\lbrace 0,+1\\rbrace$</tex-math></inline-formula> to solve the challenge. In this article, we show that our weight binarization provides an analytical solution by encoding high-magnitude weights into <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$+1$</tex-math></inline-formula> s, and 0s otherwise. Therefore, a high-quality discrete solution is established in a computationally efficient manner without the sign function. We prove that the learned weights of binarized networks roughly follow a Laplacian distribution that does not allow entropy maximization, and further demonstrate that it can be effectively solved by simply removing the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\ell _{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula> regularization during network training. Our method, dubbed sign-to-magnitude network binarization (SiMaN), is evaluated on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrating its superiority over the sign-based state-of-the-arts.

In this paper, we propose a novel 1\u00d7N pruning pattern to break this limitation. In particular, consecutive N output kernels with the same input channel index are grouped into one block, which serves as a basic pruning granularity of our pruning pattern. Our 1\u00d7N pattern prunes these blocks considered unimportant. We also provide a workflow of filter rearrangement that first rearranges the weight matrix in the output channel dimension to derive more influential blocks for accuracy improvements and then applies similar rearrangement to the next-layer weights in the input channel dimension to ensure correct convolutional operations. Moreover, the output computation after our 1\u00d7N pruning can be realized via a parallelized block-wise vectorized operation, leading to significant speedups on general CPUs. The efficacy of our pruning pattern is proved with experiments on ILSVRC-2012. For example, given the pruning rate of 50% and N=4, our pattern obtains about 3.0% improvements over filter pruning in the top-1 accuracy of MobileNet-V2. Meanwhile, it obtains 56.04ms inference savings on Cortex-A7 CPU over weight pruning.

Revealed by our analyses, the problems are caused by feature distribution crumbling, which leads to class confusion when continuously embedding few samples to a fixed feature space. In this study, we propose a Dynamic Support Network (DSN), which refers to an adaptively updating network with compressive node expansion to \u201csupport\u201d the feature space. In each training session, DSN tentatively expands network nodes to enlarge feature representation capacity for incremental classes. It then dynamically compresses the expanded network by node self-activation to pursue compact feature representation, which alleviates over-fitting. Simultaneously, DSN selectively recalls old class distributions during incremental learning to support feature distributions and avoid confusion between classes. DSN with compressive node expansion and class distribution recalling provides a systematic solution for the problems of catastrophic forgetting and overfitting. Experiments on CUB, CIFAR-100, and miniImage datasets show that DSN significantly improves upon the baseline approach, achieving new state-of-the-arts."}}

Therefore, we present a novel method of Bi-directional Masks (Bi-Mask) with its two central innovations in: 1) Separate sparse masks in the two directions of forward and backward propagation to obtain training acceleration. It disentangles the forward and backward weight sparsity and overcomes the very dense gradient computation. 2) An efficient weight row permutation method to maintain performance. It picks up the permutation candidate with the most eligible N:M weight blocks in the backward to minimize the gradient gap between traditional uni-directional masks and our bi-directional masks. Compared with existing uni-directional scenario that applies a transposable mask and enables backward acceleration, our Bi-Mask is experimentally demonstrated to be more superior in performance. Also, our Bi-Mask performs on par with or even better than methods that fail to achieve backward acceleration. Project of this paper is available at \\url{https://github.com/zyxxmu/Bi-Mask}."}}

Despite the advance of CNNs in image demoireing, existing networks are with heavy design, causing redundant computation burden for mobile devices. In this paper, we launch the first study on accelerating demoireing networks and propose a dynamic demoireing acceleration method (DDA) towards a real-time deployment on mobile devices. Our stimulus stems from a simple-yet-universal fact that moire patterns often unbalancedly distribute across an image. Consequently, excessive computation is wasted upon non-moire areas. Therefore, we reallocate computation costs in proportion to the complexity of image patches. In order to achieve this aim, we measure the complexity of an image patch by designing a novel moire prior that considers both colorfulness and frequency information of moire patterns. Then, we restore image patches with higher-complexity using larger networks and the ones with lower-complexity are assigned with smaller networks to relieve the computation burden. At last, we train all networks in a parameter-shared supernet paradigm to avoid additional parameter burden. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed DDA. In addition, the acceleration evaluated on the VIVO X80 Pro smartphone equipped with a chip of Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 shows that our method can drastically reduce the inference time, leading to a real-time image demoireing on mobile devices.

The over-increasing Winograd parameters not only exacerbate training complexity but also barricade the practical speedups due simply to the volume of element-wise products in the Winograd domain. We attempt to reduce trainable parameters by introducing a low-rank Winograd transformation, a novel training paradigm that decouples the original large tensor into two less storage-required trainable tensors, leading to a significant complexity reduction. Built upon our low-rank Winograd transformation, we take one step ahead by proposing a low-rank oriented sparse granularity that measures column-wise parameter importance. By simply involving the non-zero columns in the element-wise product, our sparse granularity is empowered with the ability to produce a very regular sparse pattern to acquire effectual Winograd speedups. To better understand the efficacy of our method, we perform extensive experiments on 3D CNNs. Results manifest that our low-rank Winograd transformation well outperforms the vanilla Winograd transformation. We also show that our proposed low-rank oriented sparse granularity permits practical Winograd acceleration compared with the vanilla counterpart."}}

Quantization stands out as a solution by representing the network in low-bit parameters and operations. However, there is a significant performance drop when performing low-bit quantized DETR (Q-DETR) with existing quantization methods. We find that the bottlenecks of Q-DETR come from the query information distortion through our empirical analyses. This paper addresses this problem based on a distribution rectification distillation (DRD). We formulate our DRD as a bi-level optimization problem, which can be derived by generalizing the information bottleneck (IB) principle to the learning of Q-DETR. At the inner level, we conduct a distribution alignment for the queries to maximize the self-information entropy. At the upper level, we introduce a new foreground-aware query matching scheme to effectively transfer the teacher information to distillation-desired features to minimize the conditional information entropy. Extensive experimental results show that our method performs much better than prior arts. For example, the 4-bit Q-DETR can theoretically accelerate DETR with ResNet-50 backbone by 6.6x and achieve 39.4% AP, with only 2.6% performance gaps than its real-valued counterpart on the COCO dataset."}}

However, there is a severe performance drop compared with real-valued networks, due to its intrinsic frequent weight oscillation during training. In this paper, we introduce a Resilient Binary Neural Network (ReBNN) to mitigate the frequent oscillation for better BNNs' training. We identify that the weight oscillation mainly stems from the non-parametric scaling factor. To address this issue, we propose to parameterize the scaling factor and introduce a weighted reconstruction loss to build an adaptive training objective. For the first time, we show that the weight oscillation is controlled by the balanced parameter attached to the reconstruction loss, which provides a theoretical foundation to parameterize it in back propagation. Based on this, we learn our ReBNN by calculating the balanced parameter based on its maximum magnitude, which can effectively mitigate the weight oscillation with a resilient training process. Extensive experiments are conducted upon various network models, such as ResNet and Faster-RCNN for computer vision, as well as BERT for natural language processing. The results demonstrate the overwhelming performance of our ReBNN over prior arts. For example, our ReBNN achieves 66.9% Top-1 accuracy with ResNet-18 backbone on the ImageNet dataset, surpassing existing state-of-the-arts by a significant margin.

In this paper, we observe an interesting phenomenon of intra-class heterogeneity in real data and show that existing methods fail to retain this property in their synthetic images, which causes a limited performance increase. To address this issue, we propose a novel zeroshot quantization method referred to as IntraQ. First, we propose a local object reinforcement that locates the target objects at different scales and positions of the synthetic images. Second, we introduce a marginal distance constraint\nto form class-related features distributed in a coarse area. Lastly, we devise a soft inception loss which injects a soft prior label to prevent the synthetic images from being overfitting to a fixed object. Our IntraQ is demonstrated to well retain the intra-class heterogeneity in the synthetic images and also observed to perform state-of-the-art.

To alleviate this limitation, in this paper, we leverage the synthetic data introduced by zeroshot quantization with calibration dataset and propose a fine-grained data distribution alignment (FDDA) method to boost the performance of post-training quantization. The method is based on two important properties of batch normalization statistics (BNS) we observed in deep layers of the trained network, i.e., inter-class separation and intra-class incohesion. To preserve this fine-grained distribution information: 1) We calculate the per-class BNS of the calibration dataset as the BNS centers of each class and propose a BNS-centralized loss to force the synthetic data distributions of different classes to be close to their own centers. 2) We add Gaussian noise into the centers to imitate the incohesion and propose a BNS-distorted loss to force the synthetic data distribution of the same class to be close to the distorted centers. By utilizing these two fine-grained losses, our method manifests the state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, especially when both the first and last layers are quantized to the low-bit. "}}
