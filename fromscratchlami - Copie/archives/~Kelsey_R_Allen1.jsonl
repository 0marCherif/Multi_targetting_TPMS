What determines which objects are actually included in our representations? We asked participants to predict how a ball will bounce through a complex field of obstacles, and probed working memory for objects in the scene that were more and less likely to be relevant to the ball\u2019s trajectory. We evaluate differ-\nent accounts of relevance and find that successful object memory is best predicted by how frequently a ball\u2019s trajectory is expected to contact that object under a probabilistic simulation model. This suggests that people construct representations for mental simulation efficiently and dynamically, on the fly, by adding objects \u201cjust in time\u201d: only when they are expected to."}}

For many real-world engineering problems, the objective function takes the form of a simulator that predicts how the system state will evolve over time, and the design challenge is to optimize the initial conditions that lead to a target outcome. Recent developments in learned simulation have shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) can be used for accurate, efficient, differentiable estimation of simulator dynamics, and support high-quality design optimization with gradient- or sampling-based optimization procedures. However, optimizing designs from scratch requires many expensive model queries, and these procedures exhibit basic failures on either non-convex or high-dimensional problems. In this work, we show how denoising diffusion models (DDMs) can be used to solve inverse design problems efficiently and propose a particle sampling algorithm for further improving their efficiency. We perform experiments on a number of fluid dynamics design challenges, and find that our approach substantially reduces the number of calls to the simulator compared to standard techniques."}}

While graph neural network (GNN)-based models are effective at learning to simulate complex physical dynamics, such as fluids, cloth and articulated bodies, they have been less effective and efficient on rigid-body physics, except with very simple shapes. Existing methods that model collisions through the meshes' nodes are often inaccurate because they struggle when collisions occur on faces far from nodes. Alternative approaches that represent the geometry densely with many particles are prohibitively expensive for complex shapes. Here we introduce the ``Face Interaction Graph Network'' (FIGNet) which extends beyond GNN-based methods, and computes interactions between mesh faces, rather than nodes. Compared to learned node- and particle-based methods, FIGNet is around 4x more accurate in simulating complex shape interactions, while also 8x more computationally efficient on sparse, rigid meshes. Moreover, FIGNet can learn frictional dynamics directly from real-world data, and can be more accurate than analytical solvers given modest amounts of training data. FIGNet represents a key step forward in one of the few remaining physical domains which have seen little competition from learned simulators, and offers allied fields such as robotics, graphics and mechanical design a new tool for simulation and model-based planning."}}

A common claim is that deep networks are incapable of accurately modeling rigid-body dynamics without explicit modules for handling contacts, due to the continuous nature of how deep networks are parameterized. Here we investigate this claim with experiments on established real and simulated datasets and show that general-purpose graph network simulators, with no contact-specific assumptions, can learn and predict contact discontinuities. Furthermore, contact dynamics learned by graph network simulators capture real-world cube tossing trajectories more accurately than highly engineered robotics simulators, even when provided with only 8 -- 16 trajectories. Overall, this suggests that rigid-body dynamics do not pose a fundamental challenge for deep networks with the appropriate general architecture and parameterization.  Instead, our work opens new directions for considering when deep learning-based models might be preferable to traditional simulation environments for accurately modeling real-world contact dynamics."}}
