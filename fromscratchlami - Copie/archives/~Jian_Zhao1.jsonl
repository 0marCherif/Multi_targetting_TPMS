The appearance of a human face changes substantially over time, resulting in significant intra-class variations. As opposed to current techniques for age-invariant face recognition, which either directly extract age-invariant features for recognition, or first synthesize a face that matches target age before feature extraction, we argue that it is more desirable to perform both tasks jointly so that they can leverage each other. To this end, we propose a deep Age-Invariant Model (AIM) for face recognition in the wild with three distinct novelties. First, AIM presents a novel unified deep architecture jointly performing cross-age face synthesis and recognition in a mutual boosting way. Second, AIM achieves continuous face rejuvenation/aging with remarkable photorealistic and identity-preserving properties, avoiding the requirement of paired data and the true age of testing samples. Third, we develop effective and novel training strategies for end-to-end learning the whole deep architecture, which generates powerful age-invariant face representations explicitly disentangled from the age variation. Moreover, we propose a new large-scale Cross-Age Face Recognition (CAFR) benchmark dataset to facilitate existing efforts and push the frontiers of age-invariant face recognition research. Extensive experiments on both our CAFR and several other cross-age datasets (MORPH, CACD and FG-NET) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AIM model over the state-of-the-arts. Benchmarking our model on one of the most popular unconstrained face recognition datasets IJB-C additionally verifies the promising generalizability of AIM in recognizing faces in the wild."}}

Compared with current techniques for pose-invariant face recognition, which either expect pose invariance from hand-crafted features or data-driven deep learning solutions, or first normalize profile face images to frontal pose before feature extraction, we argue that it is more desirable to perform both tasks jointly to allow them to benefit from each other. To this end, we propose a Pose-Invariant Model (PIM) for face recognition in the wild, with three distinct novelties.

However, learning from synthetic faces may not achieve the desired performance due to the discrepancy betwedistributions of the synthetic and real face images. To narrow this gap, we propose a Dual-Agent Generative Adversarial Network (DA-GAN) model, which can improve the realism of a face simulator's output using unlabeled real faces while preserving the identity information during the realism refinement. The dual agents are specially designed for distinguishing real versus fake and identities simultaneously. In particular, we employ an off-the-shelf 3D face model as a simulator to generate profile face images with varying poses. DA-GAN leverages a fully convolutional network as the generator to generate high-resolution images and an auto-encoder as the discriminator with the dual agents. Besides the novel architecture, we make several key modifications to the standard GAN to preserve pose, texture as well as identity, and stabilize the training process: (i) a pose perception loss; (ii) an identity perception loss; (iii) an adversarial loss with a boundary equilibrium regularization term. Experimental results show that DA-GAN not only achieves outstanding perceptual results but also significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts on the large-scale and challenging NIST IJB-A and CFP unconstrained face recognition benchmarks. In addition, the proposed DA-GAN is also a promising new approach for solving generic transfer learning problems more effectively. DA-GAN is the foundation of our winning entry to the NIST IJB-A face recognition competition in which we secured the 1 <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">st</sup> places on the tracks of verification and identification."}}

The proposed MATN takes region proposals as localization anchors, and learns a multi-scale correspondence network to continuously search for phrase regions referring to the anchors. In this way, MATN can exploit useful cues from these anchors to reliably reason about locations of the regions described by the phrases given only image-level supervision. Through differentiable sampling on image spatial feature maps, MATN introduces a novel training objective to simultaneously minimize a contrastive reconstruction loss between different phrases from a single image and a set of triplet losses among multiple images with similar phrases. Superior to existing region proposal based methods, MATN searches for the optimal bounding box over the entire feature map instead of selecting a sub-optimal one from discrete region proposals. We evaluate MATN on the Flickr30K Entities and ReferItGame datasets. The experimental results show that MATN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."}}

DCCN consists of dual subnets: DyConvNet contains a dynamic convolutional layer with a bank of basis filters; CondiNet predicts a set of adaptive weights from conditional inputs to linearly combine the basis filters. In this manner, a specific convolutional kernel can be dynamically obtained for each conditional input. The filter bank is shared between all conditions thus only a low-dimension weight vector needs to be learned. This significantly facilitates the parameter learning across different conditions when training data are limited. We evaluate DCCN on four tasks which can be formulated as conditional model learning, including specific object counting, multi-modal image classification, phrase grounding and identity based face generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in the conditional few-shot learning setting."}}
