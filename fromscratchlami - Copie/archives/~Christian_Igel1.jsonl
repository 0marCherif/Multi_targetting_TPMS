Evaluating NAS strategies is now possible on extensive search spaces and at a moderate computational cost. But so far, NAS has mainly focused on maximising performance on some hold-out validation/test set. However, energy consumption is a partially conflicting objective that should not be neglected. We hypothesise that constraining NAS to include the energy consumption of training the models could reveal a sub-space of undiscovered architectures that are more computationally efficient with a smaller carbon footprint. To support the hypothesis, an existing tabular benchmark for NAS is augmented with the energy consumption of each architecture. We then perform multi-objective optimisation that includes energy consumption as an additional objective. We demonstrate the usefulness of multi-objective NAS for uncovering the trade-off between performance and energy consumption as well as for finding more energy-efficient architectures. The updated tabular benchmark is open-sourced to encourage the further exploration of energy consumption-aware NAS."}}

In precision agriculture, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technologies are currently used to monitor crop growth, plant phenotyping, and biomass dynamics at the ecosystem scale. In this study, we utilized a UAV\u2013LiDAR sensor to monitor two crop fields and a set of machine learning (ML) methods to predict real-time AGB over two consecutive years in the region of Mid-Jutland, Denmark. During each crop growing period, UAV surveys were conducted in parallel with AGB destructive sampling every 7\u201315 days, the AGB samples from which were used as the ground truth data. We evaluated the ability of the ML models to estimate the real-time values of AGB at a sub-meter resolution (0.17\u20130.52 m2). An extremely randomized trees (ERT) regressor was selected for the regression analysis, based on its predictive performance for the first year\u2019s growing season. The model was retrained using previously identified hyperparameters to predict the AGB of the crops in the second year. The ERT performed AGB estimation using height and reflectance metrics from LiDAR-derived point cloud data and achieved a prediction performance of R2 = 0.48 at a spatial resolution of 0.35 m2. The prediction performance could be improved significantly by aggregating adjacent predictions (R2 = 0.71 and R2 = 0.93 at spatial resolutions of 1 m2 and 2 m2, respectively) as they ultimately converged to the reference biomass values because any individual errors averaged out. The AGB prediction results were examined as function of predictor type, training set size, sampling resolution, phenology, and canopy density. The results demonstrated that when combined with ML regression methods, the UAV\u2013LiDAR method could be used to provide accurate real-time AGB prediction for crop fields at a high resolution, thereby providing a way to map their biochemical constituents."}}
