However, existing approaches often rely on expensive human annotations as supervision for model training, limiting their scalability to large, unlabeled datasets. To address this challenge, we present ZeroSeg, a novel method that leverages the existing pretrained vision-language (VL) model (e.g. CLIP) to train open-vocabulary zero-shot semantic segmentation models. Although acquired extensive knowledge of visual concepts, it is non-trivial to exploit knowledge from these VL models to the task of semantic segmentation, as they are usually trained at an image level. ZeroSeg overcomes this by distilling the visual concepts learned by VL models into a set of segment tokens, each summarizing a localized region of the target image. We evaluate ZeroSeg on multiple popular segmentation benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO, in a zero-shot manner (i.e., no training or adaption on target segmentation datasets). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared to other zero-shot segmentation methods under the same training data, while also performing competitively compared to strongly supervised methods. Finally, we also demonstrated the effectiveness of ZeroSeg on open-vocabulary segmentation, through both human studies and qualitative visualizations."}}

However, existing object datasets are either non-egocentric or have limitations in object categories, visual content, and annotation granularities. In this work, we introduce EgoObjects, a large-scale egocentric dataset for fine-grained object understanding. Its Pilot version contains over 9K videos collected by 250 participants from 50+ countries using 4 wearable devices, and over 650K object annotations from 368 object categories. Unlike prior datasets containing only object category labels, EgoObjects also annotates each object with an instance-level identifier, and includes over 14K unique object instances. EgoObjects was designed to capture the same object under diverse background complexities, surrounding objects, distance, lighting and camera motion. In parallel to the data collection, we conducted data annotation by developing a multi-stage federated annotation process to accommodate the growing nature of the dataset. To bootstrap the research on EgoObjects, we present a suite of 4 benchmark tasks around the egocentric object understanding, including a novel instance level- and the classical category level object detection. Moreover, we also introduce 2 novel continual learning object detection tasks. The dataset and API are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/EgoObjects."}}

Moving forward, a complete intelligent vision system requires understanding more fine-grained object descriptions, object parts. In this paper, we propose a detector with the ability to predict both open-vocabulary objects and their part segmentation. This ability comes from two designs. First, we train the detector on the joint of part-level, object-level and image-level data to build the multi-granularity alignment between language and image. Second, we parse the novel object into its parts by its dense semantic correspondence with the base object. These two designs enable the detector to largely benefit from various data sources and foundation models. In open-vocabulary part segmentation experiments, our method outperforms the baseline by 3.3$\\sim$7.3 mAP in cross-dataset generalization on PartImageNet, and improves the baseline by 7.3 novel AP$_{50}$ in cross-category generalization on Pascal Part. Finally, we train a detector that generalizes to a wide range of part segmentation datasets while achieving better performance than dataset-specific training."}}

Unfortunately, existing video architectures are often computationally intensive and not suitable for such applications. The recent X3D work presents a new family of efficient video models by expanding a hand-crafted image architecture along multiple axes, such as space, time, width, and depth. Although operating in a conceptually large space, X3D searches one axis at a time, and merely explored a small set of 30 architectures in total, which does not sufficiently explore the space. This paper bypasses existing 2D architectures, and directly searched for 3D architectures in a fine-grained space, where block type, filter number, expansion ratio and attention block are jointly searched. A probabilistic neural architecture search method is adopted to efficiently search in such a large space. Evaluations on Kinetics and Something-Something-V2 benchmarks confirm our AutoX3D models outperform existing ones in accuracy up to 1.3% under similar FLOPs, and reduce the computational cost up to \u00d71.74 when reaching similar performance."}}

This paper summarizes the ideas, design choices, rules, and results of the challenge held at the 3rd Continual Learning in Computer Vision (CLVision) Workshop at CVPR 2022. The focus of this competition is the complex continual object detection task, which is still underexplored in literature compared to classification tasks. The challenge is based on the challenge version of the novel EgoObjects dataset, a large-scale egocentric object dataset explicitly designed to benchmark continual learning algorithms for egocentric category-/instance-level object understanding, which covers more than 1k unique main objects and 250+ categories in around 100k video frames."}}

NAS has been explosively studied to automate the discovery of top-performer neural networks, but suffers from heavy resource consumption and often incurs search bias due to truncated training or approximations. Recent NAS works start to explore indicators that can predict a network's performance without training. However, they either leveraged limited properties of deep networks, or the benefits of their training-free indicators are not applied to more extensive search methods. By rigorous correlation analysis, we present a unified framework to understand and accelerate NAS, by disentangling \"TEG\" characteristics of searched networks - Trainability, Expressivity, Generalization - all assessed in a training-free manner. The TEG indicators could be scaled up and integrated with various NAS search methods, including both supernet and single-path approaches. Extensive studies validate the effective and efficient guidance from our TEG-NAS framework, leading to both improved search accuracy and over 2.3x reduction in search time cost. Moreover, we visualize search trajectories on three landscapes of \"TEG\" characteristics, observing that while a good local minimum is easier to find on NAS-Bench-201 given its simple topology, balancing \"TEG\" characteristics is much harder on the DARTS search space due to its complex landscape geometry.
