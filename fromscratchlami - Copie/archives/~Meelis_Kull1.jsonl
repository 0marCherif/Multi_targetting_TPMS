We used an ensemble of five statistical forecasting methods and a method that we refer to as the correlator. Our retrospective analysis using the ground truth values published by the M4 organisers after the competition demonstrates that the correlator was responsible for most of our gains over the naive constant forecasting method. We identify data leakage as one reason for its success, partly due to test data selected from different time intervals, and partly due to quality issues in the original time series. We suggest that future forecasting competitions should provide actual dates for the time series so that some of those leakages could be avoided by the participants."}}

If the data have experienced dataset shift where the class distributions change post-training, then often the model\u2019s performance will decrease, over-estimating the probabilities of some classes while under-estimating the others on average. We propose unbounded and bounded general adjustment (UGA and BGA) methods that transform all predictions to (re-)equalize the average prediction and the class distribution. These methods act differently depending on which proper scoring rule is to be minimized, and we have a theoretical guarantee of reducing loss on test data, if the exact class distribution is known. We also demonstrate experimentally that, when in practice the class distribution is known only approximately, there is often still a reduction in loss depending on the amount of shift and the precision to which the class distribution is known."}}

Classifier calibration methods can map these into calibrated class probabilities, supporting cost-optimal decision making. Isotonic calibration is the standard non-parametric calibration method for binary classifiers, and it can be shown to yield the most likely monotonic calibration map on the given data, where monotonicity means that instances with higher predicted scores are more likely to be positive. Another non-parametric method is ENIR (ensemble of near-isotonic regression models) which allows for some non-monotonicity, but adds a penalty for it. We first demonstrate that these two methods tend to be over-confident and show that applying label smoothing improves calibration of both methods in more than 90% of studied cases. Unfortunately, label smoothing reduces confidence on the under-confident predictions also, and it does not reduce the raggedness of isotonic calibration. As the main contribution we propose a non-parametric Bayesian isotonic calibration method which has the flexibility of isotonic calibration to fit maps of all monotonic shapes but it adds smoothness and reduces over-confidence without requiring label smoothing. The method introduces a prior over piecewise linear monotonic calibration maps and uses a simple Monte Carlo sampling based approach to approximate the posterior mean calibration map. Our experiments demonstrate that on average the proposed method results in better calibrated probabilities than the state-of-the-art calibration methods, including isotonic calibration and ENIR."}}

While calibration has been investigated thoroughly in classification, it has not yet been well-established for regression tasks. This paper considers the problem of calibrating a probabilistic regression model to improve the estimated probability densities over the real-valued targets. We propose to calibrate a regression model through the cumulative probability density, which can be derived from calibrating a multi-class classifier. We provide three non-parametric approaches to solve the problem, two of which provide empirical estimates and the third providing smooth density estimates. The proposed approaches are experimentally evaluated to show their ability to improve the performance of regression models on the predictive likelihood."}}
