ASC consists of three components -- (1) a library of basic visuomotor skills (navigation, pick, place), (2) a skill coordination policy that chooses which skill to use when, and (3) a corrective policy that adapts pre-trained skills in out-of-distribution states. All components of ASC rely only on onboard visual and proprioceptive sensing, without requiring information like detailed maps with obstacle layouts or precise object locations, easing real-world deployment. We train ASC in simulated indoor environments, and deploy it zero-shot (without any real-world experience or fine-tuning) on the Boston Dynamics Spot robot in 8 novel real-world environments (1 apartment, 1 lab, 2 microkitchens, 2 lounges, 1 office space, 1 outdoor courtyard). In rigorous quantitative comparisons in 2 environments, ASC achieves near-perfect performance (59/60 episodes, or 98%), while sequentially executing skills succeeds in only 44/60 (73%) episodes. Extensive perturbation experiments show that ASC is robust to hand-off errors, changes in the environment layout, dynamic obstacles (e.g., people), and unexpected disturbances."}}

This is a foundational challenge for robots to be useful assistants in human environments, because it involves tackling sub-problems from across robotics: perception, language understanding, navigation, and manipulation are all essential to OVMM. In addition, integration of the solutions to these sub-problems poses its own substantial challenges. To drive research in this area, we introduce the HomeRobot OVMM benchmark, where an agent navigates household environments to grasp novel objects and place them on target receptacles. HomeRobot has two components: a simulation component, which uses a large and diverse curated object set in new, high-quality multi-room home environments; and a real-world component, providing a software stack for the low-cost Hello Robot Stretch to encourage replication of real-world experiments across labs. We implement both reinforcement learning and heuristic (model-based) baselines and show evidence of sim-to-real transfer. Our baselines achieve a 20% success rate in the real world; our experiments identify ways future research work improve performance. See videos on our website: https://home-robot-ovmm.github.io/."}}

The dynamic equation can arise from first principles (e.g., Newton\u2019s laws) and provide useful cues for learning, but its physical parameters are unknown. To address this problem, we propose a model that estimates states and physical parameters of the system using two main components. First, an autoencoder compresses a sequence of observations (e.g., sensor measurements, pixel images) into a sequence for the state representation that is consistent with physics by including a simulation of the dynamic equation. Second, an estimator is coupled with the autoencoder to predict the values of the physical parameters. We also theoretically and empirically show that using Fourier feature mappings improves generalization of the estimator in predicting physical parameters compared to raw state sequences. In our experiments on three visual and one sensor measurement tasks, our model imposes interpretability on latent states and achieves improved generalization performance for long-term prediction of system dynamics over state-of-the-art baselines."}}
