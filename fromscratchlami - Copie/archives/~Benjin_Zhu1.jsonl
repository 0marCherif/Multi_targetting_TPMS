Inspired by the InfoMax principle, we point that the margin term in contrastive loss needs to be adaptively scaled according to the number of negative pairs in order to keep steady mutual information bound and gradient magnitude. EqCo bridges the performance gap among a wide range of negative sample sizes, so that for the first time, we can use only a few negative pairs (e.g. 16 per query) to perform self-supervised contrastive training on large-scale vision datasets like ImageNet, while with almost no accuracy drop. This is quite a contrast to the widely used large batch training or memory bank mechanism in current practices. Equipped with EqCo, our simplified MoCo (SiMo) achieves comparable accuracy with MoCo v2 on ImageNet (linear evaluation protocol) while only involves 16 negative pairs per query instead of 65536, suggesting that large quantities of negative samples might not be a critical factor in contrastive learning frameworks."}}

Here we present an anchor-free detector named AutoAssign. It requires little human knowledge and achieves appearance-aware through a fully differentiable weighting mechanism. During training, to both satisfy the prior distribution of data and adapt to category characteristics, we present Center Weighting to adjust the category-specific prior distributions. To adapt to object appearances, Confidence Weighting is proposed to adjust the specific assign strategy of each instance. The two weighting modules are then combined to generate positive and negative weights to adjust each location's confidence. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO show that our method steadily surpasses other best sampling strategies by large margins with various backbones. Moreover, our best model achieves 52.1% AP, outperforming all existing one-stage detectors. Besides, experiments on other datasets, e.g., PASCAL VOC, Objects365, and WiderFace, demonstrate the broad applicability of AutoAssign."}}

Generally, we utilize sparse 3D convolution to extract rich semantic features, which are then fed into a class-balanced multi-head network to perform 3D object detection. To handle the severe class imbalance problem inherent in the autonomous driving scenarios, we design a class-balanced sampling and augmentation strategy to generate a more balanced data distribution. Furthermore, we propose a balanced group-ing head to boost the performance for the categories withsimilar shapes. Based on the Challenge results, our methodoutperforms the PointPillars [14] baseline by a large mar-gin across all metrics, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance on the nuScenes dataset. Code will be released at CBGS."}}

This clearly makes filtering the targeted users a demanding and key research task. Uni-directional social networks are the scenarios where users provide limited follow or not binary features. Related works prefer to utilize these follower-followee relations for recommendation. However, a major problem of these methods is that they assume every follower-followee user pairs are equally likely, and this leads to the coarse user following preferences inferring. Intuitively, a user\u2019s adoption of others as followees may be motivated by her interests as well as social connections, hence a good recommender should be able to separate the two situations and take both factors into account for better recommendation results. In this regard, we propose a new user recommendation framework namely UIS-MF in this work. UIS-MF can well capture user preferences by involving both interest and social factors in prediction, and targeted to recommend Top-N followees who have similar interest and close social connection relevant to a target user. Specifically, we first present a unified probabilistic topic model on follower-followee relations, namely UIS-LDA, and it employs Generalized P\u00f3lya Urn (GPU) models on mutual-following relations for discovering interest topics and social topics of users. Next we propose a community-based method for user recommendation, it organizes social communities and interest communities based on the estimation of topics obtained from UIS-LDA, and then performs Matrix Factorization (MF) method on each community to generate N most likely followees for individual user. Systematic experiments on Twitter, Sina Weibo and Epinions datasets have not only revealed the significant effect of our UIS-LDA model for the extraction of interest and social topics of users in improving recommending accuracy, but also demonstrated the advantage of our proposed recommendation framework over competitive baselines by large margins."}}
