The emergence of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enables the measure of gene expression levels for individual cells, which promotes the reconstruction of GRNs at single-cell resolution. However, existing network inference methods are mainly designed for data collected from a single data source, which ignores the information provided by multiple related data sources. In this paper, we propose a multi-view contrastive learning (DeepMCL) model to infer GRNs from scRNA-seq data collected from multiple data sources or time points. We first represent each gene pair as a set of histogram images, and then introduce a deep Siamese convolutional neural network with contrastive loss to learn the low-dimensional embedding for each gene pair. Moreover, an attention mechanism is introduced to integrate the embeddings extracted from different data sources and different neighbor gene pairs. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our contrastive learning and attention mechanisms, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model in integrating multiple data sources for GRN inference."}}

Even though various differential expression analysis methods for scRNA-seq data have been proposed based on different model assumptions and strategies recently, the differentially expressed genes identified by them are quite different from each other, and the performances of them depend on the underlying data structures. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble learning-based differential expression analysis method, scDEA, to produce a more stable and accurate result. scDEA integrates the P-values obtained from 12 individual differential expression analysis methods for each gene using a P-value combination method. Comprehensive experiments show that scDEA outperforms the state-of-the-art individual methods with different experimental settings and evaluation metrics. We expect that scDEA will serve a wide range of users, including biologists, bioinformaticians and data scientists, who need to detect differentially expressed genes in scRNA-seq data."}}

As clustering is an effective strategy towards cell-type identification, various computational approaches have been proposed for clustering scRNA-seq data. Recently, with the emergence of cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), the cell surface expression of specific proteins and the RNA expression on the same cell can be captured, which provides more comprehensive information for cell analysis. However, existing single cell clustering algorithms are mainly designed for single-omic data, and have difficulties in handling multi-omics data with diverse characteristics efficiently. In this study, we propose a novel deep embedded multi-omics clustering with collaborative training (DEMOC) model to perform joint clustering on CITE-seq data. Our model can take into account the characteristics of transcriptomic and proteomic data, and make use of the consistent and complementary information provided by different data sources effectively. Experiment results on two real CITE-seq datasets demonstrate that our DEMOC model not only outperforms state-of-the-art single-omic clustering methods, but also achieves better and more stable performance than existing multi-omics clustering methods. We also apply our model on three scRNA-seq datasets to assess the performance of our model in rare cell-type identification, novel cell-subtype detection and cellular heterogeneity analysis. Experiment results illustrate the effectiveness of our model in discovering the underlying patterns of data."}}

Biomedical link prediction and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data imputation are two essential tasks in biomedical data analyses, which can facilitate various downstream studies and gain insights into the mechanisms of complex diseases. Both tasks can be transformed into matrix completion problems. For a variety of matrix completion tasks, matrix factorization has shown promising performance. However, the sparseness and high dimensionality of biomedical networks and scRNA-seq data have raised new challenges. To resolve these issues, various matrix factorization methods have emerged recently. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on such matrix factorization methods and their usage in biomedical link prediction and scRNA-seq data imputation. Moreover, we select representative matrix factorization methods and conduct a systematic empirical comparison on 15 real data sets to evaluate their performance under different scenarios. By summarizing the experimental results, we provide general guidelines for selecting matrix factorization methods for different biomedical matrix completion tasks and point out some future directions to further improve the performance for biomedical link prediction and scRNA-seq data imputation."}}

It is formulated as a graph-generating problem by many existing approaches. Specifically, these methods firstly identify the reaction center, and break target molecule accordingly to generate synthons. Reactants are generated by either adding atoms sequentially to synthon graphs or directly adding proper leaving groups. However, both two strategies suffer since adding atoms results in a long prediction sequence which increases generation difficulty, while adding leaving groups can only consider the ones in the training set which results in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end graph generation model for retrosynthesis prediction, which sequentially identifies the reaction center, generates the synthons, and adds motifs to the synthons to generate reactants. Since chemically meaningful motifs are bigger than atoms and smaller than leaving groups, our method enjoys lower prediction complexity than adding atoms and better generalization than adding leaving groups. Experiments on a benchmark dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art algorithms."}}

Several Gaussian graphical model-based methods have been proposed to deal with this task by inferring differential networks from gene expression data. However, most existing methods define the differential networks as the difference of precision matrices, which may include false differential edges caused by the change of conditional variances. In addition, prior information about the condition-specific networks and the differential networks can be obtained from other domains. It is useful to incorporate prior information into differential network analysis. In this study, we propose a new differential network analysis method to address the above challenges. Instead of using the precision matrices, we define the differential networks as the difference of partial correlations, which can exclude the spurious differential edges due to the variants of conditional variances. Furthermore, prior information from multiple hypothesis testing is incorporated using a weighted fused penalty. Simulation studies show that our method outperforms the competing methods. We also apply our method to identify the differential network between luminal A and basal-like subtypes of breast cancers and the differential network between acute myeloid leukemia tumors and normal samples. The hub genes in the differential networks identified by our method carry out important biological functions."}}

Existing approaches transform a 3D protein-ligand complex to a two-dimensional (2D) graph, and then use graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict its binding affinity. However, the node and edge features of the 2D graph are extracted based on invariant local coordinate systems of the 3D complex. As a result, the method can not fully learn the global information of the complex, such as, the physical symmetry and the topological information of bonds. To address these issues, we propose a novel Equivariant Line Graph Network (ELGN) for affinity prediction of 3D protein ligand complexes. The proposed ELGN firstly adds a super node to the 3D complex, and then builds a line graph based on the 3D complex. After that, ELGN uses a new E(3)-equivariant network layer to pass the messages between nodes and edges based on the global coordinate system of the 3D complex. Experimental results on two real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ELGN over several state-of-the-art baselines."}}
