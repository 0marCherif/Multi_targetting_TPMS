However, the reasons for its effectiveness are not well understood. In this study, we investigate the role played by different properties of the PI in explaining away label noise. Through experiments on multiple datasets with real PI (CIFAR-N/H) and a new large-scale benchmark ImageNet-PI, we find that PI is most helpful when it allows networks to easily distinguish clean from noisy data, while enabling a learning shortcut to memorize the noisy examples. Interestingly, when PI becomes too predictive of the target label, PI methods often perform worse than their no-PI baselines. Based on these findings, we propose several enhancements to the state-of-the-art PI methods and demonstrate the potential of PI as a means of tackling label noise. Finally, we show how we can easily combine the resulting PI approaches with existing no-PI techniques designed to deal with label noise."}}

Yet, our understanding of the effectiveness of task arithmetic and its underlying principles remains limited. We present a comprehensive study of task arithmetic in vision-language models and show that weight disentanglement is the crucial factor that makes it effective. This property arises during pre-training and manifests when distinct directions in weight space govern separate, localized regions in function space associated with the tasks. Notably, we show that fine-tuning models in their tangent space by linearizing them amplifies weight disentanglement. This leads to substantial performance improvements across multiple task arithmetic benchmarks and diverse models. Building on these findings, we provide theoretical and empirical analyses of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of these models and establish a compelling link between task arithmetic and the spatial localization of the NTK eigenfunctions. Overall, our work uncovers novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of task arithmetic and offers a more reliable and effective approach to edit pre-trained models through the NTK linearization."}}

To overcome this, fast single-step attacks can be used, but doing so is prone to catastrophic overfitting (CO). This is when networks gain non-trivial robustness during the first stages of AT, but then reach a breaking point where they become vulnerable in just a few iterations. Although some works have succeeded at preventing CO, the different mechanisms that lead to this failure mode are still poorly understood. In this work, we study the onset of CO in single-step AT methods through controlled modifications of typical datasets of natural images. In particular, we show that CO can be induced when injecting the images with seemingly innocuous features that are very useful for non-robust classification but need to be combined with other features to obtain a robust classifier. This new perspective provides important insights into the mechanisms that lead to CO and improves our understanding of the general dynamics of adversarial training."}}

These features aid non-robust classification but are not enough to achieve robustness on their own. Through extensive experiments we analyze this novel phenomenon and discover that the presence of these easy features induces a learning shortcut that leads to CO.

To fix this vulnerability, prior works have built complex data augmentation strategies, combining multiple methods to enrich the training data. However, introducing intricate design choices or heuristics makes it hard to understand which elements of these methods are indeed crucial for improving robustness. In this work, we take a step back and follow a principled approach to achieve robustness to common corruptions. We propose PRIME, a general data augmentation scheme that relies on simple yet rich families of max-entropy image transformations. PRIME outperforms the prior art in terms of corruption robustness, while its simplicity and plug-and-play nature enable combination with other methods to further boost their robustness. We analyze PRIME to shed light on the importance of the mixing strategy on synthesizing corrupted images, and to reveal the robustness-accuracy trade-offs arising in the context of common corruptions. Finally, we show that the computational efficiency of our method allows it to be easily used in both on-line and off-line data augmentation schemes.

Nevertheless, despite their practical success, we still do not understand how INRs represent signals. We propose a novel unified perspective to theoretically analyse INRs. Leveraging results from harmonic analysis and deep learning theory, we show that most INR families are analogous to structured signal dictionaries whose atoms are integer harmonics of the set of initial mapping frequencies. This structure allows INRs to express signals with an exponentially increasing frequency support using a number of parameters that only grows linearly with depth. We also explore the inductive bias of INRs exploiting recent results about the empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK). Specifically, we show that the eigenfunctions of the NTK can be seen as dictionary atoms whose inner product with the target signal determines the final performance of their reconstruction. In this regard, we reveal that meta-learning has a reshaping effect on the NTK analogous to dictionary learning, building dictionary atoms as a combination of the examples seen during meta-training. Our results permit to design and tune novel INR architectures, but can also be of interest for the wider deep learning theory community."}}

To that end, we start by focusing on a very simple problem, i.e., classifying a class of linearly separable distributions, and show that, depending on the direction of the discriminative feature of the distribution, many state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have a surprisingly hard time solving this simple task. We then define as neural anisotropy directions (NADs) the vectors that encapsulate the directional inductive bias of an architecture. These vectors, which are specific for each architecture and hence act as a signature, encode the preference of a network to separate the input data based on some particular features. We provide an efficient method to identify NADs for several CNN architectures and thus reveal their directional inductive biases. Furthermore, we show that, for the CIFAR-10 dataset, NADs characterize the features used by CNNs to discriminate between different classes."}}

Influence of discriminative features on deep network boundaries", "abstract": "mportant insights towards the explainability of neural networks reside in the characteristics of their decision boundaries. In this work, we borrow tools from the field of adversarial robustness, and propose a new perspective that relates dataset features to the distance of samples to the decision boundary. This enables us to carefully tweak the position of the training samples and measure the induced changes on the boundaries of CNNs trained on large-scale vision datasets. We use this framework to reveal some intriguing properties of CNNs. Specifically, we rigorously confirm that neural networks exhibit a high invariance to non-discriminative features, and show that the decision boundaries of a DNN can only exist as long as the classifier is trained with some features that hold them together. Finally, we show that the construction of the decision boundary is extremely sensitive to small perturbations of the training samples, and that changes in certain directions can lead to sudden invariances in the orthogonal ones. This is precisely the mechanism that adversarial training uses to achieve robustness."}}

Still, a growing body of work keeps leveraging this approximation to successfully analyze important deep learning phenomena and design algorithms for new applications. In our work, we provide strong empirical evidence to determine the practical validity of such approximation by conducting a systematic comparison of the behavior of different neural networks and their linear approximations on different tasks. We show that the linear approximations can indeed rank the learning complexity of certain tasks for neural networks, even when they achieve very different performances. However, in contrast to what was previously reported, we discover that neural networks do not always perform better than their kernel approximations, and reveal that the performance gap heavily depends on architecture, dataset size and training task. We discover that networks overfit to these tasks mostly due to the evolution of their kernel during training, thus, revealing a new type of implicit bias."}}
