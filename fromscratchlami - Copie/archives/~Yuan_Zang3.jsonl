Sememe knowledge bases are built by manually annotating sememes for words and phrases. HowNet is the most well-known sememe knowledge base. It has been extensively utilized in many natural language processing tasks in the era of statistical natural language processing and proven to be effective and helpful to understanding and using languages. In the era of deep learning, although data are thought to be of vital importance, there are some studies working on incorporating sememe knowledge bases like HowNet into neural network models to enhance system performance. Some successful attempts have been made in the tasks including word representation learning, language modeling, semantic composition, etc. In addition, considering the high cost of manual annotation and update for sememe knowledge bases, some work has tried to use machine learning methods to automatically predict sememes for words and phrases to expand sememe knowledge bases. Besides, some studies try to extend HowNet to other languages by automatically predicting sememes for words and phrases in a new language. In this paper, we summarize recent studies on application and expansion of sememe knowledge bases and point out some future directions of research on sememes."}}

In the field of natural language processing, various textual adversarial attack models have been proposed, varying in the accessibility to the victim model. Among them, the attack models that only require the output of the victim model are more fit for real-world situations of adversarial attacking. However, to achieve high attack performance, these models usually need to query the victim model too many times, which is neither efficient nor viable in practice. To tackle this problem, we propose a reinforcement learning based attack model, which can learn from attack history and launch attacks more efficiently. In experiments, we evaluate our model by attacking several state-of-the-art models on the benchmark datasets of multiple tasks including sentiment analysis, text classification and natural language inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently achieves both better attack performance and higher efficiency than recently proposed baseline methods. We also find our attack model can bring more robustness improvement to the victim model by adversarial training. All the code and data of this paper will be made public."}}
