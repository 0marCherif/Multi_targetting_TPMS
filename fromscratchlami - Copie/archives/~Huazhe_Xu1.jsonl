Often regarded as a hallmark of human cognition, tool use in autonomous robots remains limited due to challenges in understanding tool-object interactions. Here we develop an intelligent robotic system, RoboCook, which perceives, models, and manipulates elasto-plastic objects with various tools. RoboCook uses point cloud scene representations, models tool-object interactions with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and combines tool classification with self-supervised policy learning to devise manipulation plans. We demonstrate that from just 20 minutes of real-world interaction data per tool, a general-purpose robot arm can learn complex long-horizon soft object manipulation tasks, such as making dumplings and alphabet letter cookies. Extensive evaluations show that RoboCook substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, exhibits robustness against severe external disturbances, and demonstrates adaptability to different materials."}}

However, due to the high degree of freedom of elasto-plastic objects, significant challenges exist in virtually every aspect of the robotic manipulation pipeline, e.g., representing the states, modeling the dynamics, and synthesizing the control signals. We propose to tackle these challenges by employing a particle-based representation for elasto-plastic objects in a model-based planning framework. Our system, RoboCraft, only assumes access to raw RGBD visual observations. It transforms the sensing data into particles and learns a particle-based dynamics model using graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the structure of the underlying system. The learned model can then be coupled with model-predictive control (MPC) algorithms to plan the robot's behavior. We show through experiments that with just 10 minutes of real-world robotic interaction data, our robot can learn a dynamics model that can be used to synthesize control signals to deform elasto-plastic objects into various target shapes, including shapes that the robot has never encountered before. We perform systematic evaluations in both simulation and the real world to demonstrate the robot's manipulation capabilities and ability to generalize to a more complex action space, different tool shapes, and a mixture of motion modes. We also conduct comparisons between RoboCraft and untrained human subjects controlling the gripper to manipulate deformable objects in both simulation and the real world. Our learned model-based planning framework is comparable to and sometimes better than human subjects on the tested tasks."}}

While sensory representations have been widely studied, the representations of actions that form motor skills are yet under exploration. In this work, we find that when a multi-task policy network takes as input states and task embeddings, a space based on the task embeddings emerges to contain meaningful action representations with moderate constraints. Within this space, interpolated or composed embeddings can serve as a high-level interface to instruct the agent to perform meaningful action sequences.  Empirical results not only show that the proposed action representations have efficacy for intra-action interpolation and inter-action composition with limited or no learning, but also demonstrate their superior ability in task adaptation to strong baselines in Mujoco locomotion tasks. The evidence elucidates that learning action representations is a promising direction toward efficient, adaptable, and composable RL, forming the basis of abstract action planning and the understanding of motor signal space.

One crucial stepping stone is to devise RL algorithms that are robust in the face of dropped information from corrupted communication or malfunctioning sensors. Typical RL methods usually require considerable online interaction data that are costly and unsafe to collect in the real world. Furthermore, when applying to the frame dropping scenarios, they perform unsatisfactorily even with moderate drop rates. To address these issues, we propose  Decision Transformer under Random Frame Dropping~(DeFog), an offline RL algorithm that enables agents to act robustly in frame dropping scenarios without online interaction. DeFog first randomly masks out data in the offline datasets and explicitly adds the time span of frame dropping as inputs. After that, a finetuning stage on the same offline dataset with a higher mask rate would further boost the performance. Empirical results show that DeFog outperforms strong baselines under severe frame drop rates like 90\\%, while maintaining similar returns under non-frame-dropping conditions in the regular MuJoCo control benchmarks and the Atari environments. Our approach offers a robust and deployable solution for controlling agents in real-world environments with limited or unreliable data."}}
