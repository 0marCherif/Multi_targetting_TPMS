Traditional SfM systems typically rely on the successful detection of repeatable keypoints across multiple views as the first step, which is difficult for texture-poor scenes, and poor keypoint detection may break down the whole SfM system. We propose a new detector-free SfM framework to draw benefits from the recent success of detector-free matchers to avoid the early determination of keypoints, while solving the multi-view inconsistency issue of detector-free matchers. Specifically, our framework first reconstructs a coarse SfM model from quantized detector-free matches. Then, it refines the model by a novel iterative refinement pipeline, which iterates between an attention-based multi-view matching module to refine feature tracks and a geometry refinement module to improve the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing detector-based SfM systems on common benchmark datasets. We also collect a texture-poor SfM dataset to demonstrate the capability of our framework to reconstruct texture-poor scenes. Based on this framework, we take $\\textit{first place}$ in Image Matching Challenge 2023."}}

While most efforts have focused on developing better neural architectures for this task, there has been no significant work on determining the proper evaluation metric. Human evaluation is the ultimate accuracy measure for this task, and automated metrics should correlate well with human quality judgments. Since descriptions are compatible with many motions, determining the right metric is critical for evaluating and designing effective generative models. This paper systematically studies which metrics best align with human evaluations and proposes new metrics that align even better. Our findings indicate that none of the metrics currently used for this task show even a moderate correlation with human judgments on a sample level. However, for assessing average model performance, commonly used metrics such as R-Precision and less-used coordinate errors show strong correlations. Additionally, several recently developed metrics are not recommended due to their low correlation compared to alternatives. We also introduce a novel metric based on a multimodal BERT-like model, MoBERT, which offers strongly human-correlated sample-level evaluations while maintaining near-perfect model-level correlation. Our results demonstrate that this new metric exhibits extensive benefits over all current alternatives."}}

This paper presents Jigsaw, a novel framework for assembling physically broken 3D objects from multiple pieces. Our approach leverages hierarchical features of global and local geometry to match and align the fracture surfaces. Our framework consists of three components: (1) surface segmentation to separate fracture and original parts, (2) multi-parts matching to find correspondences among fracture surface points, and (3) robust global alignment to recover the global poses of the pieces. We show how to jointly learn segmentation and matching and seamlessly integrate feature matching and rigidity constraints. We evaluate Jigsaw on the Breaking Bad dataset and achieve superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method also generalizes well to diverse fracture modes, objects, and unseen instances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based method designed specifically for 3D fracture assembly over multiple pieces."}}

This paper proposes a novel approach to point-cloud pre-training that learns 3D representations by leveraging pre-trained 2D networks. Different from the popular practice of predicting 2D features first and then obtaining 3D features through dimensionality lifting, our approach directly uses a 3D network for feature extraction. We train the 3D feature extraction network with the help of the novel 2D knowledge transfer loss, which enforces the 2D projections of the 3D feature to be consistent with the output of pre-trained 2D networks. To prevent the feature from discarding 3D signals, we introduce the multi-view consistency loss that additionally encourages the projected 2D feature representations to capture pixel-wise correspondences across different views. Such correspondences induce 3D geometry and effectively retain 3D features in the projected 2D features. Experimental results demonstrate that our pre-trained model can be successfully transferred to various downstream tasks, including 3D shape classification, part segmentation, 3D object detection, and semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance."}}

Unlike MAEs used in the image domain, where the pretext task is to restore features at the masked pixels, such as colors, the existing 3D MAE works reconstruct the missing geometry only, i.e, the location of the masked points. In contrast to previous studies, we advocate that point location recovery is inessential and restoring intrinsic point features is much superior. To this end, we propose to ignore point position reconstruction and recover high-order features at masked points including surface normals and surface variations, through a novel attention-based decoder which is independent of the encoder design. We validate the effectiveness of our pretext task and decoder design using different encoder structures for 3D training and demonstrate the advantages of our pretrained networks on various point cloud analysis tasks."}}

DeblurSR utilizes event data to compensate for motion ambiguities and exploits the spiking representation to parameterize the sharp output video as a mapping from time to intensity. Our key contribution, the Spiking Representation (SR), is inspired by the neuromorphic principles determining how biological neurons communicate with each other in living organisms. We discuss why the spikes can represent sharp edges and how the spiking parameters are interpreted from the neuromorphic perspective. DeblurSR has higher output quality and requires fewer computing resources than state-of-the-art event-based motion deblurring methods. We additionally show that our approach easily extends to video super-resolution when combined with recent advances in implicit neural representation.

However, little research has been done to investigate how to incorporate additional supervision on the BEV features to improve proposal generation in the detector head, while still balancing the number of powerful 3D layers and efficient 2D network operations. This paper proposes a novel scene representation that encodes both the semantics and geometry of the 3D environment in 2D, which serves as a dense supervision signal for better BEV feature learning. The key idea is to use auxiliary networks to predict a combination of explicit and implicit semantic probabilities by exploiting their complementary properties. Extensive experiments show that our simple yet effective design can be easily integrated into most state-of-the-art 3D object detectors and consistently improves upon baseline models."}}

The basic idea of GenCorres is to learn a parametric mesh generator to fit an unorganized deformable shape collection while constraining deformations between adjacent synthetic shapes to preserve geometric structures such as local rigidity and local conformality. GenCorres presents three appealing advantages over existing JSM techniques. First, GenCorres performs JSM among a synthetic shape collection whose size is much bigger than the input shapes and fully leverages the data-driven power of JSM. Second, GenCorres unifies consistent shape matching and pairwise matching (i.e., by enforcing deformation priors between adjacent synthetic shapes). Third, the generator provides a concise encoding of consistent shape correspondences. However, learning a mesh generator from an unorganized shape collection is challenging. It requires a good initial fitting to each shape and can easily get trapped by local minimums. GenCorres addresses this issue by learning an implicit generator from the input shapes, which provides intermediate shapes between two arbitrary shapes. We introduce a novel approach for computing correspondences between adjacent implicit surfaces and force the correspondences to preserve geometric structures and be cycle-consistent. Synthetic shapes of the implicit generator then guide initial fittings (i.e., via template-based deformation) for learning the mesh generator. Experimental results show that GenCorres considerably outperforms state-of-the-art JSM techniques on benchmark datasets. The synthetic shapes of GenCorres preserve local geometric features and yield competitive performance gains against state-of-the-art deformable shape generators."}}

Real time flood inundation forecast tools are still lacking. High-resolution hydrodynamic modeling has become more accessible in recent years, however, predicting flood extents at the street and building levels in real-time is still computationally demanding. Here we present a hybrid process-based and data-driven machine learning (ML) approach for flood extent and inundation depth prediction. We used the Fourier neural operator (FNO), a highly efficient ML method, for surrogate modeling. The FNO model is demonstrated over an urban area in Houston (Texas, U.S.) by training using simulated water depths (in 15-min intervals) from six historical storm events and then tested over two holdout events. Results show FNO outperforms the baseline U-Net model. It maintains high predictability at all lead times tested (up to 3 hrs) and performs well when applying to new sites, suggesting strong generalization skill."}}
