We show that encoding environment dynamics in the reward function improves the sample efficiency of PbRL by an order of magnitude. In our experiments we iterate between: (1) encoding environment dynamics in a state-action representation $z^{sa}$ via a self-supervised temporal consistency task, and (2) bootstrapping the preference-based reward function from $z^{sa}$, which results in faster policy learning and better final policy performance. For example, on quadruped-walk, walker-walk, and cheetah-run, with 50 preference labels we achieve the same performance as existing approaches with 500 preference labels, and we recover 83% and 66% of ground truth reward policy performance versus only 38% and 21% without environment dynamics. The performance gains demonstrate that _explicitly encoding environment dynamics improves preference-learned reward functions_."}}

Previous research has shown that traditional metrics used to optimize and assess models for generating lip motion from speech are not a good indicator of subjective opinion of animation quality. Devising metrics that align with subjective opinion first requires understanding what impacts human perception of quality. In this work, we focus on the degree of articulation and run a series of experiments to study how articulation strength impacts human perception of lip motion accompanying speech. Specifically, we study how increasing under-articulated (dampened) and over-articulated (exaggerated) lip motion affects human perception of quality. We examine the impact of articulation strength on human perception when considering only lip motion, where viewers are presented with talking faces represented by landmarks, and in the context of embodied characters, where viewers are presented with photo-realistic videos. Our results show that viewers prefer over-articulated lip motion consistently more than under-articulated lip motion and that this preference generalizes across different speakers and embodiments.

We hypothesize that REED-based methods better partition the state-action space and facilitate generalization to state-action pairs not included in the preference dataset. REED iterates between encoding environment dynamics in a state-action representation via a self-supervised temporal consistency task, and bootstrapping the preference-based reward function from the state-action representation. Whereas prior approaches train only on the preference-labelled trajectory pairs, REED exposes the state-action representation to all transitions experienced during policy training. We explore the benefits of REED within the PrefPPO [1] and PEBBLE [2] preference learning frameworks and demonstrate improvements across experimental conditions to both the speed of policy learning and the final policy performance. For example, on quadruped-walk and walker-walk with 50 preference labels, REED-based reward functions recover 83% and 66% of ground truth reward policy performance and without REED only 38\\% and 21\\% are recovered.

Preference-based RL (PbRL) mitigates these challenges by inferring a reward from feedback over sets of trajectories. However, the effectiveness of PbRL is limited by the amount of feedback needed to reliably recover the structure of the target reward. We present the PRIor Over Rewards (PRIOR) framework, which incorporates priors about the structure of the reward function and the preference feedback into the reward learning process. Imposing these priors as soft constraints on the reward learning objective reduces the amount of feedback required by half and improves overall reward recovery. Additionally, we demonstrate that using an abstract state space for the computation of the priors further improves the reward learning and the agent's performance."}}

Adding differential privacy guarantees bounds on privacy while data are contributed to a global model. Adding personalization to federated learning introduces new challenges as we must account for preferences of individual users, where a data sample could have conflicting labels because one sub-population of users might view an input positively, but other sub-populations view the same input negatively. We present FedEmbed, a new approach to private federated learning for personalizing a global model that uses (1) sub-populations of similar users, and (2) personal embeddings. We demonstrate that current approaches to federated learning are inadequate for handling data with conflicting labels, and we show that FedEmbed achieves up to 45% improvement over baseline approaches to personalized private federated learning."}}

Previous research has shown that traditional metrics used to optimize and assess models for generating lip motions from speech are not a good indicator of subjective opinion of animation quality. Yet, running repetitive subjective studies for assessing the quality of animations can be time-consuming and difficult to replicate. In this work, we seek to understand the relationship between perturbed lip motion and subjective opinion of lip motion quality. Specifically, we adjust the degree of articulation for lip motion sequences and run a user-study to examine how this adjustment impacts the perceived quality of lip motion. We then train a model using the scores collected from our user-study to automatically predict the subjective quality of an animated sequence. Our results show that (1) users score lip motions with slight over-articulation the highest in terms of perceptual quality; (2) under-articulation had a more detrimental effect on perceived quality of lip motion compared to the effect of over-articulation; and (3) we can automatically estimate the subjective perceptual score for a given lip motion sequences with low error rates."}}

Following cognitively-inspired models of event segmentation, ENHAnCE uses expectation violations to identify boundaries between temporally extended patterns. It applies its expectation-driven process at multiple levels of temporal granularity to produce a hierarchy of predictive models that enable it to identify concepts at multiple levels of temporal abstraction. Evaluations show that the temporal abstraction hierarchies generated by ENHAnCE closely match hand-coded hierarchies for the test data streams. Given language data streams, ENHAnCE learns a hierarchy of predictive models that capture basic units of both spoken and written language: morphemes, lexemes, phonemes, syllables, and words."}}
