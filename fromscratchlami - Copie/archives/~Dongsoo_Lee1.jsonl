Recent works such as quantization have attempted to replace the FP matrix multiplication (MatMul) of DNNs with simple integer MatMul by transforming the datatypes of both weights and activations into integers. Unfortunately, unlike weight values that are static, it is challenging to represent dynamic activations with integers. In this paper, to simultaneously achieve the accuracy of FP activation and the simplicity of integer arithmetic, we present a method for replacing FP arithmetic with integer one without changing FP activations in the storage format while weights are quantized. The proposed method pre-aligns the significands of FP activations just ahead of the MatMul on-the-fly so that the aligned significands (integers) can be used for the computation. Inspired by an observation that conventional FP arithmetic does not produce precise results due to rounding, we demonstrate that our proposed integer arithmetic-based scheme can produce the same level of errors as that of the FP arithmetic in case DNNs use FP activations and quantized weights. Experimental results show that the hardware based on the proposed scheme shows significant improvement over FP arithmetic-based designs in terms of energy efficiency and throughput-per-area while maintaining a similar level of accuracy."}}

As PTQ schemes based on reconstructing each layer or block output turn out to be effective to enhance quantized model performance, recent works have developed algorithms to devise and learn a new weight-rounding scheme so as to better reconstruct each layer or block output. We notice that, however, such new rounding schemes are established on element-wise addition. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective new rounding mechanism for PTQ, coined FlexRound, via element-wise division to learn not only a common quantization grid size but also a different scale for each pre-trained weight. Thanks to the reciprocal rule of derivatives induced by element-wise division, FlexRound is inherently able to exploit the importance of a pre-trained weight when updating its corresponding scale, and thus, flexibly quantize a pre-trained weight depending on its own importance. We empirically validate the efficacy of FlexRound on a wide range of models and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to carry out comprehensive experiments on image classification, natural language understanding, and natural language generation in the per-tensor uniform PTQ setting. Our code will be open-sourced soon."}}

The nonlinearity effect has been hardly understood, but intuitively, there would be promising diffusion patterns to efficiently train the generative distribution towards the data distribution. This paper introduces a data-adaptive nonlinear diffusion process for score-based diffusion models. The proposed Implicit Nonlinear Diffusion Model (INDM) learns by combining a normalizing flow and a diffusion process. Specifically, INDM implicitly constructs a nonlinear diffusion on the data space by leveraging a linear diffusion on the latent space through a flow network. This flow network is key to forming a nonlinear diffusion, as the nonlinearity depends on the flow network. This flexible nonlinearity improves the learning curve of INDM to nearly Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) against the non-MLE curve of DDPM++, which turns out to be an inflexible version of INDM with the flow fixed as an identity mapping. Also, the discretization of INDM shows the sampling robustness. In experiments, INDM achieves the state-of-the-art FID of 1.75 on CelebA. We release our code at https://github.com/byeonghu-na/INDM."}}

Meanwhile, it is intuitive that there would be more promising diffusion pattern adapted to the data distribution. This paper introduces such adaptive and nonlinear diffusion method for the score-based diffusion models. Unlike the static and linear VE-or-VP SDEs of the previous diffusion models, our parameterized diffusion model (PDM) learns the optimal diffusion process by combining the normalizing flow ahead of the diffusion process. Specifically, PDM utilizes the flow to non-linearly transform a data variable into a latent variable, and PDM applies the diffusion process to the transformed latent distribution with the linear diffusing mechanism. Subsequently, PDM enjoys the nonlinear and learned diffusion from the perspective of the data variable. This model structure is feasible because of the invertibility of the flow. We train PDM with the variational proxy of the log-likelihood, and we prove that the variational gap between the variational bound and the log-likelihood becomes tight when the normalizing flow becomes the optimal.

Practical pruning methods, thus, usually lower pruning rates (by structured pruning) to improve parallelism. In this paper, we study fixed-to-fixed (lossless) encoding architecture/algorithm to support fine-grained pruning methods such that sparse neural networks can be stored in a highly regular structure. We first estimate the maximum compression ratio of encoding-based compression using entropy. Then, as an effort to push the compression ratio to the theoretical maximum (by entropy), we propose a sequential fixed-to-fixed encoding scheme. We demonstrate that our proposed compression scheme achieves almost the maximum compression ratio for the Transformer and ResNet-50 pruned by various fine-grained pruning methods."}}

Neural network quantization is usually performed to reduce quantization loss assuming that quantization error of each parameter equally contributes to the overall training loss. The importance of each parameter, however, may highly differ such that for the same number of quantization bits, certain parameters lead to higher training loss than the others after quantization. In this paper, we consider a non-uniform quantization scheme, specifically binary-coding-based quantization, for high compression ratio and efficient computations while avoiding large accuracy degradation by uniform quantization (e.g., INT8). Then, we derive quantization optimization methods to take into account the importance of each parameter. We demonstrate that for post-training quantization, weight magnitude can represent importance and improve model accuracy significantly compared to the previous schemes lacking importance considerations. For various language models including BERT, DistilBERT, AWD-LSTM, and Transformer, we achieve 2-4 bits per weight by our proposed post-training quantization with reasonable accuracy degradation."}}

In this paper, in order to study when would be the right time to compress weights during optimization steps, we propose a new hyper-parameter called  Non-Regularization period or NR period during which weights are not updated for regularization. We first investigate the influence of NR period on regularization using weight decay and weight random noise insertion. Throughout various experiments, we show that stronger weight regularization demands longer NR period (regardless of batch size) to best utilize regularization effects. From our empirical evidence, we argue that weight regularization for every mini-batch allows small weight updates only and limited regularization effects such that there is a need to search for right NR period and weight regularization strength to enhance model accuracy. Consequently, NR period becomes especially crucial for model compression where large weight updates are necessary to increase compression ratio. Using various models, we show that simple weight updates to comply with compression formats along with long NR period is enough to achieve high compression ratio and model accuracy."}}

In particular, quantization based on binary codes is gaining attention because each quantized bit can be directly utilized for computations without dequantization using look-up tables. Previous attempts, however, only allow for integer numbers of quantization bits, which ends up restricting the search space for compression ratio and accuracy. Moreover, quantization bits are usually obtained by minimizing quantization loss in a local manner that does not directly correspond to minimizing the loss function. In this paper, we propose an encryption algorithm/architecture to compress quantized weights in order to achieve fractional numbers of bits per weight and new compression configurations further optimize accuracy/compression trade-offs. Decryption is implemented using XOR gates added into the neural network model and described as $\\tanh(x)$, which enable gradient calculations superior to the straight-through gradient method. We perform experiments using MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet to show that inserting XOR gates learns quantization/encrypted bit decisions through training and obtains high accuracy even for fractional sub 1-bit weights."}}

A critical problem to represent sparse matrices after pruning is that if fewer bits are used for quantization and pruning rate is enhanced, then the amount of index becomes relatively larger. Moreover, an irregular index form leads to low parallelism for convolutions and matrix multiplications. In this paper, we propose a new network pruning technique that generates a low-rank binary index matrix to compress index data significantly. Specifically, the proposed compression method finds a particular fine-grained pruning mask that can be decomposed into two binary matrices while decompressing index data is performed by simple binary matrix multiplication. We also propose a tile-based factorization technique that not only lowers memory requirements but also enhances compression ratio. Various DNN models (including conv layers and LSTM layers) can be pruned with much fewer indices compared to previous sparse matrix formats while maintaining the same pruning rate."}}

Even though pruning removes significant amount of weights in a network, memory requirement reduction was limited since conventional sparse matrix formats require significant amount of memory to store index-related information. Moreover, computations associated with such sparse matrix formats are slow because sequential sparse matrix decoding process does not utilize highly parallel computing systems efficiently. As an attempt to compress index information while keeping the decoding process parallelizable, Viterbi-based pruning was suggested. Decoding non-zero weights, however, is still sequential in Viterbi-based pruning. In this paper, we propose a new sparse matrix format in order to enable a highly parallel decoding process of the entire sparse matrix. The proposed sparse matrix is constructed by combining pruning and weight quantization. For the latest RNN models on PTB and WikiText-2 corpus, LSTM parameter storage requirement is compressed 19x using the proposed sparse matrix format compared to the baseline model. Compressed weight and indices can be reconstructed into a dense matrix fast using Viterbi encoders. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can feed parameters to processing elements 20 % to 106 % faster than the case where the dense matrix values directly come from DRAM."}}
