However, before ice core data can have scientific value, the chronology must be inferred by estimating the age as a function of depth. Under certain conditions, chemicals locked in the ice display quasi-periodic cycles that delineate annual layers. Manually counting these noisy seasonal patterns to infer the chronology can be an imperfect and time-consuming process, and does not capture uncertainty in a principled fashion. In addition, several ice cores may be collected from a region, introducing an aspect of spatial correlation between them. We present an exploration of the use of probabilistic models for automatic dating of ice cores, using probabilistic programming to showcase its use for prototyping, automatic inference and maintainability, and demonstrate common failure modes of these tools."}}

Model evaluation methods used in performance-based ensemble weighting schemes have limitations in the context of high-impact extreme events.

We explore the behaviour of the proposed method in predicting extreme heat days in Nairobi. "}}

We achieve this by assigning probability measures to the spatial domain, which allows us to treat collocation grids probabilistically as random variables to be marginalised out. Adapting this spatial statistics view, we solve forward and inverse problems for parametric PDEs in a way that leads to the construction of Gaussian process models of solution fields. The implementation of these random grids poses a unique set of challenges for inverse physics informed deep learning frameworks and we propose a new architecture called Grid Invariant Convolutional Networks (GICNets) to overcome these challenges. We further show how to incorporate noisy data in a principled manner into our physics informed model to improve predictions for problems where data may be available but whose measurement location does not coincide with any fixed mesh or grid. The proposed method is tested on a nonlinear Poisson problem, Burgers equation, and Navier-Stokes equations, and we provide extensive numerical comparisons. We demonstrate significant computational advantages over current physics informed neural learning methods for parametric PDEs while improving the predictive capabilities and flexibility of these models."}}

We consider the task of temporal segmentation of a set of time series data into representative stationary segments. We use Gaussian process (GP) priors to impose our knowledge about the characteristics of the underlying stationary segments, and use a nonparametric distribution to partition the sequences into such segments, formulated in terms of a prior distribution on segment length. Given the segmentation, the model can be viewed as a variant of a Gaussian mixture model where the mixture components are described using the covariance function of a GP. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on synthetic data as well as on real time-series data of heartbeats where the task is to segment the indicative types of beats and to classify the heartbeat recordings into classes that correspond to healthy and abnormal heart sounds."}}

Common approaches, which try to model the objective as precisely as possible, often fail to make progress by spending too many evaluations modeling irrelevant details. We address this issue by proposing surrogate models that focus on the well-behaved structure in the objective function, which is informative for search, while ignoring detrimental structure that is challenging to model from few observations. First, we demonstrate that surrogate models with appropriate noise distributions can absorb challenging structures in the objective function by treating them as irreducible uncertainty. Secondly, we show that a latent Gaussian process is an excellent surrogate for this purpose, comparing with Gaussian processes with standard noise distributions. We perform numerous experiments on a range of BO benchmarks and find that our approach improves reliability and performance when faced with challenging objective functions."}}

We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model by providing competitive results to other probabilistic monotonic models on a number of benchmark functions. In addition, we consider the utility of a monotonic random process as a part of a hierarchical probabilistic model; we examine the task of temporal alignment of time-series data where it is beneficial to use a monotonic random process in order to preserve the uncertainty in the temporal warpings."}}

Fitting a GP implies computing a posterior distribution of functions consistent with the observed data. Similarly, deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) should allow us to compute a posterior distribution of compositions of multiple functions giving rise to the observations. However, exact Bayesian inference is intractable for DGPs, motivating the use of various approximations. We show that the application of simplifying mean-field assumptions across the hierarchy leads to the layers of a DGP collapsing to near-deterministic transformations. We argue that such an inference scheme is suboptimal, not taking advantage of the potential of the model to discover the compositional structure in the data. To address this issue, we examine alternative variational inference schemes allowing for dependencies across different layers and discuss their advantages and limitations."}}

We follow the approach introduced in (Kazlauskaite, 2018) of simultaneously representing each data sequence as a composition of a true underlying function and a time-warping, both of which are modelled using Gaussian processes (GPs) (Rasmussen, 2005), and aligning the underlying functions using an unsupervised alignment method. In (Kazlauskaite, 2018) the alignment is performed using the GP latent variable model (GP-LVM) (Lawrence, 2005) as a model of sequences, while our main contribution is extending this approach to using DPMM, which allows us to align the sequences temporally and cluster them at the same time. We show that the DPMM achieves competitive results in comparison to the GP-LVM on synthetic and real-world data sets, and discuss the different properties of the estimated underlying functions and the time-warps favoured by these models."}}
