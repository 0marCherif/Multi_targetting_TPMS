However, despite their promising performance on various graph analytical tasks, most of these algorithms lack fairness considerations. As a consequence, they could lead to discrimination towards certain populations when exploited in human-centered applications. Recently, algorithmic fairness has been extensively studied in graph-based applications. In contrast to algorithmic fairness on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data, fairness in graph mining has exclusive backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfilling techniques. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction of existing literature under the context of fair graph mining. Specifically, we propose a novel taxonomy of fairness notions on graphs, which sheds light on their connections and differences. We further present an organized summary of existing techniques that promote fairness in graph mining. Finally, we discuss current research challenges and open questions, aiming at encouraging cross-breeding ideas and further advances."}}

Recent few-shot node classification methods typically learn from classes with abundant labeled nodes (i.e., meta-training classes) and then generalize to classes with limited labeled nodes (i.e., meta-test classes). Nevertheless, on real-world graphs, it is usually difficult to obtain abundant labeled nodes for many classes. In practice, each meta-training class can only consist of several labeled nodes, known as the extremely weak supervision problem. In few-shot node classification, with extremely limited labeled nodes for meta-training, the generalization gap between meta-training and meta-test will become larger and thus lead to suboptimal performance. To tackle this issue, we study a novel problem of few-shot node classification with extremely weak supervision and propose a principled framework X-FNC under the prevalent meta-learning framework. Specifically, our goal is to accumulate meta-knowledge across different meta-training tasks with extremely weak supervision and generalize such knowledge to meta-test tasks. To address the challenges resulting from extremely scarce labeled nodes, we propose two essential modules to obtain pseudo-labeled nodes as extra references and effectively learn from extremely limited supervision information. We further conduct extensive experiments on four node classification datasets with extremely weak supervision to validate the superiority of our framework compared to the state-of-the-art baselines."}}

Nevertheless, multiple recent studies have revealed that the reported state-of-the-art results of many neural recommendation models cannot be reliably replicated. A primary reason is that existing evaluations are performed under various inconsistent protocols. Correspondingly, these replicability issues make it difficult to understand how much benefit we can actually gain from these neural models. It then becomes clear that a fair and comprehensive performance comparison between traditional and neural models is needed. Motivated by these issues, we perform a large-scale, systematic study to compare recent neural recommendation models against traditional ones in top-n recommendation from implicit data. We propose a set of evaluation strategies for measuring memorization performance, generalization performance, and subgroup-specific performance of recommendation models. We conduct extensive experiments with 13 popular recommendation models (including two neural models and 11 traditional ones as baselines) on nine commonly used datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that even with extensive hyper-parameter searches, neural models do not dominate traditional models in all aspects, e.g., they fare worse in terms of average HitRate. We further find that there are areas where neural models seem to outperform non-neural models, for example, in recommendation diversity and robustness between different subgroups of users and items. Our work illuminates the relative advantages and disadvantages of neural models in recommendation and is therefore an important step towards building better recommender systems."}}

Despite their effectiveness, most graph machine learning algorithms lack considerations for fairness, which can result in discriminatory outcomes against certain demographic subgroups or individuals. As a result, there is a growing societal concern about mitigating the bias exhibited in these algorithms. To tackle the problem of algorithmic bias in graph machine learning algorithms, this tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent research progress in measuring and mitigating the bias in machine learning algorithms on graphs. Specifically, this tutorial first introduces several widely-used fairness notions and the corresponding metrics. Then, we present a well-organized review of the theoretical understanding of bias in graph machine learning algorithms, followed by a summary of existing techniques to debias graph machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different real-world applications benefit from these graph machine learning algorithms after debiasing. Finally, we provide insights on current research challenges and open questions to encourage further advances."}}

Nevertheless, GNNs could potentially render biased predictions towards certain demographic subgroups. Understanding how the bias in predictions arises is critical, as it guides the design of GNN debiasing mechanisms. However, most existing works overwhelmingly focus on GNN debiasing, but fall short on explaining how such bias is induced. In this paper, we study a novel problem of interpreting GNN unfairness through attributing it to the influence of training nodes. Specifically, we propose a novel strategy named Probabilistic Distribution Disparity (PDD) to measure the bias exhibited in GNNs, and develop an algorithm to efficiently estimate the influence of each training node on such bias. We verify the validity of PDD and the effectiveness of influence estimation through experiments on real-world datasets. Finally, we also demonstrate how the proposed framework could be used for debiasing GNNs. Open-source code can be found at https://github.com/yushundong/BIND."}}

Specifically, task-specific explanation methods are incapable of explaining pretrained GNNs whose downstream tasks are usually inaccessible, not to mention giving explanations for the transferable knowledge in pretrained GNNs. Additionally, task-specific methods only consider target models' output in the label space, which are coarse-grained and insufficient to reflect the model's internal logic. To address these limitations, we consider a two-stage explanation strategy, i.e., explainers are first pretrained in a task-agnostic fashion in the representation space and then further fine-tuned in the task-specific label space and representation space jointly if downstream tasks are accessible. The two-stage explanation strategy endows post-hoc graph explanations with the applicability to pretrained GNNs where downstream tasks are inaccessible and the capacity to explain the transferable knowledge in the pretrained GNNs. Moreover, as the two-stage explanation strategy explains the GNNs in the representation space, the fine-grained information in the representation space also empowers the explanations. Furthermore, to achieve a trade-off between the fidelity and intelligibility of explanations, we propose an explanation framework based on the Information Bottleneck principle, named Explainable Graph Information Bottleneck (EGIB). EGIB subsumes the task-specific explanation and task-agnostic explanation into a unified framework. To optimize EGIB objective, we derive a tractable bound and adopt a simple yet effective explanation generation architecture. Based on the unified framework, we further theoretically prove that task-agnostic explanation is a relaxed sufficient condition of task-specific explanation, which indicates the transferability of task-agnostic explanations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed explanation method."}}

To achieve better fitting capability, most GNNs are with a large number of parameters, which makes these GNNs computationally expensive. Therefore, it is difficult to deploy them onto edge devices with scarce computational resources, e.g., mobile phones and wearable smart devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a common solution to compress GNNs, where a light-weighted model (i.e., the student model) is encouraged to mimic the behavior of a computationally expensive GNN (i.e., the teacher GNN model). Nevertheless, most existing GNN-based KD methods lack fairness consideration. As a consequence, the student model usually inherits and even exaggerates the bias from the teacher GNN. To handle such a problem, we take initial steps towards fair knowledge distillation for GNNs. Specifically, we first formulate a novel problem of fair knowledge distillation for GNN-based teacher-student frameworks. Then we propose a principled framework named RELIANT to mitigate the bias exhibited by the student model. Notably, the design of RELIANT is decoupled from any specific teacher and student model structures, and thus can be easily adapted to various GNN-based KD frameworks. We perform extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, which corroborates that RELIANT achieves less biased GNN knowledge distillation while maintaining high prediction utility."}}

However, we observe that the current masked autoencoder models lack good generalization ability on graph data. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel graph masked autoencoder framework called GiGaMAE. Different from existing masked autoencoders that learn node presentations by explicitly reconstructing the original graph components (e.g., features or edges), in this paper, we propose to collaboratively reconstruct informative and integrated latent embeddings. By considering embeddings encompassing graph topology and attribute information as reconstruction targets, our model could capture more generalized and comprehensive knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a mutual information based reconstruction loss that enables the effective reconstruction of multiple targets. This learning objective allows us to differentiate between the exclusive knowledge learned from a single target and common knowledge shared by multiple targets. We evaluate our method on three downstream tasks with seven datasets as benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GiGaMAE against state-of-the-art baselines. We hope our results will shed light on the design of foundation models on graph-structured data. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sycny/GiGaMAE."}}

Antibiograms help clinicians to understand regional resistance rates and select appropriate antibiotics in prescriptions. In practice, significant combinations of antibiotic resistance may appear in different antibiograms, forming antibiogram patterns. Such patterns may imply the prevalence of some infectious diseases in certain regions. Thus it is of crucial importance to monitor antibiotic resistance trends and track the spread of multi-drug resistant organisms. In this paper, we propose a novel problem of antibiogram pattern prediction that aims to predict which patterns will appear in the future. Despite its importance, tackling this problem encounters a series of challenges and has not yet been explored in the literature. First of all, antibiogram patterns are not i.i.d as they may have strong relations with each other due to genomic similarities of the underlying organisms. Second, antibiogram patterns are often temporally dependent on the ones that are previously detected. Furthermore, the spread of antibiotic resistance can be significantly influenced by nearby or similar regions. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Antibiogram Pattern Prediction framework, STAPP, that can effectively leverage the pattern correlations and exploit the temporal and spatial information. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset with antibiogram reports of patients from 1999 to 2012 for 203 cities in the United States. The experimental results show the superiority of STAPP against several competitive baselines."}}
