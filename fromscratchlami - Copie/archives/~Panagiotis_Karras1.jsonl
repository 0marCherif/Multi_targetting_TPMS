Exploring and mining HINs relies on metapath queries that identify pairs of entities connected by relationships of diverse semantics. While the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads on large, web-scale HINs is highly demanding in computational cost, current approaches do not exploit interrelationships among the queries. In this paper, we present Atrapos, a new approach for the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads that leverages a combination of efficient sparse matrix multiplication and intermediate result caching. Atrapos selects intermediate results to cache and reuse by detecting frequent sub-metapaths among workload queries in real time, using a tailor-made data structure, the Overlap Tree, and an associated caching policy. Our experimental study on real data shows that Atrapos \u00a0accelerates exploratory data analysis and mining on HINs, outperforming off-the-shelf caching approaches and state-of-the-art research prototypes in all examined scenarios."}}

Individuals change traits by occasionally sampling the trait of a neighbor, while an invasion bias \u03b4 \u2265 0 expresses the stochastic preference to adopt the novel trait A over the resident trait B. The strength of an invasion is measured by the probability that eventually the whole population adopts trait A, i.e., the fixation probability. In more realistic settings, however, the invasion bias is not ubiquitous, but rather manifested only in parts of the network. For instance, when modeling the spread of a social trait, the invasion bias represents localized incentives. In this paper, we generalize the standard biased Voter model to the positional Voter model, in which the invasion bias is effectuated only on an arbitrary subset of the network nodes, called biased nodes. We study the ensuing optimization problem, which is, given a budget k, to choose k biased nodes so as to maximize the fixation probability of a randomly occurring invasion. We show that the problem is NP-hard both for finite \u03b4 and when \u03b4 \u2192 \u221e (strong bias), while the objective function is not submodular in either setting, indicating strong computational hardness. On the other hand, we show that, when \u03b4 \u2192 0 (weak bias), we can obtain a tight approximation in O(n^2\u03c9 ) time, where \u03c9 is the matrix-multiplication exponent. We complement our theoretical results with an experimental evaluation of some proposed heuristics."}}

In consequence, the need arises for effective context-aware fake news detection mechanisms, where the contextual information can be built either from the textual content of posts or from available social data (e.g., information about the users, reactions to posts, or the social network). In this paper, we propose DANES, a Deep Neural Network Ensemble Architecture for Social and Textual Context-aware Fake News Detection. DANES comprises a Text Branch for a textual content-based context and a Social Branch for the social context. These two branches are used to create a novel Network Embedding. Preliminary ablation results on 3 real-world datasets, i.e., BuzzFace, Twitter15, and Twitter16, are promising, with an accuracy that outperforms state-of-the-art solutions when employing both social and textual content features."}}

People seek affordable information on social media and can reach it within seconds. Yet this convenience comes with dangers; any user may freely post whatever they please and the content can stay online for a long period, regardless of its truthfulness. A need to detect untruthful information, also known as fake news, arises. In this paper, we present an end-to-end solution that accurately detects fake news and immunizes network nodes that spread them in real-time. To detect fake news, we propose two new stack deep learning architectures that utilize convolutional and bidirectional LSTM layers. To mitigate the spread of fake news, we propose a real-time network-aware strategy that (1) constructs a minimum-cost weighted directed spanning tree for a detected node, and (2) immunizes nodes in that tree by scoring their harmfulness using a novel ranking function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on five real-world datasets."}}

Unfortunately, in many resource-allocation settings, it is computationally hard to maximize welfare while achieving fairness goals. In this work, we consider ex-ante notions of fairness; popular examples include the \\emph{randomized round-robin algorithm} and \\emph{sortition mechanism}. We propose a general framework to systematically study the \\emph{interpolation} between fairness and welfare goals in a multi-criteria setting. We develop two efficient algorithms ($\\varepsilon-Mix$ and $Simple-Mix$) that achieve different trade-off guarantees with respect to fairness and welfare. $\\varepsilon-Mix$ achieves an optimal multi-criteria approximation with respect to fairness and welfare, while $Simple-Mix$ achieves optimality up to a constant factor with zero computational overhead beyond the underlying \\emph{welfare-maximizing mechanism} and the \\emph{ex-ante fair mechanism}. Our framework makes no assumptions on either of the two underlying mechanisms, other than that the fair mechanism produces a distribution over the set of all allocations. Indeed, if these mechanisms are themselves approximation algorithms, our framework will retain the approximation factor, guaranteeing sensitivity to the quality of the underlying mechanisms, while being \\emph{oblivious} to them. We also give an extensive experimental analysis for the aforementioned ex-ante fair mechanisms on real data sets, confirming our theoretical analysis."}}
