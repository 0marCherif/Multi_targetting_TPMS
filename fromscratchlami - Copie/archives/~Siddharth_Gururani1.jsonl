An ideal generated video should have good lip sync with the audio, natural facial expressions and head motions, and high frame quality. In this work, we present SPACE, which uses speech and a single image to generate high-resolution, and expressive videos with realistic head pose, without requiring a driving video. It uses a multi-stage approach, combining the controllability of facial landmarks with the high-quality synthesis power of a pretrained face generator. SPACE also allows for the control of emotions and their intensities. Our method outperforms prior methods in objective metrics for image quality and facial motions and is strongly preferred by users in pair-wise comparisons."}}

This is challenging to do because it is expensive to obtain bilingual training data in multiple languages, and the lack of such data results in strong correlations that entangle speaker, language, and accent, resulting in poor transfer capabilities. To overcome this, we present a multilingual, multiaccented, multispeaker speech synthesis model based on RADTTS with explicit control over accent, language, speaker and fine-grained $F_0$ and energy features. Our proposed model does not rely on bilingual training data. We demonstrate an ability to control synthesized accent for any speaker in an open-source dataset comprising of 7 accents. Human subjective evaluation demonstrates that our model can better retain a speaker's voice and accent quality than controlled baselines while synthesizing fluent speech in all target languages and accents in our dataset."}}

These large datasets, however, are often only partially labeled as collecting full annotations is a tedious and expensive process. This paper presents two semi-supervised methods capable of learning with missing labels and evaluates them on two publicly available, partially labeled datasets. The first method relies on label enhancement by a two-stage teacher-student learning process, while the second method utilizes the mean teacher semi-supervised learning algorithm. Our results demonstrate the impact of improperly handling missing labels and compare the benefits of using different strategies leveraging data with few labels. Methods capable of learning with partially labeled data have the potential to improve models for audio classification by utilizing even larger amounts of data without the need for complete annotations."}}

With increasing complexity of modeling techniques, the focus of the Musical Instrument Classification (MIC) task has shifted from single note audio analysis to MIC with real world polytimbral music. Increasingly complex models also increase the need for high quality labeled data. For the MIC task, there do not exist such large-scale fully annotated datasets. Instead researchers tend to utilize multi-track data to obtain fine-grained instrument activity annotation. Such datasets are also known as strongly labeled datasets (SLDs). These datasets are usually small and skewed in terms of genre and instrument distribution. Hence, SLDs are not the ideal choice for training generalizable MIC models. Recently, weakly labeled datasets (WLDs), with only clip-level annotations, have been presented. These are typically larger in scale than SLDs. However, methods popular in MIC literature are designed to be trained and evaluated SLDs. These do not naturally extend to the task of weakly labeled MIC. Additionally, during the labeling process, clips are not necessarily annotated with a class label for each instrument. This leads to missing labels in the dataset making it a partially labeled dataset. In this thesis, three methods are proposed to address challenges posed by weakly labeled and partially labeled data. The first one aims at learning using weak labels. The MIC task is formulated as a multi-instance multi-label classification problem. Under this framework, an attention-based model is proposed that can focus on salient instances in weakly labeled data. The other two methods focus on utilizing any information that may be gained from data with missing labels. These methods fall under the semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework, where models are trained using labeled and unlabeled data. The first semi-supervised method involves deep generative models that extend the unsupervised variational autoencoder to a semi-supervised model. The final method is based on consistency regularization-based SSL. The method proposed uses the mean teacher model, where a teacher model maintains a moving average or low-pass filtered version of a student model. The consistency regularization loss is unsupervised and may thus be applied to both labeled and unlabeled data. Additional experiments on music tagging with a large-scale WLD demonstrates the effectiveness of consistency regularization with limited labeled data. The methods presented in this thesis generally outperform methods developed using SLDs. The findings in this thesis not only impact the MIC task but also impact other music classification tasks where labeled data might be scarce. This thesis hopes to pave the way for future researchers to venture away from purely supervised learning and also consider weakly supervised approaches to solve MIR problems without access to large amounts of data."}}

Datasets for polyphonic instrument recognition can be categorized into roughly two categories. Some, such as MedleyDB, have strong per-frame instrument activity annotations but are usually small in size. Other, larger datasets such as OpenMIC only have weak labels, i.e., instrument presence or absence is annotated only for long snippets of a song. We explore an attention mechanism for handling weakly labeled data for multi-label instrument recognition. Attention has been found to perform well for other tasks with weakly labeled data. We compare the proposed attention model to multiple models which include a baseline binary relevance random forest, recurrent neural network, and fully connected neural networks. Our results show that incorporating attention leads to an overall improvement in classification accuracy metrics across all 20 instruments in the OpenMIC dataset. We find that attention enables models to focus on (or \u2018attend to\u2019) specific time segments in the audio relevant to each instrument label leading to interpretable results."}}

Different performances of the same composition may vary in terms of performance parameters such as timing or dynamics, and these variations may have a major impact on how a listener perceives the music. The analysis of music performance has traditionally been a peripheral topic for the MIR research community, where often a single audio recording is used as representative of a musical work. This paper surveys the field of Music Performance Analysis (MPA) from several perspectives including the measurement of performance parameters, the relation of those parameters to the actions and intentions of a performer or perceptual effects on a listener, and finally the assessment of musical performance. This paper also discusses MPA as it relates to MIR, pointing out opportunities for collaboration and future research in both areas."}}
