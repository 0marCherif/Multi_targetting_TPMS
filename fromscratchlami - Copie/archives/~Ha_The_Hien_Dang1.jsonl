More precisely, a game\nis called generalized potential if the simultaneous gradient of the loss functions is a nonlinear\nfunction of the gradient of a potential function. Applications include a class of games arising\nfrom chemical reaction networks with detailed balance condition. For this class of games, we\nprove an explicit exponential convergence to equilibrium for evolution of a single reversible\nreaction. Moreover, numerical investigations are performed to calculate the equilibrium\nstate of some reversible chemical reactions which give rise to generalized potential games."}}

One advantage of graph neural network is its ability to incorporate node features into the learning process. However, this prevents graph neural network from being applied into featureless graphs. In this paper, we first analyze the effects of node features on the performance of graph neural network. We show that GNNs work well if there is a strong correlation between node features and node labels. Based on these results, we propose new feature initialization methods that allows to apply graph neural network to non-attributed graphs. Our experimental results show that the artificial features are highly competitive with real features."}}

The emerging development of smart grid technologies is posing new challenges as well as opportunities to STLF. Load data, collected at higher geographical granularity and frequency through thousands of smart meters, allows us to build a more accurate local load forecasting model, which is essential for local optimization of power load through demand side management. With this paper, we show how several existing approaches for STLF are not applicable on local load forecasting, either because of long training time, unstable optimization process, or sensitivity to hyper-parameters. Accordingly, we select five models suitable for local STFL, which can be trained on different time-series with limited intervention from the user. The experiment, which consists of 40 time-series collected at different locations and aggregation levels, revealed that yearly pattern and temperature information are only useful for high aggregation level STLF. On local STLF task, the modified version of double seasonal Holt-Winter proposed in this paper performs relatively well with only 3 months of training data, compared to more complex methods."}}

Although various visualization tools have been created for certain projects so far, these tools can only be used in certain scenarios, due to their hard-coded packet formats and network's properties. To speed up the development process, a visualization tool which can adapt to any kind of WSN is essentially necessary. For this purpose, a general-purpose visualization tool - NViz, which can represent and visualize data for any kind of WSN, is proposed. NViz allows users to set their network's properties and packet formats through XML files. Based on properties defined, users can choose the meaning of them and let NViz represents the data respectively. Furthermore, a better Replay mechanism, which lets researchers and developers debug their WSN easily, is also integrated in this tool. NViz is designed based on a layered architecture which allows for clear and well-defined interrelationships and interfaces between each component."}}

This paper provides practical explanations for the question \u201cwhy is the number of Big Data applications that succeed and have an effect on our daily life so limited, compared with all of the solutions proposed and tested in the literature?\u201d, with examples taken from Smart Grids. We argue that \u201cnoninvariants\u201d are the most challenging issues in IoT applications, which can be easily revealed if we use the term \u201cinvariant\u201d to replace the more common terms such as \u201cinformation\u201d, \u201cknowledge\u201d, or \u201cinsight\u201d in any Big Data for IoT research. From our experience with developing Smart Grid applications, we produced a list of \u201cnoninvariants\u201d, which we believe to be the main causes of the gaps between Big Data in a laboratory and in practice in IoT applications. This paper also proposes Graph of Virtual Actors (GOVA) as a Big Data analytics architecture for IoT applications, which not only can solve the noninvariants issues, but can also quickly scale horizontally in terms of computation, data storage, caching requirements, and programmability of the system."}}

This enables the application of data mining techniques for traditional problems in power system. Clustering customers into appropriate groups is extremely useful for operators or retailers to address each group differently through dedicated tariffs or customer-tailored services. Currently, the task is done based on demographic data collected through questionnaire, which is error-prone. In this paper, we used three different clustering techniques (together with their variants) to automatically segment electricity consumers based on their consumption patterns. We also proposed a good way to extract consumption patterns for each consumer. The grouping results were assessed using four common internal validity indexes. We found that the combination of Self Organizing Map (SOM) and k-means algorithms produces the most insightful and useful grouping. We also discovered that grouping quality cannot be measured effectively by automatic indicators, which goes against common suggestions in literature."}}

In this paper, we describe smart grid as a socio-technical transition and illustrate the evolutionary path on which a smart grid can be realized. Through this conceptual lens, we reveal the role of big data, and how it can fuel the organic growth of smart grid. We also provide a rough estimate of how much data will be potentially generated from different data sources, which helps clarify the big data challenges during the evolutionary process."}}
