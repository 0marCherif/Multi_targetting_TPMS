Both T and G have the same node set, and for every node pair s,t, the minimum (s,t)-cut in T is also an exact minimum (s,t)-cut in G. We give the first subcubic-time algorithm that constructs such a tree for a simple graph G (unweighted with no parallel edges). Its time complexity is \u00d5(n2.5), for n=|V(G)|; previously, only \u00d5(n3) was known, except for restricted cases like sparse graphs. Consequently, we obtain the first algorithm for All-Pairs Max-Flow in simple graphs that breaks the cubic-time barrier. Gomory and Hu compute this tree using n\u22121 queries to (single-pair) Max-Flow; the new algorithm can be viewed as a fine-grained reduction to \u00d5(\u221an) Max-Flow computations on n-node graphs."}}

In this paper, we give an alternative reduction in which the set A does not depend on the input to k-SAT; thus, the quadratic lower bound for OV holds even if one of the sets is fixed in advance. Using the reductions in the literature from OV to other problems such as computing similarity measures on strings, we get hardness results of a stronger kind: there is a family of sequences {S_n}_{n = 1}^{\u221e}, |S_n| = n such that computing the Edit Distance between an input sequence X of length n and the (fixed) sequence S_n requires n^{2-o(1)} time under SETH."}}

Gomory-Hu Tree for Unweighted Graphs in Almost-Quadratic Time", "abstract": "We design an $n^{2+o(1)}$-time algorithm that constructs a cut-equivalent (Gomory-Hu) tree of a simple graph on $n$ nodes. This bound is almost-optimal in terms of $n$, and it improves on the recent $\\tilde{O}(n^{2.5})$ bound by the authors (STOC 2021), which was the first to break the cubic barrier. Consequently, the All-Pairs Maximum-Flow (APMF) problem has time complexity $n^{2+o(1)}$, and for the first time in history, this problem can be solved faster than All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP). We further observe that an almost-linear time algorithm (in terms of the number of edges $m$) is not possible without first obtaining a subcubic algorithm for multigraphs. Finally, we derandomize our algorithm, obtaining the first subcubic deterministic algorithm for Gomory-Hu Tree in simple graphs, showing that randomness is not necessary for beating the $n-1$ times max-flow bound from 1961. The upper bound is $\\tilde{O}(n^{2\\frac{2}{3}})$ and it would improve to $n^{2+o(1)}$ if there is a deterministic single-pair maximum-flow algorithm that is almost-linear. The key novelty is in using a ``dynamic pivot'' technique instead of the randomized pivot selection that was central in recent works."}}

We show that finding the exact solution is just as hard as finding its parity (i.e. if the solution is even or odd) for a large number of classical problems, including All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP), Diameter, Radius, Median, Second Shortest Path, Maximum Consecutive Subsums, Min-Plus Convolution, and 0/1-Knapsack. A direct reduction from a problem to its parity version is often difficult to design. Instead, we revisit the existing hardness reductions and tailor them in a problem-specific way to the parity version. Nearly all reductions from APSP in the literature proceed via the (subcubic-equivalent but simpler) Negative Weight Triangle (NWT) problem. Our new modified reductions also start from NWT or a non-standard parity variant of it. We are not able to establish a subcubic-equivalence with the more natural parity counting variant of NWT, where we ask if the number of negative triangles is even or odd. Perhaps surprisingly, we justify this by designing a reduction from the seemingly-harder Zero Weight Triangle problem, showing that parity is (conditionally) strictly harder than decision for NWT."}}

Our main result is an \u03a9(n 2\u2212\u03b5 ) lower bound for Sparsest Cut even in planar graphs with unit vertex weights, under the (min, +)-Convolution conjecture, showing that approxima- tions are inevitable in the near-linear time regime.

Our lower bound accomplishes a repeatedly raised challenge by being the first fine-grained lower bound for a natural planar graph problem in P. Building on our construction we prove near-quadratic lower bounds under SETH for variants of the closest pair problem in planar graphs, and use them to show that the popular Average-Linkage procedure for Hierarchical Clustering cannot be simulated in truly subquadratic time. At the core of our constructions is a diamond-like gadget that also settles the complexity of Diameter in distributed planar networks. We prove an \u03a9(n/ log n) lower bound on the number of communication rounds required to compute the weighted diameter of a network in the CONGET model, even when the underlying graph is planar and all nodes are D = 4 hops away from each other.

The best data structure known for this problem simply builds a cut-equivalent tree, discovered 60 years ago by Gomory and Hu, who also showed how to construct it using $n-1$ minimum $st$-cut computations. Using state-of-the-art algorithms for minimum $st$-cut (Lee and Sidford, FOCS 2014) arXiv:1312.6713, one can construct the tree in time $\\tilde{O}(mn^{3/2})$, which is also the preprocessing time of the data structure. (Throughout, we focus on polynomially-bounded edge weights, noting that faster algorithms are known for small/unit edge weights.) Our main result shows the following equivalence: Cut-equivalent trees can be constructed in near-linear time if and only if there is a data structure for Min-Cut queries with near-linear preprocessing time and polylogarithmic (amortized) query time, and even if the queries are restricted to a fixed source. That is, equivalent trees are an essentially optimal solution for Min-Cut queries. This equivalence holds even for every minor-closed family of graphs, such as bounded-treewidth graphs, for which a two-decade old data structure (Arikati et al., J.~Algorithms 1998) implies the first near-linear time construction of cut-equivalent trees. Moreover, unlike all previous techniques for constructing cut-equivalent trees, ours is robust to relying on approximation algorithms. In particular, using the almost-linear time algorithm for $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate minimum $st$-cut (Kelner et al., SODA 2014), we can construct a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate flow-equivalent tree (which is a slightly weaker notion) in time $n^{2+o(1)}$. This leads to the first $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation for All-Pairs Max-Flow that runs in time $n^{2+o(1)}$, and matches the output size almost-optimally."}}
