Conventional generic / salient object detection techniques are suboptimal for this task because they tend to only discover easy and clear objects, while overlooking the difficult-to-detect ones with inherent uncertainties derived from indistinguishable textures. In this work, we contribute a novel approach using a probabilistic representational model in combination with transformers to explicitly reason under uncertainties, namely uncertainty-guided transformer reasoning (UGTR), for camouflaged object detection. The core idea is to first learn a conditional distribution over the backbone's output to obtain initial estimates and associated uncertainties, and then reason over these uncertain regions with attention mechanism to produce final predictions. Our approach combines the benefits of both Bayesian learning and Transformer-based reasoning, allowing the model to handle camouflaged object detection by leveraging both deterministic and probabilistic information. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed approach can achieve higher accuracy than existing state-of-the-art models on CHAMELEON, CAMO and COD10K datasets.

To learn a better embedding space without extra computational overhead, we explicitly employ auxiliary classification supervision. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks, ie, CoCA, CoSOD3k, and Cosal2015, demonstrate that our simple GCNet outperforms 10 cutting-edge models and achieves the new state-of-the-art.

CoSOD is an emerging and rapidly growing extension of salient object detection (SOD), which aims to detect the co-occurring salient objects in a group of images. However, existing CoSOD datasets often have a serious data bias, assuming that each group of images contains salient objects of similar visual appearances. This bias can lead to the ideal settings and effectiveness of models trained on existing datasets, being impaired in real-life situations, where similarities are usually semantic or conceptual. To tackle this issue, we first introduce a new benchmark, called CoSOD3k in the wild, which requires a large amount of semantic context, making it more challenging than existing CoSOD datasets. Our CoSOD3k consists of 3,316 high-quality, elaborately selected images divided into 160 groups with hierarchical annotations. The images span a wide range of categories, shapes, object sizes, and backgrounds. Second, we integrate the existing SOD techniques to build a unified, trainable CoSOD framework, which is long overdue in this field. Specifically, we propose a novel CoEG-Net that augments our prior model EGNet with a co-attention projection strategy to enable fast common information learning. CoEG-Net fully leverages previous large-scale SOD datasets and significantly improves the model scalability and stability. Third, we comprehensively summarize 40 cutting-edge algorithms, benchmarking 18 of them over three challenging CoSOD datasets (iCoSeg, CoSal2015, and our CoSOD3k), and reporting more detailed (i.e., group-level) performance analysis. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future works of CoSOD. We hope that our study will give a strong boost to growth in the CoSOD community.

Existing RGB-D saliency detection models treat this task as a point estimation problem by predicting a single saliency map following a deterministic learning pipeline. We argue that, however, the deterministic solution is relatively ill-posed. Inspired by the saliency data labeling process, we propose a generative architecture to achieve probabilistic RGB-D saliency detection which utilizes a latent variable to model the labeling variations. Our framework includes two main models: 1) a generator model, which maps the input image and latent variable to stochastic saliency prediction, and 2) an inference model, which gradually updates the latent variable by sampling it from the true or approximate posterior distribution. The generator model is an encoder-decoder saliency network. To infer the latent variable, we introduce two different solutions: i) a Conditional Variational Auto-encoder with an extra encoder to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variable; and ii) an Alternating Back-Propagation technique, which directly samples the latent variable from the true posterior distribution. Qualitative and quantitative results on six challenging RGB-D benchmark datasets show our approach's superior performance in learning the distribution of saliency maps.

Over the years, developments in VPS are not moving forward with ease due to the lack of large-scale fine-grained segmentation annotations. To address this issue, we first introduce a high-quality frame-by-frame annotated VPS dataset, named SUN-SEG, which contains 158,690 colonoscopy frames from the well-known SUN-database. We provide additional annotations with diverse types, i.e., attribute, object mask, boundary, scribble, and polygon. Second, we design a simple but efficient baseline, dubbed PNS+, consisting of a global encoder, a local encoder, and normalized self-attention (NS) blocks. The global and local encoders receive an anchor frame and multiple successive frames to extract long-term and short-term spatial-temporal representations, which are then progressively updated by two NS blocks. Extensive experiments show that PNS+ achieves the best performance and real-time inference speed (170fps), making it a promising solution for the VPS task. Third, we extensively evaluate 13 representative polyp/object segmentation models on our SUN-SEG dataset and provide attribute-based comparisons. Finally, we discuss several open issues and suggest possible research directions for the VPS community."}}

Coupling these two components enables OSFormer to efficiently blend local features and long-range context dependencies for predicting camouflaged instances.

An essential property of camouflaged objects is that they usually exhibit patterns similar to the background and thus make them hard to identify from still images. Therefore, effectively handling temporal dynamics in videos becomes the key for the VCOD task as the camouflaged objects will be noticeable when they move. However, current VCOD methods often leverage homography or optical flows to represent motions, where the detection error may accumulate from both the motion estimation error and the segmentation error. On the other hand, our method unifies motion estimation and object segmentation within a single optimization framework. Specifically, we build a dense correlation volume to implicitly capture motions between neighbouring frames and utilize the final segmentation supervision to optimize the implicit motion estimation and segmentation jointly. Furthermore, to enforce temporal consistency within a video sequence, we jointly utilize a spatio-temporal transformer to refine the short-term predictions. Extensive experiments on VCOD benchmarks demonstrate the architectural effectiveness of our approach. We also provide a large-scale VCOD dataset named MoCA-Mask with pixel-level handcrafted ground-truth masks and construct a comprehensive VCOD bench-mark with previous methods to facilitate research in this direction.
