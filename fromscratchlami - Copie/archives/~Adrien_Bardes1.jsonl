However, our understanding and knowledge of the representation are still limited. This work shows that the success of the SOTA Siamese-network-based SSL approaches is primarily based on learning a distributed representation of image patches. In particular, we show that when we learn a representation only for fixed-scale image patches and aggregate different patch representations for an image (instance), it can achieve on par or even better results than the baseline methods on several benchmarks. Further, we show that the patch representation aggregation can also improve various SOTA baseline methods by a large margin. We also establish a formal connection between the Siamese-network-based SSL objective and the image patches co-occurrence statistics modeling, which supplements the prevailing invariance perspective. By visualizing the nearest neighbors of different image patches in the embedding space and projection space, we show that while the projection has more invariance, the embedding space tends to preserve more equivariance and locality. While it is important to push the SOTA engineering frontier, we show that it is also a promising direction to simplify the SOTA methods to build better understanding."}}

However, our understanding of the principle behind learning such a representation is still limited. This work shows that joint-embedding SSL approaches primarily learn a representation of image patches, which reflects their co-occurrence. Such a connection to co-occurrence modeling can be established formally, and it supplements the prevailing invariance perspective. We empirically show that learning a representation for fixed-scale patches and aggregating local patch representations as the image representation achieves similar or even better results than the baseline methods. We denote this process as BagSSL. Even with 32x32 patch representation, BagSSL achieves 62% top-1 linear probing accuracy on ImageNet. On the other hand, with a multi-scale pretrained model, we show that the whole image embedding is approximately the average of local patch embeddings. While the SSL representation is relatively invariant at the global scale, we show that locality is preserved when we zoom into local patch-level representation. Further, we show that patch representation aggregation can improve various SOTA baseline methods by a large margin. The patch representation is considerably easier to understand, and this work makes a step to demystify self-supervised representation learning."}}

This usually skimmed-over trick is actually critical for SSL methods to display competitive performances. For example, on ImageNet classification, more than 30 points of percentage can be gained that way. This is a little vexing, as one would hope that the network layer at which invariance is explicitly enforced by the SSL criterion during training (the last layer) should be the one to use for best generalization performance downstream. But it seems not to be, and this study sheds some light on why. This trick, which we name Guillotine Regularization (GR), is in fact a generically applicable form of regularization that has also been used to improve generalization performance in transfer learning scenarios. In this work, through theory and experiments, we formalize GR and identify the underlying reasons behind its success in SSL methods. Our study shows that the use of this trick is essential to SSL performance for two main reasons: (i) improper data-augmentations to define the positive pairs used during training, and/or (ii) suboptimal selection of the hyper-parameters of the SSL loss."}}
