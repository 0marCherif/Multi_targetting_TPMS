Existing approaches optimize a pipeline of pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection and hyperparameter optimization, and assume that the user is fully aware of the choice of the underlying metric (such as precision, recall or F1-measure). However, end-users are often unaware of the actual implications of choosing a metric, as the resulting models often significantly vary in their predictions. In this work, we propose a framework to personalise AutoML for\nindividual end-users by learning a designated ranking model from pairwise user preferences and using the latter as the metric function for state-of-the-art AutoML systems. Given a set of possible metrics, we generate candidate models by repeatedly running AutoML with combinations of the former and have the user choose between pairs of resulting models. We use RankNet to learn a personalized ranking function for the end-user, which is used as loss function for final run of a standard AutoML system.\nTo evaluate our proposed framework we define three preferences a user could pursue and show that a ranking model is able to learn these preferences from pairwise comparisons. Furthermore, by changing the metric function of AutoML we show that a personalized preference is able to improve machine learning pipelines. We evaluated the ability of learning a personalized preference and the entire framework on several OpenML multi-class classification datasets."}}

Lifted data representations might enable a new class of semantic agents for complex decision-making on the Web, reaching from filling out Web forms and booking flights to mastering any Web-based task. However, exclusively using semantic models has several drawbacks, such as extensive manual efforts for enabling semantic agents to solve Web tasks or limited capabilities to personalize task solutions for end users. While using semantics is a crucial component for guiding prospective semantic agents, we have to find a balance between modelling rich background knowledge and learning optimal agent behaviour through advanced Machine Learning (ML) methods. In this work, we propose a semantic agent framework for (i) modelling agent-related semantic annotations for Web tasks, (ii) using the latter to train statistical agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in an offline simulation as well as in real online use and (iii) feeding back the learned agent behaviour and its provenance information in terms of a semantic model that can be directly used by purely semantics-based agents. We evaluate our approach based on the MiniWob++ benchmark for automatically solving Web tasks. We show that our proposed semantic agent framework enables to (i) warm start agents with semantic background knowledge to faster learn task-dependent optimal behaviour in terms of the expected cumulative reward and (ii) directly reuse the learned behaviour by semantic-based agents that act by automatically derived Notation3 (N3) implication rules."}}

Using a shared-nothing computer cluster is a way to achieve scalability by carrying out query processing on top of large RDF datasets in a distributed fashion. Aiming to this the current paper elaborates on the impact of relational schema design when queries are mapped into Apache Spark SQL. A single triple table, a set of tables resulting from partitioning by predicate, a single wide table covering all properties, and a set of tables based on the application model specification called domain-dependent-schema, are the considered designs. For each of the mentioned approaches, the rows of the corresponding tables are stored in the distributed file system HDFS using the columnar-store Parquet. Experiments using standard benchmarks demonstrate that the single wide property table approach, despite its simplicity, is superior to other approaches. Further experiments demonstrate that this single table approach continues to be attractive even when repartitioning by key (RDF subject) is applied before executing queries."}}

Despite the potential and added value that such aggregate applications bring, the implementations are usually custom solutions for particular use cases and do not support easy integration of further devices. To this end, the vision of the Web of Things (WoT) is to leverage Web standards in order to interconnect all types of devices and real-world objects, and thus to make them a part of the World Wide Web (WWW) and provide overall interoperability. In this context we introduce Smart Web Services (SmartWS) that not only provide remote access to resources and functionalities, by relying on standard communication protocols, but also encapsulate `intelligence'. Smartness features can include, for instance, context-based adaptation, cognition, inference and rules that implement autonomous decision logic in order to realize services that automatically perform tasks on behalf of the users, without requiring their explicit involvement. In this paper, we present the key characteristics of SmartWS, and introduce a reference implementation framework. Furthermore, we describe a specific use case for implementing SmartWS in the medical domain and specify a maturity model for determining the quality and usability of SmartWS."}}

Consequently, there are numerous, partly redundant data analytics services, each optimized for data with certain characteristics. Often, analytics tasks require multiple services to be pipelined to find a solution, where combinations of exchangeable services for single steps might outperform one-service-predictions. This work proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) perception of prior setting, where decentralized agents are considered to manage services, having to coordinate their decisions to find a consensus. We, first, propose a supervised method for service accuracy estimation and, therefore, exploit locality-sensitive features of training data. Given a committee of services managed by agents, we develop coordination strategies to handle conflicting confidences and reduce erroneous predictions due to service correlation. We evaluate our approach with Named Entity Recognition (NER)- and Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) services on text corpora with heterogeneous characteristics (i.e. news articles and tweets). Our empirical results improve the out-of-the-box performance of the original services."}}

In most of the cases, there exist numerous, exchangeable software components for a single step, each an \"expert\" for data with certain characteristics. Which expert to apply to which observed data instance in which step becomes a challenge that is even hard for humans to decide. In this work, we treat the problem as Single-Agent System (SAS) where a centralized agent learns how to best exploit experts. We therefore define locality-sensitive relational measures for experts and data points, so-called \"meta-dependencies\", to assess expert performances, and use them for decision-making via Online Model-Free- and Batch Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches, building on techniques from Contextual Bandits (CBs) and Statistical Relational Learning (SRL). The resulting system automatically learns to pick the best pipeline of experts for a given set of data points. We evaluate our approach for Entity Linking on text corpora with heterogeneous characteristics (such as news articles or tweets). Our empirical results improve the estimation of expert accuracies as well as the out-of-the-box performance of the original experts without manual tuning."}}

For a successful operation the surgeon has to keep track of a variety of relevant impact factors, such as patient-individual medical history records, valve geometries, or tissue properties of the surgical target, and thereon-based deduce type and size of the best-suitable ring prosthesis according to practical surgery experience. With this work, we aim at supporting the surgeon in selecting this ring prosthesis by means of a comprehensive information processing pipeline. It gathers all available patient-individual information, and mines this data according to 'surgical rules', that represent published MVR expert knowledge and recommended best practices, in order to suggest a set of potentially suitable annuloplasty rings. Subsequently, these rings are employed in biomechanical MVR simulation scenarios, which simulate the behavior of the patient-specific mitral valve subjected to the respective virtual ring implantation. We present the implementation of our deductive system for MVR ring selection and how it is integrated into a cognitive data processing pipeline architecture, which is built under consideration of Linked Data principles in order to facilitate holistic information processing of heterogeneous medical data. By the example of MVR surgery, we demonstrate the ease of use and the applicability of our development. We expect to essentially support patient-specific decision making in MVR surgery by means of this holistic information processing approach."}}

However, medicine is also one of the most demanding domains for computer-based support systems, since medical assistance tasks are complex and the practical experience of the physician is crucial. Recent developments in the area of cognitive computing appear to be well suited to tackle medicine as an application domain. Methods We propose a system based on the idea of cognitive computing and consisting of auto-configurable medical assistance algorithms and their self-adapting combination. The system enables automatic execution of new algorithms, given they are made available as Medical Cognitive Apps and are registered in a central semantic repository. Learning components can be added to the system to optimize the results in the cases when numerous Medical Cognitive Apps are available for the same task. Our prototypical implementation is applied to the areas of surgical phase recognition based on sensor data and image progressing for tumor progression mappings. Results Our results suggest that such assistance algorithms can be automatically configured in execution pipelines, candidate results can be automatically scored and combined, and the system can learn from experience. Furthermore, our evaluation shows that the Medical Cognitive Apps are providing the correct results as they did for local execution and run in a reasonable amount of time. Conclusion The proposed solution is applicable to a variety of medical use cases and effectively supports the automated and self-adaptive configuration of cognitive pipelines based on medical interpretation algorithms."}}
