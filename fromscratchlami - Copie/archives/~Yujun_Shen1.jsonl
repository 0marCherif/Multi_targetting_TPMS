An inaccurate estimation may mislead the model into learning faulty geometry. This work proposes PoF3D that frees generative radiance fields from the requirements of 3D pose priors. We first equip the generator with an efficient pose learner, which is able to infer a pose from a latent code, to approximate the underlying true pose distribution automatically. We then assign the discriminator a task to learn pose distribution under the supervision of the generator and to differentiate real and synthesized images with the predicted pose as the condition. The pose-free generator and the pose-aware discriminator are jointly trained in an adversarial manner. Extensive results on a couple of datasets confirm that the performance of our approach, regarding both image quality and geometry quality, is on par with state of the art. To our best knowledge, PoF3D demonstrates the feasibility of learning high-quality 3D-aware image synthesis without using 3D pose priors for the first time."}}

Establishing such a connection facilitates a more convenient local control of GAN generation, where users can alter image content only within a spatial area simply by partially resampling the latent codes. Experimental results confirm four appealing properties of our regularizer, which we call LinkGAN. (1) Any image region can be linked to the latent space, even if the region is pre-selected before training and fixed for all instances. (2) Two or multiple regions can be independently linked to different latent axes, surprisingly allowing tokenized control of synthesized images. (3) Our regularizer can improve the spatial controllability of both 2D and 3D GAN models, barely sacrificing the synthesis performance. (4) The models trained with our regularizer are compatible with GAN inversion techniques and maintain editability on real images"}}

Particularly focusing on visual and linguistic modalities, we categorize data knowledge into five unit types, namely, in-image, in-text, cross-image, cross-text, and image-text, and set up an efficient pipeline to help construct the multimodal knowledge graph from any data collection. Thanks to the logical information naturally contained in knowledge graph, organizing datasets under UKnow format opens up more possibilities of data usage compared to the commonly used image-text pairs. Following UKnow protocol, we collect, from public international news, a large-scale multimodal knowledge graph dataset that consists of 1,388,568 nodes (with 571,791 vision-related ones) and 3,673,817 triplets. The dataset is also annotated with rich event tags, including 11 coarse labels and 9,185 fine labels. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the potential of UKnow in supporting common-sense reasoning and boosting vision-language pre-training with a single dataset, benefiting from its unified form of knowledge organization. Code, dataset, and models will be made publicly available."}}

Despite the recent advance in short-form videos (\\textit{e.g.}, in minutes), temporal grounding in long videos (\\textit{e.g.}, in hours) is still at its early stage. To address this challenge, a common practice is to employ a sliding window, yet can be inefficient and inflexible due to the limited number of frames within the window. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework for fast temporal grounding, which is able to model an hours-long video with \\textbf{one-time} network execution. Our pipeline is formulated in a coarse-to-fine manner, where we first extract context knowledge from non-overlapped video clips (\\textit{i.e.}, anchors), and then supplement the anchors that highly response to the query with detailed content knowledge. Besides the remarkably high pipeline efficiency, another advantage of our approach is the capability of capturing long-range temporal correlation, thanks to modeling the entire video as a whole, and hence facilitates more accurate grounding. Experimental results suggest that, on the long-form video datasets MAD and Ego4d, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts, and achieves \\textbf{14.6$\\times$} / \\textbf{102.8$\\times$} higher efficiency respectively.

This work offers a new generation paradigm that allows flexible control of the output image, such as spatial layout and palette, while maintaining the synthesis quality and model creativity. With compositionality as the core idea, we first decompose an image into representative factors, and then train a diffusion model with all these factors as the conditions to recompose the input. At the inference stage, the rich intermediate representations work as composable elements, leading to a huge design space (i.e., exponentially proportional to the number of decomposed factors) for customizable content creation. It is noteworthy that our approach, which we call Composer, supports various levels of conditions, such as text description as the global information, depth map and sketch as the local guidance, color histogram for low-level details, etc. Besides improving controllability, we confirm that Composer serves as a general framework and facilitates a wide range of classical generative tasks without retraining. Code and models will be made available."}}

GAN generator learns to compose realistic images and reproduce the real data distribution. Through that, a hierarchical visual feature with multi-level semantics spontaneously emerges. In this work we investigate that such a generative feature learned from image synthesis exhibits great potentials in solving a wide range of computer vision tasks, including both generative ones and more importantly discriminative ones. We first train an encoder by considering the pretrained StyleGAN generator as a learned loss function. The visual features produced by our encoder, termed as Generative Hierarchical Features (GH-Feat), highly align with the layer-wise GAN representations, and hence describe the input image adequately from the reconstruction perspective. Extensive experiments support the versatile transferability of GH-Feat across a range of applications, such as image editing, image processing, image harmonization, face verification, landmark detection, layout prediction, image retrieval, etc. We further show that, through a proper spatial expansion, our developed GH-Feat can also facilitate fine-grained semantic segmentation using only a few annotations. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the appealing performance of GH-Feat."}}

Despite its recent success in image synthesis, applying DPMs to video generation is still challenging due to high-dimensional data spaces. Previous methods usually adopt a standard diffusion process, where frames in the same video clip are destroyed with independent noises, ignoring the content redundancy and temporal correlation. This work presents a decomposed diffusion process via resolving the per-frame noise into a base noise that is shared among all frames and a residual noise that varies along the time axis. The denoising pipeline employs two jointly-learned networks to match the noise decomposition accordingly. Experiments on various datasets confirm that our approach, termed as VideoFusion, surpasses both GAN-based and diffusion-based alternatives in high-quality video generation. We further show that our decomposed formulation can benefit from pre-trained image diffusion models and well-support text-conditioned video creation."}}

This work presents Vision Middleware (ViM), a new learning paradigm that targets unified transferring from a single foundation model to a variety of downstream tasks. ViM consists of a zoo of lightweight plug-in modules, each of which is independently learned on a midstream dataset with a shared frozen backbone. Downstream tasks can then benefit from an adequate aggregation of the module zoo thanks to the rich knowledge inherited from midstream tasks. There are three major advantages of such a design. From the efficiency aspect, the upstream backbone can be trained only once and reused for all downstream tasks without tuning. From the scalability aspect, we can easily append additional modules to ViM with no influence on existing modules. From the performance aspect, ViM can include as many midstream tasks as possible, narrowing the task gap between upstream and downstream. Considering these benefits, we believe that ViM, which the community could maintain and develop together, would serve as a powerful tool to assist foundation models."}}

Unlike most vision tasks that have per-sample ground-truth, image synthesis targets generating \\emph{unseen} data and hence is usually evaluated with a distributional distance between one set of real samples and another set of generated samples. This work provides an empirical study on the evaluation of synthesis performance by taking the popular generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a representative of generative models. In particular, we make in-depth analyses on how to represent a data point in the feature space, how to calculate a fair distance using selected samples, and how many instances to use from each set. Experiments on multiple datasets and settings suggest that (1) a group of models including both CNN-based and ViT-based architectures serve as reliable and robust feature extractors, (2) Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) enables better comparison across various extractors and hierarchical layers in one model, and (3) CKA shows satisfactory sample efficiency and complements existing metrics (\\textit{e.g.}, FID) in characterizing the similarity between two internal data correlations. These findings help us design a new measurement system, based on which we re-evaluate the state-of-the-art generative models in a consistent and reliable way."}}
