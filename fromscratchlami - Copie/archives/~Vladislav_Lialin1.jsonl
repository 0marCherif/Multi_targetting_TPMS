Currently popular video-text data mining approach via automatic speech recognition (ASR) used in HowTo100M provides low-quality captions that often do not refer to the video content. Other mining approaches do not provide proper language descriptions (video tags) and are biased toward short clips (alt text). In this work, we show how recent advances in image captioning allow us to pre-train high-quality video models without any parallel video-text data. We pre-train several video captioning models that are based on an OPT language model and a TimeSformer visual backbone. We fine-tune these networks on several video captioning datasets. First, we demonstrate that image captioning pseudolabels work better for pre-training than the existing HowTo100M ASR captions. Second, we show that pre-training on both images and videos produces a significantly better network (+4 CIDER on MSR-VTT) than pre-training on a single modality. Our methods are complementary to the existing pre-training or data mining approaches and can be used in a variety of settings. Given the efficacy of the pseudolabeling method, we are planning to publicly release the generated captions."}}

However, conclusions from such studies may be limited when the probing benchmarks are small and lack statistical power. In this work, we introduce new, larger datasets for negation (NEG-1500-SIMP) and role reversal (ROLE-1500) inspired by psycholinguistic studies. We dramatically extend existing NEG-136 and ROLE-88 benchmarks using GPT3, increasing their size from 18 and 44 sentence pairs to 750 each. We also create another version of extended negation dataset (NEG-1500-SIMP-TEMP), created using template-based generation. It consists of 770 sentence pairs. We evaluate 22 models on the extended datasets, seeing model performance dip 20-57% compared to the original smaller benchmarks. We observe high levels of negation sensitivity in models like BERT and ALBERT demonstrating that previous findings might have been skewed due to smaller test sets. Finally, we observe that while GPT3 has generated all the examples in ROLE-1500 is only able to solve 24.6% of them during probing."}}

In our work, we utilize the oLMpics benchmark and psycholinguistic probing datasets for a diverse set of 29 models including T5, BART, and ALBERT. Additionally, we adapt the oLMpics zero-shot setup for autoregressive models and evaluate GPT networks of different sizes. Our findings show that none of these models can resolve compositional questions in a zero-shot fashion, suggesting that this skill is not learnable using existing pre-training objectives. Furthermore, we find that global model decisions such as architecture, directionality, size of the dataset, and pre-training objective are not predictive of a model's linguistic capabilities."}}

The questions are generated by medical experts from 100+ MIMIC-III discharge summaries. We analyze this dataset to characterize the types of information sought by medical experts. We also train baseline models for trigger detection and question generation (QG), paired with unsupervised answer retrieval over EHRs. Our baseline model is able to generate high quality questions in over 62% of cases when prompted with human selected triggers.

Datasets for these models often receive small and frequent updates, data patches. Each patch requires training a new model. To reduce training time, one can fine-tune the previously trained model on each patch, but naive fine-tuning exhibits catastrophic forgetting - degradation of the model performance on the data not represented in the data patch. In this work, we propose a simple method that alleviates catastrophic forgetting and show that it is possible to match the performance of a model trained from scratch in less than 10% of a time via fine-tuning. The key to achieving this is supersampling and EWC regularization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on multiple splits of the Facebook TOP and SNIPS datasets."}}

However, all Transformer computations occur at the level of word representations and therefore, it may be argued that Transformer models do not explicitly attempt to learn hierarchical structure which is widely assumed to be integral to language. In the present work, we introduce hierarchical processing into the Transformer model, taking inspiration from the U-Net architecture, popular in computer vision for its hierarchical view of natural images. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms both the vanilla Transformer and some strong baselines in the domain of chit-chat dialogue."}}
