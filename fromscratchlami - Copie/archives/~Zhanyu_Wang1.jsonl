We assume that the learner can access several similar tasks. The goal of the learner is to transfer knowledge from the prior tasks to a similar but novel task. For $p$ parameters, size of the support set $k$, and $l$ samples per task, we show that $T \\in O((k \\log (p-k)) / l)$ tasks are sufficient in order to recover the common support of all tasks. With the recovered support, we can greatly reduce the sample complexity for estimating the parameter of the novel task, i.e., $l \\in O(1)$ with respect to $T$ and $p$. We also prove that our rates are minimax optimal. A key difference between meta-learning and the classical multi-task learning, is that meta-learning focuses only on the recovery of the parameters of the novel task, while multi-task learning estimates the parameter of all tasks, which requires $l$ to grow with $T$. Instead, our efficient meta-learning estimator allows for $l$ to be constant with respect to $T$ (i.e., few-shot learning)."}}

The proposed pruning method does not require retraining or the expert knowledge on the sparsity level. To overcome the computational formidability of estimating the flat directions, we propose to use a carefully tuned $\\ell_1$ proximal gradient algorithm which can provably achieve the directional pruning with a small learning rate after sufficient training. The empirical results demonstrate the promising results of our solution in highly sparse regime (92% sparsity) among many existing pruning methods on the ResNet50 with the ImageNet, while using only a slightly higher wall time and memory footprint than the SGD. Using the VGG16 and the wide ResNet 28x10 on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we demonstrate that our solution reaches the same minima valley as the SGD, and the minima found by our solution and the SGD do not deviate in directions that impact the training loss.

Most existing dynamic pricing policy, which focus on the faithfulness of adopted customer choice models, exhibit a limited capability for adapting the online uncertainty of learned statistical model during pricing process. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for designing dynamic pricing policy based regularized online statistical learning with theoretical guarantees. The new approach overcomes the challenge of continuous monitoring of online Lasso procedure and possesses several appealing properties. In particular, we make the decisive observation that the always-validity of pricing decisions builds and thrives on the online regularization scheme. Our proposed online regularization scheme equips the proposed optimistic online regularized maximum likelihood pricing (OORMLP) pricing policy with three major advantages: encode market noise knowledge into pricing process optimism; empower online statistical learning with always-validity over all decision points; envelop prediction error process with time-uniform non-asymptotic oracle inequalities. This type of non-asymptotic inference results allows us to design more sample-efficient and robust dynamic pricing algorithms in practice. In theory, the proposed OORMLP algorithm exploits the sparsity structure of high-dimensional models and secures a logarithmic regret in a decision horizon. These theoretical advances are made possible by proposing an optimistic online Lasso procedure that resolves dynamic pricing problems at the process level, based on a novel use of non-asymptotic martingale concentration. In experiments, we evaluate OORMLP in different synthetic and real pricing problem settings, and demonstrate that OORMLP advances the state-of-the-art methods."}}

The current bottleneck of draft genome continuity using the second generation sequencing (SGS) reads is primarily caused by uncertainty among repetitive sequences. Even though the single-molecule real-time sequencing technology is very promising to overcome the uncertainty issue, its relatively high cost and error rate add burden on budget or computation. Many long-read assemblers take the overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) paradigm, which is less sensitive to sequencing errors, heterozygosity and variability of coverage. However, current assemblers of SGS data do not sufficiently take advantage of the OLC approach."}}
