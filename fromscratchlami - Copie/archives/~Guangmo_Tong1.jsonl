Such problems, called inverse decision-making with task migrations, are of interest in that the complex and stochastic nature of real-world applications often prevents the agent from completely knowing the underlying system. In this paper, we introduce such a new problem with formal formulations and present a generic framework for addressing decision-making tasks in social contagion management. On the theory side, we present a generalization analysis for justifying the learning performance of our framework. In empirical studies, we perform a sanity check and compare the presented method with other possible learning-based and graph-based methods. We have acquired promising experimental results, confirming for the first time that it is possible to solve one decision-making task by using the solutions associated with another one."}}

Therefore, we are frequently confronted with combinatorial optimization problems of which the objective function is unknown and thus has to be debunked using empirical evidence. In contrast to the common practice that relies on a learning-and-optimization strategy, we consider the regression between combinatorial spaces, aiming to infer high-quality optimization solutions from samples of input-solution pairs -- without the need to learn the objective function. Our main deliverable is a universal solver that is able to handle abstract undetermined stochastic combinatorial optimization problems. For learning foundations, we present learning-error analysis under the PAC-Bayesian framework using a new margin-based analysis. In empirical studies, we demonstrate our design using proof-of-concept experiments, and compare it with other methods that are potentially applicable. Overall, we obtain highly encouraging experimental results for several classic combinatorial problems on both synthetic and real-world datasets."}}

In this article, we present an analysis of the time-constrained adaptive IM problem. On the theory side, we provide the hardness results of computing the optimal policy and a lower bound on the adaptive gap, which measures the superiority of adaptive policies over the nonadaptive policies. For practical solutions, from basic to advanced, we design a series of seeding policies for achieving high efficacy and scalability.

Accurately modeling information dynamics under such a mode is important, as it provides a means of mining latent spread patterns and understanding user behaviors. In this paper, we design a novel temporal point process model to characterize information cascades in online discussion forums. The proposed model views the entire event space as a nested structure composed of main thread streams and their linked reply streams, and it explicitly models the correlations between these two types of streams through their intensity functions. Leveraging the Reddit data, we examine the performance of the designed model in different applications and compare it with other popular methods. The experimental results have shown that our model can produce competitive results, and it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in most cases."}}

However, due to dynamic internal and external influences from the sailing ship such as changing sailing speed, the existing localization systems suffer huge accuracy degradation in a mobile ship environment. The challenges are mainly due to rich and arbitrary ship motions and the resulting complicated impacts on the indoor wireless channels. To address the challenges, in this article, we first propose a ship motion descriptor to extract discriminative latent representation from complex ship motions by leveraging deep-learning techniques. Based on this representation, we then design a novel fingerprint roaming model, i.e., MoLoc, to automatically learn the predictive fingerprint variation pattern and transfer the online fingerprint measurement to adapt to dynamic ship motions in real time. Furthermore, an unsupervised learning strategy is proposed to train the fingerprint roaming model using unlabeled onboard collected data which do not incur any labor costs. We have implemented and extensively evaluated MoLoc on real-world cruise ships, where experimental results demonstrate that MoLoc improves localization accuracy from 63.2% to 92.8% compared to the state-of-the-art localization methods, including Pilot, LiFS, SpotFi, and AutoFi while achieving a mean error of 0.68 m."}}

Due to the constraints of bandwidth, latency, and privacy concerns, tracking tasks are more preferable to run on edge devices sitting close to the cameras. However, edge devices are provisioned with a fixed amount of compute budget, making them incompetent to adapt to time-varying tracking workloads caused by traffic dynamics. In coping with this challenge, we propose WatchDog, a real-time vehicle tracking system fully utilizes edge nodes across the road network. WatchDog leverages computer vision tasks with different resource-accuracy trade-offs, and decompose and schedule tracking tasks judiciously across edge devices based on the current workload to maximize the number of tasks while ensuring a provable response time bound at each edge device. Extensive evaluations have been conducted using real-world city-wide vehicle trajectory datasets, showing a 100% tracking coverage with real-time guarantee."}}

In this paper, we consider such a setting and study the misinformation prevention problem. Given the examples of attacker-protector pairs, our goal is to learn a strategy to compute protectors against future attackers, without the need of knowing the underlying diffusion model. To this end, we design a structured prediction framework, where the main idea is to parameterize the scoring function using random features constructed through distance functions on randomly sampled subgraphs, which leads to a kernelized scoring function with weights learnable via the large margin method. Evidenced by experiments, our method can produce near-optimal protectors without using any information of the diffusion model, and it outperforms other possible graph-based and learning-based methods by an evident margin."}}

People share thoughts and opinions through posting threads and replies, which form a unique communication structure between main threads and associated replies. It is significant to understand the information diffusion pattern under such a communication structure, where an essential task is to predict the arrival time of future events. In this work, we proposed a novel yet simple framework, called SocialGrid, for modeling events in online discussing forms. Our framework first transforms the entire event space into a grid representation by grouping successive evens in one time interval of a particular length. Based on the nature of the grid, we leverage the Temporal Convolution Network to learn the dynamics at the grid level. Varying the temporal scope of an individual grid, the learned grid model can be used to predict the arrival time of future events at different granularities. Leveraging the Reddit data, we validate the proposed method through experiments on a series of applications. Extensive experiments and a real-world application. Results have shown that our framework excels at various cascade prediction tasks comparing with other approaches."}}

When a user receives two opposing opinions, they tend to believe the one arrives first. Therefore, once misinformation or rumor is detected, one containment method is to introduce a positive cascade competing against the rumor. Given a budget k, the rumor blocking problem asks for k seed users to trigger the spread of a positive cascade such that the number of the users who are not influenced by rumor can be maximized. The prior works have shown that the rumor blocking problem can be approximated within a factor of (1-1/e) by a classic greedy algorithm combined with Monte Carlo simulation. Unfortunately, the Monte Carlo simulation based methods are time consuming and the existing algorithms either trade performance guarantees for practical efficiency or vice versa. In this paper, we present a randomized approximation algorithm which is provably superior to the state-of-the art methods with respect to running time. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by experiments done on both the real-world and synthetic social networks."}}
