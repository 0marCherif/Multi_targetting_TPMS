We consider a new setting for this problem where sample features are easily measured whereas sample labels are unknown and costly to obtain. Accordingly, we devise a three-stage framework in service of performing an effective two-sample test with only a small number of sample label queries: first, a classifier is trained with samples uniformly labeled to model the posterior probabilities of the labels; second, a novel query scheme dubbed bimodal query is used to query labels of samples from both classes, and last, the classical Friedman-Rafsky (FR) two-sample test is performed on the queried samples. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments performed on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed test controls the Type I error and has decreased Type II error relative to uniform querying and certainty-based querying."}}
