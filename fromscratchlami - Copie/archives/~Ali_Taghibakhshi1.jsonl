While there are many different clustering variants (based on given distance or graph structure, probability distributions, or data density), we consider here the problem of clustering nodes in a graph, motivated by the problem of aggregating discrete degrees of freedom in multigrid and domain decomposition methods for solving sparse linear systems. Specifically, we consider the challenge of forming balanced clusters in the graph of a sparse matrix for use in algebraic multigrid, although the algorithm has general applicability. Based on an extension of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, we generalize Lloyd's algorithm for partitioning subsets of Rn to balance the number of nodes in each cluster; this is accompanied by a rebalancing algorithm that reduces the overall energy in the system. The algorithm provides control over the number of clusters and leads to \"well centered\" partitions of the graph. Theoretical results are provided to establish linear complexity and numerical results in the context of algebraic multigrid highlight the benefits of improved clustering."}}

These solvers rely on several algorithmic and mathematical parameters, prescribing overlap, subdomain boundary conditions, and other properties of the DDM. While some work has been done on optimizing these parameters, it has mostly focused on the one-level setting or special cases such as structured-grid discretizations with regular subdomain construction. In this paper, we propose multigrid graph neural networks (MG-GNN), a novel GNN architecture for learning optimized parameters in two-level DDMs\\@. We train MG-GNN using a new unsupervised loss function, enabling effective training on small problems that yields robust performance on unstructured grids that are orders of magnitude larger than those in the training set. We show that MG-GNN outperforms popular hierarchical graph network architectures for this optimization and that our proposed loss function is critical to achieving this improved performance."}}

It involves identifying and linking different devices belonging to the same person, utilizing sequence logs. Previous data mining techniques have struggled to address the long-range dependencies and higher-order connections between the logs. Recently, researchers have modeled this problem as a graph problem and proposed a two-tier graph contextual embedding (TGCE) neural network architecture, which outperforms previous methods. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical graph neural network architecture (HGNN), which has a more computationally efficient second level design than TGCE. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention (Cross-Att) mechanism in our model, which improves performance by 5% compared to the state-of-the-art TGCE method."}}

This vision-only system is of interest because it is inexpensive, simple for production, and requires no external sensing. This is in contrast to existing systems that rely on integrated position sensors and global positioning system (GPS) technologies. To produce our system we combined a state-of-the-art object detection architecture, You Look Only Once (YOLO), with a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture, Double Deep Q-Networks (Double DQN). The object detection network identifies features on the mower and passes its output to the RL network, providing it with a low-dimensional representation that enables rapid and robust training. Finally, the RL network learns how to navigate the machine to the desired spot in a custom simulation environment. When tested on mower hardware, the system is able to dock with centimeter-level accuracy from arbitrary initial locations and orientations."}}
