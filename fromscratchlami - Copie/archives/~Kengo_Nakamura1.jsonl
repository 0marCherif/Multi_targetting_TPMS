These network infrastructures are required to keep all nodes connected, although these nodes are occasionally disconnected due to failures. Thus, the expected number of connected node pairs (ECP) during an operation period is a reasonable reliability measure in network design. However, no work has studied ECP due to its computational hardness; we have to solve the reliability evaluation problem, which is a computationally tough problem, for O(n <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> ) times where n is the number of nodes in a network. This paper proposes an efficient method that exactly computes ECP. Our method performs dynamic programming just once without explicit repetition for each node pair and obtains an exact ECP value weighted by the number of users at each node. A thorough complexity analysis reveals that our method is faster than an existing reliability evaluation method, which can be transferred to ECP computation, by O(n). Numerical experiments using real topologies show great efficiency; e.g., our method computes the ECP of an 821-link network in ten seconds; the existing method cannot complete it in an hour. This paper also presents two applications: critical link identification and optimal resource (e.g., a server) placement."}}

Among various constraints imposed on a graph, those regarding the connectivity of vertices, such as \"these two vertices must be connected,\" have great importance since they are indispensable for determining various graph substructures, e.g., paths, Steiner trees, and rooted spanning forests. In this view, the subgraph counting problem under connectivity constraints is also important because counting such substructures often corresponds to measuring the importance of a vertex in network infrastructures. However, we must solve the subgraph counting problems multiple times to compute such an importance measure for every vertex. Conventionally, they are solved separately by constructing decision diagrams such as BDD and ZDD for each problem. However, even solving a single subgraph counting is a computationally hard task, preventing us from solving it multiple times in a reasonable time. In this paper, we propose a dynamic programming framework that simultaneously counts subgraphs for every vertex by focusing on similar connectivity constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed method solved multiple subgraph counting problems about 10-20 times faster than the existing approach for many problem settings."}}

Because network reliability evaluation is a computationally heavy task, past research has relied on unre-alistically simple failure models such as the independent failure model, wherein each link fails stochastically and independently, ignoring large-scale failures such as disasters, or the deterministic-correlated failure model, wherein all links within a disaster area always fail. However, actual networks follow the probabilistic-correlated (PC) failure model, wherein links in a disaster area fail stochastically with respect to each disaster. This paper proposes an efficient method to accurately compute network reliability under the PC model. Following a conventional method for the independent model, the proposed method uses binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to efficiently handle an exponential number of failure states. Additionally, it employs a probabilistic inference technique to support probabilistic correlation, which is represented as another BDD for integration with the conventional method. The computational complexity was theoretically analyzed, and its performance was experimentally verified; it can compute the network reliability within 1 h for a large network with nearly 200 links and 100 potential disasters."}}

Traditionally, network reliability has been evaluated on the assumption that the availability of each link is precisely given. However, in reality, it may be given with a degree of uncertainty, e.g., with variance, which must be propagated into the network reliability. To the best of our knowledge, no literature has investigated this issue because, since even computing the reliability itself belongs to a computationally tough class, computing the variance seems much harder.This paper proposes an efficient algorithm to compute the variance of the network reliability given the variance in link availability. We experimentally verify the performance of our algorithm and show that it can compute the variance of network reliability within 0.1 seconds for real topologies with nearly 200 links. We also perform extensive analyses on the variance of network reliability and reveal that network reliability tends to be accurate and that the variance in reliability does not significantly exceed the variance in link availability. Even when some links have a substantial variance in availability, the impact on network reliability is marginal."}}
