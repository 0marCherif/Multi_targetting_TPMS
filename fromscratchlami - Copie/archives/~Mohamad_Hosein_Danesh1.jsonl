We address this issue by using reward machines (RM), a graph-based ab- straction of the underlying task to represent the current setting or context. Using a graph neural network (GNN), we embed the RMs into deep latent vector represen- tations and provide it to the agent to enhance its ability to adapt to new contexts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to embed contextual abstractions and let the agent decide how to use them. Our preliminary empirical evaluation demonstrates improved sample efficiency of our approach upon context transfer on a set of grid navigation tasks."}}

The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) offers a principled general framework for decision making under uncertainty and achieves real-time performance for complex tasks by leveraging Monte Carlo sampling. However, sampling may miss rare, but critical events, leading to potential safety concerns. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new algorithm, LEarning Attention over Driving bEhavioRs (LEADER), which learns to attend to critical human behaviors during planning. LEADER learns a neural network generator to provide attention over human behaviors; it integrates the attention into a belief-space planner through importance sampling, which biases planning towards critical events. To train the attention generator, we form a minimax game between the generator and the planner. By solving this minimax game, LEADER learns to perform risk-aware planning without explicit human effort on data labeling."}}

This is relevant to applications in control, reinforcement learning (RL), and multi-variate time-series, where changes to test time dynamics can impact the performance of learning controllers/predictors in unknown ways. This problem is particularly important in the context of deep RL, where learned controllers often overfit to the training environment. Currently, however, there is a lack of established OODD benchmarks for the types of environments commonly used in RL research. Our first contribution is to design a set of OODD benchmarks derived from common RL environments with varying types and intensities of OODD. Our second contribution is to design a strong OODD baseline approach based on recurrent implicit quantile networks (RIQNs), which monitors autoregressive prediction errors for OODD detection. Our final contribution is to evaluate the RIQN approach on the benchmarks to provide baseline results for future comparison."}}

Recent work focused on minimizing FSMs to gain high-level insight, however, minimization can obscure a deeper understanding by merging states that are semantically distinct. Conversely, our approach starts with an unminimized machine and applies more-interpretable reductions that preserve the key decision points of the policy. We also contribute a saliency tool to attain a deeper understanding of the role of observations in the decisions. Our case studies on policies from 7 Atari games and 3 control benchmarks demonstrate that the approach can reveal insights that have not been noticed in prior work.\n"}}
