However, many powerful imitation techniques do not prioritize the feasibility of the robot behaviors they generate. In this work, we explore the feasibility of plans produced by LfD. As in prior work, we employ a temporal diffusion model with fixed start and goal states to facilitate imitation through in-painting. Unlike previous studies, we apply cold diffusion to ensure the optimization process is directed through the agent's replay buffer of previously visited states. This routing approach increases the likelihood that the final trajectories will predominantly occupy the feasible region of the robot's state space. We test this method in simulated robotic environments with obstacles and observe a significant improvement in the agent's ability to avoid these obstacles during planning."}}

Instead of producing invariant visual features through memorization, invariance through inference turns adaptation at deployment-time into an unsupervised learning problem by trying to match the distribution of latent features to the agent's prior experience without relying on paired data. Although simple, we show that this idea leads to surprising improvements on a variety of adaptation scenarios without access to task reward, including changes in camera poses from the challenging distractor control suite.

While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise for solving relatively straightforward control tasks, it remains an open problem how to best incorporate planning into existing deep RL paradigms to handle increasingly complex environments. One prominent framework, Model-Based RL, learns a world model and plans using step-by-step virtual rollouts. This type of world model quickly diverges from reality when the planning horizon increases, thus struggling at long-horizon planning. How can we learn world models that endow agents with the ability to do temporally extended reasoning? In this work, we propose to learn graph-structured world models composed of sparse, multi-step transitions. We devise a novel algorithm to learn latent landmarks that are scattered (in terms of reachability) across the goal space as the nodes on the graph. In this same graph, the edges are the reachability estimates distilled from Q-functions. On a variety of high-dimensional continuous control tasks ranging from robotic manipulation to navigation, we demonstrate that our method, named L3P, significantly outperforms prior work, and is oftentimes the only method capable of leveraging both the robustness of model-free RL and generalization of graph-search algorithms. We believe our work is an important step towards scalable planning in reinforcement learning."}}

The idea is to evolve a differentiable loss function, such that an agent, which optimizes its policy to minimize this loss, will achieve high rewards. The loss is parametrized via temporal convolutions over the agent's experience. Because this loss is highly flexible in its ability to take into account the agent's history, it enables fast task learning. Empirical results show that our evolved policy gradient algorithm (EPG) achieves faster learning on several randomized environments compared to an off-the-shelf policy gradient method. We also demonstrate that EPG's learned loss can generalize to out-of-distribution test time tasks, and exhibits qualitatively different behavior from other popular metalearning algorithms."}}

Further results are presented on a set of maze environments. We show E-MAML and E-$\\text{RL}^2$ deliver better performance than baseline algorithms on both tasks."}}
