But using explicit 3D representations like voxels comes at large computing cost, adversely affecting scalability. In this work, we propose RVT, a multi-view transformer for 3D manipulation that is both scalable and accurate. Some key features of RVT are an attention mechanism to aggregate information across views and re-rendering of the camera input from virtual views around the robot workspace. In simulations, we find that a single RVT model works well across 18 RLBench tasks with 249 task variations, achieving $26\\%$ higher relative success than the existing state-of-the-art method (PerAct). It also trains 36X faster than PerAct for achieving the same performance and achieves 2.3X the inference speed of PerAct. Further, RVT can perform a variety of manipulation tasks in the real world with just a few ($\\sim$10) demonstrations per task.

Common approaches introduce intrinsic rewards to motivate exploration. For example, visitation count and prediction-based curiosity utilize some measures of novelty to drive the agent to visit novel states in the environment. However, in partially-observable environments, these methods can easily be misled by relatively \u201cnovel\u201d or noisy observations and get stuck around them. Motivated by humans\u2019 exploration behavior of seeing around the environment to get information and avoid unnecessary actions, we consider enlarging the agent\u2019s view area for efficient knowledge acquisition of the environment. In this work, we propose a novel intrinsic reward combining two components: the view-based bonus for ample view coverage and the classical count-based bonus for novel observation discovery. The resulting method, ViewX, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 12 most challenging procedurally-generated tasks on MiniGrid. Additionally, ViewX efficiently learns an exploration policy in the task-agnostic setting, which generalizes well to unseen environments. When exploring new environments on MiniGrid and Habitat, our learned policy significantly outperforms the baselines in terms of scene coverage and extrinsic reward."}}

It requires massive amounts of data drawn from training tasks to infer the common structure shared among tasks. Without heavy reward engineering, the sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks exacerbate the problem of sample efficiency in meta-RL. Another challenge in meta-RL is the discrepancy of difficulty level among tasks, which might cause one easy task dominating learning of the shared policy and thus preclude policy adaptation to new tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel objective function to learn an action translator among training tasks. We theoretically verify that value of the transferred policy with the action translator can be close to the value of the source policy. We propose to combine the action translator with context-based meta-RL algorithms for better data collection and more efficient exploration during meta-training. Our approach of policy transfer empirically improves the sample efficiency and performance of meta-RL algorithms on sparse-reward tasks."}}

We hypothesize that capturing the predictive information is useful in RL, since the ability to model what will happen next is necessary for success on many tasks. To test our hypothesis, we train Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agents from pixels with an auxiliary task that learns a compressed representation of the predictive information of the RL environment dynamics using a contrastive version of the Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (CEB) objective. We refer to these as Predictive Information SAC (PI-SAC) agents. We show that PI-SAC agents can substantially improve sample efficiency over challenging baselines on tasks from the DM Control suite of continuous control environments. We evaluate PI-SAC agents by comparing against uncompressed PI-SAC agents, other compressed and uncompressed agents, and SAC agents directly trained from pixels. Our implementation is given on GitHub."}}

Policy optimization under this setting is extremely challenging as: 1) the geometry of the objective function is hard to optimize efficiently; 2) the shift of data distributions causes high noise in the value estimation. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective policy iteration approach to batch RL using global optimization techniques known as continuation.  By constraining the difference between the learned policy and the behavior policy that generates the fixed trajectories, and continuously relaxing the constraint, our method 1) helps the agent escape local optima; 2) reduces the error in policy evaluation in the optimization procedure.   We present results on a variety of control tasks, game environments, and a recommendation task to empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method."}}

However, it is very difficult to achieve similar success without relying on expert demonstrations. Recent works on self-imitation learning showed that imitating the agent's own past good experience could indirectly drive exploration in some environments, but these methods often lead to sub-optimal and myopic behavior. To address this issue, we argue that exploration in diverse directions by imitating diverse trajectories, instead of focusing on limited good trajectories, is more desirable for the hard-exploration tasks. We propose a new method of learning a trajectory-conditioned policy to imitate diverse trajectories from the agent's own past experiences and show that such self-imitation helps avoid myopic behavior and increases the chance of finding a globally optimal solution for hard-exploration tasks, especially when there are misleading rewards. Our method significantly outperforms existing self-imitation learning and count-based exploration methods on various hard-exploration tasks with local optima. In particular, we report a state-of-the-art score of more than 20,000 points on Montezumas Revenge without using expert demonstrations or resetting to arbitrary states."}}

Instead of directly maximizing rewards, GASIL focuses on reproducing past good trajectories, which can potentially make long-term credit assignment easier when rewards are sparse and delayed. GASIL can be easily combined with any policy gradient objective by using GASIL as a learned reward shaping function. Our experimental results show that GASIL improves the performance of proximal policy optimization on 2D Point Mass and MuJoCo environments with delayed reward and stochastic dynamics."}}

To investigate this question, we consider an instantiation of this hypothesis evaluated on the Arcade Learning Element (ALE). In this study, we develop an attentive dynamics model (ADM) that discovers controllable elements of the observations, which are often associated with the location of the character in Atari games. The ADM is trained in a self-supervised fashion to predict the actions taken by the agent. The learned contingency information is used as a part of the state representation for exploration purposes. We demonstrate that combining actor-critic algorithm with count-based exploration using our representation achieves impressive results on a set of notoriously challenging Atari games due to sparse rewards. For example, we report a state-of-the-art score of >11,000 points on Montezuma's Revenge without using expert demonstrations, explicit high-level information (e.g., RAM states), or supervisory data. Our experiments confirm that contingency-awareness is indeed an extremely powerful concept for tackling exploration problems in reinforcement learning and opens up interesting research questions for further investigations."}}

This paper addresses the problem of learning object structures in an image modeling process without supervision. We propose an autoencoding formulation to discover landmarks as explicit structural representations. The encoding module outputs landmark coordinates, whose validity is ensured by constraints that reflect the necessary properties for landmarks. The decoding module takes the landmarks as a part of the learnable input representations in an end-to-end differentiable framework. Our discovered landmarks are semantically meaningful and more predictive of manually annotated landmarks than those discovered by previous methods. The coordinates of our landmarks are also complementary features to pretrained deep-neuralnetwork representations in recognizing visual attributes. In addition, the proposed method naturally creates an unsupervised, perceptible interface to manipulate object shapes and decode images with controllable structures."}}
