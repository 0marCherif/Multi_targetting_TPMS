While the optimization of stochastic black boxes is classic in (robust) Bayesian optimization, the current approaches based on Gaussian processes predominantly focus either on (i) maximization/minimization rather than target value optimization or (ii) on the expectation, but not the variance of the output, ignoring output variations due to stochasticity in uncontrollable environmental variables. In this work, we fill this gap and derive acquisition functions for common criteria such as the expected improvement, the probability of improvement, and the lower confidence bound, assuming that aleatoric effects are Gaussian with known variance. Our experiments illustrate that this setting is compatible with certain extensions of Gaussian processes, and show that the thus derived acquisition functions can outperform classical Bayesian optimization even if the latter assumptions are violated. An industrial use case in billet forging is presented."}}

Convergence problems frequently occur when simulating dynamical systems with high-frequency components, chaotic or turbulent behavior. In this work, we discuss whether the traditional PINN framework is able to predict chaotic motion by conducting experiments on the undamped double pendulum. Our results demonstrate that PINNs do not exhibit any sensitivity to perturbations in the initial condition. Instead, the PINN optimization consistently converges to physically correct solutions that violate the initial condition only marginally, but diverge significantly from the desired solution due to the chaotic nature of the system. In fact, the PINN predictions primarily exhibit low-frequency components with a smaller magnitude of higher-order derivatives, which favors lower physics loss values compared to the desired solution. We thus hypothesize that the PINNs \"cheat\" by shifting the initial conditions to values that correspond to physically correct solutions that are easier to learn. Initial experiments suggest that domain decomposition combined with an appropriate loss weighting scheme mitigates this effect and allows convergence to the desired solution."}}

In particular, the information plane analysis, which measures mutual information (MI) between input and representation as well as representation and output, should give rich insights into the training process. This approach, however, was shown to strongly depend on the choice of estimator of the MI. The problem is amplified for deterministic networks if the MI between input and representation is infinite. Thus, the estimated values are defined by the different approaches for estimation, but do not adequately represent the training process from an information-theoretic perspective. In this work, we show that dropout with continuously distributed noise ensures that MI is finite. We demonstrate in a range of experiments that this enables a meaningful information plane analysis for a class of dropout neural networks that is widely used in practice."}}

In settings with little labeled training data, their optimization relies on the complexity of the embedded physics loss function. Two fundamental questions arise in any discussion of frequently reported convergence issues in PINNs: Why does the optimization often converge to solutions that lack physical behavior? And why do reduced domain methods improve convergence behavior in PINNs? We answer these questions by studying the physics loss function in the vicinity of fixed points of dynamical systems. Experiments on a simple dynamical system demonstrate that physics loss residuals are trivially minimized in the vicinity of fixed points. As a result we observe that solutions corresponding to nonphysical system dynamics can be dominant in the physics loss landscape and optimization. We find that reducing the computational domain lowers the optimization complexity and chance of getting trapped with nonphysical solutions."}}

The model architecture was based on considerations regarding the expected frequency characteristics of knocking combustion. To aid the feature extraction, all cycles were reduced to 60{\\deg} CA long windows, with no further processing applied to the pressure traces. The neural networks were trained exclusively on in-cylinder pressure traces from multiple conditions and labels provided by human experts. The best-performing model architecture achieves an accuracy of above 92% on all test sets in a tenfold cross-validation when distinguishing between knocking and non-knocking cycles. In a multi-class problem where each cycle was labeled by the number of experts who rated it as knocking, 78% of cycles were labeled perfectly, while 90% of cycles were classified at most one class from ground truth. They thus considerably outperform the broadly applied MAPO (Maximum Amplitude of Pressure Oscillation) detection method, as well as other references reconstructed from previous works. Our analysis indicates that the neural network learned physically meaningful features connected to engine-characteristic resonance frequencies, thus verifying the intended theory-guided data science approach. Deeper performance investigation further shows remarkable generalization ability to unseen operating points. In addition, the model proved to classify knocking cycles in unseen engines with increased accuracy of 89% after adapting to their features via training on a small number of exclusively non-knocking cycles. The algorithm takes below 1 ms (on CPU) to classify individual cycles, effectively making it suitable for real-time engine control."}}

We achieve this connection by considering every data point in the dataset as an element of the Markov chain's state space, by defining the transition probabilities between states via similarities between corresponding data points, and by incorporating semi-supervision information as hard constraints in a Hartigan-style algorithm. The introduced Constrained Markov Clustering (CoMaC) is an extension of a recent information-theoretic framework for (unsupervised) Markov aggregation to the semi-supervised case. Instantiating CoMaC for certain parameter settings further generalizes two previous information-theoretic objectives for unsupervised clustering. Our results indicate that CoMaC is competitive with the state-of-the-art."}}

Despite their success in solving problems that are governed by partial differential equations, physics-informed neural networks are often difficult to train. Frequently reported convergence issues are still poorly understood and complicate the inference of correct system dynamics. In this paper, we shed light on the training process of physics-informed neural networks. By trading between data- and physics-based constraints in the network training, we study the Pareto front in multi-objective optimization problems. We use the diffusion equation and Navier-Stokes equations in various test environments to analyze the effects of system parameters on the shape of the Pareto front. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of state-of-the-art adaptive activation functions and adaptive loss weighting methods. Our results demonstrate the prominent role of system parameters in the multi-objective optimization and contribute to understanding convergence properties of physics-informed neural networks."}}

We choose a mixture of Gaussians as a target distribution in latent space, which provides a natural splitting of data into clusters. To connect Gaussian components with correct classes, we use a small amount of labeled data and a Gaussian classifier induced by the target distribution. SeGMA is optimized efficiently due to the use of the Cramer-Wold distance as a maximum mean discrepancy penalty, which yields a closed-form expression for a mixture of spherical Gaussian components and, thus, obviates the need of sampling. While SeGMA preserves all properties of its semi-supervised predecessors and achieves at least as good generative performance on standard benchmark data sets, it presents additional features: 1) interpolation between any pair of points in the latent space produces realistically looking samples; 2) combining the interpolation property with disentangling of class and style information, SeGMA is able to perform continuous style transfer from one class to another; and 3) it is possible to change the intensity of class characteristics in a data point by moving the latent representation of the data point away from specific Gaussian components."}}
