To provide accurate and efficient real-time tracking, a tracking target's future movements need to be predicted. Particularly, the destination camera and travel time of the target object are to be identified so that tracking duties can be handover-ed seamlessly. In this paper, we propose a collaborative cross-camera tracking system, called PreActo, with two key features: (1) ResNet-based trajectory learning to exploit the rich spatio-temporal information embedded within objects' moving patterns, which has not been utilized by the existing literature, and (2) collaboration between the edge server and the edge device for real-time trajectory prediction and tracking handover. To prove the validity of our proposed system, we evaluate PreActo on a video dataset leveraging real-world trajectories. Evaluation results show that the proposed system reduces up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$7\\times$</tex> the number of processed frames for handover, with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2\\times$</tex> lower latency while providing <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.5\\times$</tex> tracking precision improvement compared to the state-of-the-art."}}

Amongst them, HPA helps provide seamless service by dynamically scaling up and down the number of resource units, called pods, without having to restart the whole system. Kubernetes monitors default Resource Metrics including CPU and memory usage of host machines and their pods. On the other hand, Custom Metrics, provided by external software such as Prometheus, are customizable to monitor a wide collection of metrics. In this paper, we investigate HPA through diverse experiments to provide critical knowledge on its operational behaviors. We also discuss the essential difference between Kubernetes Resource Metrics (KRM) and Prometheus Custom Metrics (PCM) and how they affect HPA\u2019s performance. Lastly, we provide deeper insights and lessons on how to optimize the performance of HPA for researchers, developers, and system administrators working with Kubernetes in the future."}}

However, to produce a TDMA schedule is not an easy task. During the scheduling, there can be a large number of conflicts due to the nature of radio access, which leads to a waste of operating time and energy. In this paper, we first present and discuss the concept of Topological Ordering, which is based mainly on the local neighborhood size. It is aimed to create an order of scheduling that helps reduce the competition and conflicts. Next, we propose a fast and effective distributed scheduling algorithm using Topological Ordering, called DSTO, to create a collision-free TDMA schedule. This algorithm is promising in terms of reducing running time and message collisions during the scheduling phase, which in turn reduces overall message overhead. At the same time, efficient time slot allocation, which translates to a shorter frame, is guaranteed. We implement DSTO together with two other distributed scheduling algorithms on OPNET Network Modeler and thoroughly analyze the comparative results to prove its validity and effectiveness."}}

In this paper, we propose DSTO, a distributed TDMA scheduling algorithm using Topological Ordering (TO). DSTO aims to reduce conflict of scheduling time among neighbor nodes by creating a Topological Order with local neighborhood size as the main priority factor. We implemented DSTO on OPNET Network Simulator and proved its effectiveness compared to DRAND in terms of running time and message overheads."}}
