Each task induces a random completion time, and a reward is obtained only after the task is completed. The statistics of the completion time and the reward distributions of all task types are unknown to the controller. The controller needs to learn to schedule tasks to maximize the accumulated reward within a given time horizon T . Motivated by the practical scenarios, we require the designed policy to satisfy a system throughput constraint. In addition, we introduce the interruption mechanism to terminate ongoing tasks that last longer than certain deadlines. To address this scheduling problem, we model it as an online learning problem with deadline and throughput constraints. Then, we characterize the optimal offline policy and develop efficient online learning algorithms based on the Lyapunov method. We prove that our online learning algorithm achieves an $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret and zero constraint violations. We also conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of our developed learning algorithms."}}

For the transacting parties who are not directly connected, PCN allows them to route the transaction through some intermediate nodes with sufficient balance. Designing an efficient routing protocol is one of the most important and challenging problems in improving the performance of PCN. To tackle this challenge, we propose Real-Time Recursive Routing (RTRR), an efficient routing algorithm that can achieve a short routing time with strong privacy protection and high flexibility in the dynamic scenario. In addition, we investigate the bidding process in RTRR and derive the equilibrium strategy, which implies that the proposed protocol prefers to route the transaction through the nodes with a higher success rate, contributing to a better performance. Both the theoretical analyses and the empirical experiment results demonstrate the high efficiency of RTRR."}}

The gacha game has been enthusiastically embraced in numerous online video games and has a wide range of potential applications.In this work, we model the complex interaction between the seller and the buyer as a Stackelberg game, where the sequential decision of the buyer is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We define the whale property in the context of gacha games. Then, we show that this is the necessary condition to achieve optimal revenue. Moreover, we provide the revenue-optimal gacha game design and show that it is equivalent to the single-item single-bidder Myerson auction.We further explore two popular multi-item gacha games, namely, the sequential multi-item gacha game and the banner-based multi-item gacha game. We also discuss the subsidies in the gacha game and demonstrate how subsidies may encourage the buyer to engage in grinding behavior. Finally, we provide a case study on blockchain systems as gacha games."}}

In the special case of fairness constraints, we further provide a sharper constant regret bound for UCB-LP. Our regret bounds outperform the existing literature on BwK and bandits with fairness constraints simultaneously. We also develop another low-complexity version of UCB-LP and show that it yields $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ problem-independent regret and zero constraint violations with high-probability.

In addition, there is little systematic research on these projects. In this paper, we delineate play-to-earn projects in terms of economic & governance models and implementation and analyze how blockchain technology can benefit these projects by providing system robustness, transparency, composability, and decentralized governance. We begin by identifying the participants and characterizing the tokens, which are products of composability. We then summarize the roadmap and governance model to exposit there is a transition from centralized governance to decentralized governance. We also classify the implementation of the play-to-earn projects with different extents of robustness and transparency. Finally, we discuss the security & societal challenges for future research in terms of possible attacks, the economics of tokens, and governance."}}

This reduces the incentives for the miners\u2019 participation and may jeopardize the blockchain security. To mitigate this blockchain insufficient fee issue, we propose a Fee and Waiting Tax (FWT) mechanism, which explicitly considers the two types of negative externalities in the system. Specifically, we model the interactions between the protocol designer, users, and miners as a three-stage Stackelberg game. By characterizing the equilibrium of the game, we find that miners neglecting the negative externality in transaction selection cause they are willing to accept insufficient-fee transactions. This leads to the insufficient storage fee issue in the existing protocol (i.e., deployed in Bitcoin and Ethereum). Moreover, our proposed optimal FWT mechanism can motivate users to pay sufficient transaction fees to cover the storage costs and achieve the unconstrained social optimum. Numerical results show that the optimal FWT mechanism guarantees sufficient transaction fees and achieves an average social welfare improvement of 51.43% or more over the existing protocol. Furthermore, the optimal FWT mechanism reduces the average waiting time of low-fee transactions and all transactions by 68.49% and 61.56%, respectively."}}

CrowdMine solves user-proposed computing tasks and utilizes the computation committed to the task solving process to secure decentralized on-chain storage. With our designed ``Proof of Crowdsourcing Work'' (PoCW) protocol, our system provides an efficient paradigm for computation and storage in a trustless and decentralized environment. We further show that the system can defend against potential attacks on blockchain, including the short-term 51\\% attack, the problem-constructing attack, and the solution-stealing attack. We also implement the system with 40 distributed nodes to demonstrate its performance and robustness.

We adopt the universal dynamic regret as the performance metric, and consider the case when loss functions are unknown when making decisions. Previous results rely on the assumptions on loss function, e.g., linearity and smoothness, or prior knowledge of regularity measures, e.g., path length of the comparator sequence. In this paper, we propose an algorithm IOMD-SOCO that applies to general convex loss function, and show that the algorithm achieves an order-optimal universal dynamic regret bound. We also propose its parameter-free versions, i.e., without requiring the prior knowledge of path length of the comparator sequence, and achieve the same-order regret bound. We are the first to provide dynamic regret bounds for SOCO with general convex loss functions via parameter-free algorithm. Our numerical experiments show that IOMD-SOCO indeed achieves a substantial performance improvement."}}

Such a storage sustainability issue is partially due to miners\u2019 heterogeneous storage costs and users\u2019 low-intensity fee competition. Motivated by these two observations, we propose a Fee and Transaction Expiration Time (FTET) mechanism to alleviate this issue. Specifically, we model the blockchain operation as a three-stage game. In Stage I, the system designer proposes the storage sustainability mechanism. In Stage II, each user decides whether to propose transactions and the corresponding transaction fees. In Stage III, each miner decides which transactions to include in the block. Although the analysis of the heterogeneous miner interaction is technically challenging, we fully solve it in closed-form motivated by how miners select transactions in practice. The equilibrium analysis reveals that high-storage-cost miners admit transactions with fees above a time-increasing threshold. Under the optimal FTET mechanism, the blockchain system can achieve the storage sustainability without any social welfare loss, comparing with the maximum achievable social welfare without the storage sustainability constraint. Moreover, the optimal FTET mechanism achieves a higher social welfare than the fee mechanism in current practice by selectively rejecting some transactions suffering high delays. Finally, we implement a blockchain prototype to compare the performance of the optimal FTET mechanism with the mining round time adjustment (MRTA) mechanism. The optimal FTET mechanism achieves higher social welfare (94.5% on average) and better storage sustainability. We find that more pending transactions may lead to lower transaction fees."}}
