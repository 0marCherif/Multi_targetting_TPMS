While BO has been successfully applied to many scenarios, scaling BO algorithms to high-dimensional domains remains a challenge. Optimizing such functions by vanilla BO is extremely time-consuming. Alternative strategies for high-dimensional BO that are based on the idea of embedding the high-dimensional space to one with low dimensions are sensitive to the choice of the embedding dimension, which needs to be pre-specified. We develop a new computationally efficient high-dimensional BO method that leverages variable selection. We analyze the computational complexity of our algorithm and demonstrate its efficacy on several synthetic and real problems through empirical evaluations."}}

We develop a new computationally efficient high-dimensional BO method that exploits variable selection. Our method is able to automatically learn axis-aligned sub-spaces, i.e. spaces containing selected variables, without the demand of any pre-specified hyperparameters. We theoretically analyze the computational complexity of our algorithm and derive the regret bound. We empirically show the efficacy of our method on several synthetic and real problems."}}

Using protein three-dimensional structural information as the input, CavityPlus applies CAVITY to detect potential binding sites on the surface of a given protein structure and rank them based on ligandability and druggability scores. These potential binding sites can be further analysed using three submodules, CavPharmer, CorrSite, and CovCys. CavPharmer uses a receptor-based pharmacophore modelling program, Pocket, to automatically extract pharmacophore features within cavities. CorrSite identifies potential allosteric ligand-binding sites based on motion correlation analyses between cavities. CovCys automatically detects druggable cysteine residues, which is especially useful to identify novel binding sites for designing covalent allosteric ligands. Overall, CavityPlus provides an integrated platform for analysing comprehensive properties of protein binding cavities. Such analyses are useful for many aspects of drug design and discovery, including target selection and identification, virtual screening, de novo drug design, and allosteric and covalent-binding drug design.

The original version of PharmMapper includes more than 7000 target pharmacophores derived from complex crystal structures with corresponding protein target annotations. In this article, we present a new version of the PharmMapper web server, of which the backend pharmacophore database is six times larger than the earlier one, with a total of 23 236 proteins covering 16 159 druggable pharmacophore models and 51 431 ligandable pharmacophore models. The expanded target data cover 450 indications and 4800 molecular functions compared to 110 indications and 349 molecular functions in our last update. In addition, the new web server is united with the statistically meaningful ranking of the identified drug targets, which is achieved through the use of standard scores. It also features an improved user interface. The proposed web server is freely available at http://lilab.ecust.edu.cn/pharmmapper/."}}
