However, these previous studies conduct experiments on the final classification output of the network, and fail to robustly evaluate the bias contained (i) in the latent representations, and (ii) on a per-pixel level. In this paper, we design a series of experiments that overcome these issues. We do this with the goal of better understanding what type of shape information contained in the network is discriminative, where shape information is encoded, as well as when the network learns about object shape during training. We show that a network learns the majority of overall shape information at the first few epochs of training and that this information is largely encoded in the last few layers of a CNN. Finally, we show that the encoding of shape does not imply the encoding of localized per-pixel semantic information. The experimental results and findings provide a more accurate understanding of the behaviour of current CNNs, thus helping to inform future design choices."}}

Specifically, we demonstrate that positional information is encoded based on the ordering of the channel dimensions, while semantic information is largely not. Following this demonstration, we show the real world impact of these findings by applying them to two applications. First, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and loss function which improves the translation invariance of a CNN\u2019s output. Second, we propose a method to efficiently determine which channels in the latent representation are responsible for (i) encoding overall position information or (ii) region-specific positions. We first show that semantic segmentation has a significant reliance on the overall position channels to make predictions. We then show for the first time that it is possible to perform a \u2018region-specific\u2019 attack, and degrade a network\u2019s performance in a particular part of the input. We believe our findings and demonstrated applications will benefit research areas concerned with understanding the characteristics of CNNs.

An implication of this is that a filter may know what it is looking at, but not where it is positioned in the image. In this paper, we first test this hypothesis and reveal that a surprising degree of absolute position information is encoded in commonly used CNNs. We show that zero padding drives CNNs to encode position information in their internal representations, while a lack of padding precludes position encoding. This gives rise to deeper questions about the role of position information in CNNs: (i) What boundary heuristics enable optimal position encoding for downstream tasks?; (ii) Does position encoding affect the learning of semantic representations?; (iii) Does position encoding always improve performance? To provide answers, we perform the largest case study to date on the role that padding and border heuristics play in CNNs. We design novel tasks which allow us to quantify boundary effects as a function of the distance to the border. Numerous semantic objectives reveal the effect of the border on semantic representations. Finally, we demonstrate the implications of these findings on multiple real-world tasks to show that position information can both help or hurt performance."}}

Additionally, various studies have used image patches on background canvases (e.g., to accommodate that inputs to CNNs must be rectangular) without consideration that different backgrounds may contain varying levels of position information according to their color. These studies give rise to deeper questions about the role of boundary information in CNNs, that are explored in this paper: (i) What boundary heuristics (e.g., padding type, canvas color) enable optimal encoding of absolute position information for a particular downstream task?; (ii) Where in the latent representations do boundary effects destroy semantic and location information?; (iii) Does encoding position information affect the learning of semantic representations?; (iv) Does encoding position information always improve performance? To provide answers to these questions, we perform the largest case study to date on the role that padding and border heuristics play in CNNs. We first show that zero padding injects optimal position information into CNNs relative to other common padding types. We then design a series of novel tasks which allow us to accurately quantify boundary effects as a function of the distance to the border. A number of semantic objectives reveal the destructive effect of dealing with the border on semantic representations. Further, we demonstrate that the encoding of position information improves separability of learned semantic features. Finally, we demonstrate the implications of these findings on a number of real-world tasks to show that position information can act as a feature or a bug."}}

We first show that distribution-based metrics cannot measure saliency performance across datasets due to ambiguity in the choice of standard deviation, especially for Convolutional Neural Networks. Therefore, our proposed metric is AUC-based because ROC curves are relatively robust to the standard deviation problem. However, this requires sufficient unique values in the saliency prediction to compute AUC scores. Secondly, we propose a global smoothing function for the problem of few value degrees in predicted saliency output. Compared with random noise, our smoothing function can create unique values without losing the existing relative saliency relationship. Finally, we show our proposed AUC-based metric can generate a more directional negative set for evaluation, denoted as Farthest-Neighbor AUC (FN-AUC). Our experiments show FN-AUC can measure spatial biases, central and peripheral, more effectively than S-AUC without penalizing the fixation locations."}}
