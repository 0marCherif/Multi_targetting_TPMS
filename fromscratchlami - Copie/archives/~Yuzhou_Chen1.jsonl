However, such methods often tend to suffer from vulnerability to noise and limited generalization abilities, especially when semantics and structural properties of time series evolve over time. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet flexible and highly effective framework, i.e., Persistence-based Contrastive Learning with Graph Neural Recurrent Networks (PCL-GCRN). The key idea behind PCL-GCRN is the notion of topological invariance that we introduce to contrastive graph learning for multivariate spatio-temporal processes. PCL-GCRN allows us to simultaneously focus on multiple most important data shape characteristics at different granularities that play the key role in the learning performance. As a result, PCL-GCRN leads to richer data augmentation, improved performance, and enhanced robustness. Our extensive experiments on a broad range of real-world datasets, from spatio-temporal forecasting of traffic to monkeypox surveillance, suggest that PCL-GCRN yields competitive results both in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness, outperforming 19 competing approaches."}}

Current PH tools are limited to analyze the data by filtering with single parameter while in many applications, several relevant parameters are equally important to get a much finer information on the data. In this paper, we overcome this problem by introducing Effective Multidimensional Persistence (EMP) framework which enables to investigate the data by varying multiple scale parameters simultaneously. EMP framework provides a highly expressive summary of the data by integrating the multiple descriptor functions to the process successfully. EMP naturally adapts to many known single PH summaries and convert them into multidimensional summaries, for example, EMP Landscapes, EMP Silhouettes, EMP Images, and EMP Surfaces. These summaries deliver a multidimensional fingerprint of the data as matrices and arrays which are suitable for various machine learning models. \nWe apply EMP framework in graph classification tasks and observe that EMP boosts the performances of various single PH descriptors, and outperforms the most state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. We further derive theoretical guarantees of the proposed EMP summary and prove the stability properties."}}

Yet, such GNN models pre-dominantly capture only lower order interactions, that is, pairwise relations among nodes, and also largely ignore intrinsic time-conditioned information on the underlying topology of multivariate time series. To address these limitations, we propose a new time-aware GNN architecture which amplifies the power of the recently emerged simplicial neural networks with a time-conditioned topological knowledge representation in a form of zigzag persistence. That is, our new approach, Zigzag Filtration Curve based Supra-Hodge Convolution Networks (ZFC-SHCN) is built upon the two main components: (i) a new highly computationally efficient\nzigzag persistence curve which allows us to systematically encode time-conditioned topological information, and (ii) a new temporal multiplex graph representation module for learning higher-order network interactions. We discuss theoretical properties of the proposed time-conditioned topological knowledge representation and extensively validate the new time-aware ZFC-SHCN model \nin conjunction with time series forecasting on a broad range of synthetic and real-world datasets: traffic flows, COVID-19 biosurveillance, Ethereum blockchain, surface air temperature, wind energy, and vector autoregressions. Our experiments demonstrate that the ZFC-SHCN achieves the state-of-the-art performance with lower requirements on computational costs."}}

Most VS methods to date have focused on using canonical compound representations (e.g., SMILES strings, Morgan fingerprints) or generating alternative fingerprints of the compounds by training progressively more complex variational autoencoders (VAEs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). Although VAEs and GNNs led to significant improvements in VS performance, these methods suffer from reduced performance when scaling to large virtual compound datasets. The performance of these methods has shown only incremental improvements in the past few years. To address this problem, we developed a novel method using multiparameter persistence (MP) homology that produces topological fingerprints of the compounds as multidimensional vectors. Our primary contribution is framing the VS process as a new topology-based graph ranking problem by partitioning a compound into chemical substructures informed by the periodic properties of its atoms and extracting their persistent homology features at multiple resolution levels. We show that the margin loss fine-tuning of pretrained Triplet networks attains highly competitive results in differentiating between compounds in the embedding space and ranking their likelihood of becoming effective drug candidates. We further establish theoretical guarantees for the stability properties of our proposed MP signatures, and demonstrate that our models, enhanced by the MP signatures, outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets by a wide and highly statistically significant margin (e.g., 93\\% gain for Cleves-Jain and 54\\% gain for DUD-E Diverse dataset)."}}

However, most existing GNNs have inherently static architectures, and as a result, do not explicitly account for time dependencies of the encoded knowledge and are limited in their ability to simultaneously infer latent time-conditioned relations among entities. We postulate that such hidden time-conditioned properties may be captured by the tools of multipersistence, i.e, a emerging machinery in topological data analysis which allows us to quantify dynamics of the data shape along multiple geometric dimensions. \n We make the first step toward integrating the two rising research directions, that is, time-aware deep learning and multipersistence, and propose a new model, Time-Aware Multipersistence Spatio-Supra Graph Convolutional Network (TAMP-S2GCNets). We summarize inherent time-conditioned topological properties of the data as time-aware multipersistence Euler-Poincar\\'e surface and prove its stability. We then construct a supragraph convolution module which simultaneously accounts for the extracted intra- and inter- spatio-temporal dependencies in the data. Our extensive experiments on highway traffic flow, Ethereum token prices, and COVID-19 hospitalizations demonstrate that TAMP-S2GCNets outperforms the state-of-the-art tools in multivariate time series forecasting tasks."}}

However, GNNs tend to suffer from over-smoothing problems and are vulnerable to graph perturbations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topological neural framework of topological relational inference (TRI) which allows for integrating higher-order graph information to GNNs and for systematically learning a local graph structure. The key idea is to rewire the original graph by using the persistent homology of the small neighborhoods of the nodes and then to incorporate the extracted topological summaries as the side information into the local algorithm. As a result, the new framework enables us to harness both the conventional information on the graph structure and information on higher order topological properties of the graph. We derive theoretical properties on stability of the new local topological representation of the graph and discuss its implications on the graph algebraic connectivity. The experimental results on node classification tasks demonstrate that the new TRI-GNN outperforms all 14 state-of-the-art baselines on 6 out 7 graphs and exhibit higher robustness to perturbations, yielding up to 10\\% better performance under noisy scenarios."}}

Most currently available techniques are based on the idea of performing  a convolution operation in the spectral domain with a suitably chosen nonlinear trainable filter and then approximating the filter with finite order polynomials.
