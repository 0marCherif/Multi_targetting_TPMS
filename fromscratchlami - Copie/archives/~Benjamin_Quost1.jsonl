We propose to estimate energy consumption strategy from data via regression applied to trip recordings. Descriptors of the trip elements are obtained from both recordings and statistics provided by a GPS navigation system. Trips are then split into elementary units corresponding to an homogeneous driving context. For each trip element, the optimal energy consumption strategy is computed via (expensive) dynamic programming simulations. Here, data analysis is used so as to identify descriptors of this trip element that are relevant to predict the energy consumption. Then, a polynomial model is fit to the data so as to estimate, for each new trip element, the optimal energy consumption strategy from the expected driving condition, rather than using dynamic programming. Our approach distinguishes itself by the fact that road context, driver style, road slope and auxiliary electrical power are taken into account to estimate the energy consumption of a PHEV. The accuracy of the prediction process is evaluated over test data, and demonstrates the interest of our approach in predicting energy consumption."}}

It is then desirable to leverage the unlabeled data to improve the learning procedure. One way to do this is to have a model predict \u201cpseudolabels\u201d for the unlabeled data, so as to use them for learning. In self-learning, the pseudo-labels are provided by the very same model to which they are fed. As these pseudo-labels are by nature uncertain and only partially reliable, it is then natural to model this uncertainty and take it into account in the learning process, if only to robustify the self-learning procedure. This paper describes such an approach, where we use Venn-Abers Predictors to produce calibrated credal labels so as to quantify the pseudo-labeling uncertainty. These labels are then included in the learning process by optimizing an adapted loss. Experiments show that taking into account pseudo-label uncertainty both robustifies the self-learning procedure and allows it to converge faster in general."}}

Classically, the battery consumption is planned over a trip to minimize the expected fuel consumption. A cautious driver will save battery potential to cross restricted areas (with desired low or even zero fuel consumption) without the fuel engine. This paper proposes an approach to minimize energy consumption while controlling the risk of a PHEV falling short of battery potential when crossing a restricted area. We use a nonlinear Gaussian process, trained on real vehicle data, for predicting the vehicle consumption. We take into account prediction uncertainty by ensuring that the driver\u2019s highest power demand will be satisfied with a high probability. The interest of the approach is demonstrated by a simulated trip around Paris."}}

In this paper, we propose two cautious decision-making procedures, by aggregating trees providing probability intervals constructed via the imprecise Dirichlet model. The trees are aggregated in the belief functions framework, by maximizing the lower expected discounted utility, so as to achieve a good compromise between model accuracy and determinacy. They can be regarded as generalizations of the two classical aggregation strategies for tree ensembles, i.e., averaging and voting. The efficiency and performance of the proposed procedures are tested on random forests and illustrated on three UCI datasets."}}

Rankings are indeed present in many applications, including cognitive psychology, recommender systems, sports tournament or automated algorithm choices. Rankings are however prone to subjectivity (when provided by users) and to incompleteness (when a contestant is missing, or users only report partial preferences). Robust or cautious approaches may overcome such issues. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian robust approach for a commonly used parametric model, the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. This allows us to obtain interval-valued parameter estimates for the strength parameter of the Plackett-Luce model. We illustrate our method with both synthetic and real data to show the usefulness of skeptic inference."}}
