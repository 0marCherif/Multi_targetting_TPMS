Analyzing this ever-increasing data presents several challenges, including limited access to annotated data and a constantly changing environment. Recent advancements in self-supervised learning have been utilized as a pre-training step to enhance the performance of conventional supervised models to address the absence of labelled datasets. This research examines the impact of using a self-supervised representation learning model for time series classification tasks in which data is incrementally available. We proposed and evaluated a workflow in which a model learns to extract informative features using a corpus of unlabeled time series data and then conducts classification on labelled data using features extracted by the model. We analyzed the effect of varying the size, distribution, and source of the unlabeled data on the final classification performance across four public datasets, including various types of sensors in diverse applications."}}

We establish a system to monitor indoor human mobility with air quality and assess the interrelationship between these two types of time series data. More specifically, a sensor network was designed in indoor environments to observe air quality parameters continuously. Simultaneously, another sensing module detected participants' movements around the study areas. In this module, modern data analysis and machine learning techniques have been applied to reconstruct the trajectories of participants with relevant sensor information. Finally, a further study revealed the correlation between human indoor mobility patterns and indoor air quality parameters. Our experimental results demonstrate that human movements in different environments can significantly impact air quality during busy hours. With the results, we propose recommendations for future studies."}}

Various patient outcome prediction methods have been attempted to assist healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making. Existing methods focus on measuring the similarity between patients using deep neural networks to capture the hidden feature structures. However, the higher-order relationships are ignored, such as patient characteristics (e.g., diagnosis codes) and their causal effects on downstream clinical predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Hypergraph Convolutional Network that allows the representation of non-pairwise relationships among diagnosis codes in a hypergraph to capture the hidden feature structures so that fine-grained patient similarity can be calculated for personalized mortality risk prediction. Evaluation using a publicly available eICU Collaborative Research Database indicates that our method achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art models on mortality risk prediction. Moreover, the results of several case studies demonstrated the effectiveness of constructing graph networks in providing good transparency and robustness in decision-making."}}

However owing to external contexts, the dynamics at each sensor are unique. For example, the afternoon peaks at sensors near schools are more likely to occur earlier than those near residential areas. In this paper, we first analyze real-world traffic data to show that each sensor has a unique dynamic. Further analysis also shows that each pair of sensors also has a unique dynamic. Then, we explore how node embedding learns the unique dynamics at every sensor location. Next, we propose a novel module called Spatial Graph Transformers (SGT) where we use node embedding to leverage the self-attention mechanism to ensure that the information flow between two sensors is adaptive with respect to the unique dynamic of each pair. Finally, we present Graph Self-attention WaveNet (G-SWaN) to address the complex, non-linear spatiotemporal traffic dynamics. Through empirical experiments on four real-world, open datasets, we show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on both traffic speed and flow forecasting.

Rigorous testing on two public datasets highlights MAPLE's capability to decipher intricate patterns and comprehend user contexts. These robust results confirm MAPLE's versatility and resilience across various scenarios. While its primary design caters to app prediction, the outcomes also emphasize the broader applicability of LLMs in different domains.

However, the capabilities of previous deep forecasting models to generalize to new roads not seen in the training data (unseen roads) are rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce a novel setup called a spatio-temporal (ST) split to evaluate the models' capabilities to generalize to unseen roads. In this setup, the models are trained on data from a sample of roads, but tested on roads not seen in the training data. Moreover, we also present a novel framework called Spatial Contrastive Pre-Training (SCPT) where we introduce a spatial encoder module to extract latent features from unseen roads during inference time. This spatial encoder is pre-trained using contrastive learning. During inference, the spatial encoder only requires two days of traffic data on the new roads and does not require any re-training. We also show that the output from the spatial encoder can be used effectively to infer latent node embeddings on unseen roads during inference time. The SCPT framework also incorporates a new layer, named the spatially gated addition (SGA) layer, to effectively combine the latent features from the output of the spatial encoder to existing backbones. Additionally, since there is limited data on the unseen roads, we argue that it is better to decouple traffic signals to trivial-to-capture periodic signals and difficult-to-capture Markovian signals, and for the spatial encoder to only learn the Markovian signals. Finally, we empirically evaluated SCPT using the ST split setup on four real-world datasets. The results showed that adding SCPT to a backbone consistently improves forecasting performance on unseen roads. More importantly, the improvements are greater when forecasting further into the future. The codes are available on GitHub: https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/forecasting-on-new-roads ."}}

Spatio-temporal Analysis of Micro-mobility Services", "abstract": "Micro-mobility services (e.g., e-bikes, e-scooters) are increasingly popular among urban communities, being a flexible transport option that brings both opportunities and challenges. As a growing mode of transportation, insights gained from micro-mobility usage data are valuable in policy formulation and improving the quality of services. Existing research analyses patterns and features associated with usage distributions in different localities, and focuses on either temporal or spatial aspects. In this paper, we employ a combination of methods that analyse both spatial and temporal characteristics related to e-scooter trips in a more granular level, enabling observations at different time frames and local geographical zones that prior analysis wasn\u2019t able to do. The insights obtained from anonymised, restricted data on shared e-scooter rides show the applicability of the employed method on regulated, privacy preserving micro-mobility trip data. Our results showed population density is the topmost important feature, and it associates with e-scooter usage positively. Population owning motor vehicles is negatively associated with shared e-scooter trips, suggesting a reduction in e-scooter usage among motor vehicle owners. Furthermore, we found that the effect of humidity is more important than precipitation in predicting hourly e-scooter trip count. Buffer analysis showed, nearly 29% trips were stopped, and 27% trips were started on the footpath, revealing higher utilisation of footpaths for parking e-scooters in Melbourne."}}

Traffic forecasting is interesting because it is complex as the future speed of a road is dependent on a number of different factors. Therefore, to properly forecast traffic, we need a model that is capable of capturing all these different factors. A factor that is missing from the existing works is the node interactions factor. Existing works fail to capture the inter-node interactions because none are using the message-passing flavor of GNN, which is the one best suited to capture the node interactions This paper presents a plausible scenario in road traffic where node interactions are important and argued that the most appropriate GNN flavor to capture node interactions is message-passing. Results from real-world data show the superiority of the message-passing flavor for traffic forecasting. An additional experiment using synthetic data shows that the message-passing flavor can capture inter-node interaction better than other flavors."}}
