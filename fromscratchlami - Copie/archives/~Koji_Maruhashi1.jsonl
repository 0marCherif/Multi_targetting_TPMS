Designing and generating novel proteins can pave the way for many future synthetic biology applications, including drug discovery. However, it remains a challenging computational task due to the large modeling space of protein structures. In this study, we propose a latent diffusion model that can reduce the complexity of protein modeling while flexibly capturing the distribution of natural protein structures in a condensed latent space. Specifically, we propose an equivariant protein autoencoder that embeds proteins into a latent space and then uses an equivariant diffusion model to learn the distribution of the latent protein representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively generate novel protein backbone structures with high designability and efficiency."}}

To tackle this problem using machine learning methods, here we propose a novel and effective framework, known as GraphBP, to generate 3D molecules that bind to given proteins by placing atoms of specific types and locations to the given binding site one by one. In particular, at each step, we first employ a 3D graph neural network to obtain geometry-aware and chemically informative representations from the intermediate contextual information. Such context includes the given binding site and atoms placed in the previous steps. Second, to preserve the desirable equivariance property, we select a local reference atom according to the designed auxiliary classifiers and then construct a local spherical coordinate system. Finally, to place a new atom, we generate its atom type and relative location w.r.t. the constructed local coordinate system via a flow model. We also consider generating the variables of interest sequentially to capture the underlying dependencies among them. Experiments demonstrate that our GraphBP is effective to generate 3D molecules with binding ability to target protein binding sites.

We argue that the core challenge of data augmentations lies in designing data transformations that preserve labels. This is relatively straightforward for images, but much more challenging for graphs. In this work, we propose GraphAug, a novel automated data augmentation method aiming at computing label-invariant augmentations for graph classification. Instead of using uniform transformations as in existing studies, GraphAug uses an automated augmentation model to avoid compromising critical label-related information of the graph, thereby producing label-invariant augmentations at most times. To ensure label-invariance, we develop a training method based on reinforcement learning to maximize an estimated label-invariance probability. Experiments show that GraphAug outperforms previous graph augmentation methods on various graph classification tasks."}}

However, the advancements in modelling pose challenges in the model analysis process for understanding the complex effects of input factors, especially when it comes to offering concrete policies for improving system outcomes. In this work, we propose a revised micro-dynamic analysis method that adopts advanced artificial intelligence methods to enhance the model interpretation and to facilitate group-specific policy-making. It strengthens the explanation power of the conventional micro-dynamic analysis by eliminating ambiguity in the result interpretation and enabling a causal interpretation of a target phenomenon across subgroups. We applied our method to understand an agent-based model that evaluates the effects of a long-term care scheme on access to care. Our findings showed that the method can suggest policies for improving the equity of access more efficiently than the conventional scenario analysis."}}

In this paper, we start from linear structural equation models (SEMs) and investigate ways of learning causal structures from the inverse covariance matrix. The proposed method, called $\\mathcal{O}$-ICID (for {\\it Independence-preserving} Decomposition from Oracle Inverse Covariance matrix), is based on continuous optimization of a type of matrix decomposition that preserves the nonzero patterns of the inverse covariance matrix. We show that $\\mathcal{O}$-ICID provides an efficient way for identifying the true directed acyclic graph (DAG) under the knowledge of noise variances. With weaker prior information, the proposed method gives directed graph solutions that are useful for making more refined causal discovery. The proposed method enjoys a low complexity when the true DAG has bounded node degrees, as reflected by its time efficiency in experiments in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms."}}
