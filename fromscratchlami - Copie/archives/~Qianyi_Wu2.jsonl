Recent studies build direct mappings between driving signals and their predictions, leading to failure cases when synthesizing background textures and detailed local motions. In this paper, we propose the Video Portrait via Grid-based Codebook (VPGC) framework, which achieves efficient and high-fidelity portrait modeling. Our key insight is to query driving signals in a position-aware textural codebook with an explicit grid structure. The grid-based codebook stores delicate textural information locally according to our observations on video portraits, which can be learned efficiently and precisely. We subsequently design a Prior-Guided Driving Module to predict reliable features from the driving signals, which can be later decoded back to high-quality video portraits by querying the codebook. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our approach."}}

Recent studies normally find it challenging to handle rarely seen target poses due to the limitation of source data. This paper proposes the Video Portrait via Non-local Quantization Modeling (VPNQ) framework, which produces pose- and disturbance-robust reenactable video portraits. Our key insight is to learn position-invariant quantized local patch representations and build a mapping between simple driving signals and local textures with non-local spatial-temporal modeling. Specifically, instead of learning a universal quantized codebook, we identify that a personalized one can be trained to preserve desired position-invariant local details better. Then, a simple representation of projected landmarks can be used as sufficient driving signals to avoid 3D rendering. Following, we employ a carefully designed Spatio-Temporal Transformer to predict reasonable and temporally consistent quantized tokens from the driving signal. The predicted codes can be decoded back to robust and high-quality videos. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our approach."}}

Unlike traditional multi-view stereo approaches, the neural implicit surface-based methods leverage neural networks to represent 3D scenes as signed distance functions (SDFs). However, they tend to disregard the reconstruction of individual objects within the scene, which limits their performance and practical applications. To address this issue, previous work ObjectSDF introduced a nice framework of object-composition neural implicit surfaces, which utilizes 2D instance masks to supervise individual object SDFs. In this paper, we propose a new framework called ObjectSDF++ to overcome the limitations of ObjectSDF. First, in contrast to ObjectSDF whose performance is primarily restricted by its converted semantic field, the core component of our model is an occlusion-aware object opacity rendering formulation that directly volume-renders object opacity to be supervised with instance masks. Second, we design a novel regularization term for object distinction, which can effectively mitigate the issue that ObjectSDF may result in unexpected reconstruction in invisible regions due to the lack of constraint to prevent collisions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our novel framework not only produces superior object reconstruction results but also significantly improves the quality of scene reconstruction.

Existing studies only generate portraits in the 2D plane with fixed views, making the results less vivid. In this paper, we present Stereoscopic Simplified Sketch-to-Portrait (SSSP), which explores the possibility of creating Stereoscopic 3D-aware portraits from simple contour sketches by involving 3D generative models. Our key insight is to design sketch-aware constraints that can fully exploit the prior knowledge of a tri-plane-based 3D-aware generative model. Specifically, our designed region-aware volume rendering strategy and global consistency constraint further enhance detail correspondences during sketch encoding. Moreover, in order to facilitate the usage of layman users, we propose a Contour-to-Sketch module with vector quantized representations, so that easily drawn contours can directly guide the generation of 3D portraits. Extensive comparisons show that our method generates high-quality results that match the sketch. Our usability study verifies that our system is preferred by users."}}

The key to our approach lies in the explicitly modeled correspondence matching information, so as to provide the geometry prior to the prediction of NeRF color and density for volume rendering. The explicit correspondence matching is quantified with the cosine similarity between image features sampled at the 2D projections of a 3D point on different views, which is able to provide reliable cues about the surface geometry. Unlike previous methods where image features are extracted independently for each view, we consider modeling the cross-view interactions via Transformer cross-attention, which greatly improves the feature matching quality. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on different evaluation settings, with the experiments showing a strong correlation between our learned cosine feature similarity and volume density, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

However, most approaches focus on holistic scene representation yet ignore individual objects inside it, thus limiting potential downstream applications. In order to learn object-compositional representation, a few works incorporate the 2D semantic map as a cue in training to grasp the difference between objects. But they neglect the strong connections between object geometry and instance semantic information, which leads to inaccurate modeling of individual instance. This paper proposes a novel framework, ObjectSDF, to build an object-compositional neural implicit representation with high fidelity in 3D reconstruction and object representation. Observing the ambiguity of conventional volume rendering pipelines, we model the scene by combining the Signed Distance Functions (SDF) of individual object to exert explicit surface constraint. The key in distinguishing different instances is to revisit the strong association between an individual object's SDF and semantic label. Particularly, we convert the semantic information to a function of object SDF and develop a unified and compact representation for scene and objects. Experimental results show the superiority of ObjectSDF framework in representing both the holistic object-compositional scene and the individual instances.

In this study, we highlight the importance of interaction in a dual-space GAN for more controllable editing. We propose TransEditor, a novel Transformer-based framework to enhance such interaction.
