The instructions often contain descriptions of objects in the environment. To achieve accurate and efficient navigation, it is critical to build a map that accurately represents both spatial location and the semantic information of the environment objects. However, enabling a robot to build a map that well represents the environment is extremely challenging as the environment often involves diverse objects with various attributes. In this paper, we propose a multi-granularity map, which contains both object fine-grained details (\\eg, color, texture) and semantic classes, to represent objects more comprehensively. Moreover, we propose a weakly-supervised auxiliary task, which requires the agent to localize instruction-relevant objects on the map. Through this task, the agent not only learns to localize the instruction-relevant objects for navigation but also is encouraged to learn a better map representation that reveals object information. We then feed the learned map and instruction to a waypoint predictor to determine the next navigation goal. Experimental results show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 4.0% and 4.6% w.r.t. success rate both in seen and unseen environments, respectively on VLN-CE dataset.

This task, however, is extremely challenging due to 1) the highly complex spatial-temporal information in videos and 2) the lack of labeled data for training. Unlike representation learning for static images, it is difficult to construct a suitable self-supervised task to effectively model both motion and appearance features. More recently, several attempts have been made to learn video representation through video playback speed prediction. However, it is non-trivial to obtain precise speed labels for the videos. More critically, the learned models may tend to focus on motion patterns and thus may not learn appearance features well. In this paper, we observe that the relative playback speed is more consistent with motion patterns and thus provides more effective and stable supervision for representation learning. Therefore, we propose a new way to perceive the playback speed and exploit the relative speed between two video clips as labels. In this way, we are able to effectively perceive speed and learn better motion features. Moreover, to ensure the learning of appearance features, we further propose an appearance-focused task, where we enforce the model to perceive the appearance difference between two video clips. We show that jointly optimizing the two tasks consistently improves the performance on two downstream tasks (namely, action recognition and video retrieval) w.r.t the increasing pre-training epochs. Remarkably, for action recognition on the UCF101 dataset, we achieve 93.7% accuracy without the use of labeled data for pre-training, which outperforms the ImageNet supervised pre-trained model.

Most existing methods perform this task by first generating a set of proposals and then recognizing each independently. However, due to the complex structures and large content variations in action instances, recognizing them individually can be difficult. Fortunately, some proposals often share information regarding one specific action. Such information, which is ignored in existing methods, can be used to boost recognition performance. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism, called relation attention, to exploit informative relations among proposals based on their appearance or optical flow features. Specifically, we propose a relation attention module to enhance representation power by capturing useful information from other proposals. This module does not change the dimensions of the original input and output and does not rely on any specific proposal generation methods or feature extraction backbone networks. Experimental results show that the proposed relation attention mechanism improves performance significantly on both Thumos14 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets compared to existing architectures. For example, relying on Structured Segment Networks (SSN), the proposed relation attention module helps to increase the mAP from 41.4 to 43.7 on the Thumos14 dataset and outperforms the state-of-the-art results."}}

The key challenge in this task is that one training video might only contain a few annotated starting/ending frames that can be used as positive examples for model training. Most conventional approaches directly train a binary classifier using such imbalance data, thus achieving inferior results. The key idea of this paper is to use the distances between the frame within the ground truth and the starting (ending) frame as dense supervisions to improve the video grounding accuracy. Specifically, we design a novel dense regression network (DRN) to regress the distances from each frame to the starting (ending) frame of the video segment described by the query. We also propose a simple but effective IoU regression head module to explicitly consider the localization quality of the grounding results (i.e., the IoU between the predicted location and the ground truth). Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts on three datasets (i.e., Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions, and TACoS)."}}

However, the relations between proposals actually play an important role in action localization, since a meaningful action always consists of multiple proposals in a video. In this paper, we propose to exploit the proposal-proposal relations using GraphConvolutional Networks (GCNs). First, we construct an action proposal graph, where each proposal is represented as a node and their relations between two proposals as an edge. Here, we use two types of relations, one for capturing the context information for each proposal and the other one for characterizing the correlations between distinct actions. Then we apply the GCNs over the graph to model the relations among different proposals and learn powerful representations for the action classification and localization. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on THUMOS14(49.1% versus 42.8%). Moreover, augmentation experiments on ActivityNet also verify the efficacy of modeling action proposal relationships."}}

Inspired by the adversarial erasing strategy in weakly supervised semantic segmentation, we propose a novel iterative-winners-out network. Specifically, we make two technical contributions: we propose an iterative training strategy, namely, winners-out, to select the most discriminative action instances in each training iteration and remove them in the next training iteration. This iterative process alleviates the \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d phenomenon that existing approaches tend to choose the video segments that strongly correspond to the video label but neglects other less discriminative video segments. With this strategy, our network is able to localize not only the most discriminative instances but also the less discriminative ones. To better select the target action instances in winners-out, we devise a class-discriminative localization technique. By employing the attention mechanism and the information learned from data, our technique is able to identify the most discriminative action instances effectively. The two key components are integrated into an end-to-end network to localize actions without using the frame-level annotations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly supervised approaches on ActivityNet1.3 and improves mAP from 16.9% to 20.5% on THUMOS14. Notably, even with weak video-level supervision, our method attains comparable accuracy to those employing frame-level supervisions."}}
