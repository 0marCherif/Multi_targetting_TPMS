That is, our logics handle assertions All x y and AtLeast x y, where x and y are built up from basic terms by either unions or intersections. We present a sound, complete, and polynomial-time decidable proof system for these logics. An immediate consequence of our work is the completeness of the logic additionally permitting More x y. The logics considered here may be viewed as efficient fragments of two logics which appear in the literature: Boolean Algebra with Presburger Arithmetic and the Logic of Comparative Cardinality."}}

Here we consider a specific simple combinatorial game called notakto, in which players cover squares on a tic-tac-toe board until one of them loses by finishing a whole row, column, or diagonal. We introduce optimal strategies for this game played on small boards, but larger boards have proven difficult to analyze mathematically. We set out to use reinforcement learning to help give insight into optimal strategies for larger boards. Sur- prisingly, we found that, despite the simplicity of the game, AlphaGo Zero struggled to learn an optimal strategy, even though we know that they exist. We developed two ways to accelerate AlphaGo Zero\u2019s learning on this problem: one is a targeted sampling strategy that biases towards states that are likely to appear in competent play, and the other is to set the threshold for updating a model based on statistics in the training data. Both techniques make AlphaGo Zero converge faster on notakto, but they are specific to this game and still do not seem to find a near-optimal strategy. We conjecture that this difficulty may show some fundamental limitations of reinforcement learning on combinatorial games that need to be further investigated."}}

However, there is no published POGIL activity for introducing parallel and distributed computing concepts. Recent ABET curriculum recommendations include the introduction of parallel and distributed computing concepts in undergraduate Computer Science/Engineering programs. In this work, we plan a cross-university study of evaluating the impact of using POGIL to introduce parallel computing topics in Data Structures and Algorithms or similar courses in an undergraduate computer science curriculum. We designed a POGIL tool that includes an unplugged activity that helps demonstrate some fundamental concepts of parallel computing. This unplugged activity is then followed by a set of reflective questions regarding potential advantages and challenges of using parallel computing. %NEEDED? WE SAY IT LATER: The POGIL tool also contains code written in Java, C/C++, and C\\#. We plan to use PRE/POST surveys to collect data from undergraduate CS students from five universities located in different parts of the US with diverse student population. At the end of this work in progress, we will use the data to investigate how this POGIL activity helps students gain an understanding of parallel computing."}}

However, there is a relative lack of data directly comparing student outcomes when receiving computer-generated feedback and human-written feedback. This paper addresses this gap by splitting one 90-student class into two feedback groups and analyzing differences in the two cohorts' performance. The class is an intro to AI with programming HW assignments. One group of students received detailed computer-generated feedback on their programming assignments describing which parts of the algorithms' logic was missing; the other group additionally received human-written feedback describing how their programs' syntax relates to issues with their logic, and qualitative (style) recommendations for improving their code. Results on quizzes and exam questions suggest that human feedback helps students obtain a better conceptual understanding, but analyses found no difference between the groups' ability to collaborate on the final project. The course grade distribution revealed that students who received human-written feedback performed better overall; this effect was the most pronounced in the middle two quartiles of each group. These results suggest that feedback about the syntax-logic relation may be a primary mechanism by which human feedback improves student outcomes."}}

We furthermore provide an analogous characterization of the 9-cycles in the burnt pancake graph. Finally we present numerical evidence that polynomial formulae exist giving the number of signed permutations that require $k$ flips to be sorted, with $5\\leq k\\leq9$."}}

P n has been shown to have properties that makes it a useful network scheme for parallel processors. For example, it is ( n \u2212 1 ) -regular, vertex-transitive, and one can embed cycles in it of length \u2113 with 6 \u2264 \u2113 \u2264 n ! . The burnt pancake graph B P n , which is the Cayley graph of the group of signed permutations B n using prefix reversals as generators, has similar properties. Indeed, B P n is n -regular and vertex-transitive. In this paper, we show that B P n has every cycle of length \u2113 with 8 \u2264 \u2113 \u2264 2 n n ! . The proof given is a constructive one that utilizes the recursive structure of B P n . We also present a complete characterization of all the 8-cycles in B P n for n \u2265 2 , which are the smallest cycles embeddable in B P n , by presenting their canonical forms as products of the prefix reversal generators.

Active learning and collaborative learning have been used to increase student engagement, but incorporating them in smaller classes is a completely different experience from doing so in larger classes. We offer some tips and suggestions on how to incorporate these activities in larger classes including the utilization of undergraduate teaching assistants during lectures, and allowing students to work together on worksheets during lectures with the help of the teaching staff. Course questionnaires collected from five different sections that ran in the spring, summer, and fall of 2016 with around 60 to 70 students suggest that this approach has been well-received. Furthermore, the DFW rate (the proportion of students that received a D, F, or withdrew from the class) of these sections was lower than the DFW rate of other sections that shared the same evaluations (exams, homework assignments, and quizzes) and grading scheme to determine the final letter grade."}}
