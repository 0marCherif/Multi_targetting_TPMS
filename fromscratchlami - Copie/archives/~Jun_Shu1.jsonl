However, it is demonstrated that they can easily overfit to training set biases, such as label noise and class imbalance. Example reweighting algorithms are simple and effective solutions against this issue, but most of them require manually specifying the weighting functions as well as additional hyperparameters. Recently, a meta-learning-based method Meta-Weight-Net (MW-Net) has been proposed to automatically learn the weighting function parameterized by an MLP via additional unbiased metadata, which significantly improves the robustness of prior arts. The method, however, is proposed in a deterministic manner, and short of intrinsic statistical support. In this work, we propose a probabilistic formulation for MW-Net, probabilistic MW-Net (PMW-Net) in short, which treats the weighting function in a probabilistic way, and can include the original MW-Net as a special case. By this probabilistic formulation, additional randomness is introduced while the flexibility of the weighting function can be further controlled during learning. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed method improves the performance of the original MW-Net. Besides, the proposed PMW-Net can also be further extended to fully Bayesian models, to improve their robustness."}}

However, current hand-designed LR schedules need to manually pre-specify a fixed form, which limits their ability to adapt to practical non-convex optimization problems due to the significant diversification of training dynamics. Meanwhile, it always needs to search proper LR schedules from scratch for new tasks, which, however, are often largely different with task variations, like data modalities, network architectures, or training data capacities. To address this learning-rate-schedule setting issue, we propose to parameterize LR schedules with an explicit mapping formulation, called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MLR-SNet</i> . The learnable parameterized structure brings more flexibility for MLR-SNet to learn a proper LR schedule to comply with the training dynamics of DNN. Image and text classification benchmark experiments substantiate the capability of our method for achieving proper LR schedules. Moreover, the explicit parameterized structure makes the meta-learned LR schedules capable of being transferable and plug-and-play, which can be easily generalized to new heterogeneous tasks. We transfer our meta-learned MLR-SNet to query tasks like different training epochs, network architectures, data modalities, dataset sizes from the training ones, and achieve comparable or even better performance compared with hand-designed LR schedules specifically designed for the query tasks. The robustness of MLR-SNet is also substantiated when the training data are biased with corrupted noise. We further prove the convergence of the SGD algorithm equipped with LR schedule produced by our MLR-SNet, with the convergence rate comparable to the best-known ones of the algorithm for solving the problem.

Unlike existing few-shot learning methods, which consist of complex models or algorithms, our approach extends batch normalization, an essential part of current deep neural network training, whose potential has not been fully explored. In particular, a meta-module is introduced to learn to generate more powerful affine transformation parameters, known as \u03c3 and \u03b2, in the batch normalization layer adaptively so that the representation ability of batch normalization can be activated. The experimental results on miniImageNet demonstrate that Meta-BN Net not only outperforms the baseline methods at a large margin but also is competitive with recent state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods. We also conduct experiments on Fewshot-CIFAR100 and CUB datasets, and the results show that our approach is effective to boost the performance of weak baseline networks. We believe our findings can motivate to explore the undiscovered capacity of base components in a neural network as well as more efficient few-shot learning methods."}}

Current robust losses, however, inevitably involve hyperparameters to be tuned for different datasets with noisy labels, manually or heuristically through cross validation, which makes them fairly hard to be generally applied in practice. Existing robust loss methods usually assume that all training samples share common hyperparameters, which are independent of instances. This limits the ability of these methods on distinguishing individual noise properties of different samples, making them hardly adapt to different noise structures. To address above issues, we propose to assemble robust loss with instance-dependent hyperparameters to improve their noise-tolerance with theoretical guarantee. To achieve setting such instance-dependent hyperparameters for robust loss, we propose a meta-learning method capable of adaptively learning a hyperparameter prediction function, called Noise-Aware-Robust-Loss-Adjuster (NARL-Adjuster). Specifically, through mutual amelioration between hyperparameter prediction function and classifier parameters in our method, both of them can be simultaneously finely ameliorated and coordinated to attain solutions with good generalization capability. Four kinds of SOTA robust losses are attempted to be integrated with our algorithm, and experiments substantiate the general availability and effectiveness of the proposed method in both its noise tolerance and generalization performance. Meanwhile, the explicit parameterized structure makes the meta-learned prediction function capable of being readily transferrable and plug-and-play to unseen datasets with noisy labels. Specifically, we transfer our meta-learned NARL-Adjuster to unseen tasks, including several real noisy datasets, and achieve better performance compared with conventional hyperparameter tuning strategy."}}

Sample re-weighting methods are popularly used to alleviate this data bias issue. Most current methods, however, require to manually pre-specify the weighting schemes as well as their additional hyper-parameters relying on the characteristics of the investigated problem and training data. This makes them fairly hard to be generally applied in practical scenarios, due to their significant complexities and inter-class variations of data bias situations. To address this issue, we propose a meta-model capable of adaptively learning an explicit weighting scheme directly from data. Specifically, by seeing each training class as a separate learning task, our method aims to extract an explicit weighting function with sample loss and task/class feature as input, and sample weight as output, expecting to impose adaptively varying weighting schemes to different sample classes based on their own intrinsic bias characteristics. Synthetic and real data experiments substantiate the capability of our method on achieving proper weighting schemes in various data bias cases, like the class imbalance, feature-independent and dependent label noise scenarios, and more complicated bias scenarios beyond conventional cases. Besides, the task-transferability of the learned weighting scheme is also substantiated, by readily deploying the weighting function learned on relatively smaller-scale CIFAR-10 dataset on much larger-scale full WebVision dataset. A performance gain can be readily achieved compared with previous SOAT ones without additional hyper-parameter tuning and meta gradient descent step. The general availability of our method for multiple robust deep learning issues, including partial-label learning, semi-supervised learning and selective classification, has also been validated."}}

As building blocks of DNNs, batch normalization (BN) standardizes intermediate feature maps and has been widely validated to improve training stability and convergence. However, we claim that the direct use of standard BN in Class-IL models is harmful to both the representation learning and the classifier training, thus exacerbating catastrophic forgetting. In this paper we investigate the influence of BN on Class-IL models by illustrating such BN dilemma. We further propose BN Tricks to address the issue by training a better feature extractor while eliminating classification bias. Without inviting extra hyperparameters, we apply BN Tricks to three baseline rehearsal-based methods, ER, DER++ and iCaRL. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets of Seq-CIFAR-10, Seq-CIFAR-100 and Seq-Tiny-ImageNet, we show that BN Tricks can bring significant performance gains to all adopted baselines, revealing its potential generality along this line of research."}}

Contrary to conventional machine learning aiming to learn inherent prediction rules to predict labels for new query data, meta learning aims to learn the learning methodology for machine learning from observed tasks, so as to generalize to new query tasks by leveraging the meta-learned learning methodology. In this study, we interpret such learning methodology as learning an explicit hyperparameter prediction policy shared by all training tasks. Specifically, this policy is represented as a parameterized function called meta-learner, mapping from a training/test task to its suitable hyperparameter setting, extracted from a pre-specified function set called meta learning machine. Such setting guarantees that the meta-learned learning methodology is able to flexibly fit diverse query tasks, instead of only obtaining fixed hyperparameters by many current meta learning methods, with less adaptability to query task's variations. Such understanding of meta learning also makes it easily succeed from traditional learning theory for analyzing its generalization bounds with general losses/tasks/models. The theory naturally leads to some feasible controlling strategies for ameliorating the quality of the extracted meta-learner, verified to be able to finely ameliorate its generalization capability in some typical meta learning applications, including few-shot regression, few-shot classification and domain generalization."}}

Label correction strategy is commonly used to alleviate this issue by identifying suspected noisy labels and then correcting them. Current approaches to correcting corrupted labels usually need manually pre-defined label correction rules, which makes it hard to apply in practice due to the large variations of such manual strategies with respect to different problems. To address this issue, we propose a meta-learning model, aiming at attaining an automatic scheme which can estimate soft labels through meta-gradient descent step under the guidance of a small amount of noise-free meta data. By viewing the label correction procedure as a meta-process and using a meta-learner to automatically correct labels, our method can adaptively obtain rectified soft labels gradually in iteration according to current training problems. Besides, our method is model-agnostic and can be combined with any other existing classification models with ease to make it available to noisy label cases. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the superiority of our method in both synthetic and real-world problems with noisy labels compared with current state-of-the-art label correction strategies."}}

Existing approaches, e.g., re-sampling and re-weighting, commonly address this issue by rearranging the label distribution of training data to train the networks fitting well to the implicit balanced label distribution. However, most of them hinder the representative ability of learned features due to insufficient use of intra/inter-sample information of training data. To address this issue, we propose meta feature modulator (MFM), a meta-learning framework to model the difference between the long-tailed training data and the balanced meta data from the perspective of representation learning. Concretely, we employ learnable hyper-parameters (dubbed modulation parameters) to adaptively scale and shift the intermediate features of classification networks, and the modulation parameters are optimized together with the classification network parameters guided by a small amount of balanced meta data. We further design a modulator network to guide the generation of the modulation parameters, and such a meta-learner can be readily adapted to train the classification network on other long-tailed datasets. Extensive experiments on benchmark vision datasets substantiate the superiority of our approach on long-tailed recognition tasks beyond other state-of-the-art methods."}}
