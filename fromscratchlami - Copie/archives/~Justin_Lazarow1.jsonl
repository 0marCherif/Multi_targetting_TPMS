This sparse, vectorized boundary representation for objects, while attractive in many downstream computer vision tasks, quickly runs into issues of parity that need to be addressed: parity in supervision and parity in performance when compared to existing pixel-based methods. This is due in part to object instances being annotated with ground-truth in the form of polygonal boundaries or segmentation masks, yet being evaluated in a convenient manner using only segmentation masks. Our method, BoundaryFormer, is a Transformer based architecture that directly predicts polygons yet uses instance mask segmentations as the ground-truth supervision for computing the loss. We achieve this by developing an end-to-end differentiable model that solely relies on supervision within the mask space through differentiable rasterization. Boundary-Former matches or surpasses the Mask R-CNN method in terms of instance segmentation quality on both COCO and Cityscapes while exhibiting significantly better transferability across datasets."}}

Recent works require both complicated sampling-based strategies of pseudo-labeled data and distribution alignment of the pseudo-label distribution to accommodate this imbalance. We present a novel approach that relies only on a form of a distribution alignment but no sampling strategy where rather than aligning the pseudo-labels during inference, we move the distribution alignment component into the respective cross entropy loss computations for both the supervised and unsupervised losses. This alignment compensates for both imbalance in the data as well as the eventual distributional shift present during evaluation. Altogether, this provides a single, unified strategy that offers both significantly reduced training requirements and improved performance across both low and richly labeled regimes and over varying degrees of imbalance. In experiments, we validate the efficacy of our method on SSL variants of CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-127. On ImageNet-127, our method shows 1.6% accuracy improvement over the previous best method with 80% training time reduction."}}

Most complex scenes, natural or human-designed, can be expressed as a meaningful arrangement of simpler compositional graphical primitives. Generating a new layout or extending an existing layout re- quires understanding the relationships between these primitives. To do this, we propose LayoutTransformer, a novel framework that leverages self-attention to learn contextual relationships between layout elements and generate novel layouts in a given domain. Our framework allows us to generate a new layout either from an empty set or from an initial seed set of primitives, and can easily scale to support an arbitrary of primitives per layout. Furthermore, our analyses show that the model is able to automatically capture the semantic properties of the primitives. We propose simple improvements in both representation of layout primitives, as well as training methods to demonstrate competitive performance in very diverse data domains such as object bounding boxes in natural images (COCO bounding box), documents (PubLayNet), mobile applications (RICO dataset) as well as 3D shapes (Part-Net).

These devices are, however, extraordinarily resource-constrained in terms of CPU power (often Cortex M0-3 class CPUs), available memory (in few KB to MBytes), and energy. Under these constraints, we explore a novel approach to character recognition using local binary pattern networks, or LBPNet, that can learn and perform bit-wise operations in an end-to-end fashion. LBPNet has its advantage for characters whose features are composed of structured strokes and distinctive outlines. LBPNet uses local binary comparisons and random projections in place of conventional convolution (or approximation of convolution) operations, providing an important means to improve memory efficiency as well as inference speed. We evaluate LBPNet on a number of character recognition benchmark datasets as well as several object classification datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency."}}

A common approach involves the fusion of instance segmentation (for \"things\") and semantic segmentation (for \"stuff\") into a non-overlapping placement of segments, and resolves overlaps. However, instance ordering with detection confidence do not correlate well with natural occlusion relationship. To resolve this issue, we propose a branch that is tasked with modeling how two instance masks should overlap one another as a binary relation. Our method, named OCFusion, is lightweight but particularly effective in the instance fusion process. OCFusion is trained with the ground truth relation derived automatically from the existing dataset annotations. We obtain state-of-the-art results on COCO and show competitive results on the Cityscapes panoptic segmentation benchmark."}}

This generalizes the unpaired image-to-image problem from generating pairs to generating sequences. We extend cycle consistency to \\textit{loop consistency} and alleviate difficulties associated with learning in the resulting long chains of computation.
