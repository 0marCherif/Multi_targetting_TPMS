In this paper, we alleviate the interference of graph randomness and learn appropriate representations of nodes without label information. To this end, we propose USER, an unsupervised robust version of graph neural networks that is based on structural entropy. We analyze the property of intrinsic connectivity and define intrinsic connectivity graph. We also identify the rank of the adjacency matrix as a crucial factor in revealing a graph that provides the same embeddings as the intrinsic connectivity graph. We then introduce structural entropy in the objective function to capture such a graph. Extensive experiments conducted on clustering and link prediction tasks under random-noises and meta-attack over three datasets show USER outperforms benchmarks and is robust to heavier randomness."}}

Signed graph neural networks (SGNN) are powerful tools to analyze signed graphs. We address the vulnerability of SGNN to potential edge noise in the input graph. Our goal is to strengthen existing SGNN allowing them to withstand edge noises by extracting robust representations for signed graphs. First, we analyze the expressiveness of SGNN using an extended Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test and identify the limitations to SGNN over triangles that are unbalanced. Then, we design some structure-based regularizers to be used in conjunction with an SGNN that highlight intrinsic properties of a signed graph. The tools and insights above allow us to propose a novel framework, Robust Signed Graph Neural Network (RSGNN), which adopts a dual architecture that simultaneously denoises the graph while learning node representations. We validate the performance of our model empirically on four real-world signed graph datasets, i.e., Bitcoin_OTC, Bitcoin_Alpha, Epinion and Slashdot, RSGNN can clearly improve the robustness of popular SGNN models. When the signed graphs are affected by random noise, our method outperforms baselines by up to 9.35% Binary-F1 for link sign prediction. Our implementation is available in PyTorch1."}}
