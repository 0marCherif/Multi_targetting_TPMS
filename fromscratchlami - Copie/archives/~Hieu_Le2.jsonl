These proposals often do not perfectly contain the objects but overlap with them in many possible ways, exhibiting great variability induced by different object scales, object positions (w.r.t. the boxes), object parts, and backgrounds. Training a robust classifier against this variability requires abundant training data, which is not available in few-shot settings. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) based data generation model, which is capable of generating data with increased crop-related variability. The main idea is to transform the latent space such that latent codes with different norms represent different crop-related variations. This allows us to generate features with increased crop-related diversity via simply varying the latent norm. In particular, each latent code is rescaled such that its norm linearly correlates with the IoU score of the input crop w.r.t. the ground-truth box. Here the IoU score is a proxy that represents the crop-related variation. We train this VAE model on base classes conditioned on the semantic code of each class and then use the trained model to generate features for novel classes. Our experimental results show that our generated features consistently improve state-of-the-art few-shot object detection methods on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets."}}

Few-shot class representations are often biased due to data scarcity. To mitigate this issue, we propose to generate visual samples based on semantic embeddings using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) model. We train this CVAE model on base classes and use it to generate features for novel classes. More importantly, we guide this VAE to strictly generate representative samples by removing non-representative samples from the base training set when training the CVAE model. We show that this training scheme enhances the representativeness of the generated samples and therefore, improves the few-shot classification results. Experimental results show that our method improves three FSL baseline methods by substantial margins, achieving state-of-the-art few-shot classification performance on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets for both 1-shot and 5-shot settings.

However, ensuring both discriminability and diversity in the augmented samples is challenging. To address this, we propose a feature disentanglement framework that allows us to augment features with randomly sampled intra-class variations while preserving their class-discriminative features. Specifically, we disentangle a feature representation into two components: one represents the intra-class variance and the other encodes the class-discriminative information. We assume that the intra-class variance induced by variations in poses, backgrounds, or illumination conditions is shared across all classes and can be modelled via a common distribution. Then we sample features repeatedly from the learned intra-class variability distribution and add them to the class-discriminative features to get the augmented features. Such a data augmentation scheme ensures that the augmented features inherit crucial class-discriminative features while exhibiting large intra-class variance. Our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multiple challenging fine-grained few-shot image classification benchmarks.

We propose a shadow removal method that can be trained using only shadow and non-shadow patches cropped from the shadow images themselves. Our method is trained via an adversarial framework, following a physical model of shadow formation. Our central contribution is a set of physics-based constraints that enables this adversarial training. Our method achieves competitive shadow removal results compared to state-of-the-art methods that are trained with fully paired shadow and shadow-free images. The advantages of our training regime are even more pronounced in shadow removal for videos. Our method can be fine-tuned on a testing video with only the shadow masks generated by a pre-trained shadow detector and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on this challenging test. We illustrate the advantages of our method on our proposed video shadow removal dataset."}}

We then employ an inpainting network, I-Net, to further refine the results. We train and test our framework on the most challenging shadow removal dataset (ISTD). Our method improves the state-of-the-art in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) for the shadow area by 20\\%. Furthermore, this decomposition allows us to formulate a patch-based weakly-supervised shadow removal method. This model can be trained without any shadow-free images (that are cumbersome to acquire) and achieves competitive shadow removal results compared to state-of-the-art methods that are trained with fully paired shadow and shadow-free images.

To train our segmentation models, we take advantage of the Penguin Colony Dataset: a unique dataset with 2044 georeferenced cropped images from 193 Adelie penguin colonies in Antarctica. In the face of a scarcity of pixel-level annotation masks, we propose a weakly-supervised framework to effectively learn a segmentation model from weak labels. We use a classification network to filter out data unsuitable for the segmentation network. This segmentation network is trained with a specific loss function, based on the average activation, to effectively learn from the data with the weakly-annotated labels. Our experiments show that adding weakly-annotated training examples significantly improves segmentation performance, increasing the mean Intersection-over-Union from 42.3 to 60.0% on the Penguin Colony Dataset."}}

This is a challenging task because the object detector must be built without negative examples that can lead to more informative supervision signals. The main idea of our method is to cluster the feature space of a generically pre-trained CNN, to find a set of CNN features that are consistently and highly activated for an object category, which we call category-consistent CNN features. Then, we propagate their combined activation map using superpixel geodesic distances for co-localization. In our first set of experiments, we show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three related benchmarks: PASCAL 2007, PASCAL-2012, and the Object Discovery dataset. We also show that our method is able to detect and localize truly unseen categories, on six held-out ImageNet categories with accuracy that is significantly higher than previous state-of-the-art. Our intuitive approach achieves this success without any region proposals or object detectors, and can be based on a CNN that was pre-trained purely on image classification tasks without further fine-tuning."}}
