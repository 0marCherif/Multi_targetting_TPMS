Therefore, safeguarding face recognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing learning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding detection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer significant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies seek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the presentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these methods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth and infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity mobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when either modality is missing or of poor quality. In this paper, we devise an accurate and robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing system named M3FAS to overcome the issues above. The innovation of this work mainly lies in the following aspects: (1) To achieve robust PAD, our system combines visual and auditory modalities using three pervasively available sensors: camera, speaker, and microphone; (2) We design a novel two-branch neural network with three hierarchical feature aggregation modules to perform cross-modal feature fusion; (3). We propose a multi-head training strategy. The model outputs three predictions from the vision, acoustic, and fusion heads, enabling a more flexible PAD. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the accuracy, robustness, and flexibility of M3FAS under various challenging experimental settings."}}

Despite such success, in this paper, we find that its core learning strategy -- feature alignment -- could heavily hinder the model generalization. Inspired by the recent progress in neuron interpretability, we characterize this problem from a neuron activation view. Specifically, by treating feature elements as neuron activation states, we show that conventional alignment methods tend to deteriorate the diversity of learned invariant features, as they indiscriminately minimize all neuron activation differences. This instead ignores rich relations among neurons -- many of them often identify the same visual concepts though they emerge differently. With this finding, we present a simple yet effective approach, \\textit{Concept Contrast} (CoCo), which relaxes element-wise feature alignments by contrasting high-level concepts encoded in neurons. This approach is highly flexible and can be integrated into any contrastive method in DG. Through extensive experiments, we further demonstrate that our CoCo promotes the diversity of feature representations, and consistently improves model generalization capability over the DomainBed benchmark."}}

However, recent studies have pointed out that the highlighted image regions from the visual attention are often irrelevant to the given question and answer, leading to model confusion for correct visual reasoning. To tackle this problem, existing methods mostly resort to aligning the visual attention weights with human attentions. Nevertheless, gathering such human data is laborious and expensive, making it burdensome to adapt well-developed models across datasets. To address this issue, in this article, we devise a novel visual attention regularization approach, namely, AttReg, for better visual grounding in VQA. Specifically, AttReg first identifies the image regions that are essential for question answering yet unexpectedly ignored (i.e., assigned with low attention weights) by the backbone model. And then a mask-guided learning scheme is leveraged to regularize the visual attention to focus more on these ignored key regions. The proposed method is very flexible and model-agnostic, which can be integrated into most visual attention-based VQA models and require no human attention supervision. Extensive experiments over three benchmark datasets, i.e., VQA-CP v2, VQA-CP v1, and VQA v2, have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of AttReg. As a by-product, when incorporating AttReg into the strong baseline LMH, our approach can achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.00% with an absolute performance gain of 7.01% on the VQA-CP v2 benchmark dataset. In addition to the effectiveness validation, we recognize that the faithfulness of the visual attention in VQA has not been well explored in literature. In the light of this, we propose to empirically validate such property of visual attention and compare it with the prevalent gradient-based approaches."}}

Though significant it is, this paper discovers several leading factors impeding the advancement of current state-of-the-art methods. On the one hand, methods which exploit the explicit knowledge take the knowledge as a complement for the coarsely trained VQA model. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches often suffer from noise incorporation and error propagation. On the other hand, pertaining to the implicit knowledge, the multi-modal implicit knowledge for knowledge-based VQA still remains largely unexplored. This work presents a unified end-to-end retriever-reader framework towards knowledge-based VQA. In particular, we shed light on the multi-modal implicit knowledge from vision-language pre-training models to mine its potential in knowledge reasoning. As for the noise problem encountered by the retrieval operation on explicit knowledge, we design a novel scheme to create pseudo labels for effective knowledge supervision. This scheme is able to not only provide guidance for knowledge retrieval, but also drop these instances potentially error-prone towards question answering. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset. The experimental results reveal that our method outperforms existing baselines by a noticeable margin. Beyond the reported numbers, this paper further spawns several insights on knowledge utilization for future research with some empirical findings."}}

Although some progress has been achieved so far, several studies have pointed out that current VQA models are heavily affected by the language prior problem, which means they tend to answer questions based on the co-occurrence patterns of question keywords (e.g., how many) and answers (e.g., 2) instead of understanding images and questions. Existing methods attempt to solve this problem by either balancing the biased datasets or forcing models to better understand images. However, only marginal effects and even performance deterioration are observed for the first and second solution, respectively. In addition, another important issue is the lack of measurement to quantitatively measure the extent of the language prior effect, which severely hinders the advancement of related techniques. In this paper, we make contributions to solve the above problems from two perspectives. Firstly, we design a metric to quantitatively measure the language prior effect of VQA models. The proposed metric has been demonstrated to be effective in our empirical studies. Secondly, we propose a regularization method (i.e., score regularization module) to enhance current VQA models by alleviating the language prior problem as well as boosting the backbone model performance. The proposed score regularization module adopts a pair-wise learning strategy, which makes the VQA models answer the question based on the reasoning of the image (upon this question) instead of basing on question-answer patterns observed in the biased training set. The score regularization module is flexible to be integrated into various VQA models. We conducted extensive experiments over two popular VQA datasets (i.e., VQA 1.0 and VQA 2.0) and integrated the score regularization module into three state-of-the-art VQA models. Experimental results show that the score regularization module can not only effectively reduce the language prior problem of these VQA models but also consistently improve their question answering accuracy."}}
