Yet, in the speech community, the standard input of spoken LMs are 20ms-long discrete units (shorter than a phoneme). Taking inspiration from word-based LM, we introduce a Generative Spoken Language Model (GSLM) based on word-size continuous-valued audio tokens that can generate diverse and expressive language output. This is obtained by replacing lookup table for lexical types with a Lexical Embedding function, the cross entropy loss by a contrastive loss, and multinomial sampling by k-NN sampling. The resulting model is the first generative language model based on word-size continuous tokens. Its performance is on par with discrete unit GSLMs regarding generation quality and zero resource challenge metrics. Moreover, it is five times more memory efficient because of its larger units. In addition, the embeddings before and after the Lexical Embedder are phonetically and semantically interpretable."}}

We propose AudioGen, an auto-regressive generative model, operating on a learnt discrete audio representation, that generates audio samples conditioned on text inputs. The task of text-to-audio generation poses multiple challenges. Due to the way audio travels through a medium, differentiating ``objects'' can be a difficult task (e.g., separating multiple people simultaneously speaking). This is further complicated by real-world recording conditions (e.g., background noise, reverberation, etc.). Scarce text annotations impose another constraint, limiting the ability to scale models. Finally, modeling high fidelity audio requires one to operate over extremely long sequences. To alleviate the aforementioned challenges we propose an augmentation technique that mixes different audio samples, driving the model to internally learn to separate multiple sources. We curated 10 datasets containing different types of audio and text annotations to handle the scarcity of text-audio data points. For faster inference, we explore the use of multi-stream modeling, allowing the use of shorter sequences while maintaining a similar bitrate and perceptual quality. Finally, we apply classifier-free guidance to improve adherence to text. Comparing to the evaluated baselines, AudioGen outperforms over both objective and subjective metrics. We further conduct an ablation study to gauge the effects of pre-trained text and audio components."}}

However, their robustness capabilities have not been extensively investigated. This work focuses on self-supervised representations for spoken generative language models. First, we empirically demonstrate how current state-of-the-art speech representation models lack robustness to basic signal variations that do not alter the spoken information. To overcome this, we propose an effective and efficient method to learn robust self-supervised speech representation for generative spoken language modeling. The proposed approach is based on applying a set of signal transformations to the speech signal and optimizing the model using an iterative pseudo-labeling scheme. Our method significantly improves over the evaluated baselines when considering encoding metrics. We additionally evaluate our method on the speech-to-speech translation task. We consider Spanish-English and French-English conversions and empirically demonstrate the benefits of following the proposed approach."}}

However, to obtain bounds, current techniques use strict assumptions such as a uniformly bounded or a Lipschitz loss function. To avoid these assumptions, in this paper, we follow an alternative approach: we relax uniform bounds assumptions by using on-average bounded loss and on-average bounded gradient norm assumptions. Following this relaxation, we propose a new generalization bound that exploits the contractivity of the log-Sobolev inequalities. These inequalities add an additional loss-gradient norm term to the generalization bound, which is intuitively a surrogate of the model complexity. We apply the proposed bound on Bayesian deep nets and empirically analyze the effect of this new loss-gradient norm term on different neural architectures."}}

Our approach overcomes limitations of previous methods which make them dependent on clean in-domain target signals and thus, sensitive to any domain mismatch between train and test samples. RemixIT is based on a continuous self-training scheme in which a pre-trained teacher model on out-of-domain data infers estimated pseudo-target signals for in-domain mixtures. Then, by permuting the estimated clean and noise signals and remixing them together, we generate a new set of bootstrapped mixtures and corresponding pseudo-targets which are used to train the student network. Vice-versa, the teacher periodically refines its estimates using the updated parameters of the latest student models. Experimental results on multiple speech enhancement datasets and tasks not only show the superiority of our method over prior approaches but also showcase that RemixIT can be combined with any separation model as well as be applied towards any semi-supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation task. Our analysis, paired with empirical evidence, sheds light on the inside functioning of our self-training scheme wherein the student model keeps obtaining better performance while observing severely degraded pseudo-targets."}}

In many real-life settings, the discrete latent space consists of high-dimensional structures, and propagating gradients through the relevant structures often requires enumerating over an exponentially large latent space. Recently, various approaches were devised to propagate approximated gradients without enumerating over the space of possible structures. In this work, we use Natural Evolution Strategies (NES), a class of gradient-free black-box optimization algorithms, to learn discrete structured VAEs. The NES algorithms are computationally appealing as they estimate gradients with forward pass evaluations only, thus they do not require to propagate gradients through their discrete structures. We demonstrate empirically that optimizing discrete structured VAEs using NES is as effective as gradient-based approximations. Lastly, we prove NES converges for non-Lipschitz functions as appear in discrete structured VAEs."}}

We suggest adding independent pseudo quantization noise to model parameters during training to approximate the effect of a quantization operator. DiffQ is differentiable both with respect to the unquantized weights and the number of bits used. Given a single hyper-parameter balancing between the quantized model size and accuracy, DiffQ optimizes the number of bits used per individual weight or groups of weights, in end-to-end training. We experimentally verify that our method is competitive with STE based quantization techniques on several benchmarks and architectures for image classification, language modeling, and audio source separation. For instance, on the ImageNet dataset, DiffQ compresses a 12 layers transformer-based model by more than a factor of 8, (lower than 4 bits precision per weight on average), with a loss of 0.3% in model accuracy.

To enhance speech beyond the limitations of the original signal, we take a regeneration approach, in which we recreate the speech from its essence, including the semi-recognized speech, prosody features, and identity. We propose a wav-to-wav generative model for speech that can generate 24khz speech in a real-time manner and which utilizes a compact speech representation, composed of ASR and identity features, to achieve a higher level of intelligibility. Inspired by voice conversion methods, we train to augment the speech characteristics while preserving the identity of the source using an auxiliary identity network. Perceptual acoustic metrics and subjective tests show that the method obtains valuable improvements over recent baselines."}}

We investigate the soundness of the proposed approach using theoretical analysis and present statistical guarantees for the interactive test. Finally, we provide a cryptographic technique to automate fairness testing and certified inference with only black-box access to the model at hand while hiding the participants' sensitive data."}}
