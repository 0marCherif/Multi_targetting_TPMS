As models are being increasingly used, on devices, to automate tasks and power new applications, there have been concerns that such white-box access to its parameters, as opposed to the black-box setting which only provides query access to the model, increases the attack surface. Directly extending the shadow modelling technique from the black-box to the white-box setting has been shown, in general, not to perform better than black-box only attacks. A key reason is misalignment, a known characteristic of deep neural networks. We here present the first systematic analysis of the causes of misalignment in shadow models and show the use of a different weight initialisation to be the main cause of shadow model misalignment. Second, we extend several re-alignment techniques, previously developed in the model fusion literature, to the shadow modelling context, where the goal is to re-align the layers of a shadow model to those of the target model.We show re-alignment techniques to significantly reduce the measured misalignment between the target and shadow models. Finally, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of white-box membership inference attacks (MIA). Our analysis reveals that (1) MIAs suffer from misalignment between shadow models, but that (2) re-aligning the shadow models improves, sometimes significantly, MIA performance. On the CIFAR10 dataset with a false positive rate of 1\\%, white-box MIA using re-aligned shadow models improves the true positive rate by 4.5\\%.Taken together, our results highlight that on-device deployment increase the attack surface and that the newly available information can be used by an attacker."}}

Even though the server in FL does not have access to raw user data, the privacy of users may still be compromised through model parameters. To mitigate this and provide guaranteed level of privacy, user-level differentially private (DP) FL aggregation methods can be employed which are able to achieve accuracy approaching that of non-private training when there is a sufficient number of remote clients. In most practical distributed learning scenarios, the amount of labelled data each client has is usually limited, necessitating few-shot learning approaches. An effective approach to few-shot learning is transfer learning where the model employs a backbone pretrained on large public datasets and then fine-tunes it on a downstream dataset. A key advantage of transfer learning systems is that they can be made extremely parameter efficient by updating only a small subset of model parameters during fine-tuning.This advantage is extremely beneficial in the FL setting, as it helps minimize the communication cost spent on each client-server communication during training by transferring only those model parameters that need to be updated. To understand under which conditions DP FL few-shot transfer learning can be effective, we perform a set of experiments that reveals how the accuracy of DP FL image classification systems is affected as the model architecture, dataset, and subset of learnable parameters in the model varies. We evaluate on three FL datasets, establishing state-of-the-art performance on the challenging FLAIR federated learning benchmark."}}

These DP models are typically pretrained on large public datasets and then fine-tuned on downstream datasets that are (i) relatively large, and (ii) similar in distribution to the pretraining data. However, in many applications including personalization, it is crucial to perform well in the few-shot setting, as obtaining large amounts of labeled data may be problematic; and on images from a wide variety of domains for use in various specialist settings. To understand under which conditions few-shot DP can be effective, we perform an exhaustive set of experiments that reveals how the accuracy and vulnerability to attack of few-shot DP image classification models are affected as the number of shots per class, privacy level, model architecture, dataset, and subset of learnable parameters in the model vary. We show that to achieve DP accuracy on par with non-private models, the shots per class must be increased as the privacy level increases by as much as 32$\\times$ for CIFAR-100 at $\\epsilon=1$. We also find that few-shot non-private models are highly susceptible to membership inference attacks. DP provides clear mitigation against the attacks, but a small $\\epsilon$ is required to effectively prevent them."}}

As a downside, the federated setting makes the model vulnerable to various adversarial attacks in the presence of malicious clients. Specifically, an adversary can perform backdoor attacks to control model predictions via poisoning the training dataset with a trigger. In this work, we propose a mitigation for backdoor attacks in a federated learning setup. Our solution forces the model optimization trajectory to focus on the invariant directions that are generally useful for utility and avoid selecting directions that favor few and possibly malicious clients. Concretely, we consider the sign consistency of the pseudo-gradient (the client update) as an estimation of the invariance. Following this, our approach performs dimension-wise filtering to remove pseudo-gradient elements with low sign consistency. Then, a robust mean estimator eliminates outliers among the remaining dimensions. Our theoretical analysis further shows the necessity of the defense combination and illustrates how our proposed solution defends the federated learning model. Empirical results on three datasets with different modalities and varying number of clients show that our approach mitigates backdoor attacks with a negligible cost on the model utility.\n"}}

A common mechanism is to create differentially private synthetic data using generative models. Such data generation reflects certain statistical properties of the original data, but often has an unacceptable privacy vs. utility trade-off. Since natural data inherently exhibits causal structure, we propose incorporating \\emph{causal information} into the training process to favorably navigate the aforementioned trade-off. Under certain assumptions for linear gaussian models and a broader class of models, we theoretically prove that causally informed generative models provide better differential privacy guarantees than their non-causal counterparts. We evaluate our proposal using variational autoencoders, and demonstrate that the trade-off is mitigated through better utility for comparable privacy."}}

Prior work has shown that the efficacy of MI is not the same for every sample in the training dataset; they broadly attribute this behavior to various data properties such as distributional difference. However, systematically analyzing the reasons for such disparate behavior has received little attention. In this work, we investigate the cause for such a discrepancy, and observe that the reason is more subtle and fundamental. We first provide empirical insight that an MI adversary is very successful with those samples that are highly $\\textit{likely to be memorized}$, irrespective of whether the sample is from the same or a different distribution. Next, we provide a game-based formulation which lower-bounds the advantage of an adversary with the ability to determine if a sample is memorized or not, under certain assumptions made about the efficacy of the model on the memorized samples. Finally, based on our theoretical results, we present a practical instantiation of a highly effective MI attack on memorized samples."}}

Recently, leakage due to distribution inference (or property inference) attacks is gaining attention. In this attack, the  goal of an adversary is to infer distributional information about the training data. So far, research on distribution inference has focused on demonstrating successful attacks, with little attention given to identifying the potential causes of the leakage and to proposing mitigations. To bridge this gap, as our main contribution, we theoretically and empirically analyze the sources of information leakage that allows an adversary to perpetrate distribution inference attacks. We identify three sources of leakage: (1) memorizing specific information about the $\\mathbb{E}[Y|X]$ (expected label given the feature values) of interest to the adversary, (2) wrong inductive bias of the model, and (3) finiteness of the training data. Next, based on our analysis, we propose principled mitigation techniques against distribution inference attacks. Specifically, we demonstrate that causal learning techniques are more resilient to a particular type of distribution inference risk termed distributional membership inference than associative learning methods. And lastly, we present a formalization of distribution inference that allows for reasoning about more general adversaries than was previously possible."}}

Prior solutions primarily propose fine-tuning cryptographic methods to make them efficient for known fixed model architectures. The drawback with this line of approach is that the model itself is never designed to efficiently operate with existing cryptographic computations. We observe that the network architecture, internal functions, and parameters of a model, which are all chosen during training, significantly influence the computation and communication overhead of a cryptographic method, during inference.Thus, we propose SOTERIA \u2014 a training method to construct model architectures that are by-design efficient for private inference. We use neural architecture search algorithms with the dual objective of optimizing the accuracy of the model and the overhead of using cryptographic primitives for secure inference. Given the flexibility of modifying a model during training, we find accurate models that are also efficient for private computation. We select garbled circuits as our underlying cryptographic primitive, due to their expressiveness and efficiency. We empirically evaluate SOTERIA on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, to compare with the prior work on secure inference. Our results confirm that SOTERIA is indeed effective in balancing performance and accuracy."}}

Given the theoretical connection between generalization and privacy, we ask whether better OOD generalization leads to better privacy for machine learning models, where privacy is measured through robustness to membership inference (MI) attacks. In general, we find that the relationship does not hold. Through extensive evaluation on a synthetic dataset and image datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Chest X-rays, we show that a lower OOD generalization gap does not imply better robustness to MI attacks. Instead, privacy benefits are based on the extent to which a model captures the stable features. A model that captures stable features is more robust to MI attacks than models that exhibit better OOD generalization but do not learn stable features. Further, for the same provable differential privacy guarantees, a model that learns stable features provides higher utility as compared to others. Our results offer the first extensive empirical study connecting stable features and privacy, and also have a takeaway for the domain generalization community; MI attack can be used as a complementary metric to measure model quality."}}

Most existing attacks on Deep Neural Networks achieve this by supervised training of the copy using the victim's predictions. An emerging class of attacks exploit algebraic properties of DNNs to obtain high-fidelity copies using orders of magnitude fewer queries than the prior state-of-the-art. So far, such powerful attacks have been limited to networks with few hidden layers and ReLU activations.\n\nIn this paper we present algebraic attacks on large-scale natural language models in a grey-box setting, targeting models with a pre-trained (public) encoder followed by a single (private) classification layer. Our key observation is that a small set of arbitrary embedding vectors is likely to form a basis of the classification layer's input space, which a grey-box adversary can compute. We show how to use this information to solve an equation system that determines the classification layer from the corresponding probability outputs.\n\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of our attacks on different sizes of transformer models and downstream tasks. Our key findings are that (i) with frozen base layers, high-fidelity extraction is possible with a number of queries that is as small as twice the input dimension of the last layer. This is true even for queries that are entirely in-distribution, making extraction attacks indistinguishable from legitimate use; (ii) with fine-tuned base layers, the effectiveness of algebraic attacks decreases with the learning rate, showing that fine-tuning is not only beneficial for accuracy but also indispensable for model confidentiality."}}
