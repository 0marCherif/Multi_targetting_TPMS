Yet, its passive nature inevitably prevents it from being immune to unknown attackers. To achieve a proactive defense, we need a more fundamental understanding of adversarial examples, beyond the popular bounded threat model. In this paper, we provide a causal viewpoint of adversarial vulnerability: the cause is the spurious correlations ubiquitously existing in learning, i.e., the confounding effect, where attackers are precisely exploiting these effects. Therefore, a fundamental solution for adversarial robustness is by causal intervention. As visual confounders are imperceptible in general, we propose to use the instrumental variable that achieves causal intervention without the need for confounder observation. We term our robust training method as Causal intervention by instrumental Variable (CiiV). It's a causal regularization that 1) augments the image with multiple retinotopic centers and 2) encourages the model to learn causal features rather than local confounding patterns by favoring features linearly responding to spatial interpolations. Extensive experiments on a wide spectrum of attackers and settings applied in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and mini-ImageNet demonstrate that CiiV is robust to adaptive attacks, including the recent Auto-Attack. Besides, as a general causal regularization, it can be easily plugged into other methods to further boost their robustness. Codes are available in supplementary materials."}}

We propose a \u201cdivide&conquer\u201d strategy for the challenging LVIS task: divide the whole data into balanced parts and then apply incremental learning to conquer each one. This derives a novel learning paradigm: class-incremental few-shot learning, which is especially effective for the challenge evolving over time: 1) the class imbalance among the old class knowledge review and 2) the few-shot data in new-class learning. We call our approach Learning to Segment the Tail (LST). In particular, we design an instance-level balanced replay scheme, which is a memory-efficient approximation to balance the instance-level samples from the old-class images. We also propose to use a meta-module for new-class learning, where the module parameters are shared across incremental phases, gaining the learning-to-learn knowledge incrementally, from the data-rich head to the data-poor tail. We empirically show that: at the expense of a little sacrifice of head-class forgetting, we can gain a significant 8.3% AP improvement for the tail classes with less than 10 instances, achieving an overall 2.0% AP boost for the whole 1,230 classes."}}

Given such SGG, the down-stream tasks such as VQA can hardly infer better scene structures than merely a bag of objects. However, debiasing in SGG is not trivial because traditional debiasing methods cannot distinguish between the good and bad bias, e.g., good context prior (e.g., \"person read book\" rather than \"eat\") and bad long-tailed bias (e.g., \"near\" dominating \"behind / in front of\"). In this paper, we present a novel SGG framework based on causal inference but not the conventional likelihood. We first build a causal graph for SGG, and perform traditional biased training with the graph. Then, we propose to draw the counterfactual causality from the trained graph to infer the effect from the bad bias, which should be removed. In particular, we use Total Direct Effect (TDE) as the proposed final predicate score for unbiased SGG. Note that our framework is agnostic to any SGG model and thus can be widely applied in the community who seeks unbiased predictions. By using the proposed Scene Graph Diagnosis toolkit on the SGG benchmark Visual Genome and several prevailing models, we observed significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art methods."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel cause-effect look at the language bias, where the bias is formulated as the direct effect of question on answer from the view of causal inference. The effect can be captured by counterfactual VQA, where the image had not existed in an imagined scenario. Our proposed cause-effect look 1) is general to any baseline VQA architecture, 2) achieves significant improvement on the language-bias sensitive VQA-CP dataset, and 3) fills the theoretical gap in recent language prior based works."}}
{"id": "rXNoZQgOaS", "cdate": 1546300800000, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Auto-Encoding Scene Graphs for Image Captioning.", "abstract": "We propose Scene Graph Auto-Encoder (SGAE) that incorporates the language inductive bias into the encoder-decoder image captioning framework for more human-like captions. Intuitively, we humans use the inductive bias to compose collocations and contextual inference in discourse. For example, when we see the relation \"person on bike\", it is natural to replace \"on\" with \"ride\" and infer \"person riding bike on a road\" even the \"road\" is not evident. Therefore, exploiting such bias as a language prior is expected to help the conventional encoder-decoder models less likely to overfit to the dataset bias and focus on reasoning. Specifically, we use the scene graph --- a directed graph (G) where an object node is connected by adjective nodes and relationship nodes --- to represent the complex structural layout of both image (I) and sentence (S). In the textual domain, we use SGAE to learn a dictionary (D) that helps to reconstruct sentences in the S -> G -> D -> S pipeline, where D encodes the desired language prior; in the vision-language domain, we use the shared D to guide the encoder-decoder in the I -> G -> D -> S pipeline. Thanks to the scene graph representation and shared dictionary, the inductive bias is transferred across domains in principle. We validate the effectiveness of SGAE on the challenging MS-COCO image captioning benchmark, e.g., our SGAE-based single-model achieves a new state-of-the-art 127.8 CIDEr-D on the Karpathy split, and a competitive 125.5 CIDEr-D (c40) on the official server even compared to other ensemble models.

Our visual context tree model, dubbed VCTree, has two key advantages over existing structured object representations including chains and fully-connected graphs: 1) The efficient and expressive binary tree encodes the inherent parallel/hierarchical relationships among objects, e.g., \"clothes\" and \"pants\" are usually co-occur and belong to \"person\"; 2) the dynamic structure varies from image to image and task to task, allowing more content-/task-specific message passing among objects. To construct a VCTree, we design a score function that calculates the task-dependent validity between each object pair, and the tree is the binary version of the maximum spanning tree from the score matrix. Then, visual contexts are encoded by bidirectional TreeLSTM and decoded by task-specific models. We develop a hybrid learning procedure which integrates end-task supervised learning and the tree structure reinforcement learning, where the former's evaluation result serves as a self-critic for the latter's structure exploration. Experimental results on two benchmarks, which require reasoning over contexts: Visual Genome for scene graph generation and VQA2.0 for visual Q&A, show that VCTree outperforms state-of-the-art results while discovering interpretable visual context structures."}}
