In this paper, we propose GARNET, a scalable spectral method to boost the adversarial robustness of GNN models. GARNET first leverages weighted spectral embedding to construct a base graph, which is not only resistant to adversarial attacks but also contains critical (clean) graph structure for GNN training. Next, GARNET further refines the base graph by pruning additional uncritical edges based on probabilistic graphical model. GARNET has been evaluated on various datasets, including a large graph with millions of nodes. Our extensive experiment results show that GARNET achieves adversarial accuracy improvement and runtime speedup over state-of-the-art GNN (defense) models by up to $10.23\\%$ and $14.7\\times$, respectively."}}

In this paper, we propose GARNET, a scalable spectral method to boost the adversarial robustness of  GNN models for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. GARNET first computes a reduced-rank yet sparse approximation of the adversarial graph by exploiting an efficient spectral graph embedding and sparsification scheme. Next, GARNET trains an adaptive graph filter on the reduced-rank graph for node representation refinement, which is subsequently leveraged to guide label propagation for further enhancing the quality of node embeddings. GARNET has been evaluated on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets, including a large graph with millions of nodes. Our extensive experiment results show that GARNET increases adversarial accuracy over state-of-the-art GNN (defense) models by up to $9.96\\%$ and $15.17\\%$ on homophilic and heterophilic graphs, respectively."}}

Soft errors can corrupt program outputs leading to silent data corruption or a Crash. To protect computer systems against such failures, architects need to precisely and quickly identify vulnerable program instructions that need to be protected. Traditional techniques for program reliability estimation either use expensive and time-consuming fault injection or inaccurate analytical models to identify the program instructions that need to be protected against soft errors. In this work, we present GLAIVE, a graph learning-assisted model for fast, accurate, and transferable soft-error induced instruction vulnerability estimation. GLAIVE leverages a synergy between static analysis and data-driven statistical reasoning to automatically learn signatures of instruction-level vulnerabilities and their propagation to program outputs using a fine-grain error propagation information from the bit-level program graphs of a set of realistic benchmarks. Our experiments show that the learned knowledge of instruction vulnerability is transferable to unseen programs. We further show that GLAIVE can achieve an average 221\u00d7 speedup and up to 33.09 % lower program vulnerability estimation error as compared to a baseline fault-injection technique, up to 30.29 % higher vulnerability estimation accuracy, and on average can cover up to 90.23 % vulnerable instructions for a given protection budget compared to a set of baseline machine learning algorithms."}}

Thus, automatic constraint annotation from circuit netlists is a critical step to analog layout automation. In this work, we propose a graph learning based framework to learn the general rules for annotation of the symmetry constraints with path-based feature extraction and label filtering techniques. Experimental results on the open-source analog circuit designs demonstrate that our framework is able to achieve significantly higher accuracy compared with the most recent works on symmetry constraint detection leveraging graph similarity and signal flow analysis techniques. The framework is general and can be extended to other pairwise constraints as well."}}

Since hardened blocks can be configured in different ways, a variety of datapath patterns can be mapped into these blocks. We observe that existing high-level synthesis (HLS) tools often fail to capture some of the operation mapping patterns, leading to limited estimation accuracy in terms of resource usage and delay. To address this deficiency, we propose to exploit graph neural networks (GNN) to automatically learn operation mapping patterns. We apply GNN models that are trained on microbenchmarks directly to realistic designs through inductive learning. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively infer various valid mapping patterns on both microbenchmarks and realistic designs. Furthermore, the proposed framework is exploited to improve the accuracy of delay estimation in HLS."}}
