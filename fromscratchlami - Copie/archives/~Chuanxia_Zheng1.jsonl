Recent work on Vector Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (VQ-VAE) has made substantial progress in this direction. However, this quantizes latent representations using the online k-means algorithm which suffers from poor initialization and non-stationary clusters. To strengthen the clustering quality for the latent representations, we propose Vector Quantized Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (VQ-WAE) intuitively developed based on the clustering viewpoint of Wasserstein (WS) distance. Specifically, we endow a discrete distribution over the codewords and learn a deterministic decoder that transports the codeword distribution to the data distribution via minimizing a WS distance between them. We develop further theories to connect it with the clustering viewpoint of WS distance, allowing us to have a better and more controllable clustering solution. Finally, we empirically evaluate our method on several well-known benchmarks, where it achieves better qualitative and quantitative performances than the baselines in terms of the codebook utilization and image reconstruction/generation."}}

To address this issue, we propose to incorporate the spatially conditional normalization to modulate the quantized vectors so as to insert spatially variant information to the embedded index maps, encouraging the decoder to generate more photorealistic images. Moreover, we use multichannel quantization to increase the recombination capability of the discrete codes without increasing the cost of model and codebook. Additionally, to generate discrete tokens at the second stage, we adopt a Masked Generative Image Transformer (MaskGIT) to learn an underlying prior distribution in the compressed latent space, which is much faster than the conventional autoregressive model.

Separately, iGPT-based architecture has been employed to infer distributions in a discrete space derived from a pixel-level pre-clustered palette, which however cannot generate high-quality results directly. In this work, we present a novel framework for pluralistic image completion that can achieve both high quality and diversity at much faster inference speed. The core of our design lies in a simple yet effective code sharing mechanism that leads to a very compact yet expressive image representation in a discrete latent domain. The compactness and the richness of the representation further facilitate the subsequent deployment of a transformer to effectively learn how to composite and complete a masked image at the discrete code domain. Based on the global context well-captured by the transformer and the available visual regions, we are able to sample all tokens simultaneously, which is completely different from the prevailing autoregressive approach of iGPT-based works, and leads to more than 100$\\times$ faster inference speed. Experiments show that our framework is able to learn semantically-rich discrete codes efficiently and robustly, resulting in much better image reconstruction quality. Our diverse image completion framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art both quantitatively and qualitatively on multiple benchmark datasets."}}

However, most approaches focus on holistic scene representation yet ignore individual objects inside it, thus limiting potential downstream applications. In order to learn object-compositional representation, a few works incorporate the 2D semantic map as a cue in training to grasp the difference between objects. But they neglect the strong connections between object geometry and instance semantic information, which leads to inaccurate modeling of individual instance. This paper proposes a novel framework, ObjectSDF, to build an object-compositional neural implicit representation with high fidelity in 3D reconstruction and object representation. Observing the ambiguity of conventional volume rendering pipelines, we model the scene by combining the Signed Distance Functions (SDF) of individual object to exert explicit surface constraint. The key in distinguishing different instances is to revisit the strong association between an individual object\u2019s SDF and semantic label. Particularly, we convert the semantic information to a function of object SDF and develop a unified and compact representation for scene and objects. Experimental results show the superiority of ObjectSDF framework in representing both the holistic object-compositional scene and the individual instances.

Although existing approaches have brought impressive results, they mainly operated in 2D space. In light of recent advances in NeRF-based 3D-aware generative models, we introduce a new task, Semantic-to-NeRF translation, that aims to reconstruct a 3D scene modelled by NeRF, conditioned on one single-view semantic mask as input. To kick-off this novel task, we propose the Sem2NeRF framework. In particular, Sem2NeRF addresses the highly challenging task by encoding the semantic mask into the latent code that controls the 3D scene representation of a pre-trained decoder. To further improve the accuracy of the mapping, we integrate a new region-aware learning strategy into the design of both the encoder and the decoder. We verify the efficacy of the proposed Sem2NeRF and demonstrate that it outperforms several strong baselines on two benchmark datasets.

Previous methods attempting this via deep or large receptive field (RF) convolutions cannot escape from the dominance of nearby interactions, which may be inferior. In this paper, we propose to treat image completion as a directionless sequence-to-sequence prediction task, and deploy a transformer to directly capture long-range depen-dence. Crucially, we employ a restrictive CNN with small and non-overlapping RF for weighted token representation, which allows the transformer to explicitly model the long-range visible context relations with equal importance in all layers, without implicitly confounding neighboring tokens when larger RFs are used. To improve appearance consistency between visible and generated regions, a novel attention-aware layer (AAL) is introduced to better exploit distantly related high-frequency features. Overall, extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on several datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/lyndonzheng/TFill."}}
