PNKH-B is geared toward situations in which function and gradient evaluations are expensive, and the (approximate) Hessian is only available through matrix-vector products. This is commonly the case in large-scale parameter estimation, machine learning, and image processing. In each iteration, PNKH-B uses a low-rank approximation of the (approximate) Hessian to determine the search direction and construct the metric used in a projected line search. The key feature of the metric is its consistency with the low-rank approximation of the Hessian on the Krylov subspace. This renders PNKH-B similar to a projected variable metric method. We present an interior point method to solve the quadratic projection problem efficiently. Since the interior point method effectively exploits the low-rank structure, its computational cost only scales linearly with respect to the number of variables, and it only adds negligible computational time. We also experiment with variants of PNKH-B that incorporate estimates of the active set into the Hessian approximation. We prove the global convergence to a stationary point under standard assumptions. Using three numerical experiments motivated by parameter estimation, machine learning, and image reconstruction, we show that the consistent use of the Hessian metric in PNKH-B leads to fast convergence, particularly in the first few iterations.

The hallmark feature of the double descent phenomenon is a spike in the regularization gap at the interpolation threshold, i.e. when the number of features in the RFM equals the number of training samples. To close this gap, the hybrid method considered in our paper combines the respective strengths of the two most common forms of regularization: early stopping and weight decay. The scheme does not require hyperparameter tuning as it automatically selects the stopping iteration and weight decay hyperparameter by using generalized cross-validation (GCV). This also avoids the necessity of a dedicated validation set. While the benefits of hybrid methods have been well-documented for ill-posed inverse problems, our work presents the first use case in machine learning. To expose the need for regularization and motivate hybrid methods, we perform detailed numerical experiments inspired by image classification. In those examples, the hybrid scheme successfully avoids the double descent phenomenon and yields RFMs whose generalization is comparable with classical regularization approaches whose hyperparameters are tuned optimally using the test data. We provide our MATLAB codes for implementing the numerical experiments in this paper at https://github.com/EmoryMLIP/HybridRFM."}}

Pixel-wise classifiers, such as the classical support vector machine (SVM), consider spectral information only. As spatial information is not utilized, the classification results are not optimal and the classified image may appear noisy. Many existing methods, such as morphological profiles, superpixel segmentation, and composite kernels, exploit the spatial information. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach inspired by image denoising and segmentation to incorporate the spatial information. In the first stage, SVMs are used to estimate the class probability for each pixel. In the second stage, a convex variant of the Mumford\u2013Shah model is applied to each probability map to denoise and segment the image into different classes. Our proposed method effectively utilizes both spectral and spatial information of the data sets and is fast as only convex minimization is needed in addition to the SVMs. Experimental results on three widely utilized real hyperspectral data sets indicate that our method is very competitive in accuracy, timing, and the number of parameters when compared with current state-of-the-art methods, especially when the inter-class spectra are similar or the percentage of training pixels is reasonably high."}}

In this paper, we propose a practical trading strategy based on an integer programming technique to exploit the mispricing opportunity of Asian-style index futures over the settlement period using a proxy of the underlying asset. The integer program can detect mispricing, construct an arbitrage portfolio by using the proxy and dynamically maintain the arbitrage portfolio. Hang Seng Index Futures (HSI Futures) of the Hong Kong market is used to test the trading strategy. The historical data of HSI Futures shows that there is a positive relationship between the magnitude of mispricing and the time to maturity over the settlement period. Moreover, our empirical findings show positive profitability of the trading strategy."}}
