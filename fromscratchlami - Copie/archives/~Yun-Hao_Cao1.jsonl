However, we find that current SSL models suffer severe accuracy drops when performing low-bit quantization, prohibiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. In this paper, we propose a method called synergistic self-supervised and quantization learning (SSQL) to pretrain quantization-friendly self-supervised models facilitating downstream deployment. SSQL contrasts the features of the quantized and full precision models in a self-supervised fashion, where the bit-width for the quantized model is randomly selected in each step. SSQL not only significantly improves the accuracy when quantized to lower bit-widths, but also boosts the accuracy of full precision models in most cases. By only training once, SSQL can then benefit various downstream tasks at different bit-widths simultaneously. Moreover, the bit-width flexibility is achieved without additional storage overhead, requiring only one copy of weights during training and inference. We theoretically analyze the optimization process of SSQL, and conduct exhaustive experiments on various benchmarks to further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

That is, a CNN has an inductive bias to naturally focus on objects, named as Tobias (\"The object is at sight\") in this paper. This empirical inductive bias is further analyzed and successfully applied to self-supervised learning (SSL). A CNN is encouraged to learn representations that focus on the foreground object, by transforming every image into various versions with different backgrounds, where the foreground and background separation is guided by Tobias. Experimental results show that the proposed Tobias significantly improves downstream tasks, especially for object detection. This paper also shows that Tobias has consistent improvements on training sets of different sizes, and is more resilient to changes in image augmentations."}}

We argue that in real-world applications we may often only try one episode instead of many, and hence maximizing the worst-case accuracy is more important than maximizing the average accuracy. We empirically show that a high average accuracy not necessarily means a high worst-case accuracy. Since this objective is not accessible, we propose to reduce the standard deviation and increase the average accuracy simultaneously. In turn, we devise two strategies from the bias-variance tradeoff perspective to implicitly reach this goal: a simple yet effective stability regularization (SR) loss together with model ensemble to reduce variance during fine-tuning, and an adaptability calibration mechanism to reduce the bias. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, which outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin in terms of not only average, but also worst-case accuracy."}}

They achieve competitive results with CNNs but the lack of the typical convolutional inductive bias makes them more data-hungry than common CNNs. They are often pretrained on JFT-300M or at least ImageNet and few works study training ViTs with limited data. In this paper, we investigate how to train ViTs with limited data (e.g., 2040 images). We give theoretical analyses that our method (based on parametric instance discrimination) is superior to other methods in that it can capture both feature alignment and instance similarities. We achieve state-of-the-art results when training from scratch on 7 small datasets under various ViT backbones. We also investigate the transferring ability of small datasets and find that representations learned from small datasets can even improve large-scale ImageNet training."}}

However, there is as yet no straightforward way to combine it with deep learning. In this paper, we therefore propose Neural Random Subspace (NRS), a novel deep learning based random subspace method. In contrast to previous forest methods, NRS enjoys the benefits of end-to-end, data-driven representation learning, as well as pervasive support from deep learning software and hardware platforms, hence achieving faster inference speed and higher accuracy. Furthermore, as a non-linear component to be encoded into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), NRS learns non-linear feature representations in CNNs more efficiently than contemporary, higher-order pooling methods, producing excellent results with negligible increase in parameters, floating point operations (FLOPs) and real running time. Compared with random subspaces, random forests and gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs), NRS demonstrates superior performance on 35 machine learning datasets. Moreover, on both 2D image and 3D point cloud recognition tasks, integration of NRS with CNN architectures achieves consistent improvements with only incremental cost."}}

Previous methods often try to utilize feature maps and classification weights to localize objects using image level annotations indirectly. In this paper, we demonstrate that weakly supervised object localization should be divided into two parts: the class-agnostic object localization and the object classification. For class-agnostic object localization, we should use class-agnostic methods to generate noisy pseudo annotations and then perform bounding box regression on them without class labels. We propose the pseudo supervised\nobject localization (PSOL) method as a new way to solve WSOL. Our PSOL models have good transferability across\ndifferent datasets without fine-tuning. With the generated pseudo bounding boxes, we achieve 58.00% localization accuracy on ImageNet and 74.97% localization accuracy on CUB-200, which have a large edge over previous models."}}

However, a common theme in these methods is that they inherit the learning paradigm from the supervised deep learning scenario. Current SSL methods are often pretrained for many epochs on large-scale datasets using high resolution images, which brings heavy computational cost and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we demonstrate that the learning paradigm for SSL should be different from supervised learning and the information encoded by the contrastive loss is expected to be much less than that encoded in the labels in supervised learning via the cross entropy loss. Hence, we propose scaled-down self-supervised learning (S3L), which include 3 parts: small resolution, small architecture and small data. On a diverse set of datasets, SSL methods and backbone architectures, S3L achieves higher accuracy consistently with much less training cost when compared to previous SSL learning paradigm. Furthermore, we show that even without a large pretraining dataset, S3L can achieve impressive results on small data alone.
