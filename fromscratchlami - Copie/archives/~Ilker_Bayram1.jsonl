We propose a method for decomposition that relies on solving instances of a `constrained filtering problem,' which is posed as a convex minimization problem. We provide a fast algorithm for solving the minimization problem, and demonstrate the potential of the scheme on a vital signs monitoring experiment using radar."}}

In this paper, we extend such a penalty, and introduce an additional layer of grouping on the coefficients. Specifically, we first partition the signal into groups, and then apply the penalty on the \u2113 <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> norms of the groups. We discuss how this extended penalty can be used in energy minimization formulations, and demonstrate the effects of the proposed extension on a dereverberation experiment."}}

We follow the `lifting' approach, but unlike previous work which use convex relaxations of the unit rank constraint, we use a weakly-convex matrix penalty. We derive a convergent algorithm and show that it is computationally more feasible than those obtained under convex relaxations. We demonstrate numerically that when the signal to noise ratio is high, the proposed algorithm can achieve almost error-free reconstruction with fewer measurements than when convex relaxation is employed."}}

We propose an inventive use of MCLP as a pre-processing step for blind source separation with a microphone array. We show theoretically that, under certain assumptions, such pre-processing reduces the original blind reverberant source separation problem to a non-reverberant one, which in turn can be effectively tackled using existing methods. We demonstrate our claims using real recordings obtained with an eight-microphone circular array in reverberant environments."}}

We discuss how the proposed penalty/threshold function can be useful for signals with isolated nonzeros, such as audio with isolated harmonics along the frequency axis, or reflection functions in exploration seismology where the nonzeros occur on the boundaries of subsoil layers. We demonstrate the use of the proposed penalty/threshold functions in a convex denoising and a nonconvex deconvolution formulation. We provide convergent algorithms for both formulations and compare the performance with state-of-the-art methods."}}

In a spectrum frequency band, in harmonics, coefficients have a predictable pattern in phase.

In order to solve this problem we make use of a minimization problem. We solve the minimization problem with an iterative method. We discuss the performance of proposed method with experiments."}}
