In chest radiography, diagnosis is both a long-tailed and multi-label problem, as patients often present with multiple findings simultaneously. While researchers have begun to study the problem of long-tailed learning in medical image recognition, few have studied the interaction of label imbalance and label co-occurrence posed by long-tailed, multi-label disease classification. To engage with the research community on this emerging topic, we conducted an open challenge, CXR-LT, on long-tailed, multi-label thorax disease classification from chest X-rays (CXRs). We publicly release a large-scale benchmark dataset of over 350,000 CXRs, each labeled with at least one of 26 clinical findings following a long-tailed distribution. We synthesize common themes of top-performing solutions, providing practical recommendations for long-tailed, multi-label medical image classification. Finally, we use these insights to propose a path forward involving vision-language foundation models for few- and zero-shot disease classification."}}

To address the most challenging issue in this goal, i.e., catastrophic forgetting, the mainstream paradigm is memory-replay CIL, which consolidates old knowledge by replaying a small number of old classes of samples saved in the memory. Despite effectiveness, the inherent destruction-reconstruction dynamics in memory-replay CIL are an intrinsic limitation: if the old knowledge is severely destructed, it will be quite hard to reconstruct the lossless counterpart. Our theoretical analysis shows that the destruction of old knowledge can be effectively alleviated by balancing the contribution of samples from the current phase and those saved in the memory. Motivated by this theoretical finding, we propose a novel Balanced Destruction-Reconstruction module (BDR) for memory-replay CIL, which can achieve better knowledge reconstruction by reducing the degree of maximal destruction of old knowledge. Specifically, to achieve a better balance between old knowledge and new classes, the proposed BDR module takes into account two factors: the variance in training status across different classes and the quantity imbalance of samples from the current phase and memory. By dynamically manipulating the gradient during training based on these factors, BDR can effectively alleviate knowledge destruction and improve knowledge reconstruction. Extensive experiments on a range of CIL benchmarks have shown that as a lightweight plug-and-play module, BDR can significantly improve the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods with good generalization."}}

However, current works mainly pay attention to the exploration on single dataset of CXRs, which locks the potential of this powerful paradigm on larger hybrid of multi-source CXRs datasets. We identify that although blending samples from the diverse sources offers the advantages to improve the model generalization, it is still challenging to maintain the consistent superiority for the task of each source due to the existing heterogeneity among sources. To handle this dilemma, we design a Conquer-and-Divide pre-training framework, termed as UniChest, aiming to make full use of the collaboration benefit of multiple sources of CXRs while reducing the negative influence of the source heterogeneity. Specially, the ``Conquer\" stage in UniChest encourages the model to sufficiently capture multi-source common patterns, and the ``Divide\" stage helps squeeze personalized patterns into different small experts (query networks). We conduct thorough experiments on many benchmarks, e.g., ChestX-ray14, CheXpert, Vindr-CXR, Shenzhen, Open-I and SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax, verifying the effectiveness of UniChest over a range of baselines, and release our codes and pre-training models at https://github.com/Elfenreigen/UniChest."}}

However, few attempts take into account the coupled challenges posed by both the class imbalance and label co-occurrence, which hinders their value to boost the diagnosis on chest X-rays (CXRs) in the real-world scenarios. Besides, with the prevalence of pretraining techniques, how to incorporate these new paradigms into the current framework lacks of the systematical study. This technical report presents a brief description of our solution in the ICCV CVAMD 2023 CXR-LT Competition. We empirically explored the effectiveness for CXR diagnosis with the integration of several advanced designs about data augmentation, feature extractor, classifier design, loss function reweighting, exogenous data replenishment, etc. In addition, we improve the performance through simple test-time data augmentation and ensemble. Our framework finally achieves 0.349 mAP on the competition test set, ranking in the top five."}}

The straightforward combination of LT and PLL, i.e., LT-PLL, suffers from a fundamental dilemma: LT methods build upon a given class distribution that is unavailable in PLL, and the performance of PLL is severely influenced in long-tailed context. We show that even with the auxiliary of an oracle class prior, the state-of-the-art methods underperform due to an adverse fact that the constant rebalancing in LT is harsh to the label disambiguation in PLL. To overcome this challenge, we thus propose a dynamic rebalancing method, termed as RECORDS, without assuming any prior knowledge about the class distribution. Based on a parametric decomposition of the biased output, our method constructs a dynamic adjustment that is benign to the label disambiguation process and theoretically converges to the oracle class prior. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant gain of RECORDS compared with a range of baselines. The code is publicly available."}}

Nevertheless, it is hard for existing works to capture transferable and robust features, when facing the long-tailed distribution in the real-world scenarios. The attribution is that plain SSL methods to pursue sample-level uniformity easily leads to the distorted embedding space, where head classes with the huge sample number dominate the feature regime and tail classes passively collapse. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Self-Supervised Logit Adjustment ($S^2LA$) method to achieve the category-level uniformity from a geometric perspective. Specially, we measure the geometric statistics of the embedding space to construct the calibration, and jointly learn a surrogate label allocation to constrain the space expansion of head classes and avoid the passive collapse of tail classes. Our proposal does not alter the setting of SSL and can be easily integrated into existing works in an end-to-end and low-cost manner. Extensive results on a range of benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of $S^2LA$ with high tolerance to the distribution skewness. "}}
