Though existing AutoML works can speedup such process, they either require tuning from scratch for a new scenario or do not consider data privacy. To scale up, we derive a new AutoML setting from a platform perspective. In such setting, new datasets sequentially arrive at the platform, where an architecture and hyper-parameter configuration is recommended to train the optimal face detector for each dataset. This, however, brings two major challenges: (1) how to predict the best configuration for any given dataset without touching their raw images due to the privacy concern? and (2) how to continuously improve the AutoML algorithm from previous tasks and offer a better warm-up for future ones? We introduce \u201cHyperFD\u201d, a new privacy-preserving online AutoML framework for face detection. At its core part, a novel meta-feature representation of a dataset as well as its learning paradigm is proposed. Thanks to HyperFD, each local task (client) is able to effectively leverage the learning \u201cexperience\u201d of previous tasks without uploading raw images to the platform; meanwhile, the meta-feature extractor is continuously learned to better trade off the bias and variance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our design."}}

Most existing GNNs assume strong homophily of graph structure and apply permutation-invariant local aggregation of neighbors to learn a representation for each node. However, they fail to generalize to heterophilic graphs, where most neighboring nodes have different labels or features, and the relevant nodes are distant. Few recent studies attempt to address this problem by combining multiple hops of hidden representations of central nodes (i.e., multi-hop-based approaches) or sorting the neighboring nodes based on attention scores (i.e., ranking-based approaches). As a result, these approaches have some apparent limitations. On the one hand, multi-hop-based approaches do not explicitly distinguish relevant nodes from a large number of multi-hop neighborhoods, leading to a severe over-smoothing problem. On the other hand, ranking-based models do not joint-optimize node ranking with end tasks and result in sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we present Graph Pointer Neural Networks (GPNN) to tackle the challenges mentioned above. We leverage a pointer network to select the most relevant nodes from a large amount of multi-hop neighborhoods, which constructs an ordered sequence according to the relationship with the central node. 1D convolution is then applied to extract high-level features from the node sequence. The pointer-network-based ranker in GPNN is joint-optimized with other parts in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on six public node classification datasets with heterophilic graphs. The results show that GPNN significantly improves the classification performance of state-of-the-art methods. In addition, analyses also reveal the privilege of the proposed GPNN in filtering out irrelevant neighbors and reducing over-smoothing."}}

Existing works of WS for binary classification typically assume the presence of labeling sources that are able to assign both positive and negative labels to data in roughly balanced proportions. However, for many tasks of interest where there is a minority positive class, negative examples could be too diverse for developers to generate indicative labeling sources. Thus, in this work, we study the application of WS on binary classification tasks with positive labeling sources only. We propose WEAPO, a simple yet competitive WS method for producing training labels without negative labeling sources. On 10 benchmark datasets, we show WEAPO achieves the highest averaged performance in terms of both the quality of synthesized labels and the performance of the final classifier supervised with these labels. We incorporated the implementation of WEAPO into WRENCH, an existing benchmarking platform."}}

The major challenge is to capture authentic and complete user preferences in the entire session. Recent work utilizes graph structure to represent the entire session and adopts Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode session information. This modeling choice has been proved to be effective and achieved remarkable results. However, most of the existing studies only consider each item within the session independently and do not capture session semantics from a high-level perspective. Such limitation often leads to severe information loss and increases the difficulty of capturing long-range dependencies within a session. Intuitively, compared with individual items, a session snippet, i.e., a group of locally consecutive items, is able to provide supplemental user intents which are hardly captured by existing methods. In this work, we propose to learn multi-granularity consecutive user intent unit to improve the recommendation performance. Specifically, we creatively propose Multi-granularity Intent Heterogeneous Session Graph (MIHSG) which captures the interactions between different granularity intent units and relieves the burden of long-dependency. Moreover, we propose the Intent Fusion Ranking (IFR) module to compose the recommendation results from various granularity user intents. Compared with current methods that only leverage intents from individual items, IFR benefits from different granularity user intents to generate more accurate and comprehensive session representation, thus eventually boosting recommendation performance. We conduct extensive experiments on five session-based recommendation datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to current state-of-the-art methods, we achieve as large as 10.21% gain on [email\u00a0protected] and 15.53% gain on [email\u00a0protected]."}}

First, it is the largest multi-modal conversation dataset by the number of dialogues by 88x. Second, it contains massive topics to generalize the open-domain. To build engaging dialogue system with this dataset, we propose and normalize two response producing tasks based on retrieval and generative scenarios. In addition, we build two baselines for above tasks with state-of-the-art techniques and report their experimental performance. We also propose a novel evaluation metric MM-Relevance to measure the multi-modal responses. Our dataset and scripts are available in https://github.com/victorsungo/MMDialog."}}

However, simply integrating KGs in current KG-based RS models is not necessarily a guarantee to improve the recommendation performance, which may even weaken the holistic model capability. This is because the construction of these KGs is independent of the collection of historical user-item interactions; hence, information in these KGs may not always be helpful for recommendation to all users. In this paper, we propose attentive Knowledge-aware Graph convolutional networks with Collaborative Guidance for personalized Recommendation (CG-KGR). CG-KGR is a novel knowledge-aware recommendation model that enables ample and coherent learning of KGs and user-item interactions, via our proposed Collaborative Guidance Mechanism. Specifically, CG-KGR first encapsulates historical interactions to interactive information summarization. Then CG-KGR utilizes it as guidance to extract information out of KGs, which eventually provides more precise personalized recommendation. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets over two recommendation tasks, i.e., Top-K recommendation and Click-Through rate (CTR) prediction. The experimental results show that the CG-KGR model significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art models by 1.4-27.0% in terms of Recall metric on Top-K recommendation."}}
