Although it has been studied for decades, the majority of research focus on ground-based movements such as walking, sitting, dancing, etc. Off-grounded actions such as climbing are largely overlooked. As an important type of action in sports and firefighting field, the climbing movements is challenging to capture because of its complex back poses, intricate human-scene interactions, and difficult global localization. The research community does not have an in-depth understanding of the climbing action due to the lack of specific datasets. To address this limitation, we collect CIMI4D, a large rock \\textbf{C}l\\textbf{I}mbing \\textbf{M}ot\\textbf{I}on dataset from 12 persons climbing 13 different climbing walls. The dataset consists of around 180,000 frames of pose inertial measurements, LiDAR point clouds, RGB videos, high-precision static point cloud scenes, and reconstructed scene meshes. Moreover, we frame-wise annotate touch rock holds to facilitate a detailed exploration of human-scene interaction. The core of this dataset is a blending optimization process, which corrects for the pose as it drifts and is affected by the magnetic conditions. To evaluate the merit of CIMI4D, we perform four tasks which include human pose estimations (with/without scene constraints), pose prediction, and pose generation. The experimental results demonstrate that CIMI4D presents great challenges to existing methods and enables extensive research opportunities. We share the dataset with the research community in http://www.lidarhumanmotion.net/cimi4d/."}}

Employing a head-mounted device integrated with a LiDAR and camera, we record 12 human subjects' activities over 10 diverse urban scenes from an egocentric view. Frame-wise annotations for 2D key points, 3D pose parameters, and global translations are provided, together with reconstructed scene point clouds. To obtain accurate 3D ground truth in such large dynamic scenes, we propose a joint optimization method to fit local SMPL meshes to the scene and fine-tune the camera calibration during dynamic motions frame by frame, resulting in plausible and scene-natural 3D human poses. Eventually, SLOPER4D consists of 15 sequences of human motions, each of which has a trajectory length of more than 200 meters (up to 1,300 meters) and covers an area of more than 2,000 $m^2$ (up to 13,000 $m^2$), including more than 100K LiDAR frames, 300k video frames, and 500K IMU-based motion frames. With SLOPER4D, we provide a detailed and thorough analysis of two critical tasks, including camera-based 3D HPE and LiDAR-based 3D HPE in urban environments, and benchmark a new task, GHPE. The in-depth analysis demonstrates SLOPER4D poses significant challenges to existing methods and produces great research opportunities.

We propose LiDARHuman26M, a new human motion capture dataset captured by LiDAR at a much longer range to overcome this limitation. Our dataset also includes the ground truth human motions acquired by the IMU system and the synchronous RGB images. We further present a strong base-line method, LiDARCap, for LiDAR point cloud human motion capture. Specifically, we first utilize PointNet++ to encode features of points and then employ the inverse kinematics solver and SMPL optimizer to regress the pose through aggregating the temporally encoded features hierarchically. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms the techniques based only on RGB images. Ablation experiments demonstrate that our dataset is challenging and worthy of further research. Finally, the experiments on the KITTI Dataset and the Waymo Open Dataset show that our method can be generalized to different LiDAR sensor settings."}}

Existing studies are limited by their representation capability, sample efficiency, and approximation error. To address these challenges, we propose, ResQ, a MARL value function factorization method, which can find the optimal joint policy for any state-action value function through residual functions. ResQ masks some state-action value pairs from a joint state-action value function, which is transformed as the sum of a main function and a residual function. ResQ can be used with mean-value and stochastic-value RL. We theoretically show that ResQ can satisfy both the individual global max (IGM) and the distributional IGM principle without representation limitations. Through experiments on matrix games, the predator-prey, and StarCraft benchmarks, we show that ResQ can obtain better results than multiple expected/stochastic value factorization methods."}}

For CTDE, value function factorization methods make use of state during training and factorize the value function into multiple local value functions for decentralized execution. These approaches do not fully consider the relational information among agents, resulting in sub-optimal models for complex tasks. To remedy this issue, we propose QRelation which is a graph neural network approach for value function factorization. It considers both the static relations (e.g., agent types) and dynamic relations (e.g., close-by). We show that QRelation can obtain better results than state-of-the-art methods on challenging StarCraft II benchmarks."}}
