Anywhere between 30\u201340% of the sales volumes are achieved\nthrough various promotions. Promotions are instrumental in creating brand\nvisibility and awareness. In this study, we attempt to analyse the impact of\npromotions with feature advertises, in-store display, temporary price discounts\netc. Five different multivariate regression models have been developed to\nforecast the total sales of a product considering pricing and distribution\nvariables. The performance of these models has been analysed by using\nsyndicated data. Based on the results, it is found that the S-shaped (double-log)\nmodel has shown superior performance over the other models considered in\nthis study."}}

It means stocking the advertising\nactivity by integrating prior advertising expenditures into a stock variable and\nconsidering \u2018carry-over effect\u2019 over the years. Adstock is not an aggressive\nplan to augment sales. Rather, it is a planned activity to keep the sales steady\nover a given period, increase awareness and strengthen brand equity. Planned\nscheduling and execution of budget spending in achieving this advertising goal\ndictates the growth or decay in sales of a product. This research focuses on\nmeasuring the Adstock using television gross rating points (TV-GRP) and\nnon-TV media variables by using different methods available to model\nAdstock. In this study, we investigated the models available in the literature\ndescribing the \u2018decay-effect\u2019 over a given period on live data from the\nconsumer packaged goods (CPG) company. In addition, we have presented\nmodified forms of the S-shaped curve model and the exponential model. The\nproposed exponential model with both TV-GRP and non-TV media as\nindependent variables has shown superior performance over the other models.\nAll the results have been computed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS)\nEnterprise Guide 4.1."}}

In some situations, projects that are completed before\ntheir due-dates are not handed over to the project owner or customer, but held\nwith the organisation that executes the project, while the projects that are\ncompleted after their due-dates are considered tardy and result in loss of\ncustomer goodwill and penalty. The current study, therefore, addresses the\nproblem of scheduling resource-constrained multiple projects with the\nconsideration of projects having different relative earliness and relative\ntardiness costs. In the first phase of the study, relative costs (or weights) for\ntardiness of projects is considered, and the scheduling rules are presented in\norder to minimise the weighted tardiness of projects. In the second phase of the\nstudy, the objective considered is the minimisation of the sum of weighted\nearliness and weighted tardiness of projects, and the scheduling rules are\npresented by incorporating the relative costs of earliness and tardiness of projects. Computational studies have been conducted separately for both phases\nof the current study; the performance of the scheduling rules has been observed\nindependently and the results of the computational study have been reported."}}
