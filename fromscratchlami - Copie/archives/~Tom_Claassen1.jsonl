The resulting characterization leads to a procedure for establishing Markov equivalence between graphs that no longer requires explicit tests for d-separation, leading to a significantly reduced algorithmic complexity. The conceptually simplified characterization may help to reinvigorate theoretical research towards sound and complete cyclic discovery in the presence of latent confounders."}}

Building on the seminal constraint-based causal discovery algorithm, FCI, we exploit the power of direct cause-effect pair identification to uncover new relationships, which can subsequently be propagated to find even more causal links in the rest of the model. This idea has been explored before, but until now always under the assumption of no latent confounders. Using our new causal direction criterion (CDC), we can finally drop this limitation. We derive inference rules for orienting additional cause-effect relations and show how to minimize the number of tests during the CDC search. In our experimental evaluations over a range of simulated data sets, the resulting FCI-CDC algorithm increases recall by between 5%-10% compared to vanilla FCI, without loss in precision."}}

In many cases, these different distributions can be modeled as different contexts of a single underlying system, in which each distribution corresponds to a different perturbation of the system, or in causal terms, an intervention. We focus on a class of such causal domain adaptation problems, where data for one or more source domains are given, and the task is to predict the distribution of a certain target variable from measurements of other variables in one or more target domains. We propose an approach for solving these problems that exploits causal inference and does not rely on prior knowledge of the causal graph, the type of interventions or the intervention targets. We demonstrate our approach by evaluating a possible implementation on simulated and real world data."}}

Thousands of sensors measure relevant process variables at appropriate sampling rates, to provide time series as primary sources for system diagnostics. However, high-dimensionality, non-linearity and non-stationarity of the data are major challenges to efficiently, yet accurately, diagnose rare or new system issues by merely using model-based approaches. To reliably narrow down the causal search space, we validate a ranking algorithm that applies transfer entropy for bivariate interaction analysis of a system\u2019s multivariate time series to obtain a weighted directed graph, and graph eigenvector centrality to identify the system\u2019s most important sources of original information or causal influence. The results suggest that this approach robustly identifies the true drivers or causes of a complex system\u2019s deviant behavior, even when its reconstructed information transfer network includes redundant edges."}}

Most existing causal discovery methods, however, rely on the IID assumption, meaning that they are ill-equipped to handle, let alone exploit this additional information. In this work, we take a typical example from the field of ecology with an underlying directional flow structure in which samples are collected from rivers and show how to adapt the well-known Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm (Spirtes et al., 2000) to learn cause-effect relationships in such a system efficiently. We first evaluated our adaptation in a simulation study against the original FCI algorithm and found significantly increased performance regardless of the sample size. In a subsequent application to real-world river data from the US state of Ohio, we identified important likely causes of biodiversity measured in the form of the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) metric."}}

These values are designed to attribute the difference between a model's prediction and an average baseline to the different features used as input to the model. Being based on solid game-theoretic principles, Shapley values uniquely satisfy several desirable properties, which is why they are increasingly used to explain the predictions of possibly complex and highly non-linear machine learning models. Shapley values are well calibrated to a user\u2019s intuition when features are independent, but may lead to undesirable, counterintuitive explanations when the independence assumption is violated. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for computing Shapley values that generalizes recent work that aims to circumvent the independence assumption. By employing Pearl's do-calculus, we show how these `causal' Shapley values can be derived for general causal graphs without sacrificing any of their desirable properties. Moreover, causal Shapley values enable us to separate the contribution of direct and indirect effects. We provide a practical implementation for computing causal Shapley values based on causal chain graphs when only partial information is available and illustrate their utility on a real-world example."}}

When applying causal discovery algorithms designed for the acyclic setting on data generated by a system that involves feedback, one would not expect to obtain correct results. In this work, we show that---surprisingly---the output of the Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm is correct if it is applied to observational data generated by a system that involves feedback. More specifically, we prove that for observational data generated by a simple and $\\sigma$-faithful Structural Causal Model (SCM), FCI is sound and complete, and can be used to consistently estimate (i) the presence and absence of causal relations, (ii) the presence and absence of direct causal relations, (iii) the absence of confounders, and (iv) the absence of specific cycles in the causal graph of the SCM. We extend these results to constraint-based causal discovery algorithms that exploit certain forms of background knowledge, including the causally sufficient setting (e.g., the PC algorithm) and the Joint Causal Inference setting (e.g., the FCI-JCI algorithm)."}}
