Researchers have made great progress in designing various traditional methods, and their theoretical design and performance gain are close to a limit. In the past few years, learning-based IM methods have emerged to achieve stronger generalization ability to unknown graphs than traditional ones. However, the development of learning-based IM methods is still limited by fundamental obstacles, including 1) the difficulty of effectively solving the objective function; 2) the difficulty of characterizing the diversified underlying diffusion patterns; and 3) the difficulty of adapting the solution under various node-centrality-constrained IM variants. To cope with the above challenges, we design a novel framework DeepIM to generatively characterize the latent representation of seed sets, and we propose to learn the diversified information diffusion pattern in a data-driven and end-to-end manner. Finally, we design a novel objective function to infer optimal seed sets under flexible node-centrality-based budget constraints. Extensive analyses are conducted over both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the overall performance of DeepIM.

Over the past few years, plenty of studies have leveraged various forms of external knowledge to augment the reasoning capabilities of deep models, tackling challenges such as effective knowledge integration, implicit knowledge mining, and problems of tractability and optimization. However, there is a dearth of a comprehensive technical review of the existing knowledge-enhanced reasoning techniques across the diverse range of application domains. This survey provides an in-depth examination of recent advancements in the field, introducing a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing knowledge-enhanced methods into two primary categories and four subcategories. We systematically discuss these methods and highlight their correlations, strengths, and limitations. Finally, we elucidate the current application domains and provide insight into promising prospects for future research."}}

The advancement of this area is challenged by: 1) characterizing data distribution drift and its impacts on models, 2) expressiveness in tracking the model dynamics, and 3) theoretical guarantee on the performance. To address them, we propose a Temporal Domain Generalization with Drift-Aware Dynamic Neural Network (DRAIN) framework. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a Bayesian framework that jointly models the relation between data and model dynamics. We then build a recurrent graph generation scenario to characterize the dynamic graph-structured neural networks learned across different time points. It captures the temporal drift of model parameters and data distributions and can predict models in the future without the presence of future data. In addition, we explore theoretical guarantees of the model performance under the challenging temporal DG setting and provide theoretical analysis, including uncertainty and generalization error. Finally, extensive experiments on several real-world benchmarks with temporal drift demonstrate the proposed method\u2019s effectiveness and efficiency."}}

As the most well-known computational method of analogical reasoning, Structure-Mapping Theory (SMT) abstracts both target and base subjects into relational graphs and forms the cognitive process of analogical reasoning by finding a corresponding subgraph (i.e., correspondence) in the target graph that is aligned with the base graph. However, incorporating deep learning for SMT is still under-explored due to several obstacles: 1) the combinatorial complexity of searching for the correspondence in the target graph; 2) the correspondence mining is restricted by various cognitive theory-driven constraints. To address both challenges, we propose a novel framework for Analogical Reasoning (DeepGAR) that identifies the correspondence between source and target domains by assuring cognitive theory-driven constraints. Specifically, we design a geometric constraint embedding space to induce subgraph relation from node embeddings for efficient subgraph search. Furthermore, we develop novel learning and optimization strategies that could end-to-end identify correspondences that are strictly consistent with constraints driven by the cognitive theory. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DeepGAR over existing methods.

Hence it is usually crucial to identify diffusion sources according to the current graph diffusion observations. Despite its tremendous necessity and significance in practice, source localization, as the inverse problem of graph diffusion, is extremely challenging as it is ill-posed: different sources may lead to the same graph diffusion patterns. Different from most traditional source localization methods, this paper focuses on a probabilistic manner to account for the uncertainty of different candidate sources. Such endeavors require to overcome significant challenges along the way including: 1) the uncertainty in graph diffusion source localization is hard to be quantified; 2) the complex patterns of the graph diffusion sources are difficult to be probabilistically characterized; 3) the generalization under any underlying diffusion patterns is hard to be imposed. To solve the above challenges, this paper presents a generic framework: Source Localization Variational AutoEncoder (SL-VAE) for locating the diffusion sources under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Particularly, we propose a probabilistic model that leverages the forward diffusion estimation model along with deep generative models to approximate the diffusion source distribution for quantifying the uncertainty. SL-VAE further utilizes prior knowledge of the source-observation pairs to characterize the complex patterns of diffusion sources by a learned generative prior. Lastly, a unified objective that integrates the forward diffusion estimation model is derived to enforce the model to generalize under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted on $7$ real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SL-VAE in reconstructing the diffusion sources by excelling the state-of-the-arts on average 20% in AUC score.

Among various methods, replay-based approaches that maintain and replay a small episodic memory of previous samples are one of the most successful strategies against catastrophic forgetting. However, since forgetting is inevitable given bounded memory and unbounded tasks, how to forget is a problem continual learning must address. Therefore, beyond simply avoiding catastrophic forgetting, an under-explored issue is how to reasonably forget while ensuring the merits of human memory, including 1. storage efficiency, 2. generalizability, and 3. some interpretability. To achieve these simultaneously, our paper proposes a new saliency-augmented memory completion framework for continual learning, inspired by recent discoveries in memory completion separation in cognitive neuroscience. Specifically, we innovatively propose to store the part of the image most important to the tasks in episodic memory by saliency map extraction and memory encoding. When learning new tasks, previous data from memory are inpainted by an adaptive data generation module, which is inspired by how humans complete episodic memory. The module's parameters are shared across all tasks and it can be jointly trained with a continual learning classifier as bilevel optimization. Extensive experiments on several continual learning and image classification benchmarks demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness and efficiency."}}

Generative models for temporal and spatial networks respectively cannot be easily generalized to spatiotemporal graph generation due to their incapability of capturing: 1) mutually influenced graph and spatiotemporal distribution, 2) spatiotemporal-validity constraints, and 3) characteristics of multi-modal spatiotemporal properties. To this end, we propose a generic and end-to-end framework for spatiotemporal graph generation (STGEN) that jointly captures the graph, temporal, and spatial distributions of spatiotemporal graphs. Particularly, STGEN learns the multi-modal distribution of spatiotemporal graphs via learning the distribution of spatiotemporal walks based on a new heterogeneous probabilistic sequential model. Auxiliary activation layers are proposed to retain the spatiotemporal validity of the generated graphs. In addition, a new boosted strategy for the ensemble of discriminators is proposed to distinguish the generated and real spatiotemporal walks from multi-dimensions and capture the combinatorial patterns among them. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic/real-world spatiotemporal graphs and demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed model."}}
