In practice, optimization difficulties, such as conflicting gradients, can result in negative transfer, where multi-task models which perform worse than single-task models. In this work, we identify the optimization temperature---the ratio of learning rate to batch size---as a key factor in negative transfer. Temperature controls the level of noise in each optimization step, which prior work has shown to have a strong correlation with generalization. We demonstrate that, in some multi-task settings, negative transfer may arise due to poorly set optimization temperature, rather than inherently high task conflict. The implication of this finding is that in some settings, SGD with a carefully controlled temperature achieves comparable, and in some cases superior, performance to that of specialized optimization procedures such as PCGrad, MGDA, and GradNorm. In particular, our results suggest that the significant additional computational burden of these specialized methods may not always be necessary. Finally, we observe a conflict between the optimal temperatures of different tasks in a multi-task objective, with different levels of noise promoting better generalization for different\ntasks. Our work suggests the need for novel multi-task optimization methods which consider individual task noise-levels, and their impact on generalization."}}

We focus on learning an embedding that maps variable-sized samples of user activity -- ranging from single posts to entire months of activity -- to a vector space, where samples by the same author map to nearby points. The approach does not require human-annotated data for training purposes, which allows us to leverage large amounts of social media content. The proposed model outperforms several competitive baselines under a novel evaluation framework modeled after established recognition benchmarks in other domains. Our method achieves high linking accuracy, even with small samples from accounts not seen at training time, a prerequisite for practical applications of the proposed linking framework."}}

A common paradigm is to pre-train a feature extractor on large amounts of data then fine-tune it as part of a deep learning model on some downstream task (i.e. transfer learning). While effective, feature extractors like BERT may be prohibitively large for some deployment scenarios. We explore weight pruning for BERT and ask: how does compression during pre-training affect transfer learning? We find that pruning affects transfer learning in three broad regimes. Low levels of pruning (30-40%) do not affect pre-training loss or transfer to downstream tasks at all. Medium levels of pruning increase the pre-training loss and prevent useful pre-training information from being transferred to downstream tasks. High levels of pruning additionally prevent models from fitting downstream datasets, leading to further degradation. Finally, we observe that fine-tuning BERT on a specific task does not improve its prunability. We conclude that BERT can be pruned once during pre-training rather than separately for each task without affecting performance."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel procedure to learn a mapping from short episodes of user activity on social media to a vector space in which the distance between points captures the similarity of the corresponding users' invariant features. We fit the model by optimizing a surrogate metric learning objective over a large corpus of unlabeled social media content. Once learned, the mapping may be applied to users not seen at training time and enables efficient comparisons of users in the resulting vector space. We present a comprehensive evaluation to validate the benefits of the proposed approach using data from Reddit, Twitter, and Wikipedia."}}

When text is modeled as characters instead of words, the longer sequences make RNNs a poor choice. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), although somewhat less ubiquitous than RNNs, have an internal structure more appropriate for long-distance character dependencies. To better understand how CNNs and RNNs differ in handling long sequences, we use them for text classification tasks in several character-level social media datasets. The CNN models vastly outperform the RNN models in our experiments, suggesting that CNNs are superior to RNNs at learning to classify character-level data."}}
