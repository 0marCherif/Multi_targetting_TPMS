In this work, we study the problem of actively classifying dynamical systems with a finite set of Markov decision process (MDP) models. We are interested in finding strategies that actively interact with the dynamical system, and observe its reactions so that the true model is determined efficiently with high confidence. To this end, we present a decision-theoretic framework based on partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The proposed framework relies on assigning a classification belief (a probability distribution) to each candidate MDP model. Given an initial belief, some misclassification probabilities, a cost bound, and a finite time horizon, we design POMDP strategies leading to classification decisions. We present two different approaches to find such strategies. The first approach computes the optimal strategy \u201cexactly\u201d using value iteration. To overcome the computational complexity of finding exact solutions, the second approach is based on adaptive sampling to approximate the optimal probability of reaching a classification decision. We illustrate the proposed methodology using two examples from medical diagnosis and intruder detection."}}

Each agent of the multi-agent system is monitored, and if needed corrected, by the shield, such that a global specification is always satisfied. The different ways of how a shield can interfere with each agent in the system in case of an error introduces the need for quantitative objectives. This work is the first to discuss the shield synthesis problem with quantitative objectives. We provide several cost functions that are utilized in the multi-agent setting and provide methods for the synthesis of cost-optimal shields and fair shields, under the given assumptions on the multi-agent system. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach via a detailed case study on UAV mission planning for warehouse logistics and simulating the shielded multi-agent system on ROS/Gazebo."}}

We formulate the problem as a multi-agent reactive synthesis problem with surveillance objectives specified as temporal logic formulas. In order to avoid the state space blow-up arising from a centralized strategy computation, we propose a method to decentralize the surveillance strategy synthesis by decomposing the multi-agent game into subgames that can be solved independently. We also decompose the global surveillance specification into local specifications for each sensor, and show that if the sensors satisfy their local surveillance specifications, then the sensor network as a whole will satisfy the global surveillance objective. Thus, our method is able to guarantee global surveillance properties in a mobile sensor network while synthesizing completely decentralized strategies with no need for coordination between the sensors. We also present a case study in which we demonstrate an application of decentralized surveillance strategy synthesis."}}

We seek to perform mission planning for vehicles in a UAM fleet, while guaranteeing system safety requirements such as traffic separation. In this paper, we present a localized hierarchical planning procedure for the traffic management problem of a fleet of (potentially autonomous) UAM vehicles. We apply decentralized policy synthesis for route planning on individual vehicles, which are modeled by Markov decision processes. We divide the operating region into sectors and use reactive synthesis to generate local runtime enforcement modules or shields, each of which satisfies its own assume-guarantee contract that encodes requirements of conflict management, safety, and interactions with neighbouring sectors. We prove that the realization of these contracts ensures that the entire network of shields satisfies the safety specifications with each shield limited to acting in its local sector of operation."}}

This paper introduces a general framework and solution to address deception. Most existing approaches for deception consider obfuscating crucial information to rational adversaries with abundant memory and computation resources. In this paper, we consider deceiving adversaries with bounded rationality and in terms of expected rewards. This problem is commonly encountered in many applications especially involving human adversaries. Leveraging the cognitive bias of humans in reward evaluation under stochastic outcomes, we introduce a framework to optimally assign resources of a limited quantity to optimally defend against human adversaries. Modeling such cognitive biases follows the so-called prospect theory from behavioral psychology literature. Then we formulate the resource allocation problem as a signomial program to minimize the defender's cost in an environment modeled as a Markov decision process. We use police patrol hour assignment as an illustrative example and provide detailed simulation results based on real-world data."}}

Existing methods that employ design-time synthesis of shields do not scale to multi-agent systems. Moreover, such shields are typically implemented in a centralized manner, requiring global information on the state of all agents in the system. We address these limitations through a new approach where the shields are synthesized at runtime and do not require global information. There is a shield onboard every agent, which can only modify the behavior of the corresponding agent. In this approach, which is fundamentally decentralized, the shield on every agent has two components: a pathfinder that corrects the behavior of the agent and an ordering mechanism that dynamically modifies the priority of the agent. The current priority determines if the shield uses the pathfinder to modify behavior of the agent. We derive an upper bound on the maximum deviation for any agent from its original behavior. We prove that the worst-case synthesis time is quadratic in the number of agents at runtime as opposed to exponential at design-time for existing methods. We test the performance of the decentralized, runtime shield synthesis approach on a collision-avoidance problem. For 50 agents in a 50x50 grid, the synthesis at runtime requires a few seconds per agent whenever a potential collision is detected. In contrast, the centralized design-time synthesis of shields for a similar setting is intractable beyond 4 agents in a 5x5 grid."}}

Motivated by this need, we consider a class of Markov decision processes (MDPs), along with a transfer entropy cost function. In this context, we study high-level mission specifications as co-safe linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae. We provide a method to synthesize a policy that minimizes the weighted sum of the transfer entropy and the probability of failure to satisfy the specification. We derive a set of coupled non-linear equations that an optimal policy must satisfy. We then use a modified Arimoto-Blahut algorithm to solve the non-linear equations. Finally, we demonstrated the proposed method on a navigation and path planning scenario of a Mars rover."}}
