Moreover, it is extremely laborious and expensive to collect and fully annotate a point-cloud detection dataset with numerous classes of objects, leading to the limited classes of existing point-cloud datasets and hindering the model to learn general representations to achieve open-set point-cloud detection. Instead of seeking a point-cloud dataset with full labels, we resort to ImageNet1K to broaden the vocabulary of the point-cloud detector. We propose OS-3DETIC, an Open-Set 3D DETector using Image-level Class supervision. Specifically, we take advantage of two modalities, the image modality for recognition and the point-cloud modality for localization, to generate pseudo labels for unseen classes. Then we propose a novel debiased cross-modal cross-task contrastive learning method to transfer the knowledge from image modality to point-cloud modality during training. Without hurting the latency during inference, OS-3DETIC makes the well-known point-cloud detector capable of achieving open-set detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed OS-3DETIC achieves at least 10.77 % mAP improvement (absolute value) and 9.56 % mAP improvement (absolute value) by a wide range of baselines on the SUN-RGBD dataset and ScanNet dataset, respectively. Besides, we conduct sufficient experiments to shed light on why the proposed OS-3DETIC works."}}

Observing that existing works' fusion of multi-frame images are instances of temporal stereo matching, we find that performance is hindered by the interplay between 1) the low granularity of matching resolution and 2) the sub-optimal multi-view setup produced by limited history usage. Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that the optimal temporal difference between views varies significantly for different pixels and depths, making it necessary to fuse many timesteps over long-term history. Building on our investigation, we propose to generate a cost volume from a long history of image observations, compensating for the coarse but efficient matching resolution with a more optimal multi-view matching setup. Further, we augment the per-frame monocular depth predictions used for long-term, coarse matching with short-term, fine-grained matching and find that long and short term temporal fusion are highly complementary. While maintaining high efficiency, our framework sets new state-of-the-art on nuScenes, achieving first place on the test set and outperforming previous best art by 5.2% mAP and 3.7% NDS on the validation set.

In the density map, each person is represented by a Gaussian blob, and the final count is obtained from the integration of the whole map. However, it is difficult to accurately predict the density map on dense regions. A major issue is that the density map on dense regions usually accumulates density values from a number of nearby Gaussian blobs, yielding different large density values on a small set of pixels. This makes the density map present variant patterns with significant pattern shifts and brings a long-tailed distribution of pixel-wise density values. In this paper, we aim to address such issue in the density map. Specifically, we propose a simple and effective Learning to Scale (L2S) module, which automatically scales dense regions into reasonable closeness levels (reflecting image-plane distance between neighboring people). L2S directly normalizes the closeness in different patches such that it dynamically separates the overlapped blobs, decomposes the accumulated values in the ground-truth density map, and thus alleviates the pattern shifts and long-tailed distribution of density values. This helps the model to better learn the density map. We also explore the effectiveness of L2S in localizing people by finding the local minima of the quantized distance (w.r.t. person location map), which has a similar issue as density map regression. To the best of our knowledge, such localization method is also novel in localization-based crowd counting. We further introduce a customized dynamic cross-entropy loss, significantly improving the localization-based model optimization.

While human vision can understand both representations, computer vision models designed for 2D image and 3D point-cloud understanding are quite different. Our paper explores the potential of transferring 2D model architectures and weights to understand 3D point-clouds, by empirically investigating the feasibility of the transfer, the benefits of the transfer, and shedding light on why the transfer works. We discover that we can indeed use the same architecture and pretrained weights of a neural net model to understand both images and point-clouds. Specifically, we transfer the image-pretrained model to a point-cloud model by copying or inflating the weights. We find that finetuning the transformed image-pretrained models (FIP) with minimal efforts\u2014only on input, output, and normalization layers\u2014can achieve competitive performance on 3D point-cloud classification, beating a wide range of point-cloud models that adopt task-specific architectures and use a variety of tricks. When finetuning the whole model, the performance gets further improved. Meanwhile, FIP improves data efficiency, reaching up to 10.0 top-1 accuracy percent on few-shot classification. It also speeds up the training of point-cloud models by up to 11.1x for a target accuracy (e.g., 90% accuracy). Lastly, we provide an explanation of the image to point-cloud transfer from the aspect of neural collapse. The code is available at: https://github.com/chenfengxu714/image2point ."}}

Current methods develop independent pipelines for 2D and 3D semi-supervised learning despite the availability of paired image and point cloud frames. Observing that the distinct characteristics of each sensor cause them to be biased towards detecting different objects, we propose DetMatch, a flexible framework for joint semi-supervised learning on 2D and 3D modalities. By identifying objects detected in both sensors, our pipeline generates a cleaner, more robust set of pseudo-labels that both demonstrates stronger performance and stymies single-modality error propagation. Further, we leverage the richer semantics of RGB images to rectify incorrect 3D class predictions and improve localization of 3D boxes. Evaluating on the challenging KITTI and Waymo datasets, we improve upon strong semi-supervised learning methods and observe higher quality pseudo-labels.
