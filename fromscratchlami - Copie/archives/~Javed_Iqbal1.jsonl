Although significant research has been directed to reduce the domain shift in semantic segmentation, adaptation to scenes with adverse weather conditions remains an open question. Large variations in the visibility of the scene due to weather conditions, such as fog, smog, and haze, exacerbate the domain shift, thus making unsupervised adaptation in such scenarios challenging. We propose a self-entropy and multi-scale information augmented self-supervised domain adaptation method (FogAdapt) to minimize the domain shift in foggy scenes segmentation. Supported by the empirical evidence that an increase in fog density results in high self-entropy for segmentation probabilities, we introduce a self-entropy based loss function to guide the adaptation method. Furthermore, inferences obtained at different image scales are combined and weighted by the uncertainty to generate scale-invariant pseudo-labels for the target domain. These scale-invariant pseudo-labels are robust to visibility and scale variations. We evaluate the proposed model on real clear-weather scenes to real foggy scenes adaptation and synthetic non-foggy images to real foggy scenes adaptation scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that FogAdapt significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation of foggy images. Specifically, by considering the standard settings compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, FogAdapt gains 3.8% on Foggy Zurich, 6.0% on Foggy Driving-dense, and 3.6% on Foggy Driving in mIoU when adapted from Cityscapes to Foggy Zurich."}}

In a typical setting, the classification loss forces the semantic segmentation model to greedily learn the representations that capture inter-class variations in order to determine the decision (class) boundary. Due to the domain shift, this decision boundary is unaligned in the target domain, resulting in noisy pseudo labels adversely affecting self-supervised domain adaptation. To overcome this limitation, along with capturing inter-class variation, we capture pixel-level intra-class variations through class-aware multi-modal distribution learning (MMDL). Thus, the information necessary for capturing the intra-class variations is explicitly disentangled from the information necessary for inter-class discrimination. Features captured thus are much more informative, resulting in pseudo-labels with low noise. This disentanglement allows us to perform separate alignments in discriminative space and multi-modal distribution space, using cross-entropy based self-learning for the former. For later, we propose a novel stochastic mode alignment method, by explicitly decreasing the distance between the target and source pixels that map to the same mode. The distance metric learning loss, computed over pseudo-labels and backpropagated from multi-modal modeling head, acts as the regularizer over the base network shared with the segmentation head. The results from comprehensive experiments on synthetic to real domain adaptation setups, i.e., GTA-V/SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, show that DRSL outperforms many existing approaches (a minimum margin of 2.3% and 2.5% in mIoU for SYNTHIA to Cityscapes)."}}

Built-up area estimation is an important component in understanding the human impact on the environment, the effect of public policy, and general urban population analysis. The diverse nature of aerial and satellite imagery and lack of labeled data covering this diversity makes machine learning algorithms difficult to generalize for such tasks, especially across multiple domains. On the other hand, due to the lack of strong spatial context and structure, in comparison to the ground imagery, the application of existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods results in the sub-optimal adaptation. We thoroughly study the limitations of existing domain adaptation methods and propose a weakly-supervised adaptation strategy where we assume image-level labels are available for the target domain. More specifically, we design a built-up area segmentation network (as encoder-decoder), with an image classification head added to guide the adaptation. The devised system is able to address the problem of visual differences in multiple satellite and aerial imagery datasets, ranging from high resolution (HR) to very high resolution (VHR). A realistic and challenging HR dataset is created by hand-tagging the 73.4 sq-km of Rwanda, capturing a variety of build-up structures over different terrain. The developed dataset is spatially rich compared to existing datasets and covers diverse built-up scenarios including built-up areas in forests and deserts, mud houses, tin, and colored rooftops. Extensive experiments are performed by adapting from the single-source domain, to segment out the target domain. We achieve high gains ranging 11.6%-52% in IoU over the existing state-of-the-art methods."}}

Also, most of the generic object detectors process axis-aligned rectangular areas though, a thin and long rifle may actually cover only a small percentage of that area and the rest may contain irrelevant details suppressing the required object signatures. To handle these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised Orientation Aware Object Detection (OAOD) algorithm which learns to detect oriented object bounding boxes (OBB) while using AxisAligned Bounding Boxes (AABB) for training. The proposed OAOD is different from the existing oriented object detectors which strictly require OBB during training which may not always be present. The goal of training on AABB and detection of OBB is achieved by employing a multistage scheme, with Stage-1 predicting the AABB and Stage-2 predicting OBB. In-between the two stages, the oriented proposal generation module along with the object aligned RoI pooling is designed to extract features based on the predicted orientation and to make these features orientation invariant. A diverse and challenging dataset consisting of eleven thousand images is also proposed for firearm detection which is manually annotated for firearm classification and localization. The proposed ITU Firearm dataset (ITUF) contains a wide range of guns and rifles. The OAOD algorithm is evaluated on the ITUF dataset and compared with current state-of-the-art object detectors, including fully supervised oriented object detectors. OAOD has outperformed both types of object detectors with a significant margin. The experimental results (mAP: 88.3 on AABB & mAP: 77.5 on OBB) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for firearm detection."}}
