In this setting, Russo and Van Roy proposed an information theoretic analysis of Thompson Sampling based on the information ratio, allowing for elegant proofs of Bayesian regret bounds. In this paper we introduce three novel ideas to this line of work. First we propose a new quantity, the scale-sensitive information ratio, which allows us to obtain more refined first-order regret bounds (i.e., bounds of the form <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(\\sqrt {L^{*}})$ </tex-math></inline-formula> where <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$L^{*}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the loss of the best combinatorial action). Second we replace the entropy over combinatorial actions by a coordinate entropy, which allows us to obtain the first optimal worst-case bound for Thompson Sampling in the combinatorial setting. We additionally introduce a novel link between Bayesian agents and frequentist confidence intervals. Combining these ideas we show that the classical multi-armed bandit first-order regret bound <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ \\widetilde {O}(\\sqrt {d L^{*}})$ </tex-math></inline-formula> still holds true in the more challenging and more general semi-bandit scenario. This latter result improves the previous state of the art bound <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ \\widetilde {O}(\\sqrt {(d+m^{3})L^{*}})$ </tex-math></inline-formula> by Lykouris, Sridharan and Tardos. Moreover we sharpen these results with two technical ingredients. The first leverages a recent insight of Zimmert and Lattimore to replace Shannon entropy with more refined potential functions in the analysis. The second is a Thresholded Thompson Sampling algorithm, which slightly modifies the original algorithm by never playing low-probability actions. This thresholding results in fully <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$T$ </tex-math></inline-formula> -independent regret bounds when <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$L^{*}\\leq \\overline {L} ^{*}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is almost surely upper-bounded, which we show does not hold for ordinary Thompson Sampling."}}

We rely on the branching overlap gap property introduced in our previous work and develop a new method to establish it that does not require the interpolation method. Consequently our results apply even for models with non-convex covariance, where the Parisi formula for the true ground state remains open. As a special case, we obtain the algorithmic threshold for all single-species spherical spin glasses, which was previously known only for even models. We also obtain closed-form formulas for pure models which coincide with the $E_{\\infty}$ value previously determined by the Kac-Rice formula."}}

Despite a proliferation of proposed algorithms for this task, assessing their performance both theoretically and empirically is still very challenging. Distributional matching algorithms such as (Conditional) Domain Adversarial Networks [Ganin et al., 2016, Long et al., 2018] are popular and enjoy empirical success, but they lack formal guarantees. Other approaches such as Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) require a prohibitively large number of training environments---linear in the dimension of the spurious feature space $d_s$---even on simple data models like the one proposed by [Rosenfeld et al., 2021]. Under a variant of this model, we show that ERM and IRM can fail to find the optimal invariant predictor with $o(d_s)$ environments. We then present an iterative feature matching algorithm that is guaranteed with high probability to find the optimal invariant predictor after seeing only $O(\\log d_s)$ environments. Our results provide the first theoretical justification for distribution-matching algorithms widely used in practice under a concrete nontrivial data model."}}

The maximum asymptotic value OPT of this random function is characterized by a variational principle known as the Parisi formula, proved first by Talagrand and in more generality by Panchenko. Recently developed approximate message passing algorithms efficiently optimize these functions up to a value ALG given by an extended Parisi formula, which minimizes over a larger space of functional order parameters. These two objectives are equal for spin glasses exhibiting a no overlap gap property. However, ALG can be strictly smaller than OPT, and no efficient algorithm producing a value exceeding ALG is known. We prove that when all interactions have even degree, no algorithm satisfying an overlap concentration property can produce an objective larger than ALG with non-negligible probability. This property holds for all algorithms with suitably Lipschitz dependence on the random disorder coefficients of the objective. It encompasses natural formulations of gradient descent, approximate message passing, and Langevin dynamics run for bounded time and in particular includes the algorithms achieving ALG mentioned above. To prove this result, we substantially generalize the overlap gap property framework introduced by Gamarnik and Sudan to arbitrary ultrametric forbidden structures of solutions."}}

When one is allowed to make coherent measurements entangled across all copies, $\\Theta(d^2/\\epsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient to get trace distance $\\epsilon$. Unfortunately, the protocols achieving this rate incur large quantum memory overheads that preclude implementation on near-term devices. On the other hand, the best known protocol using incoherent (single-copy) measurements uses $O(d^3/\\epsilon^2)$ copies, and multiple papers have posed it as an open question to understand whether or not this rate is tight. In this work, we fully resolve this question, by showing that any protocol using incoherent measurements, even if they are chosen adaptively, requires $\\Omega(d^3/\\epsilon^2)$ copies, matching the best known upper bound. We do so by a new proof technique which directly bounds the ``tilt'' of the posterior distribution after measurements, which yields a surprisingly short proof of our lower bound, and which we believe may be of independent interest. While this implies that adaptivity does not help for tomography with respect to trace distance, we show that it actually does help for tomography with respect to infidelity. We give an adaptive algorithm that outputs a state which is $\\gamma$-close in infidelity to $\\rho$ using only $\\tilde{O}(d^3/\\gamma)$ copies, which is optimal for incoherent measurements. In contrast, it is known that any nonadaptive algorithm requires $\\Omega(d^3/\\gamma^2)$ copies. While it is folklore that in $2$ dimensions, one can achieve a scaling of $O(1/\\gamma)$, to the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first to achieve the optimal rate in all dimensions."}}
