We present a new methodology for real-time semantic mapping from RGB-D sequences that combines a 2D neural network and a 3D network based on a SLAM system with 3D occupancy mapping. When segmenting a new frame we perform latent feature re-projection from previous frames based on differentiable rendering. Fusing re-projected feature maps from previous frames with current-frame features greatly improves image segmentation quality, compared to a baseline that processes images independently. For 3D map processing, we propose a novel geometric quasi-planar over-segmentation method that groups 3D map elements likely to belong to the same semantic classes, relying on surface normals. We also describe a novel neural network design for lightweight semantic map post-processing. Our system achieves state-of-the-art semantic mapping quality within 2D-3D networks-based systems and matches the performance of 3D convolutional networks on three real indoor datasets, while working in real-time. Moreover, it shows better cross-sensor generalization abilities compared to 3D CNNs, enabling training and inference with different depth sensors. Code and data will be released on project page: http://jingwenwang95.github.io/SeMLaPS"}}

Co-SLAM represents the scene as a multi-resolution hash-grid to exploit its high convergence speed and ability to represent high-frequency local features. In addition, Co-SLAM incorporates one-blob encoding, to encourage surface coherence and completion in unobserved areas. This joint parametric-coordinate encoding enables real-time and robust performance by bringing the best of both worlds: fast convergence and surface hole filling. Moreover, our ray sampling strategy allows Co-SLAM to perform global bundle adjustment over all keyframes instead of requiring keyframe selection to maintain a small number of active keyframes as competing neural SLAM approaches do. Experimental results show that Co-SLAM runs at 10-17Hz and achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results, and competitive tracking performance in various datasets and benchmarks (ScanNet, TUM, Replica, Synthetic RGBD).

We model the underlying scene with a learned hierarchical feature voxel grid that encapsulates multi-level geometric and appearance local information. Feature vectors are directly optimized such that after being tri-linearly interpolated, decoded by two shallow MLPs into signed distance and radiance values, and rendered via surface volume rendering, the discrepancy between synthesized and observed RGB/depth values is minimized. Our supervision signals -- RGB, depth and approximate SDF -- can be obtained directly from input images without any need for fusion or post-processing. We formulate a novel SDF gradient regularization term that encourages surface smoothness and hole filling while maintaining high frequency details. GO-Surf can optimize sequences of $1$-$2$K frames in $15$-$45$ minutes, a speedup of $\\times60$ over NeuralRGB-D, the most related approach based on an MLP representation, while maintaining on par performance on standard benchmarks.

DSP-SLAM takes as input the 3D point cloud reconstructed by a feature-based SLAM system and equips it with the ability to enhance its sparse map with dense reconstructions of detected objects. Objects are detected via semantic instance segmentation, and their shape and pose are estimated using category-specific deep shape embeddings as priors, via a novel second order optimization. Our object-aware bundle adjustment builds a pose-graph to jointly optimize camera poses, object locations and feature points. DSP-SLAM can operate at 10 frames per second on 3 different input modalities: monocular, stereo, or stereo+LiDAR. We demonstrate DSP-SLAM operating at almost frame rate on monocular-RGB sequences from the Friburg and Redwood-OS datasets, and on stereo+LiDAR sequences on the KITTI odometry dataset showing that it achieves high-quality full object reconstructions, even from partial observations, while maintaining a consistent global map. Our evaluation shows improvements in object pose and shape reconstruction with respect to recent deep prior-based reconstruction methods and reductions in camera tracking drift on the KITTI dataset.
