When data is given as a stream, streaming submodular optimization (SSO) techniques are desired. Existing SSO techniques can only apply to insertion-only streams where each element has an infinite lifespan, and sliding-window streams where each element has a same lifespan (i.e., window size). However, elements in some data streams may have arbitrary different lifespans, and this requires addressing SSO over streams with inhomogeneous-decays (SSO-ID). This work formulates the SSO-ID problem and presents three algorithms: BASIC-STREAMING is a basic streaming algorithm that achieves an (1/2 \u2212 \u025b) approximation factor; HISTAPPROX improves the efficiency significantly and achieves an (1/3 \u2212 \u025b) approximation factor; HISTSTREAMING is a streaming version of HISTAPPROX and uses heuristics to further improve the efficiency. Experiments conducted on real data demonstrate that HISTSTREAMING can find high quality solutions and is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the naive GREEDY algorithm."}}

The popularity of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) and location-based Internet services (e.g., Google Maps) facilitates the collection of users' locations over time. Despite recent efforts to predict users' attributes (e.g., age and gender) and social networks based on utilizing the rich location context knowledge (e.g., name, type, and description) of places of interest (e.g., restaurants and hotels) they checked-in on location-based online social networks such as Foursqure and Gowalla, little attention has been given to inferring attributes and social networks of mobile device users based on their spatiotemporal trajectories with less/no location context knowledge. In this paper we collect logs of thousands of mobile devices' network connections to wireless access points (APs) of two campuses, and investigate whether one can infer mobile device users' demographic attributes and social networks solely from their spatiotemporal AP-trajectories. We develop a tensor factorization based method Dinfer to infer mobile device users' demographic attributes from their AP-trajectories by leveraging prior knowledge, such as users' social networks. We also propose a novel method Sinfer to learn social networks between mobile device users by exploring patterns of their AP-trajectories, such as fine-grained co-occurrence events (e.g., co-coming, co-leaving, and co-presenting duration). Experimental results on real-word datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods."}}
