Algorithms based on multichannel linear prediction (MCLP) have been shown to be especially effective for blind speech dereverberation and numerous variants have been introduced in the literature. Most of these approaches can be derived from a common framework, where the MCLP problem for speech dereverberation is formulated as a weighted least squares problem that can be solved analytically. Since conventional batch MCLP-based dereverberation algorithms are not suitable for low-latency applications, a number of online variants based on the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm have been proposed. However, RLS-based approaches often suffer from numerical instability and their use in online systems can further be limited due to high computational complexity with a large number of channels or filter taps. In this paper, we aim to address the issues of numerical robustness and computational complexity. More specifically, we derive alternative online weighted least squares algorithms through Householder RLS and Householder least squares lattice (HLSL), which are numerically stable and retain the fast convergence capability of the RLS algorithm. Furthermore, we derive an angle-normalized variant of the HLSL algorithm and show that it is robust to speech cancellation for a wide range of forgetting factors and filter taps. Finally, we support our findings through experimental results and demonstrate numerical and algorithmic robustness, long-term stability, linear complexity in filter taps, low memory footprint, and effectiveness in speech recognition applications."}}

The relative merits of the four algorithms in terms of several objective measures, automatic speech recognition performance, robustness against noise, variations between simulated and recorded reverberant speech, computation time and latency are discussed. Experimental results show that all four algorithms are capable of providing benefits in reverberant environments even with moderate background noises. In addition, low complexity and latency indicate their potential for real-time applications."}}

In order to prevent overestimation of the undesired reverberant component, possibly leading to severe distortions of the output, we propose to use a statistical model for late reverberation to limit the power of the MCLP-based estimate. The resulting constrained optimization problem is solved by using the alternating direction method of multipliers, resulting in two variants of the dereverberation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed constraint increases the robustness with respect to parameter selection and improves the usability for dynamic scenarios in comparison to the unconstrained method."}}

Aiming at obtaining an output signal which better resembles a clean speech signal, we propose to extend the acoustic multi-channel equalization cost function with a penalty function which promotes sparsity of the output signal in the short-time Fourier transform domain. Two conventionally used sparsity-promoting penalty functions are investigated, i.e., the l <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> -norm and the l <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub> -norm, and the sparsity-promoting filters are iteratively computed using the alternating direction method of multipliers.

First, a minimum variance distortionless response beamformer with an online estimated noise coherence matrix is used to suppress noise and reverberation. The output of this beamformer is then processed by a single-channel spectral enhancement scheme, based on statistical room acoustics, minimum statistics, and temporal cepstrum smoothing, to suppress residual noise and reverberation. The evaluation is conducted using the REVERB challenge corpus, designed to evaluate speech enhancement algorithms in the presence of both reverberation and noise. The proposed system is evaluated using instrumental speech quality measures, the performance of an automatic speech recognition system, and a subjective evaluation of the speech quality based on a MUSHRA test. The performance achieved by beamforming, single-channel spectral enhancement, and their combination are compared, and experimental results show that the proposed system is effective in suppressing both reverberation and noise while improving the speech quality. The achieved improvements are particularly significant in conditions with high reverberation times."}}

It consists of recovering a tensor from a subset of its entries. The usual structural assumption on a tensor that makes the problem well posed is that the tensor has low rank in every mode. Several tensor completion methods based on minimization of nuclear norm, which is the closest convex approximation of rank, have been proposed recently, with applications mostly in image inpainting problems. It is often stated in these papers that methods based on Tucker factorization perform poorly when the true ranks are unknown. In this paper, we propose a simple algorithm for Tucker factorization of a tensor with missing data and its application to low- $$n$$ n -rank tensor completion. The algorithm is similar to previously proposed method for PARAFAC decomposition with missing data. We demonstrate in several numerical experiments that the proposed algorithm performs well even when the ranks are significantly overestimated. Approximate reconstruction can be obtained when the ranks are underestimated. The algorithm outperforms nuclear norm minimization methods when the fraction of known elements of a tensor is low."}}

In this paper, we focus on a class of blind batch methods for speech dereverberation in a noiseless scenario with a single source, which are based on multi-channel linear prediction in the short-time Fourier transform domain. Dereverberation is performed by maximum-likelihood estimation of the model parameters that are subsequently used to recover the desired speech signal. Contrary to the conventional method, we propose to model the desired speech signal using a general sparse prior that can be represented in a convex form as a maximization over scaled complex Gaussian distributions. The proposed model can be interpreted as a generalization of the commonly used time-varying Gaussian model. Furthermore, we reformulate both the conventional and the proposed method as an optimization problem with an lp-norm cost function, emphasizing the role of sparsity in the considered speech dereverberation methods. Experimental evaluation in different acoustic scenarios show that the proposed approach results in an improved performance compared to the conventional approach in terms of instrumental measures for speech quality."}}

Aiming to achieve multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) speech dereverberation in a blind manner, we propose a cost function based on the concept of group sparsity. To minimize the obtained nonconvex function, an iteratively reweighted least-squares procedure is used. Moreover, it can be shown that the derived algorithm generalizes several existing speech dereverberation algorithms. Experimental results for several acoustic systems demonstrate the effectiveness of nonconvex sparsity-promoting cost functions in the context of dereverberation."}}

In this paper we focus on a blind speech dereverberation method based on multi-channel linear prediction (MCLP) in the short-time Fourier transform domain, which is typically performed in each frequency bin independently without taking into account the spectral structure of the speech signal. Since it is widely accepted that a speech spectrogram can be well approximated with a low-rank matrix, e.g., using a spectral dictionary, in this paper we propose to incorporate a low-rank matrix approximation of the speech spectrogram into the MCLP-based speech dereverberation. The low-rank approximation is obtained using nonnegative matrix factorization with Itakura-Saito divergence. Experimental results for several measured acoustic systems show that incorporating a low-rank approximation improves the dereverberation performance in terms of instrumental speech quality measures."}}
