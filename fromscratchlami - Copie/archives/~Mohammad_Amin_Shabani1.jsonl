In this paper, we propose a general multi-scale framework that can be applied to state-of-the-art transformer-based time series forecasting models\n(FEDformer, Autoformer, etc.). Using iteratively refining a forecasted time series at multiple scales with shared weights, architecture adaptations and a specially-designed normalization scheme, we are able to achieve significant performance improvements with minimal additional computational overhead. Via detailed ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed architectural and methodological innovations. Furthermore, our experiments on various public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the corresponding baselines. Depending on the choice of transformer architecture, our mutli-scale framework results in mean squared error reductions ranging from 5.5% to 38.5%. Our code is publicly available in https://github.com/BorealisAI/scaleformer."}}

The proposed method exploits multiple datasets with different labels for different-but-related tasks such as simultaneous age, gender, race, facial expression estimation. Specifically, when there are only a few well-labeled data for a specific task among the multiple related ones, we exploit the labels of other related tasks in different domains. Our approach is composed of (1) a new MTL method which can deal with weakly labeled datasets and perform several tasks simultaneously, and (2) an MTL-based data distillation framework which enables network generalization for the training and test data from different domains. Experiments show that the proposed multi-task system performs each task better than the baseline single task. It is also demonstrated that using different domain datasets along with the main dataset can enhance network generalization and overcome the domain differences between datasets. Also, comparing data distillation both on the baseline and MTL framework, the latter shows more accurate predictions on unlabeled data from different domains. Furthermore, by proposing a new learning-rate optimization method, our proposed network is able to dynamically tune its learning rate."}}

A graph G is said to have property M(k) if it is not uniquely k-list colorable. Mahmoodian and Mahdian (Ars Comb 51:295\u2013305, 1999) characterized all graphs with property M(2). For $$k\\ge 3$$ k \u2265 3 property M(k) has been studied only for multipartite graphs. Here we find bounds on M(k) for graphs embedded on surfaces, and obtain new results on planar graphs. We begin a general study of bounds on M(k) for regular graphs, as well as for graphs with varying list sizes."}}
