To impose the learned DNN dynamical models with key physical properties such as conservation laws, this paper proposes a two-step approach to endow the invariant priors into the simulations. We first establish a contrastive learning framework to capture the system invariants along the trajectory observations. During the dynamics modeling, we design a projection layer of DNNs to preserve the system invariance. Through experiments, we show our method consistently outperforms the baseline in both coordinate error and conservation metrics and can be further extended to complex and large dynamics by leveraging autoencoder. Notably, a byproduct of our framework is the automated conservation law discovery for dynamical systems with single conservation property. "}}

However, these certification based methods treat all the examples equally regardless of their vulnerability and true adversarial distribution, limiting the model's potential in achieving optimal verifiable accuracy. In the paper, we propose new methods to include the customized weight distribution and automatic schedule tuning methods on the perturbation schedule. These methods are generally applicable to all the verification-based robust training with almost no additional computational cost. Our results show improvement on MNIST with $\\epsilon = 0.3$ and CIFAR on $\\epsilon = 8/255$ for both IBP and CROWN-IBP based methods. "}}

To address this issue, we propose RADIAL-RL, a principled framework to train reinforcement learning agents with improved robustness against $l_p$-norm bounded adversarial attacks. Our framework is compatible with popular deep reinforcement learning algorithms and we demonstrate its performance with deep Q-learning, A3C and PPO. We experiment on three deep RL benchmarks (Atari, MuJoCo and ProcGen) to show the effectiveness of our robust training algorithm. Our RADIAL-RL agents consistently outperform prior methods when tested against attacks of varying strength and are more computationally efficient to train. In addition, we propose a new evaluation method called Greedy-Worst-Case Reward (GWC) to measure attack agnostic robustness of deep RL agents. We show that GWC can be evaluated efficiently and is a good estimate of the reward under the worst possible sequence of adversarial attacks. All code used for our experiments is available at https://github.com/tuomaso/radial_rl_v2."}}
