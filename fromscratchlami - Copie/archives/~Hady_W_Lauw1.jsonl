Given an image, visual sentiment analysis aims at recognizing positive or negative sentiment, and occasionally neutral sentiment as well. A nascent yet promising direction is Transformer-based models applied to image data, whereby Vision Transformer (ViT) establishes remarkable performance on large-scale vision benchmarks. In addition to investigating the fitness of ViT for visual sentiment analysis, we further incorporate concept orientation into the self-attention mechanism, which is the core component of Transformer. The proposed model captures the relationships between image features and specific concepts. We conduct extensive experiments on Visual Sentiment Ontology (VSO) and Yelp.com online review datasets, showing that not only does the proposed model significantly improve upon the base model ViT in detecting visual sentiment but it also outperforms previous visual sentiment analysis models with narrowly-defined orientations. Additional analyses yield insightful results and better understanding of the concept-oriented self-attention mechanism."}}

However, resolving which product in one language corresponds to another product in a different language remains an under-explored problem. We explore this from two perspectives. First, given two products of different languages, how to assess their similarity that could signal a potential match. Second, given products from various languages, how to arrive at a multi-partite clustering that respects cardinality constraints efficiently. We describe algorithms for each perspective and integrate them into a promising solution validated on real-world datasets."}}

Exploring hidden topics within documents and discovering key words associated with each topic allow us to develop a semantic interpretation of the corpus. Moreover, documents are usually associated with authors. For example, news reports have journalists specializing in writing certain type of events, academic papers have authors with expertise in certain research topics, etc. Modeling authorship information could benefit topic modeling, since documents by the same authors tend to reveal similar semantics. This observation also holds for documents published on the same venues. However, most topic models ignore the auxiliary authorship and publication venues. Given above two challenges, we propose a Variational Graph Author Topic Model for documents to integrate both semantic interpretability and authorship and venue modeling into a unified VGAE framework. For authorship and venue modeling, we construct a hierarchical multi-layered document graph with both intra- and cross-layer topic propagation. For semantic interpretability, three word relations (contextual, syntactic, semantic) are modeled and constitute three word sub-layers in the document graph. We further propose three alternatives for variational divergence. Experiments verify the effectiveness of our model on supervised and unsupervised tasks."}}

While typically a corpus contains documents of variable lengths, most previous topic models treat documents of different lengths uniformly, assuming that each document is sufficiently informative. However, shorter documents may have only a few word co-occurrences, resulting in inferior topic quality.  Some other previous works assume that all documents are short, and leverage external auxiliary data, e.g., pretrained word embeddings and document connectivity. Orthogonal to existing works, we remedy this problem within the corpus itself by proposing a Meta-Complement Topic Model, which improves topic quality of short texts by transferring the semantic knowledge learned on long documents to complement semantically limited short texts. As a self-contained module, our framework is agnostic to auxiliary data and can be further improved by flexibly integrating them into our framework. Specifically, when incorporating document connectivity, we further extend our framework to complement documents with limited edges. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of our framework.\n"}}

These recommendation captions are usually manually crafted and generic in nature, making it difficult to attach meaningful and informative names at scale. As a result, the captions are inadequate in helping customers to better understand the connection between the multiple recommendations and make faster product discovery. We propose an Adaptive Multiple-Product Summarization framework (AmpSum) that automatically and adaptively generates widget captions based on different recommended products. The multiplicity of products to be summarized in a widget caption is particularly novel. The lack of well-developed labels motivates us to design a weakly supervised learning approach with distant supervision to bootstrap the model learning from pseudo labels, and then fine-tune the model with a small amount of manual labels. To validate the efficacy of this method, we conduct extensive experiments on several product categories of Amazon data. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines over 9.47-29.14% on ROUGE and 27.31% on METEOR. With case studies, we illustrate how AmpSum could adaptively generate summarization based on different product recommendations."}}

For instance, we encounter these in the form of hashtags on Instagram, galleries on Flickr, or boards on Pinterest. The selection and coherence of such user-curated visual clusters arise from a user's preference for a certain type of content as well as her own perception of which images are similar and thus belong to a cluster. We seek to model such curation behaviors towards supporting users in their future activities such as expanding existing clusters or discovering new clusters altogether. This paper proposes a framework, namely COLLABORATIVE CURATING that jointly models the interrelated modalities of preference expression and similarity perception. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets from a visual curating platform show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms baselines focusing on either clustering behaviors or preferences alone."}}

Oftentimes, a user's interactions with items are influenced by several hidden factors. To better uncover these hidden factors, we seek disentangled representations. Existing disentanglement methods for recommendations are mainly concerned with user-item interactions alone. To further improve not only the effectiveness of recommendations but also the interpretability of the representations, we propose to learn a second set of disentangled user representations from textual content and to align the two sets of representations with one another. The purpose of this coupling is two-fold. For one benefit, we leverage textual content to resolve sparsity of user-item interactions, leading to higher recommendation accuracy. For another benefit, by regularizing factors learned from user-item interactions with factors learned from textual content, we map uninterpretable dimensions from user representation into words. An attention-based alignment is introduced to align and enrich hidden factors representations. A series of experiments conducted on four real-world datasets show the efficacy of our methods in improving recommendation quality."}}

Given that groups of people can perform many real-world activities (e.g., a group of people attending a conference looking for a place to dine), the need for recommendations for groups has increased. A wide range of Group Recommender Systems (GRecSys) has been developed to aggregate individual preferences to group preferences. We analyze 175 studies related to GRecSys. Previous works evaluate their systems using different types of groups (sizes and cohesiveness), and most of such works focus on testing their systems using only one type of item, called Experience Goods (EG). As a consequence, it is hard to get consistent conclusions about the performance of GRecSys. We present the aggregation strategies and aggregation functions that GRecSys commonly use to aggregate group members\u2019 preferences. This study experimentally compares the performance (i.e., accuracy, ranking quality, and usefulness) using four metrics (Hit Ratio, Normalize Discounted Cumulative Gain, Diversity, and Coverage) of eight representative RecSys for group recommendations on ephemeral groups. Moreover, we use two different aggregation strategies, 10 different aggregation functions, and two different types of items on two types of datasets (EG and Search Goods (SG)) containing real-life datasets. The results show that the evaluation of GRecSys needs to use both EG and SG types of data, because the different characteristics of datasets lead to different performance. GRecSys using Singular Value Decomposition or Neural Collaborative Filtering methods work better than others. It is observed that the Average aggregation function is the one that produces better results."}}
