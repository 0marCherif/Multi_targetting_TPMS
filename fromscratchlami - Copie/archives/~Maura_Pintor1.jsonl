In this paper, we re-evaluate such methods through the lens of different metrics that characterize the augmented manifold, finding contradictory evidence. Our extensive empirical analysis involving 5 data augmentation methods, all tested with an increasing probability of augmentation, shows that: (i) novel data augmentation methods proposed to improve adversarial robustness only improve it when combined with classical augmentations (like image flipping and rotation), and even worsen adversarial robustness if used in isolation; and (ii) adversarial robustness is significantly affected by the augmentation probability, conversely to what is claimed in recent work. We conclude by discussing how to rethink the development and evaluation of novel data augmentation methods for adversarial robustness."}}

Many defenses have been shown to provide a false sense of robustness by causing gradient-based attacks to fail, and they have been broken under more rigorous evaluations.\nAlthough guidelines and best practices have been suggested to improve current adversarial robustness evaluations, the lack of automatic testing and debugging tools makes it difficult to apply these recommendations in a systematic manner.\nIn this work, we overcome these limitations by: (i) categorizing   attack failures based on how they affect the optimization of gradient-based attacks, while also  unveiling two novel failures affecting many popular attack implementations and past evaluations;\n (ii) proposing six novel \\emph{indicators of failure}, to automatically detect the presence of such failures in the attack optimization process; and (iii) suggesting a systematic protocol to apply the corresponding fixes. \nOur extensive experimental analysis, involving more than 15 models in 3 distinct application domains, shows that our indicators of failure can be used to debug and improve current adversarial robustness evaluations, thereby providing a first concrete step towards automatizing and systematizing them.

However, their optimization is computationally demanding, and requires careful hyperparameter tuning, potentially leading to suboptimal robustness evaluations. To overcome these issues, we propose ImageNet-Patch, a dataset to benchmark machine-learning models against adversarial patches. It consists of a set of patches, optimized to generalize across different models, and readily applicable to ImageNet data after preprocessing them with affine transformations. This process enables an approximate yet faster robustness evaluation, leveraging the transferability of adversarial perturbations. We showcase the usefulness of this dataset by testing the effectiveness of the computed patches against 127 models. We conclude by discussing how our dataset could be used as a benchmark for robustness, and how our methodology can be generalized to other domains. We open source our dataset and evaluation code at https://github.com/pralab/ImageNet-Patch."}}
