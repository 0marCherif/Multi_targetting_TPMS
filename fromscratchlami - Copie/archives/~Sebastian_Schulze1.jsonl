We propose a Bayesian Quadrature scheme to make this marginalisation more efficient and thereby more practical.

Kernel samples are selected by generalising an information-theoretic acquisition function for warped Bayesian Quadrature. We show that our framework achieves more accurate predictions with better calibrated uncertainty than state-of-the-art baselines, especially when given limited (wall-clock) time budgets."}}

A Bayes-optimal policy, which does so optimally, conditions its actions not only on the environment state but also on the agent's uncertainty about the environment. Computing a Bayes-optimal policy is however intractable for all but the smallest tasks. In this paper, we introduce variational Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL (variBAD), a way to meta-learn approximately Bayes-optimal policies for complex tasks. VariBAD simultaneously meta-learns a variational auto-encoder to perform approximate inference, and a policy that incorporates task uncertainty directly during action selection by conditioning on both the environment state and the approximate belief. In two toy domains, we illustrate how variBAD performs structured online exploration as a function of task uncertainty. We further evaluate variBAD on MuJoCo tasks widely used in meta-RL and show that it achieves higher online return than existing methods. On the recently proposed Meta-World ML1 benchmark, variBAD achieves state of the art results by a large margin, fully solving two out of the three ML1 tasks for the first time."}}

Traditional tuning algorithms only consider the final performance of hyperparameters acquired after many expensive iterations and ignore intermediate information from earlier training steps. In this paper, we present a Bayesian optimization(BO) approach which exploits the iterative structure of learning algorithms for efficient hyperparameter tuning. We propose to learn an evaluation function compressing learning progress at any stage of the training process into a single numeric score according to both training success and stability. Our BO framework is then trade-off the benefit of assessing a hyperparameter setting over additional training steps against their computation cost. We further increase model efficiency by selectively including scores from different training steps for any evaluated hyperparameter set. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by tuning hyperparameters for the training of deep reinforcement learning agents and convolutional neural networks.
