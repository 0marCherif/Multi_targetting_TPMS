We focus on a specific class of point processes called the Hawkes process. We begin by pointing out that most of the existing sparse causal learning algorithms for the Hawkes process suffer from a singularity in maximum likelihood estimation. As a result, their sparse solutions can appear only as numerical artifacts. In this paper, we propose a mathematically well-defined sparse causal learning framework based on a cardinality-regularized Hawkes process, which remedies the pathological issues of existing approaches. We leverage the proposed algorithm for the task of instance-wise causal event analysis, where sparsity plays a critical role. We validate the proposed framework with two real use-cases, one from the power grid and the other from the cloud data center management domain. "}}

As such, we propose a decentralized machine learning framework that is carefully designed to respect the values of democracy, diversity, and privacy. Specifically, we propose a federated multi-task learning framework that integrates a privacy-preserving dynamic consensus algorithm. We show that a specific network topology called the expander graph dramatically improves the scalability of global consensus building. We conclude the paper by making some remarks on open problems."}}

When using a black-box model, such as one to predict building energy consumption from many sensor measurements, we often have a situation where some observed samples may significantly deviate from their prediction. It may be due to a sub-optimal black-box model, or simply because those samples are outliers. In either case, one would ideally want to compute a responsibility score indicative of the extent to which an input variable is responsible for the anomalous output. In this work, we formalize this task as a statistical inverse problem: Given model deviation from the expected value, infer the responsibility score of each of the input variables. We propose a new method called likelihood compensation (LC), which is founded on the likelihood principle and computes a correction to each input variable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first principled framework that computes a responsibility score for real valued anomalous model deviations. We apply our approach to a real-world building energy prediction task and confirm its utility based on expert feedback."}}

Major application scenarios include collaborative anomaly detection among distributed industrial assets owned by different companies competing with each other. Of critical importance here is to achieve two conflicting goals at once: data privacy and collaboration. To this end, we propose a new framework for collaborative dictionary learning. By using a mixture of the exponential family, we show that collaborative learning can be nicely separated into three steps: local updates, global consensus, and optimization. For the critical step of consensus building, we propose a new algorithm that does not rely on expensive encryption-based multi-party computation. Our theoretical and experimental analysis shows that our method is several orders of magnitude faster than the alternative."}}
