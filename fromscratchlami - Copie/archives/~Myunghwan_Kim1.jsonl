In many cases, it is important to evaluate whether information is spreading fairly to all groups in a network. For instance, are male and female students equally likely to hear about a new scholarship? In this paper, we present the information unfairness criterion, which measures whether information spreads fairly to all groups in a network. We perform a thorough case study on the DBLP computer science co-authorship network with respect to gender. We then propose MaxFair, an algorithm to add edges to a network to decrease information unfairness, and evaluate on several real-world network datasets."}}

Ideal edge semantics should not only show that two users are connected, but also why they know each other and what they share in common. However, relations in social networks are often hard to pro le, due to noisy multi-modal signals and limited user-generated ground-truth labels. In this work, we aim to develop a uni ed and principled frame- work that can pro le user relations as edge semantics in social networks by integrating multi-modal signals in the presence of noisy and incomplete data. Our framework is also exible towards limited or missing supervision. Speci cally, we assume a latent distribution of multiple relations underlying each user link, and learn them with multi-modal graph edge variational autoencoders. We encode the network data with a graph convolutional network, and decode arbitrary signals with multiple reconstruction networks. Extensive experiments and case studies on two public DBLP author networks and two internal LinkedIn member networks demonstrate the superior e ectiveness and e ciency of our proposed model."}}

Hypernymy, also known as is-a relation or subclass-of relation, lays in the core of many knowledge graphs and benefits many downstream applications. Existing methods of hypernymy discovery either leverage textual patterns to extract explicitly mentioned hypernym-hyponym pairs, or learn a distributional representation for each term of interest based its context. These approaches rely on statistical signals from the textual corpus, and their effectiveness would therefore be hindered when the signals from the corpus are not sufficient for all terms of interest. In this work, we propose to discover hypernymy in text-rich HINs, which can introduce additional high-quality signals. We develop a new framework, named HyperMine, that exploits multi-granular contexts and combines signals from both text and network without human labeled data. HyperMine extends the definition of \"context\" to the scenario of text-rich HIN. For example, we can define typed nodes and communities as contexts. These contexts encode signals of different granularities and we feed them into a hypernymy inference model. HyperMine learns this model using weak supervision acquired based on high-precision textual patterns. Extensive experiments on two large real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HyperMine and the utility of modeling context granularity. We further show a case study that a high-quality taxonomy can be generated solely based on the hypernymy discovered by HyperMine."}}

As large-scale graphs are ubiquitous, ranging from web graphs to online social networks, compactly representing graphs becomes important to efficiently store and process them. Given a graph, graph summarization aims to find its compact representation consisting of (a) a summary graph where the nodes are disjoint sets of nodes in the input graph, and each edge indicates the edges between all pairs of nodes in the two sets; and (b) edge corrections for restoring the input graph from the summary graph exactly or within error bounds. Although graph summarization is a widely-used graph-compression technique readily combinable with other techniques, existing algorithms for graph summarization are not satisfactory in terms of speed or compactness of outputs. More importantly, they assume that the input graph is small enough to fit in main memory. In this work, we propose SWeG, a fast parallel algorithm for summarizing graphs with compact representations. SWeG is designed for not only shared-memory but also MapReduce settings to summarize graphs that are too large to fit in main memory. We demonstrate that SWeG is (a) Fast: SWeG is up to 5400 \u00d7 faster than its competitors that give similarly compact representations, (b) Scalable: SWeG scales to graphs with tens of billions of edges, and (c) Compact: combined with state-of-the-art compression methods, SWeG achieves up to 3.4 \u00d7 better compression than them."}}

Studying the following questions will help establishing business strategies leading to their success: How do the behaviors of users in a web service evolve over time? To reach a certain engagement level, what are the common stages that many users go through? How can we represent the stage that each individual user lies in? To answer these questions, we propose a behavior model that discovers the progressions of users' behaviors from a given starting point - such as a new subscription or first experience of certain features - to a particular target stage such as a predefined engagement level of interest. Under our model, transitions over stages represent progression of users where each stage in our model is characterized by probability distributions over types of actions, frequencies of actions, and next stages to move. Each user performs actions and moves to a next stage following the probability distributions characterizing the current stage. We also develop a fast and memory-efficient algorithm that fits our model to trillions of behavioral logs. Our algorithm scales linearly with the size of data. Especially, its distributed version implemented in the MapReduce framework successfully handles petabyte-scale data with one trillion actions. Lastly, we show the effectiveness of our model and algorithm by applying them to real-world data from LinkedIn. We discover meaningful stages that LinkedIn users go through leading to predefined target goals. In addition, our trained models are shown to be useful for downstream tasks such as prediction of future actions."}}

We observe that the initial state of ego-network growth in a newly joined company shows strong correlations with the future status in the company -- such as network size, network diversity, and retention. We also present some key patterns that demonstrate the importance of the first few connections in the new company as well as how they lead to the phenomena we observed."}}

These users and relationships can be naturally represented as a dynamic multi-view network, which is a set of weighted graphs with shared common nodes but having their own respective edges. Different network views, representing structural relationship and interaction types, could have very distinctive properties individually and these properties may change due to interplay across views. Therefore, it is of interest to study how multiple views interact and affect network dynamics and, in addition, explore possible applications to social networking. In this paper, we propose approaches to capture and analyze multi-view network dynamics from various aspects. Through our proposed descriptors, we observe the synergy and cannibalization between different user groups and network views from LinkedIn dataset. We then develop models that consider the synergy and cannibalization per new relationship, and show the outperforming predictive capability of our models compared to baseline models. Finally, the proposed models allow us to understand the interplay among different views where they dynamically change over time."}}

We find that a social network model with nodes and links sampled from an $m$-dimensional metric space with power-law distributed influence regions best fits samples from real-world networks when $m$ scales logarithmically with the number of nodes of the network. This supports a logarithmic dimension hypothesis, and we provide evidence with two different social networks, Facebook and LinkedIn. Further, we employ two different methods for confirming the hypothesis: the first uses the distribution of motif counts, and the second exploits the eigenvalue distribution."}}

Here, services are specialized for a certain task, run on multiple machines, and communicate with each other to serve a user's request. An anomalous change in a metric of one service can propagate to other services during this communication, resulting in overall degradation of the request. As any such degradation is revenue impacting, maintaining correct functionality is of paramount concern: it is important to find the root cause of any anomaly as quickly as possible. This is challenging because there are numerous metrics or sensors for a given service, and a modern website is usually composed of hundreds of services running on thousands of machines in multiple data centers. This paper introduces MonitorRank, an algorithm that can reduce the time, domain knowledge, and human effort required to find the root causes of anomalies in such service-oriented architectures. In the event of an anomaly, MonitorRank provides a ranked order list of possible root causes for monitoring teams to investigate. MonitorRank uses the historical and current time-series metrics of each sensor as its input, along with the call graph generated between sensors to build an unsupervised model for ranking. Experiments on real production outage data from LinkedIn, one of the largest online social networks, shows a 26% to 51% improvement in mean average precision in finding root causes compared to baseline and current state-of-the-art methods."}}

A fundamental problem in the analysis of time-varying network data is to extract a summary of the common structure and the dynamics of underlying relations between entities. Here we build on the intuition that changes in the network structure are driven by the dynamics at the level of groups of nodes. We propose a nonparametric multi-group membership model for dynamic networks. Our model contains three main components. We model the birth and death of groups with respect to the dynamics of the network structure via a distance dependent Indian Buffet Process. We capture the evolution of individual node group memberships via a Factorial Hidden Markov model. And, we explain the dynamics of the network structure by explicitly modeling the connectivity structure. We demonstrate our model\u2019s capability of identifying the dynamics of latent groups in a number of different types of network data. Experimental results show our model achieves higher predictive performance on the future network forecasting and missing link prediction."}}
