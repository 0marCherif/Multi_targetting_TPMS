However, it has brought a fundamental issue of larger memory consumption at deployment time. Furthermore, this results in significant inference speed degradation at auto-regressive decoding steps due to the increased memory transfers. In this paper, we propose a simple weight-only quantization method using ultra low-bit such as 2-bit, 3-bit and 4-bits to effectively mitigate the increased memory and latency issues of MoE models. We show that low-bit quantization together with the MoE architecture delivers a reliable model performance while reducing the memory size significantly even without any additional training. Especially, expert layers in MoE models are much more robust to the quantization than conventional feedforward networks (FFN) layers. In our comprehensive analysis, we show that MoE models with 2-bit and 80\\% sparse expert weights can deliver better model performance than the dense model trained on the same dataset. We present how quantization of different parts of models affects the performance with various experiments using a large MoE model (5.3 B). As a result of low-bit quantization, we show the model size can be reduced by 4.9X smaller than the original half precision floating point (fp16) MoE model. This cuts down the model size of 5.3B parameters from 8.4x of the dense model to only 1.7x of the dense model after 2-bit quantization. It still preserves 1.88\\% higher accuracy than the dense model. Combined with an optimized GPU runtime implementation, it also achieves 2.7X speed-up which is even slightly faster than the FLOPs equivalent dense model."}}

However, SAMs are reported to be parameter inefficient such that larger models do not always lead to better performance. While most on-going research focuses on improving SAMs models by exploring methods of routing inputs to experts, our analysis reveals that such research might not lead to the solution we expect, i.e., the commonly-used routing methods based on gating mechanisms do not work better than randomly routing inputs to experts. In this paper, we propose a new expert-based model, THOR ($\\underline{\\textbf{T}}$ransformer wit$\\underline{\\textbf{H}}$ St$\\underline{\\textbf{O}}$chastic Expe$\\underline{\\textbf{R}}$ts). Unlike classic expert-based models, such as the Switch Transformer, experts in THOR are randomly activated for each input during training and inference. THOR models are trained using a consistency regularized loss, where experts learn not only from training data but also from other experts as teachers, such that all the experts make consistent predictions.  We validate the effectiveness of THOR on machine translation tasks. Results show that THOR models are more parameter efficient in that they significantly outperform the Transformer and MoE models across various settings. For example, in multilingual translation, THOR outperforms the Switch Transformer by 2 BLEU scores, and obtains the same BLEU score as that of a state-of-the-art MoE model that is 18 times larger.

However, this is not the case for most languages especially low-resource ones with insufficient annotated training data. Cross-lingual transfer learning methods improve the performance on a low-resource target language by leveraging labeled data from other (source) languages, typically with the help of cross-lingual resources such as parallel corpora. In this work, we propose a zero-resource multilingual transfer learning model that can utilize training data in multiple source languages, while not requiring target language training data nor cross-lingual supervision. Unlike most existing methods that only rely on language-invariant features for cross-lingual transfer, our approach utilizes both language-invariant and language-specific features in a coherent way. Our model leverages adversarial networks to learn language-invariant features and mixture-of-experts models to dynamically exploit the relation between the target language and each individual source language. This enables our model to learn effectively what to share between various languages in the multilingual setup. It results in significant performance gains over prior art, as shown in an extensive set of experiments over multiple text classification and sequence tagging tasks including a large-scale real-world industry dataset."}}

Our proposed approach utilizes a transfer-learning approach to share lexical and sentences level representations across multiple source languages into one target language. The lexical part is shared through a Universal Lexical Representation to support multi-lingual word-level sharing. The sentence-level sharing is represented by a model of experts from all source languages that share the source encoders with all other languages. This enables the low-resource language to utilize the lexical and sentence representations of the higher resource languages. Our approach is able to achieve 23 BLEU on Romanian-English WMT2016 using a tiny parallel corpus of 6k sentences, compared to the 18 BLEU of strong baseline system which uses multi-lingual training and back-translation."}}

Previous work attacked this problem by inducing new translation rules from monolingual data with a semi-supervised algorithm. However, this approach does not scale very well since it is very computationally expensive to generate new translation rules for only a few thousand sentences. We propose a much faster and simpler method that directly hallucinates translation rules for infrequent phrases based on phrases with similar continuous representations for which a translation is known. To speed up the retrieval of similar phrases, we investigate approximated nearest neighbor search with redundant bit vectors which we find to be three times faster and significantly more accurate than locality sensitive hashing. Our approach of learning new translation rules improves a phrase-based baseline by up to 1.6 BLEU on Arabic-English translation, it is three-orders of magnitudes faster than existing semi-supervised methods and 0.5 BLEU more accurate."}}

In this work, we present a semi-supervised graph-based approach for generating new translation rules that leverages bilingual and monolingual data. The proposed technique first constructs phrase graphs using both source and target language monolingual corpora. Next, graph propagation identifies translations of phrases that were not observed in the bilingual corpus, assuming that similar phrases have similar translations. We report results on a large Arabic-English system and a medium-sized Urdu-English system. Our proposed approach significantly improves the performance of competitive phrasebased systems, leading to consistent improvements between 1 and 4 BLEU points on standard evaluation sets."}}

The decoders accompanying these extensions typically exceed quadratic time complexity.\r\n\r\nThis paper extends the Direct Translation Model 2 (DTM2) with syntax while maintaining linear-time decoding. We employ a linear-time parsing algorithm based on an eager, incremental interpretation of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). As every input word is processed, the local parsing decisions resolve ambiguity eagerly, by selecting a single supertag-operator pair for extending the dependency parse incrementally. Alongside translation features extracted from the derived parse tree, we explore syntactic features extracted from the incremental derivation process. Our empirical experiments show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the art DTM2 system."}}

In this work we show that incorporating lexical syntactic descriptions in the form of supertags can yield significantly better PBSMT systems. We describe a novel PBSMT model that integrates supertags into the target language model and the target side of the translation model. Two kinds of supertags are employed: those from Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar and Combinatory Categorial Grammar. Despite the differences between these two approaches, the supertaggers give similar improvements. In addition to supertagging, we also explore the utility of a surface global grammaticality measure based on combinatory operators. We perform various experiments on the Arabic to English NIST 2005 test set addressing issues such as sparseness, scalability and the utility of system subcomponents. Our best result (0.4688 BLEU) improves by 6.1% relative to a state-of-theart PBSMT model, which compares very favourably with the leading systems on the NIST 2005 task."}}

The proposed approach has been used to acquire extraction patterns for the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC) task. ACE RDC is considered a hard task in information extraction due to the absence of large amounts of training data and inconsistencies in the available data.
