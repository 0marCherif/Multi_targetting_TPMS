The amount of power required to operate such massive computing machines has been steadily increasing, earning HPC users a higher than usual carbon footprint. While the problem is well known in academia, the exact energy requirements of hardware, software and how to optimize it are hard to quantify. To tackle this issue, we need tools to understand the software and its relationship with power consumption in today\u2019s high performance computers. With that in mind, we present perun, a Python package and command line interface to measure energy consumption based on hardware performance counters and selected physical measurement sensors. This enables accurate energy measurements on various scales of computing, from a single laptop to an MPI-distributed HPC application. We include an analysis of the discrepancies between these sensor readings and hardware performance counters, with particular focus on the power draw of the usually overlooked non-compute components such as memory. One of our major insights is their significant share of the total energy consumption. We have equally analyzed the runtime and energy overhead perun\u00a0generates when monitoring common HPC applications, and found it to be minimal. Finally, an analysis on the accuracy of different measuring methodologies when applied at large scales is presented."}}

This paper proposes an alternative approach to solve two core issues, i.e., weight transport and update locking, for biological plausibility and computational efficiency. We introduce Feed-Forward with delayed Feedback (F$^3$), which improves upon prior work by utilizing delayed error information as a sample-wise scaling factor to approximate gradients more accurately. We find that F$^3$ reduces the gap in predictive performance between biologically plausible training algorithms and backpropagation by up to 96%. This demonstrates the applicability of biologically plausible training and opens up promising new avenues for low-energy training and parallelization."}}

To address the exponential rise in training time, users are turning to data parallel neural networks (DPNN) and large-scale distributed resources on computer clusters. Current DPNN approaches implement the network parameter updates by synchronizing and averaging gradients across all processes with blocking communication operations after each forward-backward pass. This synchronization is the central algorithmic bottleneck. We introduce the distributed asynchronous and selective optimization (DASO) method, which leverages multi-GPU compute node architectures to accelerate network training while maintaining accuracy. DASO uses a hierarchical and asynchronous communication scheme comprised of node-local and global networks while adjusting the global synchronization rate during the learning process. We show that DASO yields a reduction in training time of up to 34% on classical and state-of-the-art networks, as compared to current optimized data parallel training methods."}}

This compact formulation is equivalent to the adjacency matrix, but enables learning a tree's structure from its leaves alone without the prior assumptions required if using the adjacency matrix directly. Employing the LCAG therefore enables the first end-to-end trainable solution which learns the hierarchical structure of varying tree sizes directly, using only the terminal tree leaves to do so. In the case of high-energy particle physics, a particle decay forms a hierarchical tree structure of which only the final products can be observed experimentally, and the large combinatorial space of possible trees makes an analytic solution intractable. We demonstrate the use of the LCAG as a target in the task of predicting simulated particle physics decay structures using both a Transformer encoder and a Neural Relational Inference encoder Graph Neural Network. With this approach, we are able to correctly predict the LCAG purely from leaf features for a maximum tree-depth of $8$ in $92.5\\%$ of cases for trees up to $6$ leaves (including) and $59.7\\%$ for trees up to $10$ in our simulated dataset."}}

The need for higher compute power is being met with increasingly more potent accelerators and the use of large compute clusters. However, the gain in prediction accuracy from large models trained on distributed and accelerated systems comes at the price of a substantial increase in energy demand, and researchers have started questioning the environmental friendliness of such AI methods at scale. Consequently, energy efficiency plays an important role for AI model developers and infrastructure operators alike. The energy consumption of AI workloads depends on the model implementation and the utilized hardware. Therefore, accurate measurements of the power draw of AI workflows on different types of compute nodes is key to algorithmic improvements and the design of future compute clusters and hardware. To this end, we present measurements of the energy consumption of two typical applications of deep learning models on different types of compute nodes. Our results indicate that 1. deriving energy consumption directly from runtime is not accurate, but the consumption of the compute node needs to be considered regarding its composition; 2. neglecting accelerator hardware on mixed nodes results in overproportional inefficiency regarding energy consumption; 3. energy consumption of model training and inference should be considered separately - while training on GPUs outperforms all other node types regarding both runtime and energy consumption, inference on CPU nodes can be comparably efficient. One advantage of our approach is that the information on energy consumption is available to all users of the supercomputer, enabling an easy transfer to other workloads alongside a raise in user-awareness of energy consumption."}}

Therefore, Hyperspectral denoising is a crucial step for analyzing hyperspectral images (HSIs). Conventional computational methods rarely use GPUs to improve efficiency and are not fully open-source. Alternatively, deep learning-based methods are often open-source and use GPUs, but their training and utilization for real-world applications remain non-trivial for many researchers. Consequently, we propose HyDe: the first open-source, GPU-accelerated Python-based, hyperspectral image denoising toolbox, which aims to provide a large set of methods with an easy-to-use environment. HyDe includes a variety of methods ranging from low-rank wavelet-based methods to deep neural network (DNN) models. HyDe's interface dramatically improves the interoperability of these methods and the performance of the underlying functions. In fact, these methods maintain similar HSI denoising performance to their original implementations while consuming nearly ten times less energy. Furthermore, we present a method for training DNNs for denoising HSIs which are not spatially related to the training dataset, i.e., training on ground-level HSIs for denoising HSIs with other perspectives including airborne, drone-borne, and space-borne. To utilize the trained DNNs, we show a sliding window method to effectively denoise HSIs which would otherwise require more than 40 GB.
