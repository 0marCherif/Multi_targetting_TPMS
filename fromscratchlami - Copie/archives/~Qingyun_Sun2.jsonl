What topology-imbalance means and how to measure its impact on graph learning remain under-explored. In this paper, we provide a new understanding of topology-imbalance from a global view of the supervision information distribution in terms of under-reaching and over-squashing, which motivates two quantitative metrics as measurements. In light of our analysis, we propose a novel position-aware graph structure learning framework named PASTEL, which directly optimizes the information propagation path and solves the topology-imbalance issue in essence. Our key insight is to enhance the connectivity of nodes within the same class for more supervision information, thereby relieving the under-reaching and over-squashing phenomena. Specifically, we design an anchor-based position encoding mechanism, which better incorporates relative topology position and enhances the intra-class inductive bias by maximizing the label influence. We further propose a class-wise conflict measure as the edge weights, which benefits the separation of different node classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior potential and adaptability of PASTEL in enhancing GNNs' power in different data annotation scenarios."}}

However, the increasing demands of satisfactory experiences require larger AI models, whose inference efficiency becomes the non-negligible drawback in the time-sensitive network QoS. In this work, we defined this challenge as the inference-QoS (iQoS) problem of the network QoS itself, which balances inference efficiency and performance for AI services. We design a unified iQoS metric to evaluate the AI-enhanced QoS frameworks with considerations on model performance, inference latency, and input scale. Then, we propose a two-stage pipeline as the exemplar for leveraging the iQoS metric in QoS-aware AI services: (i) enhance reconstruction ability, pretraining masked autoencoder extracts intrinsic data correlations by multi-scale masking; (ii) improve inference efficiency, forecasting masked decoder uses the data scale pruning in terms of spatial and temporal dimension for prediction. Comprehensive experiments on our method demonstrate its superior inference latency and overwhelming traffic matrix prediction performance."}}
