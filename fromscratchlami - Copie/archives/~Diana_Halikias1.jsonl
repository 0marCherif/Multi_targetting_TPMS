While deep learning models traditionally require copious amounts of training data, recent PDE learning techniques achieve spectacular results with limited data availability. Still, these results are empirical. Our work provides theoretical guarantees on the number of input-output training pairs required in PDE learning, explaining why these methods can be data-efficient. Specifically, we exploit randomized numerical linear algebra and PDE theory to derive a provably data-efficient algorithm that recovers solution operators of 3D elliptic PDEs from input-output data and achieves an exponential convergence rate with respect to the size of the training dataset with an exceptionally high probability of success."}}

Here, we prove that operator NNs of bounded width and arbitrary depth are universal approximators for continuous nonlinear operators. In our main result, we prove that for non-polynomial activation functions that are continuously differentiable at a point with a nonzero derivative, one can construct an operator NN of width five, whose inputs are real numbers with finite decimal representations, that is arbitrarily close to any given continuous nonlinear operator. We derive an analogous result for non-affine polynomial activation functions. We also show that depth has theoretical advantages by constructing operator ReLU NNs of depth $2k^3+8$ and constant width that cannot be well-approximated by any operator ReLU NN of depth $k$, unless its width is exponential in $k$."}}
