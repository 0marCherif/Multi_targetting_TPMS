We extend Deep Basis Fitting (DBF) for depth completion within a Bayesian evidence framework to provide calibrated per-pixel variance. The DBF approach frames the depth completion problem in terms of a network that produces a set of low-dimensional depth bases and a differentiable least squares fitting module that computes the basis weights using the sparse depths. By adopting a Bayesian treatment, our Bayesian Deep Basis Fitting (BDBF) approach is able to 1) predict high-quality uncertainty estimates and 2) enable depth completion with few or no sparse measurements. We conduct controlled experiments to compare BDBF against commonly used techniques for uncertainty estimation under various scenarios. Results show that our method produces better uncertainty estimates with accurate depth prediction."}}

While UGVs have larger payload capabilities and longer operation time, they are limited to 2-D space. This makes UAVs better suited for tasks that require fast coverage, harsh terrain traversal, and high altitude or multilevel operation. However, it remains a challenging task to develop a reliable yet fully autonomous UAV system that can actively extract actionable information in large-scale cluttered agricultural environments. Such a system will have to estimate its own poses, build a map of the environment, navigate through obstacles, and act to gather information with limited onboard computation and battery life. In this survey, we first review recent advances in UAV hardware and software, ranging from novel platforms and sensors to state-of-the-art autonomous navigation, object detection and segmentation, robot localization, and mapping algorithms related to agriculture. We then provide a list of challenges in each field and potential opportunities for the broader adoption of UAVs in precision agriculture."}}

This representation is storage-efficient, less ambiguous, and more informative, thus facilitating large-scale autonomy and the acquisition of actionable information in highly unstructured, GPS-denied environments. In this letter, we propose an integrated system that can perform large-scale autonomous flights and real-time semantic mapping in challenging under-canopy environments. We detect and model tree trunks and ground planes from LiDAR data, which are associated across scans and used to constrain robot poses as well as tree trunk models. The autonomous navigation module utilizes a multi-level planning and mapping framework and computes dynamically feasible trajectories that lead the UAV to build a semantic map of the user-defined region of interest in a computationally and storage efficient manner. A drift-compensation mechanism is designed to minimize the odometry drift using semantic SLAM outputs in real time, while maintaining planner optimality and controller stability. This leads the UAV to execute its mission accurately and safely at scale. Code is released at: https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_autonomous_flight and https://github.com/KumarRobotics/sloam."}}
