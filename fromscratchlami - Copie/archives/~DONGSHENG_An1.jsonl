By the Brenier theory, computing the optimal transport map is equivalent to solving a Monge-Amp\\`ere equation, which is highly non-linear. Therefore, the computation of optimal transportation maps is intrinsically challenging.\n\nIn this work, we propose a novel and powerful method, the FFT-OT (fast Fourier transform-optimal transport), to compute the 3-dimensional OT problems. The method is based on several key ideas: first, the Monge-Amp\\`ere equation is linearized to a sequence of linear elliptic PDEs with spacial and temporal variant coefficients; second, the obliqueness property of optimal transportation maps is reformulated as a Neumann boundary condition; and third, the variant coefficient elliptic PDEs are approximated by constant coefficient elliptic PDEs and solved by FFT on GPUs. We also prove that the algorithm converges linearly, namely the approximation error decreases exponentially fast. Experimental results show that the FFT-OT algorithm is more than a hundred times faster than the conventional methods based on the convex geometry. Furthermore, the method can be directly applied for sampling from complex 3D density functions in machine learning and magnifying the volumetric data in medical imaging. "}}

The evidential layers help to classify the high-dimensional radiomics features to predict the methylation status of MGMT and OS. Tests showed that our model achieved an accuracy of 0.844, making it possible to use as a clinic-enabling technique in the diagnosing and management of GBM.

Conventional discrete OT problem can be solved using linear programming (LP). Unfortunately, due to the large scale and the intrinsic non-linearity, achieving discrete OT plan with adequate accuracy and efficiency is challenging. Generally speaking, the OT plan is highly sparse. This work proposes an auxiliary measure method to use the semi-discrete OT maps to estimate the sparsity of the discrete OT plan with squared Euclidean cost. Although obtaining the accurate semi-discrete OT maps is difficult, we can find the sparsity information through computing the approximate semi-discrete OT maps by convex optimization. The sparsity information can be further incorporated into the downstream LP optimization to greatly reduce the computational complexity and improve the accuracy. We also give a theoretic error bound between the estimated transport plan and the OT plan in terms of Wasserstein distance. Experiments on both synthetic data and color transfer tasks demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method."}}

In this paper, we proposed an image compression method based on the recognition of importance of regions in images. As not all the information in an image is equally useful, we can identify important regions in an image for high fidelity compression and accept a comparatively more lossy compression about less important regions of the image. First, we segment images to two parts, namely, foreground and background, where the foreground represents the more important component and the background is of less importance. Second, we apply optimal mass transportation mapping in a GAN (generative adversarial network) framework to both the foreground and back-ground to magnify the foreground and shrink the background while keeping the shape and total image area unchanged. As a result, in the processed image, the ratio of foreground to background is larger than the corrresponding ratio in the original image. This ratio is controllable in our process, giving users the ability to control the degree of compression. The GAN-processed image is then used for compression. To restore the image, we apply a GAN model to the compressed image and recover the ratio of foreground and background using an optimal mass transportation map. Test results show that our method is highly effective in reconstructing detail of important components in compressed images while achieving a high compression ratio."}}

In this paper, we propose to use short run MCMC, such as Langevin dynamics, as an approximate inference engine, where the bias existing in the output distribution of the short run Langevin dynamics is corrected by optimal transport, which aims at minimizing the Wasserstein distance between the biased distribution produced by the finite step Langevin dynamics and the prior distribution.
