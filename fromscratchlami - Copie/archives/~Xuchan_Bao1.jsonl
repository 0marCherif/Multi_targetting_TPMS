We propose double Follow-the-Ridge (double-FTR), an algorithm that locally converges to and only to local Nash equilibria in general-sum two-player differentiable games. To our knowledge, double-FTR is the first algorithm with such guarantees for general-sum games. Furthermore, we show that by varying its preconditioner, double-FTR leads to a broader family of algorithms with the same convergence guarantee. In addition, double-FTR avoids oscillation near equilibria due to the real-eigenvalues of its Jacobian at fixed points. \nEmpirically, we validate the double-FTR algorithm on a range of simple zero-sum and general sum games, as well as simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) tasks."}}

Limited by the lack of general-purpose analytical tools, it is difficult to hand-engineer desirable voting rules for each use case. For this reason, it is appealing to automatically discover voting rules geared towards each scenario. In this paper, we show that set-input neural network architectures such as Set Transformers, fully-connected graph networks and DeepSets are both theoretically and empirically well-suited for learning voting rules. In particular, we show that these network models can not only mimic a number of existing voting rules to compelling accuracy --- both position-based (such as Plurality and Borda) and comparison-based (such as Kemeny, Copeland and Maximin) --- but also discover near-optimal voting rules that maximize different social welfare functions. Furthermore, the learned voting rules generalize well to different voter utility distributions and election sizes unseen during training."}}

In this work, we adapt the IQC theory to study first-order methods for smooth and strongly-monotone games and show how to design tailored quadratic constraints to get tight upper bounds of convergence rates. Using this framework, we recover the existing bound for the gradient method~(GD), derive sharper bounds for the proximal point method~(PPM) and optimistic gradient method~(OG), and provide for the first time a global convergence rate for the negative momentum method~(NM) with an iteration complexity $\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa^{1.5})$, which matches its known lower bound. In addition, for time-varying systems, we prove that the gradient method with optimal step size achieves the fastest provable worst-case convergence rate with quadratic Lyapunov functions. Finally, we further extend our analysis to stochastic games and study the impact of multiplicative noise on different algorithms. We show that it is impossible for an algorithm with one step of memory to achieve acceleration if it only queries the gradient once per batch (in contrast with the stochastic strongly-convex optimization setting, where such acceleration has been demonstrated). However, we exhibit an algorithm which achieves acceleration with two gradient queries per batch."}}

In principle, one could apply image-based style transfer techniques to a time-frequency representation of an audio signal, but this depends on having a representation that allows independent manipulation of timbre as well as high-quality waveform generation. We introduce TimbreTron, a method for musical timbre transfer which applies \u201cimage\u201d domain style transfer to a time-frequency representation of the audio signal, and then produces a high-quality waveform using a conditional WaveNet synthesizer. We show that the Constant Q Transform (CQT) representation is particularly well-suited to convolutional architectures due to its approximate pitch equivariance. Based on human perceptual evaluations, we confirmed that TimbreTron recognizably transferred the timbre while otherwise preserving the musical content, for both monophonic and polyphonic samples. We made an accompanying demo video here: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~huang/TimbreTron/index.html which we strongly encourage you to watch before reading the paper."}}
