We prove that the problem of deciding whether s pebbles suffice to reversibly pebble a DAG G is PSPACE-complete, as was previously shown for the standard pebble game in [Gilbert, Lengauer and Tarjan '80]. Via two different graph product constructions we then strengthen these results to establish that both standard and reversible pebbling space are PSPACE-hard to approximate to within any additive constant. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first hardness of approximation results for pebble games in an unrestricted setting (even for polynomial time). Also, since [Chan '13] proved that reversible pebbling is equivalent to the games in [Dymond and Tompa '85] and [Raz and McKenzie '99], our results apply to the Dymond -- Tompa and Raz -- McKenzie games as well, and from the same paper it follows that resolution depth is PSPACE-hard to determine up to any additive constant. We also obtain a multiplicative logarithmic separation between reversible and standard pebbling space. This improves on the additive logarithmic separation previously known and could plausibly be tight, although we are not able to prove this. We leave as an interesting open problem whether our additive hardness of approximation result could be strengthened to a multiplicative bound if the computational resources are decreased from polynomial space to the more common setting of polynomial time."}}

Many combinatorial lower bounds to study I versus NI and NC versus P under different restricted settings scale in the same way as the pebbling algorithm of Dymond-Tompa. These lower bounds include, (1) the monotone separation of m-I from m-NI by studying the size of monotone switching networks in Potechin '10; (2) a new semantic separation of NC from P and of NC <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sup> from NC <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i+1</sup> by studying circuit depth, based on the techniques developed for the semantic separation of NC <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> from NC <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> by the universal composition relation in Edmonds-Impagliazzo-Rudich-Sgall '01 and in Hastad- Wigderson '97; and (3) the monotone separation of m-NC from m-P and of m-NC <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sup> from m-NC <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i+1</sup> by studying (a) the depth of monotone circuits in Raz-McKenzie '99; and (b) the size of monotone switching networks in Chan- Potechin '12.

The key idea of the method is to partition the vertex set of a graph randomly into two disjoint sets to separate a solution from the rest of the graph into connected components, and then select appropriate components to form a solution. We can use universal sets to derandomize algorithms obtained from this method. This new method is versatile and powerful as it can be used to solve a wide range of fixed-cardinality optimization problems for degree-bounded graphs, graphs of bounded degeneracy (a large family of graphs that contains degree-bounded graphs, planar graphs, graphs of bounded tree-width, and nontrivial minor-closed families of graphs), and even general graphs."}}
