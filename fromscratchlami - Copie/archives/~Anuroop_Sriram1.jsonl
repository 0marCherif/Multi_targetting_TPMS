These calculations are traditionally performed using Density Functional Theory, which is computationally very expensive. Machine learning has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of these calculations from days or hours to seconds.\n\nWe propose the Spherical Channel Network (SCN) to model atomic energies and forces. The SCN is a graph neural network where nodes represent atoms and edges their neighboring atoms. The atom embeddings are a set of spherical functions, called spherical channels, represented using spherical harmonics. We demonstrate, that by rotating the embeddings based on the 3D edge orientation, more information may be utilized while maintaining the rotational equivariance of the messages. While equivariance is a desirable property, we find that by relaxing this constraint in both message passing and aggregation, improved accuracy may be achieved. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the large-scale Open Catalyst 2020 dataset in both energy and force prediction for numerous tasks and metrics."}}

However, the GNNs that have proven most effective for this task are memory intensive as they model higher-order interactions in the graphs such as those between triplets or quadruplets of atoms, making it challenging to scale these models. In this paper, we introduce Graph Parallelism, a method to distribute input graphs across multiple GPUs, enabling us to train very large GNNs with hundreds of millions or billions of parameters. We empirically evaluate our method by scaling up the recently proposed DimeNet++ and GemNet models by over an order of magnitude in the number of parameters. On the large-scale Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset, these graph-parallelized models lead to relative improvements of 1) 15% on the force MAE metric on the S2EF task and 2) 21% on the AFbT metric on the IS2RS task, establishing new state-of-the-art results."}}

In this paper, we explore more general setups where the domain of the unlabeled data for pre-training data differs from the domain of the labeled data for fine-tuning, which in turn may differ from the test data domain. Our experiments show that using target domain data during pre-training leads to large performance improvements across a variety of setups. On a large-scale competitive setup, we show that pre-training on unlabeled in-domain data reduces the gap between models trained on in-domain and out-of-domain labeled data by 66%-73%. This has obvious practical implications since it is much easier to obtain unlabeled target domain data than labeled data. Moreover, we find that pre-training on multiple domains improves generalization performance on domains not seen during training."}}

The key quantity to estimate is atomic forces, where the state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) explicitly enforce basic physical constraints such as rotation-covariance. However, to strictly satisfy the physical constraints, existing models have to make tradeoffs between computational efficiency and model expressiveness. Here we explore an alternative approach. By not imposing explicit physical constraints, we can flexibly design expressive models while maintaining their computational efficiency. Physical constraints are implicitly imposed by training the models using physics-based data augmentation. To evaluate the approach, we carefully design a scalable and expressive GNN model, ForceNet, and apply it to OC20 (Chanussot et al., 2020), an unprecedentedly-large dataset of quantum physics calculations. Our proposed ForceNet is able to predict atomic forces more accurately than state-of-the-art physics-based GNNs while being faster both in training and inference. Overall, our promising and counter-intuitive results open up an exciting avenue for future research."}}

Machine learning techniques using clinical data such as chest X-rays have been used to predict which patients are most at risk of deterioration. We consider the task of predicting two types of patient deterioration based on chest X-rays: adverse event deterioration (i.e., transfer to the intensive care unit, intubation, or mortality) and increased oxygen requirements beyond 6 L per day. Due to the relative scarcity of COVID-19 patient data, existing solutions leverage supervised pretraining on related non-COVID images, but this is limited by the differences between the pretraining data and the target COVID-19 patient data. In this paper, we use self-supervised learning based on the momentum contrast (MoCo) method in the pretraining phase to learn more general image representations to use for downstream tasks. We present three results. The first is deterioration prediction from a single image, where our model achieves an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.742 for predicting an adverse event within 96 hours (compared to 0.703 with supervised pretraining) and an AUC of 0.765 for predicting oxygen requirements greater than 6 L a day at 24 hours (compared to 0.749 with supervised pretraining). We then propose a new transformer-based architecture that can process sequences of multiple images for prediction and show that this model can achieve an improved AUC of 0.786 for predicting an adverse event at 96 hours and an AUC of 0.848 for predicting mortalities at 96 hours. A small pilot clinical study suggested that the prediction accuracy of our model is comparable to that of experienced radiologists analyzing the same information."}}

However, practical models for real large-scale and complex problems remain out of reach. Here we present ForceNet, a model for accurate and fast quantum chemistry simulations to accelerate catalyst discovery for renewable energy applications. ForceNet is a graph neural network that uses surrounding 3D molecular structure to estimate per-atom forces---a central capability for performing atomic simulations. The key challenge is to accurately capture highly complex and non-linear quantum interactions of atoms in 3D space, on which forces are dependent. To this end, ForceNet adopts (1) expressive message passing architecture, (2) appropriate choice of basis and non-linear activation functions, and (3) model scaling in terms of network depth and width. We show ForceNet reduces the estimation error of atomic forces by 30% compared to existing ML models, and generalizes well to out-of-distribution structures. Finally,  we apply ForceNet to the large-scale catalyst dataset, OC20. We use ForceNet to perform quantum chemistry simulations, where ForceNet is able to achieve 4x higher success rate than existing ML models. Overall, we demonstrate the potential for ML-based simulations to achieve practical usefulness while being orders of magnitude faster than physics-based simulations."}}

We perform experiments on the standard Librispeech dataset, and leverage additional unlabeled data from Librivox through pseudo-labeling. We show that while Transformer-based acoustic models have superior performance with the supervised dataset alone, semi-supervision improves all models across architectures and loss functions and bridges much of the performance gaps between them. In doing so, we reach a new state-of-the-art for end-to-end acoustic models decoded with an external language model in the standard supervised learning setting, and a new absolute state-of-the-art with semi-supervised training. Finally, we study the effect of leveraging different amounts of unlabeled audio, propose several ways of evaluating the characteristics of unlabeled audio which improve acoustic modeling, and show that acoustic models trained with more audio rely less on external language models."}}

As we increase our reliance on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, which produce intermittent power, storage is needed to transfer power from times of peak generation to peak demand. This may require the storage of power for hours, days, or months. One solution that offers the potential of scaling to nation-sized grids is the conversion of renewable energy to other fuels, such as hydrogen or methane. To be widely adopted, this process requires cost-effective solutions to running electrochemical reactions. An open challenge is finding low-cost electrocatalysts to drive these reactions at high rates. Through the use of quantum mechanical simulations (density functional theory), new catalyst structures can be tested and evaluated. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of these simulations limits the number of structures that may be tested. The use of machine learning may provide a method to efficiently approximate these calculations, leading to new approaches in finding effective electrocatalysts. In this paper, we provide an introduction to the challenges in finding suitable electrocatalysts, how machine learning may be applied to the problem, and the use of the Open Catalyst Project OC20 dataset for model training."}}
