Our cryo-EM forward model accounts for the biomolecular configuration (via spatial coordinates of pseudo-atoms, in contrast with traditional voxelized representations) the global pose, the effect of the microscope (contrast transfer function\u2019s defocus parameter). To account for conformational heterogeneity, we use the anisotropic network model (ANM). We perform experiments on synthetic data and show that the posterior of the scalar component along the lowest ANM mode and the angle of 2D in-plane pose can be jointly inferred with deep neural networks. We also perform Fourier frequency marching in the simulation and likelihood during training of the neural networks, as an annealing step."}}

We introduce a new coordinate network architecture and training scheme that enables coarse-to-fine optimization with fine-grained control over the frequency support of learned reconstructions. This is achieved with two key innovations. First, we incorporate skip connections so that structure at one scale is preserved when fitting finer-scale structure. Second, we propose a novel initialization scheme to provide control over the model frequency spectrum at each stage of optimization. We demonstrate how these modifications enable multiscale optimization for coarse-to-fine fitting to natural images. We then evaluate our model on synthetically generated datasets for the the problem of single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction. We learn high resolution multiscale structures, on par with the state-of-the art. Project webpage: https://shekshaa.github.io/ResidualMFN/.\n"}}

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in particular have been explored on a wide variety of problems such as disease prediction, segmentation, and matrix completion by leveraging large, multi-modal datasets. In this paper, we introduce a new spectral domain architecture for deep learning on graphs for disease prediction. The novelty lies in defining geometric \u2018inception modules\u2019 which are capable of capturing intra- and inter-graph structural heterogeneity during convolutions. We design filters with different kernel sizes to build our architecture. We show our disease prediction results on two publicly available datasets. Further, we provide insights on the behaviour of regular GCNs and our proposed model under varying input scenarios on simulated data."}}

A model capable of leveraging the individuality of each multi-modal data is required for better disease prediction. We propose a graph convolution based deep model which takes into account the distinctiveness of each element of the multi-modal data. We incorporate a novel self-attention layer, which weights every element of the demographic data by exploring its relation to the underlying disease. We demonstrate the superiority of our developed technique in terms of computational speed and performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Often a varied order of importance for this heterogeneous data is considered for personalized decisions. Current learning-based methods have achieved better performance with uniform attention to individual information, but a very few have focused on patient-specific attention learning schemes for each modality. Towards this, we introduce a model which not only improves the disease prediction but also focuses on learning patient-specific order of importance for multi-modal data elements. In order to achieve this, we take advantage of LSTM-based attention mechanism and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to design our model. GCNs learn multi-modal but class-specific features from the entire population of patients, whereas the attention mechanism optimally fuses these multi-modal features into a final decision, separately for each patient. In this paper, we apply the proposed approach for disease prediction task for Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s using two public medical datasets."}}
