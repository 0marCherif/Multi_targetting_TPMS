In case of Budgeted Influence Maximization (BIM), the users of the network have a cost and influential user selection needs to be done within a given budget. In case of Earned Benefit Maximization (EBM) Problem, a set of target users along with their benefit value is given and the aim is to choose highly influential users within an allocated budget to maximize the earned benefit. In this paper, we study the BIM and EBM Problem under the tag-specific edge probability setting, which means instead of a single edge probability a set of probability values (each one for a specific context e.g., \u2018games,\u2019 \u2018academics,\u2019 etc.) per edge is given. The aim is to identify the influential tags and users for maximizing the influence and earned benefit. Considering the realistic fact that different tags have a different impact on different communities of a social network, we propose two solution methodologies and one pruning technique. A detailed analysis of all the solution approaches has been done. An extensive set of experiments have been carried out with three benchmark datasets. From the experiments, we observe that the proposed solution approaches outperform baseline methods (e.g., random node-random tag, high-degree node\u2013high-frequency tag, high-degree node\u2013high-frequency tag with community). For the tag-based BIM Problem the improvement is upto $$8\\%$$ 8 % in terms of number of influenced nodes and for the tag-based EBM Problem the improvement is upto $$15\\%$$ 15 % in terms of earned benefit."}}

Retraining these `lottery ticket' subnetworks from their initialization minimizes the computational burden while preserving the test set accuracy of the original network. Based on our knowledge, the existing literature only confirms that pruning is needed and it can be achieved up to certain sparsity. We analyze the pruned network in the context of the properties of Ramanujan expander graphs. We consider the feed-forward network (both multi-layer perceptron and convolutional network) as a series of bipartite graphs which establish the connection from input to output. Now, as the fraction of remaining weights reduce with increasingly aggressive pruning two distinct regimes are observed: initially, no significant decrease in accuracy is demonstrated, and then the accuracy starts dropping rapidly. We empirically show that in the first regime the pruned lottery ticket sub-network remains a Ramanujan graph. Subsequently, with the loss of Ramanujan graph property, accuracy begins to reduce sharply. This characterizes an absence of resilient connectivity in the pruned sub-network. We also propose a new magnitude-based pruning algorithm to preserve the above property. We perform experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets using different established feed-forward architectures and show that the winning ticket obtained from the proposed algorithm is much more robust."}}

Analyzing and enumerating different structural patterns of such networks are important in different domains including social network analysis, computational biology, etc. In this paper, we study the problem of enumerating one such pattern: maximal $$(\\varDelta , \\gamma )$$ -Clique. Given a temporal network $$\\mathcal {G}(V, E, \\mathcal {T})$$ , a $$(\\varDelta , \\gamma )$$ -Clique is a vertex subset, time interval pair $$(\\mathcal {X}, [t_a,t_b])$$ such that between every pair of vertices of $$\\mathcal {X}$$ , there exist at least $$\\gamma $$ links in each $$\\varDelta $$ duration in $$[t_a,t_b]$$ . The proposed methodology is broadly divided into two phases. In the first phase, each temporal link is processed for constructing $$(\\varDelta , \\gamma )$$ -Clique(s) with maximum duration. In the second phase, these initial cliques are expanded by vertex addition to form the maximal cliques. We show that the proposed methodology is correct, and running time, space requirement analysis has been done. From the experimentation on three real datasets, we observe that the proposed methodology enumerates all the maximal $$(\\varDelta ,\\gamma )$$ -Cliques efficiently, particularly when the dataset is sparse. As a special case ( $$\\gamma =1$$ ), the proposed methodology is also able to enumerate $$(\\varDelta ,1) \\equiv \\varDelta $$ -cliques with much less time compared to the existing methods."}}

This provides additional information about the structural properties of a node, which the standard convolution operation in a GCN can then leverage for obtaining potentially improved effectiveness in a down-stream task. Our experiments demonstrate that adding these node interaction patterns (NIPs) along with an additional noise-contrastive pairwise document similarity objective within a GCN improves the linked document classification task."}}

In this paper, we study the dynamic skyline query problem on uncertain graphs (DySky). The input to this problem is an uncertain graph, a subset of its nodes as query vertices, and the goal here is to return all the data vertices which are not dominated by others. We employ two distance measures in the context of uncertain graphs, namely, Majority Distance, and Expected Distance. Our approach is broadly divided into three steps: Pruning, Distance Computation, and Skyline Vertex Set Generation. We implement the proposed methodology with three publicly available datasets and observe that it can find out skyline vertex set without taking much time even for million sized graphs if expected distance is concerned. Particularly, the pruning strategy reduces the computational time significantly."}}

The intuition of social recommendation is to reflect one's personal choice by its social neighbors. Though there exists a considerable amount of studies in this domain, no attention is paid to incorporate the transitive relationships of social ties in the ranking problem. In this paper, we exploit the lth order transitive relations of a user and extend the popular Social Bayesian Personalized Ranking (SBPR) model. The use of transitive relation creates a more granular pairwise ranking of items for a particular user and levels the user's personal choice based on the order of its social neighbors. We implement the model and conduct experiments on two real-world recommendation datasets with different values of l. We show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art pairwise ranking techniques."}}

In the basic MF model, the use of additional information such as social network, item tags along with rating has become popular and effective, which results in making the model more complex. However, there are very few studies in recent years, which only use the users rating information for the recommendation. In this paper, we present a new finding on exploiting Projected User and Item Graph in the setting of Kernelized Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (KPMF), which uses different graph kernels from the projected graphs. KPMF works with its latent vector spanning over all users (and items) with Gaussian process priors and tries to capture the covariance structure across users and items from their respective projected graphs. We also explore the ways of building these projected graphs to maximize the prediction accuracy. We implement the model in five real-world datasets and achieve significant performance improvement in terms of RMSE with state-of-the-art MF techniques."}}
