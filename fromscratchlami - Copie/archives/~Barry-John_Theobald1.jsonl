We show that encoding environment dynamics in the reward function improves the sample efficiency of PbRL by an order of magnitude. In our experiments we iterate between: (1) encoding environment dynamics in a state-action representation $z^{sa}$ via a self-supervised temporal consistency task, and (2) bootstrapping the preference-based reward function from $z^{sa}$, which results in faster policy learning and better final policy performance. For example, on quadruped-walk, walker-walk, and cheetah-run, with 50 preference labels we achieve the same performance as existing approaches with 500 preference labels, and we recover 83% and 66% of ground truth reward policy performance versus only 38% and 21% without environment dynamics. The performance gains demonstrate that _explicitly encoding environment dynamics improves preference-learned reward functions_."}}

Previous research has shown that traditional metrics used to optimize and assess models for generating lip motion from speech are not a good indicator of subjective opinion of animation quality. Devising metrics that align with subjective opinion first requires understanding what impacts human perception of quality. In this work, we focus on the degree of articulation and run a series of experiments to study how articulation strength impacts human perception of lip motion accompanying speech. Specifically, we study how increasing under-articulated (dampened) and over-articulated (exaggerated) lip motion affects human perception of quality. We examine the impact of articulation strength on human perception when considering only lip motion, where viewers are presented with talking faces represented by landmarks, and in the context of embodied characters, where viewers are presented with photo-realistic videos. Our results show that viewers prefer over-articulated lip motion consistently more than under-articulated lip motion and that this preference generalizes across different speakers and embodiments.

Most prior works assess the quality of generated head motion by comparing them against a single ground-truth using an objective metric. Yet there are many plausible head motion sequences to accompany a speech utterance. In this work, we study the variation in the perceptual quality of head motions sampled from a generative model. We show that, despite providing more diverse head motions, the generative model produces motions with varying degrees of perceptual quality. We finally show that objective metrics commonly used in previous research do not accurately reflect the perceptual quality of generated head motions. These results open an interesting avenue for future work to investigate better objective metrics that correlate with human perception of quality."}}

In this paper, we use a contrastive self-supervised learning method, SimCLR, to learn representations that capture the semantics of skeleton point clouds. This work focuses on systematically evaluating the effects that different algorithmic decisions (including augmentations, dataset partitioning and backbone architecture) have on the learned skeleton representations. To pre-train the representations, we normalise six existing datasets to obtain more than 40 million skeleton frames. We evaluate the quality of the learned representations with three downstream tasks: skeleton reconstruction, motion prediction, and activity classification. Our results demonstrate the importance of 1) combining spatial and temporal augmentations, 2) including additional datasets for encoder training, and 3) and using a graph neural network as an encoder."}}

In this work, we demonstrate that encoding environment dynamics in the reward function (REED) dramatically reduces the number of preference labels required in state-of-the-art preference-based RL frameworks. We hypothesize that REED-based methods better partition the state-action space and facilitate generalization to state-action pairs not included in the preference dataset. REED iterates between encoding environment dynamics in a state-action representation via a self-supervised temporal consistency task, and bootstrapping the preference-based reward function from the state-action representation. Whereas prior approaches train only on the preference-labelled trajectory pairs, REED exposes the state-action representation to all transitions experienced during policy training. We explore the benefits of REED within the PrefPPO [1] and PEBBLE [2] preference learning frameworks and demonstrate improvements across experimental conditions to both the speed of policy learning and the final policy performance. For example, on quadruped-walk and walker-walk with 50 preference labels, REED-based reward functions recover 83% and 66% of ground truth reward policy performance and without REED only 38\\% and 21\\% are recovered. For some domains, REED-based reward functions result in policies that outperform policies trained on the ground truth reward."}}

However, the effectiveness of MEMs in the presence of distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. Our work examines how distribution shifts generated by common image corruptions affect the accuracy/efficiency of MEMs. We find that under common corruptions, early-exiting at the first correct exit reduces the inference cost and provides a significant boost in accuracy ( 10%) over exiting at the last layer. However, with realistic early-exit strategies, which do not assume knowledge about the correct exits, MEMs still reduce inference cost but provide a marginal improvement in accuracy (1%) compared to exiting at the last layer. Moreover, the presence of distribution shift widens the gap between an MEM's maximum classification accuracy and realistic early-exit strategies by 5% on average compared with the gap on in-distribution data. Our empirical analysis shows that the lack of calibration due to a distribution shift increases the susceptibility of such early-exit strategies to exit early and increases misclassification rates. Furthermore, the lack of calibration increases the inconsistency in the predictions of the model across exits, leading to both inefficient inference and more misclassifications compared with evaluation on in-distribution data. Finally, we propose two metrics, underthinking and overthinking, that quantify the different behavior of practical early-exit strategy under distribution shifts, and provide insights into improving the practical utility of MEMs."}}

Adding personalization to federated learning introduces new challenges as we must account for preferences of individual users, where a data sample could have conflicting labels because one sub-population of users might view an input positively, but other sub-populations view the same input negatively. We present FedEmbed, a new approach to private federated learning for personalizing a global model that uses (1) sub-populations of similar users, and (2) personal embeddings. We demonstrate that current approaches to federated learning are inadequate for handling data with conflicting labels, and we show that FedEmbed achieves up to 45% improvement over baseline approaches to personalized private federated learning."}}

Previous research has shown that traditional metrics used to optimize and assess models for generating lip motions from speech are not a good indicator of subjective opinion of animation quality. Yet, running repetitive subjective studies for assessing the quality of animations can be time-consuming and difficult to replicate. In this work, we seek to understand the relationship between perturbed lip motion and subjective opinion of lip motion quality. Specifically, we adjust the degree of articulation for lip motion sequences and run a user-study to examine how this adjustment impacts the perceived quality of lip motion. We then train a model using the scores collected from our user-study to automatically predict the subjective quality of an animated sequence. Our results show that (1) users score lip motions with slight over-articulation the highest in terms of perceptual quality; (2) under-articulation had a more detrimental effect on perceived quality of lip motion compared to the effect of over-articulation; and (3) we can automatically estimate the subjective perceptual score for a given lip motion sequences with low error rates."}}

We show that visual cues provide not only high-level information about speech activity, i.e., speech/silence, but also fine-grained visual information about the place of articulation. One byproduct of this finding is that the learned visual embeddings can be used as features for other visual speech applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned visual embeddings for classifying visemes (the visual analogy to phonemes). Our results provide insight into important aspects of audiovisual speech enhancement and demonstrate how such models can be used for self-supervision tasks for visual speech applications."}}
