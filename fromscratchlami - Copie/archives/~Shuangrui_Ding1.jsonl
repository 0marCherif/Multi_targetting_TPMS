However, the unfriendly computation cost impedes their potential in the video recognition domain. To optimize the speed-accuracy trade-off, we propose Semantic-aware Temporal Accumulation score (STA) to prune spatio-temporal tokens integrally. STA score considers two critical factors: temporal redundancy and semantic importance. The former depicts a specific region based on whether it is a new occurrence or a seen entity by aggregating token-to-token similarity in consecutive frames while the latter evaluates each token based on its contribution to the overall prediction. As a result, tokens with higher scores of STA carry more temporal redundancy as well as lower semantics thus being pruned. Based on the STA score, we are able to progressively prune the tokens without introducing any additional parameters or requiring further re-training. We directly apply the STA module to off-the-shelf ViT and VideoSwin backbones, and the empirical results on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2 achieve over 30% computation reduction with a negligible ~0.2% accuracy drop.

Building on these results, we take one step further and explore the possibility of integrating these two features to enhance object-centric representations. Our preliminary experiments indicate that query slot attention can extract different semantic components from the RGB feature map, while random sampling based slot attention can exploit temporal correspondence cues between frames to assist instance identification. Motivated by this, we propose a novel semantic-aware masked slot attention on top of the fused semantic features and correspondence maps. It comprises two slot attention stages with a set of shared learnable Gaussian distributions. In the first stage, we use the mean vectors as slot initialization to decompose potential semantics and generate semantic segmentation masks through iterative attention. In the second stage, for each semantics, we randomly sample slots from the corresponding Gaussian distribution and perform masked feature aggregation within the semantic area to exploit temporal correspondence patterns for instance identification. We adopt semantic- and instance-level temporal consistency as self-supervision to encourage temporally coherent object-centric representations. Our model effectively identifies multiple object instances with semantic structure, reaching promising results on unsupervised video object discovery. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on dense label propagation tasks, demonstrating the potential for object-centric analysis.

Previous works have shown promising results via processing optical flows to segment objects. However, taking flow as input brings about two drawbacks. First, flow cannot capture sufficient cues when objects remain static or partially occluded. Second, it is challenging to establish temporal coherency from flow-only input, due to the missing texture information. To tackle these limitations, we propose a model for directly processing consecutive RGB frames, and infer the optical flow between any pair of frames using a layered representation, with the opacity channels being treated as the segmentation. Additionally, to enforce object permanence, we apply temporal consistency loss on the inferred masks from randomly-paired frames, which refer to the motions at different paces, and encourage the model to segment the objects even if they may not move at the current time point. Experimentally, we demonstrate superior performance over previous state-of-the-art methods on three public video segmentation datasets (DAVIS2016, SegTrackv2, and FBMS-59), while being computationally efficient by avoiding the overhead of computing optical flow as input."}}

Most works naively sample different clips to construct positive and negative pairs. However, we observe that this formulation inclines the model towards the background scene bias. The underlying reasons are twofold. First, the scene difference is usually more noticeable and easier to discriminate than the motion difference. Second, the clips sampled from the same video often share similar backgrounds but have distinct motions. Simply regarding them as positive pairs will draw the model to the static background rather than the motion pattern. To tackle this challenge, this paper presents a novel dual contrastive formulation. Concretely, we decouple the input RGB video sequence into two complementary modes, static scene and dynamic motion. Then, the original RGB features are pulled closer to the static features and the aligned dynamic features, respectively. In this way, the static scene and the dynamic motion are simultaneously encoded into the compact RGB representation. We further conduct the feature space decoupling via activation maps to distill static- and dynamic-related features. We term our method as Dual Contrastive Learning for spatio-temporal Representation (DCLR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCLR learns effective spatio-temporal representations and obtains state-of-the-art or comparable performance on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Diving-48 datasets."}}

Specifically, we utilize static frame and frame difference to help decouple static and dynamic concepts, and respectively align the concept distributions in latent space. We add diversity and fidelity regularizations to guarantee that we learn a compact set of meaningful concepts. Then we employ a cross-attention mechanism to aggregate detailed local features of different concepts, and filter out redundant concepts with low activations to perform local concept contrast.

When naively pulling two augmented views of a video closer, the model however tends to learn the common static background as a shortcut but fails to capture the motion information, a phenomenon dubbed as background bias. Such bias makes the model suffer from weak generalization ability, leading to worse performance on downstream tasks such as action recognition. To alleviate such bias, we propose Foreground-background Merging (FAME) to deliberately compose the moving foreground region of the selected video onto the static background of others. Specifically, without any off-the-shelf detector, we extract the moving fore-ground out of background regions via the frame difference and color statistics, and shuffle the background regions among the videos. By leveraging the semantic consistency between the original clips and the fused ones, the model focuses more on the motion patterns and is debiased from the background shortcut. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAME can effectively resist background cheating and thus achieve the state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks across UCF101, HMDB51, and Diving48 datasets. The code and configurations are released at https://github.com/Mark12Ding/FAME."}}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-level feature optimization framework to improve the generalization and temporal modeling ability of learned video representations. Concretely, high-level features obtained from naive and prototypical contrastive learning are utilized to build distribution graphs, guiding the process of low-level and mid-level feature learning. We also devise a simple temporal modeling module from multi-level features to enhance motion pattern learning. Experiments demonstrate that multi-level feature optimization with the graph constraint and temporal modeling can greatly improve the representation ability in video understanding.
