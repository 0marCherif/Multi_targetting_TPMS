In this context, the majority of existing pooled testing methods for the identification of infected individuals are agnostic to the circumstances of contagion. However, individuals for whom a test is ordered are usually traced contacts of an infectious person\u2014they are secondary infections. As a result, their infection statuses are correlated. In this work, we propose a novel pooled testing method that makes explicit use of epidemic parameters describing the distribution of secondary infections. Our method partitions an infected individual\u2019s contacts into pools whose sizes make more efficient use of the available tests. Extensive simulations under a variety of epidemiological conditions informed by the COVID-19 literature show that our method can significantly decrease the expected number of tests under superspreading dynamics, i.e., when the distribution of secondary infections exhibits high variance. The simulations also show that our method maintains its advantageous performance under imperfect conditions, such as significant dilution effects or incomplete contact tracing."}}
