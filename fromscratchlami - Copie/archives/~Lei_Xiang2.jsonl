However, the relatively long acquisition time makes the acquired image vulnerable to motion artifacts. To speed up the imaging process, various algorithms have been proposed to reconstruct high-quality images from under-sampled k-space data. However, most of the existing algorithms only rely on mono-modality acquisition for the image reconstruction. In this paper, we propose to combine complementary MR acquisitions (i.e., T1WI and under-sampled T2WI particularly) to reconstruct the high-quality image (i.e., corresponding to the fully-sampled T2WI). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to fuse multi-modal MR acquisitions through deep learning to speed up the reconstruction of a certain target image. Specifically, we present a novel deep learning approach, namely Dense-Unet, to accomplish the reconstruction task. The proposed Dense-Unet requires fewer parameters and less computation, while achieving promising performance. Our results have shown that Dense-Unet can reconstruct a 3D T2WI volume in less than 10 seconds with an under-sampling rate of 8 for the k-space and negligible aliasing artifacts or signal-noise-ratio (SNR) loss. Experiments also demonstrate excellent transferring capability of Dense-Unet when applied to the datasets acquired by different MR scanners. The above results imply great potential of our method in many clinical scenarios."}}

Among them, the synthesis of computed tomography (CT) image from T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) image is of great importance, although the mapping between them is highly complex due to large gaps of appearances of the two modalities. In this work, we aim to tackle this MR-to-CT synthesis task by a novel deep embedding convolutional neural network (DECNN). Specifically, we generate the feature maps from MR images, and then transform these feature maps forward through convolutional layers in the network. We can further compute a tentative CT synthesis from the midway of the flow of feature maps, and then embed this tentative CT synthesis result back to the feature maps. This embedding operation results in better feature maps, which are further transformed forward in DECNN. After repeating this embedding procedure for several times in the network, we can eventually synthesize a final CT image in the end of the DECNN. We have validated our proposed method on both brain and prostate imaging datasets, by also comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results suggest that our DECNN (with repeated embedding operations) demonstrates its superior performances, in terms of both the perceptive quality of the synthesized CT image and the run-time cost for synthesizing a CT image."}}

In order to obtain high-quality PET images, a standard-dose radioactive tracer is needed, which inevitably causes the risk of radiation exposure damage. For reducing the patient\u2019s exposure to radiation and maintaining the high quality of PET images, in this paper, we propose a deep learning architecture to estimate the high-quality standarddose PET (SPET) image from the combination of the low-quality low-dose PET (LPET) image and the accompanying T1-weighted acquisition from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specifically, we adapt the convolutional neural network (CNN) to account for the two channel inputs of LPET and T1, and directly learn the end-to-end mapping between the inputs and the SPET output. Then, we integrate multiple CNN modules following the auto-context strategy, such that the tentatively estimated SPET of an early CNN can be iteratively refined by subsequent CNNs. Validations on real human brain PET/MRI data show that our proposed method can provide competitive estimation quality of the PET images, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, our method is highly efficient to test on a new subject, e.g., spending \u223c2 s for estimating an entire SPET image in contrast to \u223c16 min by the state-of-the-art method. The results above demonstrate the potential of our method in real clinical applications."}}

Recently, deep neural networks provided promising solutions for automatic image segmentation; however, they often perform good on regular samples (i.e., easy-to-segment samples), since the datasets are dominated by easy and regular samples. For medical images, due to huge inter-subject variations or disease-specific effects on subjects, there exist several difficult-to-segment cases that are often overlooked by the previous works. To address this challenge, we propose a difficulty-aware deep segmentation network with confidence learning for end-to-end segmentation. The proposed framework has two main contributions: 1) Besides the segmentation network, we also propose a fully convolutional adversarial network for confidence learning to provide voxel-wise and region-wise confidence information for the segmentation network. We relax the adversarial learning to confidence learning by decreasing the priority of adversarial learning, so that we can avoid the training imbalance between generator and discriminator. 2) We propose a difficulty-aware attention mechanism to properly handle hard samples or hard regions considering structural information, which may go beyond the shortcomings of focal loss. We further propose a fusion module to selectively fuse the concatenated feature maps in encoder-decoder architectures. Experimental results on clinical and challenge datasets show that our proposed network can achieve state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. Further analysis also indicates that each individual component of our proposed network contributes to the overall performance improvement."}}
