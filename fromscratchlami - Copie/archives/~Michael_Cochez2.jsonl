A major concern is to produce predictions that are logically consistent with these constraints. To do so, we formulate this problem as an embedding inference problem where the constraints are imposed onto the embeddings of labels by geometric construction. Particularly, we consider a hyperbolic Poincar\u00e9 ball model in which we encode labels as Poincar\u00e9 hyperplanes that work as linear decision boundaries. The hyperplanes are interpreted as convex regions such that the logical relationships (implication and exclusion) are geometrically encoded using the insideness and disjointedness of these regions, respectively. We show theoretical groundings of the method for preserving logical relationships in the embedding space. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets show 1) significant improvements in mean average precision; 2) lower number of constraint violations;  3) an order of magnitude fewer dimensions than baselines."}}

In order to show this, we have designed and released our own challenging environment, \"the Room\", compatible with OpenAI Gym, where an agent has to properly learn how to encode, store, and retrieve memories to maximize its rewards. The Room environment allows for a hybrid intelligence setup where machines and humans can collaborate. We show that two agents collaborating with each other results in better performance than one agent acting alone. We have open-sourced our code and models at https://github.com/tae898/explicit-memory."}}

The amount of gradient information that needs to be stored during training for real-world graphs is often too large for the amount of memory available on most GPUs. In this work, we experiment with the use of graph summarization techniques to compress the graph and hence reduce the amount of memory needed. After training the R-GCN on the graph summary, we transfer the weights back to the original graph and attempt to perform inference on it. We obtain reasonable results on the AIFB, MUTAG and AM datasets. Our experiments show that training on the graph summary can yield a comparable or higher accuracy to training on the original graphs.Furthermore, if we take the time to compute the summary out of the equation, we observe that the smaller graph representations obtained with graph summarization methods reduces the computational overhead. However, further experiments are needed to evaluate additional graph summary models and whether our findings also holds true for very large graphs."}}

Reasoning-based methods with complex reasoning mechanisms, such as reinforcement learning-based sequential decision making, have been regarded as the default pathway for this task. However, these mechanisms are difficult to implement and train, which hampers their reproducibility and transferability to new domains. In this paper, we propose QAGCN - a simple but effective and novel model that leverages attentional graph convolutional networks that can perform multi-step reasoning during the encoding of knowledge graphs. As a consequence, complex reasoning mechanisms are avoided. In addition, to improve efficiency, we retrieve answers using highly-efficient embedding computations and, for better interpretability, we extract interpretable paths for returned answers. On widely adopted benchmark datasets, the proposed model has been demonstrated competitive against state-of-the-art methods that rely on complex reasoning mechanisms. We also conducted extensive experiments to scrutinize the efficiency and contribution of each component of our model."}}

This ecosystem is implemented using various technologies and platforms. In fact, the use of a common metadata standard for describing datasets and open data portals, i.e., the DCAT-AP specification, appears as the lingua franca that connects an, otherwise, fragmented environment. In this context, the standard-based consolidation of open data promotes the subsidiarity principle, allowing open data portal owners to choose platforms and internal representations based on their specific requirements. However, the portal owners must provide an export with DCAT-AP compliant metadata about the dataset they store. In this paper we provide a detailed study of how the DCAT-AP specification is used in practice, both at the national and the European level. Consequently, we also identify issues, challenges, and opportunities for improvements that can be used as input for the next revision cycle of the standard. Essentially, our goal is to contribute towards the enrichment of a growing and promising European open data ecosystem."}}

It subsumes both one-hop link prediction as well as other more complex types of logical queries. Existing algorithms operate only on classical, triple-based graphs, whereas modern KGs often employ a hyper-relational modeling paradigm. In this paradigm, typed edges may have several key-value pairs known as qualifiers that provide fine-grained context for facts. In queries, this context modifies the meaning of relations, and usually reduces the answer set. Hyper-relational queries are often observed in real-world KG applications, and existing approaches for approximate query answering cannot make use of qualifier pairs. In this work, we bridge this gap and extend the multi-hop reasoning problem to hyper-relational KGs allowing to tackle this new type of complex queries. Building upon recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks and query embedding techniques, we study how to embed and answer hyper-relational conjunctive queries. Besides that, we propose a method to answer such queries and demonstrate in our experiments that qualifiers improve query answering on a diverse set of query patterns."}}

Simple sketch applications are usually too imprecise, while comprehensive ontology editors are often too complicated for non-experts. We present Neologism 2.0 - an open-source tool for quick vocabulary creation through domain experts. Its guided vocabulary creation and its collaborative graph editor enable the quick creation of proper vocabularies, even for non-experts, and dramatically reduces the time and effort to draft vocabularies collaboratively. An RDF export allows quick bootstrapping of any other Semantic Web tool."}}

In particular, clustering helps at analyzing unstructured and high-dimensional data in the form of sequences, expressions, texts and images. Further, clustering is used to gain insights into biological processes in the genomics level, e.g. clustering of gene expressions provides insights on the natural structure inherent in the data, understanding gene functions, cellular processes, subtypes of cells and understanding gene regulations. Subsequently, clustering approaches, including hierarchical, centroid-based, distribution-based, density-based and self-organizing maps, have long been studied and used in classical machine learning settings. In contrast, deep learning (DL)-based representation and feature learning for clustering have not been reviewed and employed extensively. Since the quality of clustering is not only dependent on the distribution of data points but also on the learned representation, deep neural networks can be effective means to transform mappings from a high-dimensional data space into a lower-dimensional feature space, leading to improved clustering results. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art DL-based approaches for cluster analysis that are based on representation learning, which we hope to be useful, particularly for bioinformatics research. Further, we explore in detail the training procedures of DL-based clustering algorithms, point out different clustering quality metrics and evaluate several DL-based approaches on three bioinformatics use cases, including bioimaging, cancer genomics and biomedical text mining. We believe this review and the evaluation results will provide valuable insights and serve a starting point for researchers wanting to apply DL-based unsupervised methods to solve emerging bioinformatics research problems."}}
