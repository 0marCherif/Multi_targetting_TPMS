In this paper, we propose to solve the two tasks jointly for natural multi-person images, in which the estimated pose provides object-level shape prior to regularize part segments while the part-level segments constrain the variation of pose locations. Specifically, we first train two fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), namely Pose FCN and Part FCN, to provide initial estimation of pose joint potential and semantic part potential. Then, to refine pose joint location, the two types of potentials are fused with a fully-connected conditional random field (FCRF), where a novel segment-joint smoothness term is used to encourage semantic and spatial consistency between parts and joints. To refine part segments, the refined pose and the original part potential are integrated through a Part FCN, where the skeleton feature from pose serves as additional regularization cues for part segments. Finally, to reduce the complexity of the FCRF, we induce human detection boxes and infer the graph inside each box, making the inference forty times faster. Since theres no dataset that contains both part segments and pose labels, we extend the PASCAL VOC part dataset [6] with human pose joints and perform extensive experiments to compare our method against several most recent strategies. We show that our algorithm surpasses competing methods by 10.6% in pose estimation with much faster speed and by 1.5% in semantic part segmentation."}}

The localization of joints in pose estimation can be much more accurate with the support of part segment consistency while the local confusions in part segmentation can be greatly reduced with the support of top-down pose information. In natural scenes which consist of multiple people, human pose estimation and human part segmentation are still challenging due to multi-instance confusion and large variations in pose, scale, appearance and occlusion. Current state-of-the-art methods for both tasks rely on deep neural networks to extract data-dependent features, and combine them with a carefully designed graphical model. However, these methods have no efficient mechanism to handle multi-person overlapping or to adapt to the scale of human instances, thus are still limited when facing large variability in human pose and scale. To improve the performance of both tasks over current methods, we propose three models that tackle the difficulty of pose/scale variation in two major directions: (1) introduce top-down pose consistency into semantic part segmentation and introduce part segment consistency into human pose estimation, letting the two tasks benefit each other; (2) handle the scale variation by designing a mechanism to adapt to the size of human instances and their corresponding parts. Our first model incorporates pose cues into a graphical model-based part segmentation framework while our third model combines pose information within a framework made up of fully convolutional networks (FCN). Our second model is a hierarchical FCN framework that performs object/part scale estimation and part segmentation jointly, adapting to the size of objects and parts. We show that all our three models achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets."}}

In this paper, we propose a human parsing pipeline that uses pose cues, i.e., estimates of human joint locations, to provide pose-guided segment proposals for semantic parts. These segment proposals are ranked using standard appearance cues, deep-learned semantic feature, and a novel pose feature called pose-context. Then these proposals are selected and assembled using an And-Or graph to output a parse of the person. The And-Or graph is able to deal with large human appearance variability due to pose, choice of clothes, etc. We evaluate our approach on the popular Penn-Fudan pedestrian parsing dataset, showing that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts, and perform diagnostics to demonstrate the effectiveness of different stages of our pipeline."}}
