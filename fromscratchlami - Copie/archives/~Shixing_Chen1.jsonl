To address this challenge, we introduce a novel training framework based on cross-modal contrastive learning that uses progressive self-distillation and soft image-text alignments to more efficiently learn robust representations from noisy data. Our model distills its own knowledge to dynamically generate soft-alignment targets for a subset of images and captions in every minibatch, which are then used to update its parameters. Extensive evaluation across 14 benchmark datasets shows that our method consistently outperforms its CLIP counterpart in multiple settings, including: (a) zero-shot classification, (b) linear probe transfer, and (c) image-text retrieval, without incurring extra computational cost. Analysis using an ImageNet-based robustness test-bed [70] reveals that our method offers better effective robustness to natural distribution shifts compared to both ImageNet-trained models and CLIP itself. Lastly, pretraining with datasets spanning two orders of magnitude in size shows that our improvements over CLIP tend to scale with number of training examples."}}

Unlike previous approaches, we particularly address the challenge of field- registration when: (a) there are not enough distinguishable features on the field, and (b) no prior knowledge is available about the camera. To this end, we detect a grid of key- points distributed uniformly on the entire field instead of using only sparse local corners and line intersections, thereby extending the keypoint coverage to the texture-less parts of the field as well. To further improve keypoint based homography estimate, we differentialbly warp and align it with a set of dense field-features defined as normalized distance- map of pixels to their nearest lines and key-regions. We predict the keypoints and dense field-features simultaneously using a multi-task deep network to achieve computational efficiency. To have a comprehensive evaluation, we have compiled a new dataset called SportsFields which is collected from 192 video-clips from 5 different sports covering large environmental and camera variations. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm not only achieves state of the art field-registration accuracy but also runs in real-time for HD resolution videos using commodity hardware."}}

However, given their complex temporal structure, finding scene boundaries can be a challenging task requiring large amounts of labeled training data. To address this challenge, we present a self-supervised shot contrastive learning approach (ShotCoL) to learn a shot representation that maximizes the similarity between nearby shots compared to randomly selected shots. We show how to apply our learned shot representation for the task of scene boundary detection to offer state-of-the-art performance on the MovieNet dataset while requiring only 25% of the training labels, using 9x fewer model parameters and offering 7x faster runtime. To assess the effectiveness of ShotCoL on novel applications of scene boundary detection, we take on the problem of finding timestamps in movies and TV episodes where video-ads can be inserted while offering a minimally disruptive viewing experience. To this end, we collected a new dataset called AdCuepoints with 3,975 movies and TV episodes, 2.2 million shots and 19,119 minimally disruptive ad cue-point labels. We present a thorough empirical analysis on this dataset demonstrating the effectiveness of ShotCoL for ad cue-points detection."}}

Recent research shows that the aging features deeply learned from large-scale data lead to significant performance improvement on facial image-based age estimation. However, age-related ordinal information is totally ignored in these approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework, ranking-CNN, for age estimation. Ranking-CNN contains a set of basic CNNs, each of which is trained with ordinal age labels. Then, their binary outputs are aggregated for the final age prediction. From a theoretical perspective, we obtain an approximation for the final ranking error, show that it is controlled by the maximum error produced among subranking problems, and thus find a new error bound, which provides helpful guidance for the training and analysis of deep rankers. Based on the new error bound, we theoretically give an explicit formula for the learning of ranking-CNN and demonstrate its convergence using the stochastic approximation method. Moreover, we rigorously prove that ranking-CNN, by considering ordinal relation between ages, is more likely to get smaller estimation errors when compared with multiclass classification approaches. Through extensive experiments, we show that ranking-CNN outperforms other state-of-the-art feature extractors and age estimators on benchmark datasets."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel Coupled End-to-end Transfer Learning (CETL) framework, which mainly consists of two convolutional neural networks (source and target) that connect to a shared decoder. A novel loss function, the coupled loss, is used for CETL training. From a theoretical perspective, we demonstrate the rationale of the coupled loss by establishing a learning bound for CETL. Moreover, we introduce the generalized Fisher information to improve multi-task optimization in CETL. From a practical aspect, CETL provides a unified and highly flexible solution for various learning tasks such as domain adaption and knowledge distillation. Empirical result shows the superior performance of CETL on cross-domain and cross-task image classification."}}
