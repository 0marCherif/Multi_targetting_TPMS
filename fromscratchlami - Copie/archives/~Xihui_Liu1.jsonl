For a point cloud of a 3D scene with posed RGB images, we first predict segmentation masks of RGB images with SAM, and then project the 2D masks into the 3D points. Later, we merge the 3D masks iteratively with a bottom-up merging approach. At each step, we merge the point cloud masks of two adjacent frames with the bidirectional merging approach. In this way, the 3D masks predicted from different frames are gradually merged into the 3D masks of the whole 3D scene. Finally, we can optionally ensemble the result from our SAM3D with the over-segmentation results based on the geometric information of the 3D scenes. Our approach is experimented with ScanNet dataset and qualitative results demonstrate that our SAM3D achieves reasonable and fine-grained 3D segmentation results without any training or finetuning of SAM."}}

However, there is a growing concern that the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology may produce fake photos, which can create confusion and diminish trust in photographs. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate agents for distinguishing state-of-the-art AI-generated visual content. Our study benchmarks both human capability and cutting-edge fake image detection AI algorithms, using a newly collected large-scale fake image dataset Fake2M. In our human perception evaluation, titled HPBench, we discovered that humans struggle significantly to distinguish real photos from AI-generated ones, with a misclassification rate of 38.7%. Along with this, we conduct the model capability of AI-Generated images detection evaluation MPBench and the top-performing model from MPBench achieves a 13% failure rate under the same setting used in the human evaluation. We hope that our study can raise awareness of the potential risks of AI-generated images and facilitate further research to prevent the spread of false information.

Although breakthroughs have been made in natural language processing and image representation learning, it is still challenging for video models to reach it due to the increasing uncertainty of spatiotemporal signals. To ease training, existing works leverage image foundation models' prior knowledge and equip them with efficient temporal modules. Despite the satisfactory fine-tuning performance, we empirically find they fall short of out-of-the-box usage, given the even degraded performance in zero-shot/linear protocols compared to their baseline counterparts. In this work, we analyze the factor that leads to degradation from the perspective of language supervision distortion. We argue that tuning a text encoder end-to-end, as done in previous work, is suboptimal since it may overfit in terms of styles, thereby losing its original generalization ability to capture the semantics of various language registers. The overfitted text encoder, in turn, provides a harmful supervision signal, degrading the video representation. To tackle this issue, we propose a degradation-free pre-training strategy to retain the generalization ability of the text encoder via freezing shallow layers while enabling the task-related semantics capturing in tunable deep layers. As for the training objective, we adopted the transcript sorting task in TVTS incorporated with masking techniques to enable scalable training. As a result, we produce a series of models, dubbed TVTSv2, with up to one billion parameters. We achieve new state-of-the-arts on various video benchmarks with a frozen backbone, surpassing the recent ImageBind, InternVideo, etc. Code is available at https://github.com/TencentARC/TVTS."}}

Among these applications, 3D object generation techniques are of utmost importance. This technique has unlocked fresh avenues in the realm of creating, customizing, and exploring 3D objects. However, the quality and diversity of existing 3D object generation methods are constrained by the inadequacies of existing 3D object datasets, including issues related to text quality, the incompleteness of multi-modal data representation encompassing 2D rendered images and 3D assets, as well as the size of the dataset. In order to resolve these issues, we present UniG3D, a unified 3D object generation dataset constructed by employing a universal data transformation pipeline on Objaverse and ShapeNet datasets. This pipeline converts each raw 3D model into comprehensive multi-modal data representation <text, image, point cloud, mesh> by employing rendering engines and multi-modal models. These modules ensure the richness of textual information and the comprehensiveness of data representation. Remarkably, the universality of our pipeline refers to its ability to be applied to any 3D dataset, as it only requires raw 3D data. The selection of data sources for our dataset is based on their scale and quality. Subsequently, we assess the effectiveness of our dataset by employing Point-E and SDFusion, two widely recognized methods for object generation, tailored to the prevalent 3D representations of point clouds and signed distance functions.

Image Synthesis with Semantic Diffusion Guidance", "abstract": "Controllable image synthesis models allow creation of diverse images based on text instructions or guidance from a reference image. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have been shown to generate more realistic imagery than prior methods, and have been successfully demonstrated in unconditional and class-conditional settings. We investigate fine-grained, continuous control of this model class, and introduce a novel unified framework for semantic diffusion guidance, which allows either language or image guidance, or both. Guidance is injected into a pretrained unconditional diffusion model using the gradient of image-text or image matching scores, without re-training the diffusion model. We explore CLIP-based language guidance as well as both content and style-based image guidance in a unified framework. Our text-guided synthesis approach can be applied to datasets without associated text annotations. We conduct experiments on FFHQ and LSUN datasets, and show results on fine-grained text-guided image synthesis, synthesis of images related to a style or content reference image, and examples with both textual and image guidance. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>"}}

However, how to interpret and manipulate the latent space of diffusion models has not been extensively explored. Prior work diffusion autoencoders encode the semantic representations into a semantic latent code, which fails to reflect the rich information of details and the intrinsic feature hierarchy. To mitigate those limitations, we propose Hierarchical Diffusion Autoencoders (HDAE) that exploit the fine-grained-to-abstract and lowlevel-to-high-level feature hierarchy for the latent space of diffusion models. The hierarchical latent space of HDAE inherently encodes different abstract levels of semantics and provides more comprehensive semantic representations. In addition, we propose a truncated-feature-based approach for disentangled image manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach with extensive experiments and applications on image reconstruction, style mixing, controllable interpolation, detail-preserving and disentangled image manipulation, and multi-modal semantic image synthesis."}}

In contrast, such privilege has not yet fully benefited 3D deep learning, mainly due to the limited availability of large-scale 3D datasets. Merging multiple available data sources and letting them collaboratively train a single model is a potential solution. However, due to the large domain gap between 3D point cloud datasets, such mixed supervision could adversely affect the model's performance and lead to degenerated performance (i.e., negative transfer) compared to single-dataset training. In view of this challenge, we introduce Point Prompt Training (PPT), a novel framework for multi-dataset synergistic learning in the context of 3D representation learning that supports multiple pre-training paradigms. Based on this framework, we propose Prompt-driven Normalization, which adapts the model to different datasets with domain-specific prompts and Language-guided Categorical Alignment that decently unifies the multiple-dataset label spaces by leveraging the relationship between label text. Extensive experiments verify that PPT can overcome the negative transfer associated with synergistic learning and produce generalizable representations. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on each dataset using a single weight-shared model with supervised multi-dataset training. Moreover, when served as a pre-training framework, it outperforms other pre-training approaches regarding representation quality and attains remarkable state-of-the-art performance across over ten diverse downstream tasks spanning both indoor and outdoor 3D scenarios."}}

Our approach follows a \"noise-to-map\" generative paradigm for prediction by progressively removing noise from a random Gaussian distribution, guided by the image. The method, called DDP, efficiently extends the denoising diffusion process into the modern perception pipeline. Without task-specific design and architecture customization, DDP is easy to generalize to most dense prediction tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation and depth estimation. In addition, DDP shows attractive properties such as dynamic inference and uncertainty awareness, in contrast to previous single-step discriminative methods. We show top results on three representative tasks with six diverse benchmarks, without tricks, DDP achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on each task compared to the specialist counterparts. For example, semantic segmentation (83.9 mIoU on Cityscapes), BEV map segmentation (70.6 mIoU on nuScenes), and depth estimation (0.05 REL on KITTI).

It is extremely challenging because of the limited data and annotations (bounding boxes with class labels or text descriptions) of 3D scenes. Previous approaches leverage large-scale richly-annotated image datasets as a bridge between 3D and category semantics but require an extra alignment process between 2D images and 3D points, limiting the open-vocabulary ability of 3D detectors. Instead of leveraging 2D images, we propose Object2Scene, the first approach that leverages large-scale large-vocabulary 3D object datasets to augment existing 3D scene datasets for open-vocabulary 3D object detection. Object2Scene inserts objects from different sources into 3D scenes to enrich the vocabulary of 3D scene datasets and generates text descriptions for the newly inserted objects. We further introduce a framework that unifies 3D detection and visual grounding, named L3Det, and propose a cross-domain category-level contrastive learning approach to mitigate the domain gap between 3D objects from different datasets. Extensive experiments on existing open-vocabulary 3D object detection benchmarks show that Object2Scene obtains superior performance over existing methods. We further verify the effectiveness of Object2Scene on a new benchmark OV-ScanNet-200, by holding out all rare categories as novel categories not seen during training."}}
