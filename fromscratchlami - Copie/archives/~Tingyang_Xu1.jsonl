The key idea for GNNs is to obtain informative representation through aggregating information from local neighborhoods. However, it remains an open question whether the neighborhood information is adequately aggregated for learning representations of nodes with few neighbors. To address this, we propose a simple and efficient data augmentation strategy, local augmentation, to learn the distribution of the node features of the neighbors conditioned on the central node's feature and enhance GNN's expressive power with generated features. Local augmentation is a general framework that can be applied to any GNN model in a plug-and-play manner. It samples feature vectors associated with each node from the learned conditional distribution as additional input for the backbone model at each training iteration. Extensive experiments and analyses show that local augmentation consistently yields performance improvement when applied to various GNN architectures across a diverse set of benchmarks. For example, experiments show that plugging in local augmentation to GCN and GAT improves by an average of 3.4% and 1.6% in terms of test accuracy on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. Besides, our experimental results on large graphs (OGB) show that our model consistently improves performance over backbones. Code is available at https://github.com/SongtaoLiu0823/LAGNN."}}

Deep learning has achieved great success in this task, but relies heavily on abundant annotated data. However, annotating molecules is particularly costly because it often requires lab experiments conducted by experts. Active Learning (AL) tackles this issue by querying (i.e., selecting) the most valuable samples to annotate, according to two criteria: uncertainty of the model and diversity of data. Combining both criteria (a.k.a. hybrid AL) generally leads to better performance than using only one single criterion. However, existing best hybrid methods rely on some trade-off hyperparameters for balancing uncertainty and diversity, and hence need to carefully tune the hyperparameters in each experiment setting, causing great annotation and time inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel AL method that jointly models uncertainty and diversity without the trade-off hyperparameters. Specifically, we model the joint distribution of the labeled data and the model prediction. Based on this distribution, we introduce a Minimum Maximum Probability Querying (MMPQ) strategy, in which a single selection score naturally captures how the model is uncertain about its prediction, and how dissimilar the sample is to the currently labeled data. To model the joint distribution, we adapt the energy-based models to the non-Euclidean molecular graph data, by learning chemically-meaningful embedding vectors as the proxy of the graphs. We perform extensive experiments on binary classification datasets. Results show that our method achieves superior AL performance, outperforming existing methods by a large margin. We also conduct ablation studies to verify different design choices of our approach."}}

The majority of existing works study methodologies of set function learning under the function value oracle, which, however, requires expensive supervision signals. This renders it impractical for applications with only weak supervisions under the Optimal Subset (OS) oracle, the study of which is surprisingly overlooked. In this work, we present a principled yet practical maximum likelihood learning framework, termed as EquiVSet,  that simultaneously meets the following desiderata of learning neural set functions under the OS oracle: i) permutation invariance of the set mass function being modeled; ii) permission of varying ground set; iii) minimum prior and iv) scalability. The main components of our framework involve: an energy-based treatment of the set mass function, DeepSet-style architectures to handle permutation invariance, mean-field variational inference, and its amortized variants. Thanks to the delicate combination of these advanced architectures, empirical studies on three real-world applications (including  Amazon product recommendation, set anomaly detection, and compound selection for virtual screening) demonstrate that EquiVSet outperforms the baselines by a large margin.

To cope with this issue, we propose a diversified multiscale graph learning model equipped with two core ingredients:  a graph self-correction mechanism to generate informative embedded graphs, and a diversity boosting regularizer to achieve a comprehensive characterization of the input graph. The proposed mechanism compensates the pooled graph with the lost information during the graph pooling process by feeding back the estimated residual graph, which serves as a plug-in component for popular graph pooling methods. Meanwhile, pooling methods enhanced with the self-correcting procedure encourage the discrepancy of node embeddings, and thus it contributes to the success of ensemble learning strategy. The proposed regularizer instead enhances the ensemble diversity at the graph-level embeddings by leveraging the interaction among individual classifiers. Extensive experiments on popular graph classification benchmarks show that the approaches lead to significant improvements over state-of-the-art graph pooling methods, and the ensemble multiscale graph learning models achieve superior enhancement."}}

The challenges mainly stem from that the interacting systems are exponentially-compositional, symmetrical, and commonly geometrically-constrained. Current methods, particularly the ones based on equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have targeted on the first two challenges but remain immature for constrained systems. In this paper, we propose Graph Mechanics Network (GMN) which is combinatorially efficient, equivariant and constraint-aware. The core of GMN is that it represents, by generalized coordinates, the forward kinematics information (positions and velocities) of a structural object. In this manner, the geometrical constraints are implicitly and naturally encoded in the forward kinematics. Moreover, to allow equivariant message passing in GMN, we have developed a general form of orthogonality-equivariant functions, given that the dynamics of constrained systems are more complicated than the unconstrained counterparts. Theoretically, the proposed equivariant formulation is proved to be universally expressive under certain conditions. Extensive experiments support the advantages of GMN compared to the state-of-the-art GNNs in terms of prediction accuracy, constraint satisfaction and data efficiency on the simulated systems consisting of particles, sticks and hinges, as well as two real-world datasets for molecular dynamics prediction and human motion capture."}}

Existing methods mainly attempt to mine user interests from users' historical behaviours, which contain users' directly interacted items. Although these methods have made great progress, they are often limited by the recommender system's direct exposure and inactive interactions, and thus fail to mine all potential user interests. To tackle these problems, we propose Neighbor-Interaction based CTR prediction (NI-CTR), which considers this task under a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) setting. In short, Neighbor-Interaction based CTR prediction involves the local neighborhood of the target user-item pair in the HIN to predict their linkage. In order to guide the representation learning of the local neighbourhood, we further consider different kinds of interactions among the local neighborhood nodes from both explicit and implicit perspective, and propose a novel Graph-Masked Transformer (GMT) to effectively incorporates these kinds of interactions to produce highly representative embeddings for the target user-item pair. Moreover, in order to improve model robustness against neighbour sampling, we enforce a consistency regularization loss over the neighbourhood embedding. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets with millions of instances and the experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CTR models significantly. Meanwhile, the comprehensive ablation studies verify the effectiveness of every component of our model. Furthermore, we have deployed this framework on the WeChat Official Account Platform with billions of users.

In spite of its extensive use in many fields, such as ADMET prediction, virtual screening, protein folding and generative chemistry, little has been explored in terms of the out-of-distribution (OOD) learning problem with \\emph{noise}, which is inevitable in real world AIDD applications. In this work, we present DrugOOD, a systematic OOD dataset curator and benchmark for AI-aided drug discovery, which comes with an open-source Python package that fully automates the data curation and OOD benchmarking processes. We focus on one of the most crucial problems in AIDD: drug target binding affinity prediction, which involves both macromolecule (protein target) and small-molecule (drug compound). In contrast to only providing fixed datasets, DrugOOD offers automated dataset curator with user-friendly customization scripts, rich domain annotations aligned with biochemistry knowledge, realistic noise annotations and rigorous benchmarking of state-of-the-art OOD algorithms. Since the molecular data is often modeled as irregular graphs using graph neural network (GNN) backbones, DrugOOD also serves as a valuable testbed for \\emph{graph OOD learning} problems. Extensive empirical studies have shown a significant performance gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution experiments, which highlights the need to develop better schemes that can allow for OOD generalization under noise for AIDD."}}
