A variety of techniques have been developed to construct more effective macro actions. However, they usually fail to provide an approach for combining macro actions to form a synergistic macro action ensemble. A synergistic macro action ensemble performs better than individual macro actions within it. Motivated by the recent advances of neural architecture search, we formulate the construction of a synergistic macro action ensemble as a sequential decision problem and evaluate the ensemble in a task. The formulation of sequential decision problem enables coherency in the macro actions to be considered. Also, our evaluation procedure takes synergism into account since the synergism among the macro action ensemble exhibits when jointly used by an agent. The experimental results show that our framework is able to discover synergistic macro action ensembles. We further perform experiments to validate the synergism property among the macro actions in an ensemble."}}

Unfortunately, the reality gap between synthetic and real visual data prohibits direct migration of the models trained in virtual worlds to the real world. This paper proposes a modular architecture for tackling the virtual-to-real problem. The proposed architecture separates the learning model into a perception module and a control policy module, and uses semantic image segmentation as the meta representation for relating these two modules. \u00a0The perception module translates the perceived RGB image to semantic image segmentation. \u00a0The control policy module is implemented as a deep reinforcement learning agent, which performs actions based on the translated image segmentation. Our architecture is evaluated in an obstacle avoidance task and a target following task. \u00a0Experimental results show that our architecture significantly outperforms all of the baseline methods in both virtual and real environments, and demonstrates a faster learning curve than them. \u00a0We also present a detailed analysis for a variety of variant configurations, and validate the transferability of our modular architecture."}}
