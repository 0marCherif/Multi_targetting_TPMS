In this work, we demonstrate that sponge attacks can also be implanted at training time, when model training is outsourced to a third party, via an attack that we call sponge poisoning. This attack allows one to increase the energy consumption and latency of machine-learning models indiscriminately on each test-time input. We present a novel formalization for sponge poisoning, overcoming the limitations related to the optimization of test-time sponge examples, and show that this attack is possible even if the attacker only controls a few poisoning samples and model updates. Our extensive experimental analysis, involving two deep learning architectures and three datasets, shows that sponge poisoning can almost completely vanish the effect of such hardware accelerators. Finally, we analyze activations of the resulting sponge models, identifying the module components that are more sensitive to this vulnerability."}}

However, the trustworthiness of the resulting models can be compromised when such data is maliciously manipulated to mislead the learning process. In this article, we first review poisoning attacks that compromise the training data used to learn machine-learning models, including attacks that aim to reduce the overall performance, manipulate the predictions on specific test samples, and even implant backdoors in the model. We then discuss how to mitigate these attacks before, during, and after model training. We conclude our article by formulating some relevant open challenges which are hindering the development of testing methods and benchmarks suitable for assessing and improving the trustworthiness of machine-learning models against data poisoning attacks."}}

The training data is used to learn new models or update existing ones, assuming that it is sufficiently representative of the data that will be encountered at test time. This assumption is challenged by the threat of poisoning, an attack that manipulates the training data to compromise the model's performance at test time. Although poisoning has been acknowledged as a relevant threat in industry applications, and a variety of different attacks and defenses have been proposed so far, a complete systematization and critical review of the field is still missing. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive systematization of poisoning attacks and defenses in machine learning, reviewing more than 100 papers published in the field in the last 15 years. We start by categorizing the current threat models and attacks, and then organize existing defenses accordingly. While we focus mostly on computer-vision applications, we argue that our systematization also encompasses state-of-the-art attacks and defenses for other data modalities. Finally, we discuss existing resources for research in poisoning, and shed light on the current limitations and open research questions in this research field."}}

Although backdoor attacks have been demonstrated in a variety of settings and against different models, the factors affecting their effectiveness are still not well understood. In this work, we provide a unifying framework to study the process of backdoor learning under the lens of incremental learning and influence functions. We show that the effectiveness of backdoor attacks depends on: (i) the complexity of the learning algorithm, controlled by its hyperparameters; (ii) the fraction of backdoor samples injected into the training set; and (iii) the size and visibility of the backdoor trigger. These factors affect how fast a model learns to correlate the presence of the backdoor trigger with the target class. Our analysis unveils the intriguing existence of a region in the hyperparameter space in which the accuracy on clean test samples is still high while backdoor attacks are ineffective, thereby suggesting novel criteria to improve existing defenses."}}

Due to the widespread use of these applications, a robustness analysis of this family of algorithms against adversarial noise has become imperative. To the best of our knowledge, however, only a few works have currently addressed this problem. In an attempt to fill this gap, in this work, we propose a black-box adversarial attack for crafting adversarial samples to test the robustness of clustering algorithms. We formulate the problem as a constrained minimization program, general in its structure and customizable by the attacker according to her capability constraints. We do not assume any information about the internal structure of the victim clustering algorithm, and we allow the attacker to query it as a service only. In the absence of any derivative information, we perform the optimization with a custom approach inspired by the Abstract Genetic Algorithm (AGA). In the experimental part, we demonstrate the sensibility of different single and ensemble clustering algorithms against our crafted adversarial samples on different scenarios. Furthermore, we perform a comparison of our algorithm with a state-of-the-art approach showing that we are able to reach or even outperform its performance. Finally, to highlight the general nature of the generated noise, we show that our attacks are transferable even against supervised algorithms such as SVMs, random forests, and neural networks."}}
