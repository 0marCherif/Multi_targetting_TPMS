Although recent work has shown that there can be significant improvements in OOS detection when the intent classes are represented as dense-vectors based on domain specific knowledge, we argue in this paper that such gains are more likely due to advantages of dense-vector to one-hot encoding methods in representing the complexity of the OOS space. We start by showing how dense-vector encodings can create OOS spaces with much richer topologies than one-hot encoding methods. We then demonstrate empirically, using four standard intent classification datasets, that knowledge-free, randomly generated dense-vector encodings of intent classes can yield massive, over 20% gains over one-hot encodings, and also outperform the previous, domain knowledge-based, SOTA of one of the datasets. We finish by describing a novel algorithm to search for good dense-vector encodings and present initial but promising experimental results of its use."}}

This is done in the context of a real-world practice of curators of conversational systems who often embed taxonomically-structured meta-knowledge into their documentation. The paper provides evidence that the practice is quite common among curators, that is used as part of their collaborative practices, and that the embedded knowledge can be mined by algorithms. Further, this meta-knowledge can be integrated, using neuro-symbolic algorithms, to the machine learning-based conversational system, to improve its run-time accuracy and to enable tools to support curatorial tasks. Those results point towards new ways of designing development tools which explore an integrated use of code and documentation by machines."}}

These systems have improved operational efficiency by reducing the cost of customer service and more and more are used in customer service channels. More recently, with the addition of speech capabilities added to those systems, bot language modifications have to be done in order to improve user experience. In this paper, we analyze the language used in those systems using datasets collected from real chatbots. For that, we first propose models that are able to identify the language style (writing, speech, and computer-mediated) using as linguist features syntactic (Biber's dimensions) and sentence embeddings as well as state-of-art datasets. Our results show that our models were able to distinguish among the three classes with an accuracy of up to 66%. Finally, we evaluate real chatbots systems, either speech- and text-based ones, using our proposed models. We found that these real chatbots are generally using a computer-mediated style, but there is indication that their developers tend to adapt the language style to be more speech-like when text-to-speech is used."}}

The main goal is to demonstrate a way to take advantage of a pool of systems, since in the literature several systems have been proposed for the task, and the results have been improving considerably. Note though, that such systems can behave differently, better or worse than the other ones, according to the input. For this reason, in this work we investigate the benefits of exploiting multiple systems at once, in a single-engine, in order to select the most appropriate simplification output from a pool of candidate outputs. In such an engine, a multi-critera decision making approach selects the final output considering simplicity and similarity scores, by comparing the candidates with the input. Results on both the Turk and WikiSmall corpora indicate that the proposed framework is able to balance the trade-off between bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU), system output against references and against the input sentence (SARI), and Flesch reading ease scores for existing state-of-the art models."}}

In a text-based chat group, the only information available is the sender, the content of the text and the dialogue history. In this paper we present our study on how these information can be used on the prediction task through a corpus and architecture that integrates turn-taking classifiers based on Maximum Likelihood Expectation (MLE), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Finite State Automata (FSA). The corpus is a synthetic adaptation of the Multi-Domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset (MultiWOZ) to a multiple travel service-based bots scenario with dialogue errors and was created to simulate user's interaction and evaluate the architecture. We present experimental results which show that the CNN approach achieves better performance than the baseline with an accuracy of 92.34%, but the integrated solution with MLE, CNN and FSA achieves performance even better, with 95.65%."}}

This paper explores what types of content voice-based AI conversational systems should have to attend visitors' expectations in a museum. The study analyses 142,463 conversation logs from 5,242 unique sessions of a nine-month long deployment of a voice-based interactive guide in a modern art museum in Brazil. In this experiment, visitors freely asked questions about seven different artworks of different styles. By grouping the visitor utterances into eight types of content, we determined that more than half of the visitors asked about the meanings and intentions behind the artwork, followed by facts about the artwork and author-related questions. We also determined that the types of questions were not affected by each artwork, the artwork style, or its physical location. We also saw some relationships between the visitor's overall evaluation of the experience with the types of questions she asked. Based on those results, we identified implications for designing content for voice-based conversational systems in museums."}}

Given that people tend to post texts expressing opinions or emotions of varied intensities regarding given real-world events, the main idea is to create corpus containing pairs of posts with opposite tone but about the same topic. By doing so we overcome the main limitation of current tone rephrasing methods: the lack of appropriate parallel training corpora. We explore different methods to create the datasets, including some which require some level of manual labelling. The results show that a completely automatic generation from Twitter data yields training datasets which are better than those with manual interventions, and good enough for Seq2Seq models to outperform non-Seq2Seq models trained with similar data."}}

Hundreds of illegal interventions have been reported around the world, causing a significant number of deaths, relevant impacts on the environment, and capital loss. Therefore, it is important to develop systems that are able to detect such scenarios at an early stage, enabling a fast counteract. To this end, machine learning algorithms can train models on available data for detecting future issues. Most recently, ensemble learning and dynamic classifier selection (DCS) techniques have been achieving promising results in supervised learning tasks. Such models are usually trained based on a single criterion. However, it is desirable to take into account both the number of false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) for the illegal tapping detection task, since they are conflicting and both lead to financial losses and/or accidents. Therefore, this work proposes a novel DCS technique based on multiple criteria, namely overall local class-specific accuracy (OLCA), which employs multi-criteria decision making for dynamically selecting the best classifier for a new sample given the local true positive and negative ratios. A numerical experiment is conducted for assessing the generalization performance of the proposed method in an oil pipeline, with the goal of detecting illegal taping using pressure transient signals. Results show that OLCA is able to reduce the number of both FP and FN when dynamically selecting the classifiers of a baseline Random Forest ensemble."}}
