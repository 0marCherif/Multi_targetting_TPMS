In the tabular data classification scenario, with the emergence of the transformer architecture, a number of algorithms have been reported to yield better results than conventional tree-based models. Most of these methods attribute the success of deep learning methods to the expressive feature construction capability of neural networks. Nonetheless, in real practice, manually designed high-order features with traditional machine learning methods are still widely used because neural-network-based features can be easy to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose an evolution-based feature engineering algorithm to imitate the manual feature construction process through trial and improvement. Importantly, the evolutionary method provides an opportunity to optimize cross-validation loss, where gradient methods fail to do so. On a large-scale classification benchmark of 119 datasets, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing fine-tuned state-of-the-art tree-based and deep-learning-based classification algorithms."}}
