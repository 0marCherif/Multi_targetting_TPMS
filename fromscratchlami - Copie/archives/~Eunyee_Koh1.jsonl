Unlike many internet scale systems that use a singular set of search terms and return a ranked list of options from amongst thousands, our system uses multi-turn user dialog to deeply understand the user\u2019s preferences. The system responds in context to the user\u2019s specific and immediate feedback to make sequential recommendations. We envision our system would be highly useful in situations with intrinsic constraints, such as finding the right restaurant within walking distance or the right retail item within a limited inventory. Our research prototype instantiates the former use case, leveraging real data from Google Places, Yelp, and Zomato. We evaluated our system against a similar system that did not incorporate user feedback in a 16 person remote study, generating 64 scenario-based search journeys. When our recommendation system was successfully triggered, we saw both an increase in efficiency and a higher confidence rating with respect to final user choice. We also found that users preferred our system (75%) compared with the baseline."}}

People often express their preferences in terms of a critique of the current recommendation (e.g., \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good for a date\u201d), requiring some degree of common sense for a preference to be inferred. In this work, we present a method for transforming a user critique into a positive preference (e.g., \u201cI prefer more romantic\u201d) in order to retrieve reviews pertaining to potentially better recommendations (e.g., \u201cPerfect for a romantic dinner\u201d). We leverage a large neural language model (LM) in a few-shot setting to perform critique-to-preference transformation, and we test two methods for retrieving recommendations: one that matches embeddings, and another that fine-tunes an LM for the task. We instantiate this approach in the restaurant domain and evaluate it using a new dataset of restaurant critiques. In an ablation study, we show that utilizing critique-to-preference transformation improves recommendations, and that there are at least three general cases that explain this improved performance."}}

The online setting has an additional requirement of maintaining a valid solution at any point in time. For solving these new problems, we propose algorithms with theoretical guarantees, evaluate them on several real-world datasets, and show that they give comparable performance to state-of-the-art offline algorithms that store the entire data in memory and take multiple passes over it."}}

Although many networks contain this type of temporal information, the majority of research in network representation learning has focused on static snapshots of the graph and has largely ignored the temporal dynamics of the network. In this work, we describe a general framework for incorporating temporal information into network embedding methods. The framework gives rise to methods for learning time-respecting embeddings from continuous-time dynamic networks. Overall, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and dynamic network embedding approach as it achieves an average gain of 11.9% across all methods and graphs. The results indicate that modeling temporal dependencies in graphs is important for learning appropriate and meaningful network representations."}}

A critical prerequisite to personalization is establishing user identity. However the variety of devices, including mobile phones, appliances, and smart watches, from which users access web services from both anonymous and logged-in sessions poses a significant obstacle to user identification. The resulting entity resolution task of establishing user identity across devices and sessions is commonly referred to as ``visitor stitching.'' We introduce a general, probabilistic approach to visitor stitching using features and attributes commonly contained in web logs. Using web logs from two real-world corporate websites, we motivate the need for probabilistic models by quantifying the difficulties posed by noise, ambiguity, and missing information in deployment. Next, we introduce our approach using probabilistic soft logic (PSL), a statistical relational learning framework capable of capturing similarities across many sessions and enforcing transitivity. We present a detailed description of model features and design choices relevant to the visitor stitching problem. Finally, we evaluate our PSL model on binary classification performance for two real-world visitor stitching datasets. Our model demonstrates significantly better performance than several state-of-the-art classifiers, and we show how this advantage results from collective reasoning across sessions."}}

As a result, identifying users with similar usage patterns within these large sets of web logs is increasingly challenging and critical for personalization and user experience in many areas, from recommender systems to digital marketing. In this work, we explore the use of visual search for top-k user retrieval based on similar user behavior. We introduce a convolution neural network (WimNet) that learns latent representation from a set of web logs represented as images. Specifically, it contains two convolution layers take row- and column-wise convolutions to capture user behavior across multiple devices and websites and learns latent representation and reconstructs a transition matrix between user activities of given web logs. To evaluate our method, we conduct conventional top-k retrieval task on the simulated dataset, and the preliminary analysis results suggest that our method produces more accurate and robust results regardless of the complexity of query log."}}

Those items could be represented as nodes in a graph while viewing their relationships as edges according to the user actions. Based on the item graph, identifying items that attract users to purchase the target item could be practically used for supporting business decisions. To do this, we introduce a new task, called `Purchase Influence Mining', that finds the top-k items (PIM-items) maximizing the estimated purchase influence from them to a target item. We solve this problem by modeling the purchase influence as the shortest path between item pair. According to the result, our approach more consistently finds the k PIM-items than the baseline."}}
