To tackle this problem, knowledge distillation (KD) can be employed to compress the huge model by constructing a simple teacher-student learning framework. Different from the traditional CNN detectors, where the distillation targets can be naturally aligned through the feature map, DETR regards object detection as a set prediction problem, leading to an unclear relationship between teacher and student during distillation. In this paper, we propose DETRDistill, a novel knowledge distillation dedicated to DETR-families. We first explore a sparse matching paradigm with progressive stage-by-stage instance distillation. Considering the diverse attention mechanisms adopted in different DETRs, we propose attention-agnostic feature distillation module to overcome the ineffectiveness of conventional feature imitation. Finally, to fully leverage the intermediate products from the teacher, we introduce teacher-assisted assignment distillation, which greatly alleviates the instability of label assignment caused by bipartite graph matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our distillation method achieves significant improvement on various competitive DETR approaches, without introducing extra consumption in the inference phase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study to explore a general distillation method for DETR-style detectors."}}

Owing to its low cost and high efficiency, multi-view 3D object detection has demonstrated promising application prospects. However, accurately detecting objects through perspective views is extremely difficult due to the lack of depth information. Current approaches tend to adopt heavy backbones for image encoders, making them inapplicable for real-world deployment. Different from the images, LiDAR points are superior in providing spatial cues, resulting in highly precise localization. In this paper, we explore the incorporation of LiDAR-based detectors for multi-view 3D object detection. Instead of directly training a depth prediction network, we unify the image and LiDAR features in the Bird-Eye-View (BEV) space and adaptively transfer knowledge across non-homogenous representations in a teacher-student paradigm. To this end, we propose BEVDistill, a cross-modal BEV knowledge distillation (KD) framework for multi-view 3D object detection. \nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current KD approaches on a highly-competitive baseline, BEVFormer, without introducing any extra cost in the inference phase. Notably, our best model achieves 59.4 NDS on the nuScenes test leaderboard, achieving new state-of-the-arts in comparison with various image-based detectors.

However, drastic performance degradation remains an unwell-studied challenge for practical cross-domain deployment as the lack of labels on the target domain. In this paper, we first comprehensively investigate the significant underlying factor of the domain gap in Mono3D, where the critical observation is a depth-shift issue caused by the geometric misalignment of domains. Then, we propose STMono3D, a new self-teaching framework for unsupervised domain adaptation on Mono3D. To mitigate the depth-shift, we introduce the geometry-aligned multi-scale training strategy to disentangle the camera parameters and guarantee the geometry consistency of domains. Based on this, we develop a teacher-student paradigm to generate adaptive pseudo labels on the target domain. Benefiting from the end-to-end framework that provides richer information of the pseudo labels, we propose the quality-aware supervision strategy to take instance-level pseudo confidences into account and improve the effectiveness of the target-domain training process. Moreover, the positive focusing training strategy and dynamic threshold are proposed to handle tremendous FN and FP pseudo samples. STMono3D achieves remarkable performance on all evaluated datasets and even surpasses fully supervised results on the KITTI 3D object detection dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore effective UDA methods for Mono3D."}}

We start with a meticulous pilot study to demonstrate that the long-range correlation is essential for accurate depth estimation. Therefore, we propose to leverage the Transformer to model this global context with an effective attention mechanism. We also adopt an additional convolution branch to preserve the local information as the Transformer lacks the spatial inductive bias in modeling such contents. However, independent branches lead to a shortage of connections between features. To bridge this gap, we design a hierarchical aggregation and heterogeneous interaction module to enhance the Transformer features via element-wise interaction and model the affinity between the Transformer and the CNN features in a set-to-set translation manner. Due to the unbearable memory cost caused by global attention on high-resolution feature maps, we introduce the deformable scheme to reduce the complexity. Extensive experiments on the KITTI, NYU, and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate that our proposed model, termed DepthFormer, surpasses state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods with prominent margins. Notably, it achieves the most competitive result on the highly competitive KITTI depth estimation benchmark.

The former can provide accurate localization of objects, and the latter is denser and richer in semantic information. Recently, AutoAlign presents a learnable paradigm in combining these two modalities for 3D object detection. However, it suffers from high computational cost introduced by the global-wise attention. To solve the problem, we propose Cross-Domain DeformCAFA module in this work. It attends to sparse learnable sampling points for cross-modal relational modeling, which enhances the tolerance to calibration error and greatly speeds up the feature aggregation across different modalities. To overcome the complex GT-AUG under multi-modal settings, we design a simple yet effective cross-modal augmentation strategy on convex combination of image patches given their depth information. Moreover, by carrying out a novel image-level dropout training scheme, our model is able to infer in a dynamic manner. To this end, we propose AutoAlignV2, a faster and stronger multi-modal 3D detection framework, built on top of AutoAlign. Extensive experiments on nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AutoAlignV2.

However, accurately detecting objects through perspective views in the 3D space is extremely difficult due to the lack of depth information. Recently, DETR3D introduces a novel 3D-2D query paradigm in aggregating multi-view images for 3D object detection and achieves state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, with intensive pilot experiments, we quantify the objects located at different regions and find that the \"truncated instances'' (i.e., at the border regions of each image) are the main bottleneck hindering the performance of DETR3D. Although it merges multiple features from two adjacent views in the overlapping regions, DETR3D still suffers from insufficient feature aggregation, thus missing the chance to fully boost the detection performance. In an effort to tackle the problem, we propose Graph-DETR3D to automatically aggregate multi-view imagery information through graph structure learning. It constructs a dynamic 3D graph between each object query and 2D feature maps to enhance the object representations, especially at the border regions. Besides, Graph-DETR3D benefits from a novel depth-invariant multi-scale training strategy, which maintains the visual depth consistency by simultaneously scaling the image size and the object depth. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our Graph-DETR3D.

While tremendous successful methods have obtained excellent results, most of them are computationally expensive and not applicable for real-time on-device inference. In this paper, we aim to address more practical applications of monocular depth estimation, where the solution should consider not only the precision but also the inference time on mobile devices. To this end, we first develop an end-to-end learning-based model with a tiny weight size (1.4MB) and a short inference time (27FPS on Raspberry Pi 4). Then, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy, called R2 crop, to boost the model performance. Moreover, we observe that the simple lightweight model trained with only one single loss term will suffer from performance bottleneck. To alleviate this issue, we adopt multiple loss terms to provide sufficient constraints during the training stage. Furthermore, with a simple dynamic re-weight strategy, we can avoid the time-consuming hyper-parameter choice of loss terms. Finally, we adopt the structure-aware distillation to further improve the model performance. Notably, our solution named LiteDepth ranks 2nd in the MAI&AIM2022 Monocular Depth Estimation Challenge}, with a si-RMSE of 0.311, an RMSE of 3.79, and the inference time is 37$ms$ tested on the Raspberry Pi 4.

Instead of establishing deterministic correspondence with camera projection matrix, we model the mapping relationship between the image and point clouds with a learnable alignment map. This map enables our model to automate the alignment of non-homogenous features in a dynamic and data-driven manner. Specifically, a cross-attention feature alignment module is devised to adaptively aggregate pixel-level image features for each voxel. To enhance the semantic consistency during feature alignment, we also design a self-supervised cross-modal feature interaction module, through which the model can learn feature aggregation with instance-level feature guidance. Extensive experimental results show that our approach can lead to 2.3 mAP and 7.0 mAP improvements on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets respectively.

However, most of the methods are generally designed on the RGB image domain. Due to the discrepancy between the two-dimensional image plane and the three-dimensional space, such pre-trained models fail to perceive spatial information and serve as sub-optimal solutions for 3D-related tasks. To bridge this gap, we aim to learn a spatial-aware visual representation that can describe the three-dimensional space and is more suitable and effective for these tasks. To leverage point clouds, which are much more superior in providing spatial information compared to images, we propose a simple yet effective 2D Image and 3D Point cloud Unsupervised pre-training strategy, called SimIPU. Specifically, we develop a multi-modal contrastive learning framework that consists of an intra-modal spatial perception module to learn a spatial-aware representation from point clouds and an inter-modal feature interaction module to transfer the capability of perceiving spatial information from the point cloud encoder to the image encoder, respectively. Positive pairs for contrastive losses are established by the matching algorithm and the projection matrix. The whole framework is trained in an unsupervised end-to-end fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore contrastive learning pre-training strategies for outdoor multi-modal datasets, containing paired camera images and LIDAR point clouds."}}

However, the current training pipeline for dense detectors is compromised to lots of conjunctions that may not hold. In this paper, we investigate three such important conjunctions: 1) only samples assigned as positive in classification head are used to train the regression head; 2) classification and regression share the same input feature and computational fields defined by the parallel head architecture; and 3) samples distributed in different feature pyramid layers are treated equally when computing the loss. We first carry out a series of pilot experiments to show disentangling such conjunctions can lead to persistent performance improvement.
