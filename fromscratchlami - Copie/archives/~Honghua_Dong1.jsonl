Given any input graph, we create multi-scale graphs using graph pooling. Then, we connect them into a mega graph by bridging inter-graph edges according to the graph pooling results. Instead of universally stacking graph convolutions over the mega graph, we apply general graph convolutions over intra-graph edges, while the convolutions over inter-graph edges follow a bidirectional pathway to deliver the information along the hierarchy for one turn. Graph convolution and graph pooling are two core elementary operations of MeGraph. In our implementation, we adopt the graph full network (GFuN) and propose the stridden edge contraction pooling (S-EdgePool) with adjustable pooling ratio, which are extended from conventional graph convolution and edge contraction pooling. The MeGraph model enables information exchange across multi-scale graphs, repeatedly, for deeper understanding of wide-range correlations in graphs. This distinguishes MeGraph from many recent hierarchical graph neural networks like Graph U-Nets. We conduct comprehensive empirical studies on tens of public datasets, in which we observe consistent performance gains comparing to baselines. Specifically, we establish 5 new graph theory benchmark tasks that require long-term inference and deduction to solve, where MeGraph demonstrates dominated performance compared with popular graph neural networks."}}

To discover compositional structures of the data, we propose the Scattering Compositional Learner (SCL), an architecture that composes neural networks in a sequence. Our SCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two RPM datasets, with a 48.7% relative improvement on Balanced-RAVEN and 26.4% on PGM over the previous state-of-the-art. We additionally show that our model discovers compositional representations of objects' attributes (e.g., shape color, size), and their relationships (e.g., progression, union). We also find that the compositional representation makes the SCL significantly more robust to test-time domain shifts and greatly improves zero-shot generalization to previously unseen analogies."}}

In the multi-agent setting, a DRL agent\u2019s policy can easily get stuck in a poor local optima w.r.t. its training partners \u2013 the learned policy may be only locally optimal to other agents\u2019 current policies. In this paper, we focus on the problem of training robust DRL agents with continuous actions in the multi-agent learning setting so that the trained agents can still generalize when its opponents\u2019 policies alter. To tackle this problem, we proposed a new algorithm, MiniMax Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (M3DDPG) with the following contributions: (1) we introduce a minimax extension of the popular multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (MADDPG), for robust policy learning; (2) since the continuous action space leads to computational intractability in our minimax learning objective, we propose Multi-Agent Adversarial Learning (MAAL) to efficiently solve our proposed formulation. We empirically evaluate our M3DDPG algorithm in four mixed cooperative and competitive multi-agent environments and the agents trained by our method significantly outperforms existing baselines."}}

This memory records structured trajectories that have led to interesting states in the past, and can be used by the agent to revisit those states more effectively.  In high-dimensional decision making problems, where deep reinforcement learning is considered crucial, our approach provides a simple, transparent and effective way that can be naturally combined with complex, deep learning models.  We show how such explicit memory may be used to enhance existing exploration algorithms such as intrinsically motivated ones and count-based ones, and demonstrate our method's advantages in various simulated environments."}}

Hence, borrowing the idea from hierarchical reinforcement learning, we propose a framework that disentangles task and environment specific knowledge by separating them into two units. The environment-specific unit handles how to move from one state to the target state; and the task-specific unit plans for the next target state given a specific task.
