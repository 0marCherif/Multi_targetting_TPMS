Recent technological advances in singlecell genomics have enabled the measurement of multiple facets of cellular state, producing\ndatasets with millions of single-cell observations. While these data hold great promise\nfor understanding molecular mechanisms in health and disease, analysis challenges arising\nfrom sparsity, technical and biological variability, and high dimensionality of the data\nhinder the derivation of such mechanistic insights. To promote the innovation of algorithms\nfor analysis of multimodal single-cell data, we organized a competition at NeurIPS 2021\napplying the Common Task Framework to multimodal single-cell data integration. For\nthis competition we generated the first multimodal benchmarking dataset for single-cell\nbiology and defined three tasks in this domain: prediction of missing modalities, aligning\nmodalities, and learning a joint representation across modalities. We further specified\nevaluation metrics and developed a cloud-based algorithm evaluation pipeline. Using this\nsetup, 280 competitors submitted over 2600 proposed solutions within a 3 month period,\nshowcasing substantial innovation especially in the modality alignment task. Here, we\npresent the results, describe trends of well performing approaches, and discuss challenges\nassociated with running the competition."}}

Deep generative models have shown promising results for molecule generation, but the benefits of specific inductive biases for learning distributions over small graphs are unclear. Our study aims to investigate the impact of subgraph structures and vocabulary design on distribution learning, using small drug molecules as a case study. To this end, we introduce Subcover, a new subgraph-based fragmentation scheme, and evaluate it through a two-step variational auto-encoder. Our results show that Subcover\u2019s improved identification of chemically meaningful subgraphs leads to a relative improvement of the FCD score by 30%, outperforming previous methods. Our findings highlight the potential of Subcover to enhance the performance and scalability of existing methods, contributing to the advancement of drug discovery."}}

Recently, Parameterized Monge Maps (PMM) were introduced to learn the optimal map between two distributions.\nHere, we apply PMM to model single-cell dynamics and show that PMM fails to account for asymmetric shifts in cell state distributions. To alleviate this limitation, we propose Unbalanced Parameterised Monge Maps (UPMM). We first describe the novel formulation and show on synthetic data how our method extends discrete unbalanced OT to the continuous domain. Then, we demonstrate that UPMM outperforms well-established trajectory inference methods on real-world developmental single-cell data."}}

Besides assessing existing methods, we propose a regularization technique to sparsify ``input-output connections'' and extract relevant features during training. Moreover, we curate real-world datasets including human motion capture and human hematopoiesis single-cell RNA-seq data to realistically analyze different levels of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in forecasting and dynamics identification respectively. Our extensive empirical evaluation on these challenging benchmarks suggests that weight sparsity improves generalization in the presence of noise or irregular sampling. However, it does not prevent learning spurious feature dependencies in the inferred dynamics, rendering them impractical for predictions under interventions, or for inferring the true underlying dynamics. Instead, feature sparsity can indeed help with recovering sparse ground-truth dynamics compared to unregularized NODEs."}}

In this work, we introduce a minimal noise adaptation method based on a singular value decomposition (SVDNA) to overcome the domain gap between target domains from three different device manufacturers in retinal OCT imaging. Our method utilizes the difference in noise structure to successfully bridge the domain gap between different OCT devices and transfer the style from unlabeled target domain images to source images for which manual annotations are available. We demonstrate how this method, despite its simplicity, compares or even outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods for semantic segmentation on a public OCT dataset. SVDNA can be integrated with just a few lines of code into the augmentation pipeline of any network which is in contrast to many state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods which often need to change the underlying model architecture or train a separate style transfer model. The full code implementation for SVDNA will be made available at https://github.com/ValentinKoch/SVDNA ."}}
