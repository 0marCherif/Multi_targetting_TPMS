In particular, our proposed method BVPNet is streamlined to predict the blood volume pulse (BVP) signals from face videos. Towards this, we firstly define ROIs based on facial landmarks and then extract the raw temporal signal from each ROI. Then the extracted signals are pre-processed via first-order difference and Butterworth filter and combined to form a Spatial-Temporal map (STMap). We then propose to revise U-Net, in order to predict BVP signals from the STMap. BVPNet takes into account both temporal and frequency domain losses in order to learn better than conventional models. Our experimental results suggest that our BVPNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two publicly available datasets (MMSE-HR and VIPL-HR)."}}

Thus, they may suffer from poor generalization ability in unseen scenarios. This paper proposes a novel adversarial learning approach for rPPG based physiological measurement by using Dual Generative Adversarial Networks (Dual-GAN) to model the BVP estimation and noise distribution jointly. The BVP-GAN aims to learn a noise-resistant mapping from input to ground-truth BVP, and the Noise-GAN aims to learn the noise distribution. The dual GANs can promote each other's capability, leading to improved feature disentanglement between BVP and noises. Besides, a plug-and-play block named ROI alignment and fusion (ROI-AF) block is proposed to alleviate the inconsistencies between different ROIs and exploit informative features from a wider receptive field in terms of ROIs. In comparison to state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves better performance in heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiration frequency estimation from face videos."}}

The topic draws great interests,but the lack of publicly available benchmark databases and a fair validation platform are hindering its further development. Forthisconcern,weorganizethefirstchallenge on Remote Physiological Signal Sensing (RePSS), in which two databases of VIPL and OBF are provided as the bench mark for kin researchers to evaluate their approaches. The 1st challenge of RePSS focuses on measuring the average heart rate from facial videos, which is the basic problem of remote physiological measurement. This paper presents an overview of the challenge, including data, protocol, analysis of results and discussion. The top ranked solutions are highlighted to provide insights for researchers, and future directions are outlined for this topic and this challenge."}}
