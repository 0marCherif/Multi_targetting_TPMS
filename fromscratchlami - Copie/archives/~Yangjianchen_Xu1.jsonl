We aimed to estimate the time-varying effects of primary and booster COVID-19 vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection on subsequent omicron infection and severe illness (hospital admission or death) in children younger than 12 years of age.\n\nMethods\n\nIn this observational cohort study, we obtained individual-level records on vaccination with the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines and clinical outcomes from the North Carolina COVID-19 Surveillance System and the COVID-19 Vaccine Management System for 1\u2009368\u2009721 North Carolina residents aged 11 years or younger from Oct 29, 2021 (Oct 29, 2021 for children aged 5\u201311 years and June 17, 2022 for children aged 0\u20134 years), to Jan 6, 2023. We used Cox regression to estimate the time-varying effects of primary and booster vaccination and previous infection on the risks of omicron infection, hospital admission, and death.\n\nFindings\n\nFor children 5\u201311 years of age, the effectiveness of primary vaccination against infection, compared with being unvaccinated, was 59\u00b79% (95% CI 58\u00b75\u201361\u00b72) at 1 month, 33\u00b77% (32\u00b76\u201334\u00b78) at 4 months, and 14\u00b79% (95% CI 12\u00b73\u201317\u00b75) at 10 months after the first dose. Compared with primary vaccination only, the effectiveness of a monovalent booster dose after 1 month was 24\u00b74% (14\u00b74\u201333\u00b72) and that of a bivalent booster dose was 76\u00b77% (45\u00b77\u201390\u00b70). The effectiveness of omicron infection against reinfection was 79\u00b79% (78\u00b78\u201380\u00b79) after 3 months and 53\u00b79% (52\u00b73\u201355\u00b75) after 6 months. For children 0\u20134 years of age, the effectiveness of primary vaccination against infection, compared with being unvaccinated, was 63\u00b78% (57\u00b70\u201369\u00b75) at 2 months and 58\u00b71% (48\u00b73\u201366\u00b71) at 5 months after the first dose, and the effectiveness of omicron infection against reinfection was 77\u00b73% (75\u00b79\u201378\u00b76) after 3 months and 64\u00b77% (63\u00b73\u201366\u00b71) after 6 months. For both age groups, vaccination and previous infection had better effectiveness against severe illness as measured by hospital admission or death as a composite endpoint than against infection.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines were effective against omicron infection and severe outcomes in children younger than 12 years, although the effectiveness decreased over time. Bivalent boosters were more effective than monovalent boosters. Immunity acquired via omicron infection was high and waned gradually over time. These findings can be used to develop effective prevention strategies against COVID-19 in children younger than 12 years.\n\nFunding\n\nUS National Institutes of Health."}}

We previously reported surveillance data from the state of North Carolina on the effectiveness of these two bivalent boosters over the first 3 months of deployment. Here, we present two additional months of data to show the durability of protection conferred by these two bivalent boosters when the omicron\u2019s BQ.1/BQ.1.1 and XBB/XBB.1.5 strains became predominant.\n\nWe used data on booster doses and clinical outcomes from September 1, 2022 to February 10, 2023 for all North Carolina residents 12 years of age or older. During this time period, 6,306,311 participants were eligible for bivalent boosters, and 1,279,802 received them; 253 of the 2,208 Covid-19 related hospitalizations and 79 of the 867 Covid-19 related deaths occurred after receipt of the bivalent booster.\n\nWe considered two different but non-exclusive outcome measures: severe infection resulting in hospitalization and severe infection resulting in hospitalization or death. We fit the Cox regression model with a timevarying hazard ratio of severe infection for each additional booster dose received, adjusting for the baseline characteristics shown in Table S1. We defined the booster effectiveness as one minus the hazard ratio, multiplied by 100%.\n\nThe estimation results are shown in Figure 1. Effectiveness against severe infection resulting in hospitalization reached a level of 62.3% (95% CI, 36.9 to 77.5) after 2 weeks and decreased to 47.4% (95% CI, 31.4 to 59.7), 43.4% (95% CI, 34.1 to 51.4), and 36.0% (95% CI, 9.0 to 55.0) after 4 weeks, 10 weeks, and 20 weeks, respectively.\n\nEffectiveness against severe infection resulting in hospitalization or death reached a level of 67.4% (95% CI, 46.2 to 80.2) after 2 weeks and decreased to 47.5% (95% CI, 32.6 to 59.2), 44.3% (95% CI, 35.7 to 51.7), and 38.4% (95% CI, 13.4 to 56.1) after 4 weeks, 10 weeks, and 20 weeks, respectively.\n\nWe also analyzed the data separately for participants who received bivalent boosters before November 1, 2022 (when BA.4/BA.5 were predominant) and after November 1,2022 (when BQ.1/BQ.1.1 became more prevalent and then were gradually replaced by XBB/XBB.1.5). The results are also shown in Figure 1. The ramping and waning patterns were broadly similar between the two booster cohorts.\n\nIn summary, bivalent boosters provided durable additional protection against hospitalization and death from omicron infection in persons who had previously been vaccinated or boosted. Although the two bivalent vaccines target the BA.4/BA.5 strains, they were also effective against the BQ.1/BQ.1.1 and XBB/XBB.1.5 strains."}}

We focused on new data collected during two months of bivalent boosters, September 1 to November 3, 2022, and the preceding two months of monovalent boosters, July 1 to August 31, 2022. During the July 1\u2013August 31 period, 162,280 of 6,407,930 eligible participants received monovalent boosters, and 127,047 cases of infection were reported, 1,114 and 469 of which were known to result in hospitalization and death, respectively. During the September 1\u2013November 3 period, 804,474 of 6,432,553 eligible participants received bivalent boosters, and 53,883 cases of infection were reported, 638 and 335 of which were known to result in hospitalization and death, respectively.\n\nWe used the Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by vaccination status at the start of each study period and with the booster dose as a time-dependent exposure, to estimate the hazard ratio of severe infection (resulting in hospitalization or death) for a single booster dose (i.e., first booster versus primary vaccination, second booster versus first booster, or third booster versus second booster), while adjusting for baseline characteristics. We defined the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) as one minus the hazard ratio, multiplied by 100%.\n\nFor all participants 12 years of age and older, the rVE of one monovalent or bivalent booster dose against severe infection resulting in hospitalization was estimated at 45.7% (95% CI, \u201314.5 to 74.2) or 75.2% (95% CI, 43.8 to 89.0), respectively. Of note, the rVE pertains to the additional benefit of a single booster dose; the absolute vaccine effectiveness (compared with the unvaccinated) would be much higher. We obtained similar rVE values when restricting to participants aged \u226518 or \u226565 years or to mRNA primary vaccine recipients; rVE values were higher for Moderna than Pfizer-BioNTech boosters. The results for the composite endpoint of hospitalization and death were similar to those of hospitalization.\n\nIn conclusion, bivalent boosters provided substantial additional protection against severe omicron infection in persons who had previously been vaccinated or boosted. The estimated effectiveness of bivalent boosters was much higher than that of monovalent boosters, although the estimates had considerable uncertainties due to the small numbers of events."}}

Recent case-control studies have shown modest short- term effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine for this age group during the early phase of the omicron era (from mid-December 2021 to mid- February 2022). Here, we report a large cohort study on the long-term protection of this vaccine and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection against infection, hospitalization and death in children aged 5 to 11 over 6 months of the omicron period.\nThe data sources and statistical methods for this study have been described elsewhere. Briefly, we extracted individual-level data on vaccination histories and clinical outcomes (SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and resulting hospitalization and death) up to June 3, 2022 by linking the North Carolina COVID-19 Surveillance System and Vaccine Management System, and we used 2020 census data to determine the total number of residents with each combination of demographic variables. There are a total of 881,255 children aged 5\u201311, with 143,775 SARS-CoV-2 infections; 205 of the infected children were known to be hospitalized, and 5 were known to have died (Table 1). A total of 215,937 children received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine between November 1, 2021 and June 3, 2022. We used Cox regression to formulate the time-varying effects of the BNT162b2 vaccine and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while adjusting for the demographic variables listed in Table 1.\nFigure 1 shows the effectiveness (i.e., 1\u2013relative risk) of the BNT162b2 two-dose regimen and prior infection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine effectiveness was higher among previously infected children than previously uninfected children, and it waned over time (Fig. 1A, Table S1). Among previously uninfected children, vaccine effectiveness reached 59.2% (95% CI, 57.2 to 61.0) at 5 weeks after dose 1 and declined to 7.5% (95% CI, 1.3 to 13.4) after 15 weeks. Among previously infected children, vaccine effectiveness reached 71.0% (95% CI, 61.1 to 78.4) at 5 weeks after dose 1 and declined to 33.4% (95% CI, 3.5 to 54.0) after 15 weeks. The immunity acquired via SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher than that acquired by vaccination, though it waned over time (Fig. 1B, Table S2). Infection with the delta or older variants had modest protection against infection with the omicron variant. The effectiveness of omicron infection in reducing the risk of reinfection with omicron was 90.1% (95% CI, 88.6 to 91.5) after 2 months and 63.5% (95% CI, 59.6 to 67.0) after 4 months.\nThere were only 11 known hospitalizations and no known deaths among the 186,056 recipients of the two-dose regimen. Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization 3 weeks to 6 months after dose 1 was 96.3% (95% CI, 6.4 to 99.9). The effectiveness of prior infection against hospitalization from reinfection 2 weeks to 19 months later was 81.3% (95% CI, 41.7 to 94.0).\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the BNT162b2 booster for children aged 5\u201311 on May 17, 2022. As of June 3, 2022, a total of 6,351 children had received the booster. There were 37 infections and no known hospitalizations or deaths after the booster."}}

As of June 3, 2022, 67% of participants had been vaccinated. There were 2\u202f771\u202f364 SARS-CoV-2 infections, with a hospitalization rate of 6.3% and mortality rate of 1.4%. The adjusted RR of the primary vaccine series compared with being unvaccinated against infection became 0.53 (95% CI, 0.52-0.53) for BNT162b2, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.51-0.53) for mRNA-1273, and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.50-0.53) for Ad26.COV2.S 10 months after the first dose, but the adjusted HR for hospitalization remained at 0.29 (95% CI, 0.24-0.35) for BNT162b2, 0.27 (95% CI, 0.23-0.32) for mRNA-1273, and 0.35 (95% CI, 0.29-0.42) for Ad26.COV2.S and the adjusted HR of death remained at 0.23 (95% CI, 0.17-0.29) for BNT162b2, 0.15 (95% CI, 0.11-0.20) for mRNA-1273, and 0.24 (95% CI, 0.19-0.31) for Ad26.COV2.S. For the BNT162b2 primary series, boosting in December 2021 with BNT162b2 had the adjusted RR relative to primary series of 0.39 (95% CI, 0.38-0.40) and boosting with mRNA-1273 had the adjusted RR of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.30-0.34) against infection after 1 month and boosting with BNT162b2 had the adjusted RR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82-0.86) and boosting with mRNA-1273 had the adjusted RR of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57-0.62) after 3 months. Among all participants, the adjusted RR of Omicron infection compared with no prior infection was estimated at 0.23 (95% CI, 0.22-0.24) against infection, and the adjusted HRs were 0.10 (95% CI, 0.07-0.14) against hospitalization and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.08-0.15) against death after 4 months.\n\nConclusions and Relevance  Receipt of primary COVID-19 vaccine series compared with being unvaccinated, receipt of boosters compared with primary vaccination, and prior infection compared with no prior infection were all significantly associated with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (including Omicron) and resulting hospitalization and death. The associated protection waned over time, especially against infection."}}

We construct the nonparametric pseudo-likelihood under the working assumption that all event times are independent and present a simple and stable EM-type algorithm. The resulting nonparametric maximum pseudo-likelihood estimators for the regression parameters are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, with a limiting covariance matrix that can be consistently estimated by a sandwich estimator under arbitrary dependence structures for the related event times.
