By representing the confounder as a latent variable, we propose Counterfactual VAE, a new variant of variational autoencoder, based on recent advances in identifiability of representation learning. Combining the identifiability and classical identification results of causal inference, under mild assumptions on the generative model and with small noise on the outcome, we theoretically show that the confounder is identifiable up to an affine transformation and then the treatment effects can be identified.  Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method matches the state-of-the-art, even under settings violating our formal assumptions."}}
