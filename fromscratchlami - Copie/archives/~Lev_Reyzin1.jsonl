This two-player search game is an adaptation of the single-agent interactive learning problem. Here, we analyze the game for trees under different costs: under zero-sum cost we present the one-step Nash equilibrium strategy, and show that the competition hinders both players\u2019 search progress as compared to binary search; under non-zero-sum costs, however, we present a cooperative strategy which benefits both players."}}

In this paper, we study collaborative PAC learning with the goal of reducing communication cost at essentially no penalty to the sample complexity. We develop communication efficient collaborative PAC learning algorithms using distributed boosting. We then consider the communication cost of collaborative learning in the presence of classification noise. As an intermediate step, we show how collaborative PAC learning algorithms can be adapted to handle classification noise. With this insight, we develop communication efficient algorithms for collaborative PAC learning robust to classification noise."}}

We give strong geometric structural properties that need to be satisfied by stable instances. We then make use of, and strengthen, these geometric properties to show that $1.562$-stable instances of Euclidean Steiner trees are polynomial-time solvable. We also provide a connection between certain approximation algorithms and Bilu-Linial stability for Steiner trees."}}

This is important to do when both the datasets and the number of queries asked are very large. In particular, we describe a mechanism that provides a polynomial speed-up per query over previous mechanisms, without needing to increase the total amount of data required to maintain the same generalization error as before. We prove that this speed-up holds for arbitrary statistical queries. We also provide an even faster method for achieving statistically-meaningful responses wherein the mechanism is only allowed to see a constant number of samples from the data per query. Finally, we show that our general results yield a simple, fast, and unified approach for adaptively optimizing convex and strongly convex functions over a dataset."}}

The goal is to learn a hypothesis that predicts the proportions of labels on the distribution underlying the sample. This model of learning is applicable to a wide variety of settings, including predicting the number of votes for candidates in political elections from polls. In this paper, we formally define this class and resolve foundational questions regarding the computational complexity of CR learning and characterize its relationship to PAC learning. Among our results, we show, perhaps surprisingly, that for finite VC classes what can be efficiently CR learned is a strict subset of what can be learned efficiently in PAC, under standard complexity assumptions. We also show that there exist classes of functions whose CR learnability is independent of ZFC, the standard set theoretic axioms. This implies that CR learning cannot be easily characterized (like PAC by VC dimension)."}}

In this query model of learning, a graph is hidden from the learner, and the learner can access information about it with path queries. For a source and destination node, a path query returns whether there is a directed path from the source to the destination node in the hidden graph. In this paper we first give bounds for learning graphs on $n$ vertices and $k$ strongly connected components. We then study the case of bounded degree directed trees and give new algorithms for learning \"almost-trees\" -- directed trees to which extra edges have been added. We also give some lower bound constructions justifying our approach."}}
