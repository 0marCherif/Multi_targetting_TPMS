At each decoding step, SpecDec first speculatively drafts (i.e. decodes) next $k$ tokens with an NAT model and then verifies them with an AT model, where only the drafted tokens passing the verification are accepted as decoded tokens for guaranteeing its translation result is exactly the same as AT. The collaboration of NAT drafting and AT verification leads to a much higher decoding speed without quality loss due to parallel computing enabled by speculative decoding.\n\nWe conduct experiments in 4 standard WMT translation benchmarks and confirm the vanilla SpecDec yields exactly the same results as AT greedy decoding with an around $3\\times$ speedup, and that its variant (SpecDec++) with an advanced verification strategy not only outperforms AT greedy decoding, but also further improves the decoding speed, resulting in an around $5\\times$ speedup over AT. Moreover, SpecDec can be easily generalized for speeding up other seq2seq tasks like Abstractive Summarization, and benefit more from stronger computing devices, demonstrating its potential to become a de facto decoding standard in the future for efficient and lossless seq2seq generation."}}
