An obvious choice in developing explainable intelligent systems relies on employing knowledge representation formalisms which are inherently tailored towards expressing human knowledge e.g., interrogative agendas. In the scope of this work, we focus on formal concept analysis (FCA), a standard knowledge representation formalism, to express interrogative agendas, and in particular to categorize objects w.r.t. a given set of features. Several FCA-based algorithms have already been in use for standard machine learning tasks such as classification and outlier detection. These algorithms use a single concept lattice for such a task, meaning that the set of features used for the categorization is fixed. Different sets of features may have different importance in that categorization, we call a set of features an agenda. In many applications a correct or good agenda for categorization is not known beforehand. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning algorithm to construct a good interrogative agenda explaining the data. Such algorithm is meant to call existing FCA-based classification and outlier detection algorithms iteratively, to increase their accuracy and reduce their sample complexity. The proposed method assigns a measure of importance to different set of features used in the categorization, hence making the results more explainable."}}

Understanding cooperation, therefore, on matters such as how it emerges, develops, or fails is an important avenue of research, not only in a human context, but also for the advancement of next generation artificial intelligence paradigms which are presumably human-compatible. With this motivation in mind, we study the emergence of cooperative behaviour between two independent deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents provided with human input in a novel game environment. In particular, we investigate whether evaluative human feedback (through interactive RL) and expert demonstration (through inverse RL) can help RL agents to learn to cooperate better. We report two main findings. Firstly, we find that the amount of feedback given has a positive impact on the accumulated reward obtained through cooperation. That is, agents trained with a limited amount of feedback outperform agents trained without any feedback, and the performance increases even further as more feedback is provided. Secondly, we find that expert demonstration also helps agents\u2019 performance, although with more modest improvements compared to evaluative feedback. In conclusion, we present a novel game environment to better understand the emergence of cooperative behaviour and show that providing human feedback and demonstrations can accelerate this process."}}

Since the information content on the Web is both inherently context-dependent and frequently updated, the occurrence of a logical inconsistency is often inevitable. This phenomenon has led the research community to develop various types of inconsistency-tolerant semantics over the last few decades. Although the study of query answering under inconsistency-tolerant semantics is well-understood, the problem of explaining query answering under such semantics took considerably less attention, especially in the scenario where the facts are prioritized. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. More specifically, we use Dung\u2019s abstract argumentation framework to address the problem of explaining inconsistency-tolerant query answering in Datalog \u00b1 KB where facts are prioritized, or preordered. We clarify the relationship between preferred repair semantics and various notions of extensions for argumentation frameworks. The strength of such argumentation-based approach is the explainability; users can more easily understand why different points of views are conflicting and why the query answer is entailed (or not) under different semantics. To this end we introduce the formal notion of a dialogical explanation, and show how it can be used to both explain showing why query results hold and not hold according to the known semantics in inconsistent Datalog \u00b1 knowledge bases."}}
