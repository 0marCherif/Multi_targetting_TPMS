However, the difficulty of interpreting such models is a limitation, especially for applications involving high-stakes decision, including the identification of bacterial infections. This paper considers fast Raman spectroscopy data and demonstrates that a logistic regression model with carefully selected features achieves accuracy comparable to that of neural networks, while being much simpler and more transparent. Our analysis leverages wavelet features with intuitive chemical interpretations, and performs controlled variable selection with knockoffs to ensure the predictors are relevant and non-redundant. Although we focus on a particular data set, the proposed approach is broadly applicable to other types of signal data for which interpretability may be important."}}

Here we report on KnockoffZoom: a flexible method that localizes causal variants at multiple resolutions by testing the conditional associations of genetic segments of decreasing width, while provably controlling the false discovery rate. Our method utilizes artificial genotypes as negative controls and is equally valid for quantitative and binary phenotypes, without requiring any assumptions about their genetic architectures. Instead, we rely on well-established genetic models of linkage disequilibrium. We demonstrate that our method can detect more associations than mixed effects models and achieve fine-mapping precision, at comparable computational cost. Lastly, we apply KnockoffZoom to data\u00a0"}}

In contrast with standard approaches, our method can leverage sophisticated multivariate algorithms but makes no parametric assumptions about the unknown relation between genotypes and phenotype. Instead, we recognize that genotypes can be considered as a random sample from an appropriate model, encapsulating our knowledge of genetic inheritance and human populations. This allows the generation of imperfect copies (knockoffs) of these variables that serve as ideal negative controls, correcting for linkage disequilibrium and accounting for unknown population structure, which may be due to diverse ancestries or familial relatedness. The validity and effectiveness of our method are demonstrated by by extensive simulations and by applications to the UK Biobank data. These analyses confirm our method is powerful relative to state-of-the-art alternatives, while comparisons with other studies validate most of our discoveries. Finally, fast software is made available for researchers to analyze Biobank-scale datasets."}}

However, they cannot test for interactions nor find whether an association is only significant within a latent subset of a heterogeneous population. We address this limitation by developing an extension of the knockoff filter that tests conditional associations within automatically detected subsets of individuals, provably controlling the false discovery rate for the selected hypotheses. Then, under the additional assumption of a partially linear model with a binary predictor, we extend the conditional randomization test as to make inferences about quantiles of individual effects that are robust to sample heterogeneity and interactions. The performances of these methods are investigated through simulations and with the analysis of data from a randomized blood donation experiment with several treatments."}}

Blending inductive and transductive conformal inference in an innovative way, the described methods can re-weight standard conformal p-values based on dependent side information from known out-of-distribution data in a principled way, and can automatically take advantage of the most powerful model from any collection of one-class and binary classifiers. The solution can be implemented either through sample splitting or via a novel transductive cross-validation+ scheme which may also be useful in other applications of conformal inference, due to tighter guarantees compared to existing cross-validation approaches. After studying false discovery rate control and power within a multiple testing framework with several possible outliers, the proposed solution is shown to outperform standard conformal p-values through simulations as well as applications to image recognition and tabular data."}}

After achieving marginal coverage for random queries under the assumption of data exchangeability, the proposed method is extended to provide stronger inferences accounting for possibly heterogeneous frequencies of different random queries, redundant queries, and distribution shifts. While the presented methods are broadly applicable, this paper focuses on use cases involving the count-min sketch algorithm and a non-linear variation thereof, to facilitate comparison to prior work. In particular, the developed methods are compared empirically to frequentist and Bayesian alternatives, through simulations and experiments with data sets of SARS-CoV-2 DNA sequences and classic English literature.

In particular, they tend to be overconfident. We begin to address this problem in the context of multi-class classification by developing a novel training algorithm producing models with more dependable uncertainty estimates, without sacrificing predictive power. The idea is to mitigate overconfidence by minimizing a loss function, inspired by advances in conformal inference, that quantifies model uncertainty by carefully leveraging hold-out data. Experiments with synthetic and real data demonstrate this method can lead to smaller conformal prediction sets with higher conditional coverage, after exact calibration with hold-out data, compared to state-of-the-art alternatives."}}
