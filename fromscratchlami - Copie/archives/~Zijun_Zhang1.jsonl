We therefore propose to map both the generated and target distributions to the latent space using the encoder of a standard autoencoder, and train the generator (or decoder) to match the target distribution in the latent space. The resulting method, perceptual generative autoencoder (PGA), is then incorporated with a maximum likelihood or variational autoencoder (VAE) objective to train the generative model. With maximum likelihood, PGAs generalize the idea of reversible generative models to unrestricted neural network architectures and arbitrary latent dimensionalities. When combined with VAEs, PGAs can generate sharper samples than vanilla VAEs. Compared to other autoencoder-based generative models using simple priors, PGAs achieve state-of-the-art FID scores on CIFAR-10 and CelebA."}}

While adaptive algorithms, such as Adam and RMSprop, have shown better optimization performance than stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in many scenarios, they often lead to worse generalization performance than SGD, when used for training deep neural networks (DNNs). In this work, we identify two problems regarding the direction and step size for updating the weight vectors of hidden units, which may degrade the generalization performance of Adam. As a solution, we propose the normalized direction-preserving Adam (ND-Adam) algorithm, which controls the update direction and step size more precisely, and thus bridges the generalization gap between Adam and SGD. Following a similar rationale, we further improve the generalization performance in classification tasks by regularizing the softmax logits. By bridging the gap between SGD and Adam, we also shed some light on why certain optimization algorithms generalize better than others."}}

From an information perspective, we consider injecting multiplicative noise into a DNN as training the network to solve the task with noisy information pathways, which leads to the observation that multiplicative noise tends to increase the correlation between features, so as to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of information pathways. However, high feature correlation is undesirable, as it increases redundancy in representations. In this work, we propose non-correlating multiplicative noise (NCMN), which exploits batch normalization to remove the correlation effect in a simple yet effective way. We show that NCMN significantly improves the performance of standard multiplicative noise on image classification tasks, providing a better alternative to dropout for batch-normalized networks. Additionally, we present a unified view of NCMN and shake-shake regularization, which explains the performance gain of the latter."}}
