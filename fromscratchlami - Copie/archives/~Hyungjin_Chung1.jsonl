Leveraging the learned score function as a prior, here we introduce a way to sample data from a conditional distribution given the measurements, such that the model can be readily used for solving inverse problems in imaging, especially for accelerated MRI. In short, we train a continuous time-dependent score function with denoising score matching. Then, at the inference stage, we iterate between the numerical SDE solver and data consistency step to achieve reconstruction. Our model requires magnitude images only for training, and yet is able to reconstruct complex-valued data, and even extends to parallel imaging. The proposed method is agnostic to sub-sampling patterns and has excellent generalization capability so that it can be used with any sampling schemes for any body parts that are not used for training data. Also, due to its generative nature, our approach can quantify uncertainty, which is not possible with standard regression settings. On top of all the advantages, our method also has very strong performance, even beating the models trained with full supervision. With extensive experiments, we verify the superiority of our method in terms of quality and practicality."}}

Furthermore, its application to inverse problems have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. Unfortunately, diffusion models have a critical downside - they are inherently slow to sample from, needing few thousand steps of iteration to generate images from pure Gaussian noise. In this work, we show that starting from Gaussian noise is unnecessary. Instead, starting from a single forward diffusion with better initialization significantly reduces the number of sampling steps in the reverse conditional diffusion. This phenomenon is formally explained by the contraction theory of the stochastic difference equations like our conditional diffusion strategy - the alternating applications of reverse diffusion followed by a non-expansive data consistency step. The new sampling strategy, dubbed Come-Closer-Diffuse-Faster (CCDF), also reveals a new insight on how the existing feed-forward neural network approaches for inverse problems can be synergistically combined with the diffusion models. Experimental results with super-resolution, image inpainting, and compressed sensing MRI demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction performance at significantly reduced sampling steps.\n"}}

Although the simple generative process surprisingly works well, is this the best way to generate image data? For instance, despite the fact that human perception is more sensitive to the low-frequencies of an image, diffusion models themselves do not consider any relative importance of each frequency component. Therefore, to incorporate the inductive bias for image data, we propose a novel generative process that synthesizes images in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, we generalize the standard diffusion models by enabling diffusion in a rotated coordinate system with different velocities for each component of the vector. We further propose a blur diffusion as a special case, where each frequency component of an image is diffused at different speeds. Specifically, the proposed blur diffusion consists of a forward process that blurs an image and adds noise gradually, after which a corresponding reverse process deblurs an image and removes noise progressively. Experiments show that proposed model outperforms the previous method in FID on LSUN bedroom and church datasets."}}

In particular, self-supervised learning and generative models have been successfully used for various biological imaging applications. In this article, we provide an overview of these approaches from a coherent perspective in the context of classical inverse problems and discuss their applications to biological imaging, including electron, fluorescence, deconvolution microscopy, optical diffraction tomography (ODT), and functional neuroimaging."}}
