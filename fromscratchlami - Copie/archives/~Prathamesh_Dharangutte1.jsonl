We show that the simple and practically popular Hutchinson's estimator, run for m trials, returns a diagonal estimate such that with probability 1 \u2014 \u03b4 Above c is a fixed constant and \u0100 equals A with its diagonal set to zero. This result improves on recent work in [4] by a log(n) factor, yielding a bound that is independent of the matrix dimension, n. We show a similar bound for variants of Hutchinson's estimator that use non-Rademacher random vectors."}}

This model captures the increasingly common trade-off between employing both an expensive similarity model (e.g. a large-scale embedding model), and a less accurate but cheaper model. Hence, the goal is to make as few queries to the strong oracle as possible. We consider both so-called ''point queries'', where the strong oracle is queried on a set of points $S \\subset \\mathcal{X} $ and returns $d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \\in S$, and ''edge queries'' where it is queried for individual distances $d(x,y)$. Our main contributions are optimal algorithms and lower bounds for clustering and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in this model. For $k$-centers, $k$-median, and $k$-means, we give constant factor approximation algorithms with only $\\tilde{O}(k)$ strong oracle point queries, and prove that $\\Omega(k)$ queries are required for any bounded approximation. For edge queries, our upper and lower bounds are both $\\tilde{\\Theta}(k^2)$. Surprisingly, for the MST problem we give a $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ approximation algorithm using no strong oracle queries at all, and a matching $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ lower bound. We empirically evaluate our algorithms, and show that their quality is comparable to that of the baseline algorithms that are given all true distances, but while querying the strong oracle on only a small fraction ($<1\\%$) of points."}}

These requirements arise in real world applications of private data curation, including the public release of the 2020 U.S. Decennial Census. They pose a great challenge to the production of provably private data products with adequate statistical usability. We propose \\emph{integer subspace differential privacy} to rigorously articulate the privacy guarantee when data products maintain both the invariants and integer characteristics, and demonstrate the composition and post-processing properties of our proposal. To address the challenge of sampling from a potentially highly restricted discrete space, we devise a pair of unbiased additive mechanisms, the generalized Laplace and the generalized Gaussian mechanisms, by solving the Diophantine equations as defined by the constraints. The proposed mechanisms have good accuracy, with errors exhibiting sub-exponential and sub-Gaussian tail probabilities respectively. To implement our proposal, we design an MCMC algorithm and supply empirical convergence assessment using estimated upper bounds on the total variation distance via $L$-lag coupling. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal with applications to a synthetic problem with intersecting invariants, a sensitive contingency table with known margins, and the 2010 Census county-level demonstration data with mandated fixed state population totals."}}

We study a version of this problem that arises in the field of landscape genetics, where genetic similarity between organisms living in a heterogeneous landscape is explained by a weighted graph that encodes the ease of dispersal through that landscape. Our main contribution is an efficient algorithm for inverse landscape genetics, which is the task of inferring this graph from measurements of genetic similarity at different locations (graph nodes). Inverse landscape genetics is important in discovering impediments to species dispersal that threaten biodiversity and long-term species survival. In particular, it is widely used to study the effects of climate change and human development. Drawing on influential work that models organism dispersal using graph effective resistances (McRae 2006), we reduce the inverse landscape genetics problem to that of inferring graph edges from noisy measurements of these resistances, which can be obtained from genetic similarity data. Building on the NeurIPS 2018 work of Hoskins et al. (2018) on learning edges in social networks, we develop an efficient first-order optimization method for solving this problem. Despite its non-convex nature, experiments on synthetic and real genetic data establish that our method provides fast and reliable convergence, significantly outperforming existing heuristics used in the field. By providing researchers with a powerful, general purpose algorithmic tool, we hope our work will have a positive impact on accelerating work on landscape genetics."}}
