In this work, we utilize the Fourier analysis to empirically provide a promising mechanism to understand why feedforward deeper learning is faster. To this end, we separate a deep neural network, trained by normal stochastic gradient descent, into two parts during analysis, i.e., a pre-condition component and a learning component, in which the output of the pre-condition one is the input of the learning one. We use a filtering method to characterize the frequency distribution of a high-dimensional function. Based on experiments of deep networks and real dataset, we propose a deep frequency principle, that is, the effective target function for a deeper hidden layer biases towards lower frequency during the training. Therefore, the learning component effectively learns a lower frequency function if the pre-condition component has more layers. Due to the well-studied frequency principle, i.e., deep neural networks learn lower frequency functions faster, the deep frequency principle provides a reasonable explanation to why deeper learning is faster. We believe these empirical studies would be valuable for future theoretical studies of the effect of depth in deep learning."}}

Inspired by the phase diagram for two-layer ReLU NNs with infinite width (Luo et al., 2021), we make a step towards drawing a phase diagram for three-layer ReLU NNs with infinite width. First, we derive a normalized gradient flow for three-layer ReLU NNs and obtain two key independent quantities to distinguish different dynamical regimes for common initialization methods. With carefully designed experiments and a large computation cost, for both synthetic datasets and real datasets, we find that the dynamics of each layer also could be divided into a linear regime and a condensed regime, separated by a critical regime. The criteria is the relative change of input weights (the input weight of a hidden neuron consists of the weight from its input layer to the hidden neuron and its bias term) as the width approaches infinity during the training, which tends to $0$, $+\\infty$ and $O(1)$, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrate that different layers can lie in different dynamical regimes in a training process within a deep NN. In the condensed regime, we also observe the condensation of weights in isolated orientations with low complexity. Through experiments under three-layer condition, our phase diagram suggests a complicated dynamical regimes consisting of three possible regimes, together with their mixture, for deep NNs and provides a guidance for studying deep NNs in different initialization regimes, which reveals the possibility of completely different dynamics emerging within a deep NN for its different layers."}}

The condensation dynamics implies that the training implicitly regularizes a NN towards one with much smaller effective size. In this work, we illustrate the formation of the condensation in multi-layer fully connected NNs and show that the maximal number of condensed orientations in the initial training stage is twice the multiplicity of the activation function, where ``multiplicity'' indicates the multiple roots of activation function at origin. Our theoretical analysis confirms experiments for two cases, one is for the activation function of multiplicity one with arbitrary dimension input, which contains many common activation functions, and the other is for the layer with one-dimensional input and arbitrary multiplicity. This work makes a step towards understanding how small initialization leads NNs to condensation at the initial training stage."}}

In this work, we show that the training with dropout finds the neural network with a flatter minimum compared with standard gradient descent training. We further study the underlying mechanism of why dropout finds flatter minima through experiments. We propose a Variance Principle that the variance of a noise is larger at the sharper direction of the loss landscape. Existing works show that SGD satisfies the variance principle, which leads the training to flatter minima. Our work show that the noise induced by the dropout also satisfies the variance principle that explains why dropout finds flatter minima. In general, our work points out that the variance principle is an important similarity between dropout and SGD that lead the training to find flatter minima and obtain good generalization. "}}
