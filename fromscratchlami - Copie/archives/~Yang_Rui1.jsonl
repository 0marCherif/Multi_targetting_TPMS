Unfortunately, in real-world scenarios, representation learning is usually fragile to task-irrelevant distractions such as variations in background or viewpoint. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel clustering-based approach, namely Clustering with Bisimulation Metrics (CBM), which learns robust representations by grouping visual observations in the latent space. Specifically, CBM alternates between two steps: (1) grouping observations by measuring their bisimulation distances to the learned prototypes; (2) learning a set of prototypes according to the current cluster assignments. Computing cluster assignments with bisimulation metrics enables CBM to capture task-relevant information, as bisimulation metrics quantify the behavioral similarity between observations. Moreover, CBM encourages the consistency of representations within each group, which facilitates filtering out task-irrelevant information and thus induces robust representations against distractions. An appealing feature is that CBM can achieve sample-efficient representation learning even if multiple distractions exist simultaneously.Experiments demonstrate that CBM significantly improves the sample efficiency of popular visual RL algorithms and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both multiple and single distraction settings. The code is available at https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/RL-CBM."}}

A widely used idea is to learn task-relevant representations that encode task-relevant information of common features in POMDPs, i.e., rewards and transition dynamics. As transition dynamics in the latent state space -- which are task-relevant and invariant to visual distractions -- are unknown to the agents, existing methods alternatively use transition dynamics in the observation space to extract task-relevant information in transition dynamics. However, such transition dynamics in the observation space involve task-irrelevant visual distractions, degrading the generalization performance of VRL methods. To tackle this problem, we propose the reward sequence distribution conditioned on the starting observation and the predefined subsequent action sequence (RSD-OA). The appealing features of RSD-OA include that: (1) RSD-OA is invariant to visual distractions, as it is conditioned on the predefined subsequent action sequence without task-irrelevant information from transition dynamics, and (2) the reward sequence captures long-term task-relevant information in both rewards and transition dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that our representation learning approach based on RSD-OA significantly improves the generalization performance on unseen environments, outperforming several state-of-the-arts on DeepMind Control tasks with visual distractions."}}

Two main promising research directions are multi-agent value function decomposition and multi-agent policy gradients. In this paper, we propose a new decomposed multi-agent soft actor-critic (mSAC) method, which effectively combines the advantages of the aforementioned two methods. The main modules include decomposed Q network architecture, discrete probabilistic policy and counterfactual advantage function (optinal). Theoretically, mSAC supports efficient off-policy learning and addresses credit assignment problem partially in both discrete and continuous action spaces. Tested on StarCraft II micromanagement cooperative multiagent benchmark, we empirically investigate the performance of mSAC against its variants and analyze the effects of the different components. Experimental results demonstrate that mSAC significantly outperforms policy-based approach COMA, and achieves competitive results with SOTA value-based approach Qmix on most tasks in terms of asymptotic perfomance metric. In addition, mSAC achieves pretty good results on large action space tasks, such as 2c_vs_64zg and MMM2."}}
