However, we do not yet understand the inherent robustness achieved by contributions from different layers of a PLM. We systematically analyze the robustness of these representations layer by layer from two perspectives. First, we measure the robustness of representations by using domain divergence between two domains. We find that i) Domain variance increases from the lower to the upper layers for vanilla PLMs; ii) Models continuously pretrained on domain-specific data (DAPT)(Gururangan et al., 2020) exhibit more variance than their pretrained PLM counterparts; and that iii) Distilled models (e.g., DistilBERT) also show greater domain variance. Second, we investigate the robustness of representations by analyzing the encoded syntactic and semantic information using diagnostic probes. We find that similar layers have similar amounts of linguistic information for data from an unseen domain."}}

The call for contributions of research papers -- through an e-mail or as a webpage, not only solicits research works from scientists, but also lists the names of the researchers and their roles in managing the conference. Tracking such information which showcases the researchers' leadership qualities is becoming increasingly important. Here we present ServiceMarq - a system which proactively tracks service contributions to conferences. It performs focused crawling for website-based call for papers, and integrates archival and natural language processing libraries to achieve both high precision and recall in extracting information. Our results indicate that aggregated service contribution gives an alternative but correlated picture of institutional quality compared against standard bibliometrics. In addition, we have developed a proof of concept website to track service contributions and is available at https://cfp-mining-fe.herokuapp.com and our github repo is available at https://github.com/shitian007/cfp-mining"}}

However, they are largely unable to provide satisfactory answers to time- and location-specific queries. Such queries can best and often only be answered by humans that are currently on-site. Although online platforms for community question answering are very popular, very few exceptions consider the notion of users\u2019 current physical locations. In this article, we present CloseUp, our prototype for the seamless integration of community-driven live search into a Google-like search experience. Our efforts focus on overcoming the defining differences between traditional Web search and community question answering, namely the formulation of search requests (keyword-based queries vs. well-formed questions) and the expected response times (milliseconds vs. minutes/hours). To this end, the system features a deep learning pipeline to analyze submitted queries and translate relevant queries into questions. Searching users can submit suggested questions to a community of mobile users. CloseUp provides a stand-alone mobile application for submitting, browsing, and replying to questions. Replies from mobile users are presented as live results in the search interface. Using a field study, we evaluated the feasibility and practicability of our approach."}}

Often, large number of reviews are written for restaurants which warrants the need for automated summarization systems. In this paper we present epicure, a novel text and image summarization platform. For the summarization of opinionated content like reviews, considering different aspects have largely been ignored, and we address this by creating balanced reviews for different aspects like food and service. We argue that traditional criteria for extractive review summarization such as coverage and diversity have limited applicability. We draw on the power and usefulness of submodular functions for extractive summarization and introduce novel submodular functions such as importance, freshness, purity, trustworthiness and balanced opinion. We are also one of the first to provide an image summary for diffeerent aspects of a restaurant by mapping text to images using a multimodal neural network, for which we provide initial experiments. We show the effectiveness of our platform by evaluating it against strong baselines and also use crowdsourcing experiments for a subjective comparison of our approach with existing works."}}
