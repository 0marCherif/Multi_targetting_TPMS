Compared to spatial convolution for appearance, the temporal component provides an additional (and important) clue for motion modeling, as a number of actions can be reliably recognized based on the motion information. In this paper, we present an effective and interpretable module, Dense Correlation Fields (DCF), which builds up dense visual correlation volumes at the feature level to model different motion patterns explicitly. To achieve this goal, we rely on a spatially hierarchical architecture that preserves both fine local information provided in the lower layer and the high-level semantic information from the deeper layer. Our method fuses spatial hierarchical correlation and temporal long-term correlation, which is better suited for small objects and large displacements. This module is extensible and can be plugged into many backbone architectures to accurately predict object interactions in the video. DCF shows consistent improvements over 2D CNNs and 3D CNNs baseline networks with 3.7% and 3.0% gains respectively on the standard video action benchmark of SSV1."}}

Recent methods of this kind normally consist of three major components: intra-frame network, motion prediction network, and residual network, among which the motion prediction part is particularly critical for video compression. Benefiting from the optical flow which enables dense motion prediction, recent methods have shown competitive performance compared with traditional codecs. However, problems such as tail shadow and background distortion in the predicted frame remain unsolved. To tackle these problems, JMPNet is introduced in this paper to provide more accurate motion information by using both optical flow and dynamic local filter as well as an attention map to further fuse these motion information in a smarter way. Experimental results show that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) rate-distortion (RD) performance in the most data-sets."}}

In recent years, learned image compression methods have been proposed and achieved compelling performance to the traditional standards.

Although some variable-rate approaches have been proposed to reduce the cost by using a single network, most of them brought some performance degradation when applying fine rate control. To enable variable-rate control without sacrificing the performance, we propose an efficient Interpolation Variable-Rate (IVR) network, by introducing a handy Interpolation Channel Attention (InterpCA) module in the compression network. With the use of two hyperparameters for rate control and linear interpolation, the InterpCA achieves a fine PSNR interval of 0.001 dB and a fine rate interval of 0.0001 Bits-Per-Pixel (BPP) with 9000 rates in the IVR network.

Approaches have been proposed to reduce the complexity by replacing motion prediction modules with implicit flow networks. Error propagation aware training strategy is also proposed to alleviate incremental reconstruction errors from previously decoded frames. Although these methods have brought some improvement, little attention has been paid to the framework itself. Inspired by the success of learned image compression through simplifying the framework with a single deep neural network, it is natural to expect a better performance in video compression via a simple yet appropriate framework. Therefore, we propose a framework to directly compress raw-pixel frames (rather than residual images), where no extra motion prediction module is required. Instead, an entropy model is used to estimate the spatiotemporal redundancy in a latent space rather than pixel level, which significantly reduces the complexity of the framework. Specifically, the whole framework is a compression module, consisting of a unified auto-encoder which produces identically distributed latents for all frames, and a spatiotemporal entropy estimation model to minimize the entropy of these latents. Experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under the metric of multiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) and achieves competitive results under the metric of PSNR."}}
