To address these challenges, we propose (1) a continuous-time version of the Gated Recurrent Unit, building upon the recent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Chen et al., 2018), and (2) a Bayesian update network that processes the sporadic observations. We bring these two ideas together in our GRU-ODE-Bayes method. We then demonstrate that the proposed method encodes a continuity prior for the latent process and that it can exactly represent the Fokker-Planck dynamics of complex processes driven by a multidimensional stochastic differential equation. Additionally, empirical evaluation shows that our method outperforms the state of the art on both synthetic data and real-world data with applications in healthcare and climate forecast. What is more, the continuity prior is shown to be well suited for low number of samples settings.\n"}}

Indeed, this type of data usually consists in short time series with missing or noisy values for which causal inference is increasingly difficult. In this work, we propose a method to uncover causal relations in chaotic dynamical systems from short, noisy and sporadic time series (that is, incomplete observations at infrequent and irregular intervals) where the classical convergent cross mapping (CCM) fails. Our method works by learning a Neural ODE latent process modeling the state-space dynamics of the time series and by checking the existence of a continuous map between the resulting processes. We provide theoretical analysis and show empirically that Latent-CCM can reliably uncover the true causal pattern, unlike traditional methods."}}

We are interested to learn $f: U \\rightarrow W$ where we have a fully mediating representation $V$ such that $f$ factors into $U \\rightarrow V \\rightarrow W$. However, observing V requires detailed and expensive labels. We propose \\textbf{graph aligning} approach that generates rich or detailed labels given normal labels $W$. In this paper we investigate the scenario of domain adaptation from the source domain where we have access to the expensive labels $V$ to the target domain where only normal labels W are available. Focusing on the problem of predicting chemical compound graphs from 2D images the fully mediating layer is represented using the planar embedding of the chemical graph structure we are predicting. The use of a fully mediating layer implies some assumptions on the mechanism of the underlying process. However if the assumptions are correct it should allow the machine learning model to be more interpretable, generalize better and be more  data efficient at training time.\nThe empirical results show that, using only 4000 data points, we obtain up to 4x improvement of performance after domain adaptation to target domain compared to pretrained model only on the source domain. After domain adaptation, the model is even able to detect atom types that were never seen in the original source domain. Finally, on the Maybridge data set the proposed self-labeling approach reached higher performance than the current state of the art."}}
