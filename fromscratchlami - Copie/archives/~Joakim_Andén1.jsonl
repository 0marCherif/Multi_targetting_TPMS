Our classifier composes the scattering transform (ST) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. It is trained on PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2021 data. The ST captures short-term temporal ECG modulations while reducing its sampling rate to a few samples per typical heart beat. We pass the output of the ST to a depthwise-separable convolution layer which combines lead responses separately for each ST coefficient and then combines resulting values across ST coefficients. At a deeper level, 2 LSTM layers integrate local variations of the input over long time scales. We train in an end-to-end fashion as a multilabel classification problem with a normal and 25 arrhythmia classes. We used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for transfer learning from 12-lead ST representations to reduced-lead ones.

The molecular structures are not rigid objects, but flexible objects involved in dynamical processes. The different conformations are exhibited by different instances of the macromolecule observed in a cryo-EM experiment, each of which is recorded as a particle image. The range of conformations and the conformation of each particle are not known a priori; one of the great promises of cryo-EM is to map this conformation space. Remarkable progress has been made in determining rigid structures from homogeneous samples of molecules in spite of the unknown orientation of each particle image and significant progress has been made in recovering a few distinct states from mixtures of rather distinct conformations, but more complex heterogeneous samples remain a major challenge. We introduce the ``hyper-molecule'' framework for modeling structures across different states of heterogeneous molecules, including continuums of states. The key idea behind this framework is representing heterogeneous macromolecules as high-dimensional objects, with the additional dimensions representing the conformation space. This idea is then refined to model properties such as localized heterogeneity. In addition, we introduce an algorithmic framework for recovering such maps of heterogeneous objects from experimental data using a Bayesian formulation of the problem and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to address the computational challenges in recovering these high dimensional hyper-molecules. We demonstrate these ideas in a prototype applied to synthetic data."}}
