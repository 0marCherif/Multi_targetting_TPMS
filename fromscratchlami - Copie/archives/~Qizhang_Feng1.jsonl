Towards Public Dataset Protection with Clean-Label Backdoor Watermarking", "abstract": "The huge supporting training data on the Internet has been a key factor in the success of deep learning models. However, this abundance of public-available data also raises concerns about the unauthorized exploitation of datasets for commercial purposes, which is forbidden by dataset licenses. In this paper, we propose a backdoor-based watermarking approach that serves as a general framework for safeguarding public-available data. By inserting a small number of watermarking samples into the dataset, our approach enables the learning model to implicitly learn a secret function set by defenders. This hidden function can then be used as a watermark to track down third-party models that use the dataset illegally. Unfortunately, existing backdoor insertion methods often entail adding arbitrary and mislabeled data to the training set, leading to a significant drop in performance and easy detection by anomaly detection algorithms. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a clean-label backdoor watermarking framework that uses imperceptible perturbations to replace mislabeled samples. As a result, the watermarking samples remain consistent with the original labels, making them difficult to detect. Our experiments on text, image, and audio datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively safeguards datasets with minimal impact on original task performance. We also show that adding just 1% of watermarking samples can inject a traceable watermarking function and that our watermarking samples are stealthy and look benign upon visual inspection."}}

Fairness problems have been identified in machine learning for healthcare, resulting in an unfair allocation of limited healthcare resources or excessive health risks for certain groups. Therefore, addressing the fairness problems has recently attracted increasing attention from the healthcare community. However, the intersection of machine learning for healthcare and fairness in machine learning remains understudied. In this review, we build the bridge by exposing fairness problems, summarizing possible biases, sorting out mitigation methods and pointing out challenges along with opportunities for the future."}}

Assessing the credibility of scientific findings and claims in research publications has long been a time-consuming and challenging task for researchers and decision-makers. In this paper, we introduce RES - an intelligent system that assists humans in analyzing the credibility of scientific findings and claims in research publications in the field of social and behavioral sciences by estimating their replicability. The pipeline of RES consists of four major modules that perform feature extraction, replicability estimation, result explanation, and sentiment analysis respectively. Our evaluation based on human experts' assessments suggests that the RES has achieved adequate performance. The RES is also built with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is publicly accessible at https://tamu-infolab.github.io/RES/."}}

Different from the conventional feature-based explanations (e.g., attributions), counterfactuals are a series of hypothetical samples which can flip model decisions with minimal perturbations on queries. Given valid counterfactuals, humans are capable of reasoning under ``what-if'' circumstances, so as to better understand the model decision boundaries. However, releasing counterfactuals could be detrimental, since it may unintentionally leak sensitive information to adversaries, which brings about higher risks on both model security and data privacy. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel framework to generate differentially private counterfactual (DPC) without touching the deployed model or explanation set, where noises are injected for protection while maintaining the explanation roles of counterfactual. In particular, we train an autoencoder with the functional mechanism to construct noisy class prototypes, and then derive the DPC from the latent prototypes based on the post-processing immunity of differential privacy. Further evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, showing that DPC can successfully relieve the risks on both extraction and inference attacks."}}
