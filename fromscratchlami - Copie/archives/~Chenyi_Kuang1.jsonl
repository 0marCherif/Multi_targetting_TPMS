Image-based 3D face reconstruction, which can represent a dense space of facial motions, is typically accomplished by estimating identity, expression, texture, head pose, and illumination separately via pre-constructed 3D morphable models (3DMMs). Recent 3D reconstruction models can recover high-quality geometric facial details like wrinkles and pores, but are still limited in their ability to recover 3D subtle motions caused by the activation of AUs. We present a multi-stage learning framework that recovers AU-interpretable 3D facial details by learning personalized AU-specific blendshapes from images. Our model explicitly learns 3D expression basis by using AU labels and generic AU relationship prior and then constrains the basis coefficients such that they are semantically mapped to each AU. Our AU-aware 3D reconstruction model generates accurate 3D expressions composed by semantically meaningful AU motion components. Furthermore, the output of the model can be directly applied to generate 3D AU occurrence predictions, which have not been fully explored by prior 3D reconstruction models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via qualitative and quantitative evaluations."}}

As an attractive alternative to appearance-based models, 3D model-based gaze estimation methods are powerful because a general prior of eye anatomy or geometry has been integrated into the 3D model hence they adapt well under various head poses and illumination conditions. We present a method for constructing an anatomically accurate 3D deformable eye model from the IR images of eyes and demonstrate its application to 3D gaze estimation. The 3D eye model consists of a deformable basis capable of representing individual real-world eyeballs, corneas, irises and kappa angles. To validate the model\u2019s accuracy, we combine it with a 3D face model (without eyeball) and perform image-based fitting to obtain eye basis coefficients The fitted eyeball is then used to compute 3D gaze direction. Evaluation results on multiple datasets show that the proposed method generalizes well across datasets and is robust under various head poses."}}
