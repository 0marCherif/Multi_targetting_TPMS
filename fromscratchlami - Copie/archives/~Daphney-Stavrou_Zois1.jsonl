However, these variables are not in practice directly observable, but can be instead inferred via noisy but costly features. Herein, we study the problem of datum\u2013wise feature selection and classification in the case where the label of each data instance is described by a known Bayesian network, and features are available at a cost. The goal is to accurately classify each data instance, while keeping the feature acquisition cost minimum. To this end, we first propose a forward pass algorithm that sequentially acquires features to infer the label of each variable in the Bayesian network. During this process, the proposed algorithm uses both the acquired features and the Bayesian network relationships. In an effort to improve classification accuracy, we also devise a backward pass algorithm, which exploits Bayesian network relationships along with evidence. We discuss the computational complexity of both algorithms and experimentally assess their performance on 11 datasets. We observe that the forward pass algorithm achieves higher accuracy using a small fraction of features compared to state\u2013of\u2013the\u2013art, while the backward pass algorithm enhances accuracy without acquiring additional features."}}

However, the literature on predictive models in the context of homeless service provision has neglected the sequential nature of services that an individual receives over time. Our work addresses this gap by learning, from administrative data, a Bayesian network, which in turn can be used to accurately predict whether an individual will exit the system, or alternatively, the service she would be assigned to the next time she experiences homelessness. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach outperforms prior art not only at predicting exit, but also the less frequent services (and thus more challenging to predict)."}}

BCI-based color vision assessment uses steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited during a grid search of colors to identify metamers\u2014light sources with different spectral distributions that appear to be the same color. Present BCI-based color vision assessment methods are slow; they require extensive data collection for each color in the grid search to reduce measurement noise. metaID+ suppresses measurement noise using Gaussian process regression (i.e., a covariance function is used to replace each measurement with the weighted sum of all of the measurements). Thus, metaID+ reduces the amount of data required for each measurement. We evaluated metaID+ using data collected from ten participants and compared the sum-of-squared errors (SSE; relative to the average grid of each participant) between our algorithm and metaID (an existing algorithm). metaID+ significantly reduced the SSE. In addition, metaID+ achieved metaID\u2019s minimum SSE while using 61.3% less data. By using less data to achieve the same level of error, metaID+ improves the performance of BCI-based color vision assessment."}}

Due to the significant impact of road accidents on health and development, early and accurate detection of accidents is crucial. To address this issue, a novel Bayesian quickest change detection formulation is introduced, which considers both average detection delay and false alarm rate. The optimum strategy is derived via dynamic programming and shown to compare a recursively computed statistic with a function of false alarm to identify accidents as they happen. Considering that post\u2013accident conditions are typically not known, two methods are proposed that recursively estimate multiple unknown parameters during the accident detection process. Further, four aggregation methods are proposed to improve performance exploiting spatial correlations between sensors. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate improvement up to 65.2% and 87.2% in average detection delay and false alarm rate, respectively, against prior work."}}

In this paper, we propose an approach to speed-up the structure learning process without compromising accuracy, assuming a given set of candidate network structures. Specifically, the proposed method sequentially evaluates variable relationships until it reaches a specific decision regarding the underlying Bayesian network. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on two standard Bayesian networks and compared with existing methods."}}

WBANs constitute a new class of wireless sensor networks that enable diverse applications in healthcare, entertainment, sports, military and emergency situations. A typical WBAN consists of a few, heterogeneous sensors wirelessly coupled to an energy-constrained fusion center which, according to observations of a real-world prototype WBAN, imposes critical restrictions on system lifetime. To address this issue, a novel stochastic control framework is introduced, which considers both sensor heterogeneity and application requirements, for achieving the two-fold goal: energy savings with satisfactory detection performance. An optimal dynamic programming algorithm for the sensor selection problem is also derived. Important properties of the cost functionals are derived and used to design three approximation algorithms, which offer near optimal performance with significant complexity reduction. Simulations on real-world data show energy gains as high as 68% in comparison to an equal allocation scheme with probability of detection error on the order of 10 -4 "}}
