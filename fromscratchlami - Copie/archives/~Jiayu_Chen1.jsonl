It has also been a trend to automate the curriculum generation process. Automatic CL works primarily focus on goal-conditioned RL problems, where an explicit indicator of training progress, e.g., reward or success rate, can be used to prioritize the training tasks. However, such a requirement is no longer valid in zero-sum games: there are no goals for the agents, and the accumulative reward of the learning policy can constantly fluctuate throughout training. In this work, we present the first theoretical framework of automatic curriculum learning in the setting of zero-sum games and derive a surprisingly simple indicator of training progress, i.e., the Q-value variance, which can be directly approximated by computing the variance of value network ensembles. With such a progression metric, we further adopt a particle-based task sampler to generate initial environment configurations for training, which is particularly lightweight, computation-efficient, and naturally multi-modal. Combining these techniques with multi-agent PPO training, we obtain our final algorithm, Zero-sum Automatic Curriculum Learning (ZACL). We first evaluate ZACL in a 2D particle-world environment, where ZACL produces much stronger policies than popular RL methods for zero-sum games using the same amount of samples. Then we show in the challenging hide-and-seek environment that ZACL can lead to all four emergent phases using a single desktop computer, which is reported for the first time in the literature.

We motivate our curriculum learning paradigm through a variational perspective, where the learning objective can be decomposed into two terms: task learning on the current curriculum, and curriculum update to a new task distribution. Local optimization over the second term suggests that the curriculum should gradually expand the training tasks from easy to hard. Our VACL algorithm implements this variational paradigm with two practical components, task expansion and entity curriculum, which produces a series of training tasks over both the task configurations as well as the number of entities in the task. Experiment results show that VACL solves a collection of sparse-reward problems with a large number of agents. Particularly, using a single desktop machine, VACL achieves 98% coverage rate with 100 agents in the simple-spread benchmark and reproduces the ramp-use behavior originally shown in OpenAI\u2019s hide-and-seek project."}}
