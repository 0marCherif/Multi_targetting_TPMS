We experimentally demonstrate a reprogrammable CT Analog linear-phase filter by utilizing the ladder filter delay element and Vector-Matrix Multiplication (VMM) both compiled on the SoC FPAA. Using the Ladder Filter as a programmable CT delay operation enables a traditionally difficult analog signal operation. This effort extensively models and characterizes the ladder filter delay stage in terms of its transfer function, delay tunability, power requirements, distortion, and SNR. The theoretical development is compared to experimental measurements on an SoC FPAA with programmable ladder filter delay of 2.9\u03bcs and 4.2\u03bcs for multiple input frequencies (e.g. 5kHz, 20kHz). In addition, we show that VMMs can compensate the non-idealities found in the ladder filter delay-line operation."}}

This tool enables users to generate macro blocks and customize block location while designing mixed-signal systems on the FPAA and also enables using routing fabric, composed of FGs, for Vector Matrix Multiplication (VMM), a computing element for an analog neural network. The paper demonstrates system level examples using this tool flow, where the experimental results have been proved in other publications."}}

The computational circuits are implemented on a reconfigurable and programmable signal-processing platform, namely field-programmable analog array (FPAA). The design leverages the core enabling technology of FPAA, namely floating-gate CMOS devices, and an on-chip low-power microcontroller to achieve energy-efficiency while not compromising accuracy. The custom physical-computation-electronics operating in CMOS subthreshold region, performs low-level (i.e., physiologically-relevant feature extraction) and high-level (i.e., detecting arrhythmia) signal processing in an energy-efficient manner. The on-chip microcontroller is used (1) in the programming mode for controlling the charge storage at the analog-memory elements to introduce patient-dependency into the system and (2) in the run mode to quantify the vital signs. The system has been validated against digital computation results from MATLAB using datasets collected from three healthy subjects and datasets from the MIT/BIH open source database. Based on all recordings in the MIT/BIH database, ECG R-peak detection sensitivity is 94.2%. The processor detects arrhythmia in three MIT/BIH recordings with an average sensitivity of 96.2%. The cardiac processor achieves an average percentage mean error bounded by 3.75%, 6.27%, and 7.3% for R-R duration, systolic blood pressure, and oxygen saturation level calculations; respectively. The power consumption of the ECG, blood-pressure and photo-plethysmography processing circuitry are 126 nW, 251 nW and 1.44 \u03bcW respectively in a 350 nm process. Overall, the cardiac processor consumes 1.82 \u03bcW."}}

Our DRNN is used to predict Cartesian representation of a computer cursor movement kinematics from open-loop neural data recorded from the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of a human subject in a BMI system. We design the algorithm to achieve a reasonable trade-off between performance and robustness, and we constrain memory usage in favor of future hardware implementation. We feed the predictions of the network back to the input to improve prediction performance and robustness. We apply a scheduled sampling approach to the model in order to solve a statistical distribution mismatch between the ground truth and predictions. Additionally, we configure a small DRNN to operate with a short history of input, reducing the required buffering of input data and number of memory accesses. This configuration lowers the expected power consumption in a neural network accelerator. Operating on wavelet-based neural features, we show that the average performance of DRNN surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in the literature on both single- and multi-day data recorded over 43 days. Results show that multi-state DRNN has the potential to model the nonlinear relationships between the neural data and kinematics for robust BMIs."}}

The technique enables opportunities for embedded, ultra-low power machine learning, techniques typically considered for large servers. To develop this training algorithm, this paper starts by understanding fundamental equivalent transformations for the VMM + WTA classifier networks. A VMM+ WTA structure can exactly compute a self-organizing map (SOM) or vector quantization (VQ) operation, in addition to other transformations. SOM, VQ, and Gaussian mixture models learning concepts are utilized for the training algorithm of this single one-layer network. An on-chip clustering step determines the initial weight set for ideal target and background values. Null symbols are important for the algorithm and are set from midpoints of the target values.
