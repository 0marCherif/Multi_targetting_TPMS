Simple, well-motivated architectural variations that transfer across tasks and scale, increasing the impact of modeling research. However, with the emergence of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameters models, large language models are increasingly expensive to accurately design and train. Notably, it can be difficult to evaluate how modeling decisions may impact emergent capabilities, given that these capabilities arise mainly from sheer scale.Targeting a multilingual language model in the 100B+ parameters scale, our goal is to identify an architecture and training setup that makes the best use of our 1,000,000 A100-GPU-hours budget. Specifically, we perform an ablation study comparing different modeling practices and their impact on zero-shot generalization. We perform all our experiments on 1.3B models, providing a compromise between compute costs and the likelihood that our conclusions will hold for the target 100B+ model. In addition, we study the impact of various popular pretraining corpora on zero-shot generalization. We also study the performance of a multilingual model and how it compares to the English-only one. Finally, we consider the scaling behaviour of Transformers to chose the target model size, shape, and training setup."}}

It has been hypothesized that this is a consequence of implicit multitask learning in language models\u2019 pretraining (Radford et al., 2019). Can zero-shot generalization instead be directly induced by explicit multitask learning? To test this question at scale, we develop a system for easily mapping any natural language tasks into a human-readable prompted form. We convert a large set of supervised datasets, each with multiple prompts with diverse wording. These prompted datasets allow for benchmarking the ability of a model to perform completely unseen tasks specified in natural language. We fine-tune a pretrained encoder-decoder model (Raffel et al., 2020; Lester et al., 2021) on this multitask mixture covering a wide variety of tasks. The model attains strong zero-shot performance on several datasets, often outperforming models 16\u00d7 its size. Further, our model attains strong performance on a subset of tasks from the BIG-Bench benchmark, outperforming models 6\u00d7 its size. All trained models are available at https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/t-zero, and all prompts are available at https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/promptsource."}}

Previous work has demonstrated effective methods to circumvent these issues when knowledge of the bias is available. We consider cases where the bias issues may not be explicitly identified, and show a method for training models that learn to ignore these problematic correlations. Our approach relies on the observation that models with limited capacity primarily learn to exploit biases in the dataset. We can leverage the errors of such limited capacity models to train a more robust model in a product of experts, thus bypassing the need to hand-craft a biased model. We show the effectiveness of this method to retain improvements in out-of-distribution settings even if no particular bias is targeted by the biased model."}}

We propose the use of movement pruning, a simple, deterministic first-order weight pruning method that is more adaptive to pretrained model fine-tuning. We give mathematical foundations to the method and compare it to existing zeroth- and first-order pruning methods. Experiments show that when pruning large pretrained language models, movement pruning shows significant improvements in high-sparsity regimes. When combined with distillation, the approach achieves minimal accuracy loss with down to only 3% of the model parameters."}}

However, their hefty computational and memory demands make them challenging to deploy to resource-constrained edge platforms with strict latency requirements. We present EdgeBERT, an in-depth algorithm-hardware co-design for latency-aware energy optimization for multi-task NLP. EdgeBERT employs entropy-based early exit predication in order to perform dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS), at a sentence granularity, for minimal energy consumption while adhering to a prescribed target latency. Computation and memory footprint overheads are further alleviated by employing a calibrated combination of adaptive attention span, selective network pruning, and floating-point quantization. Furthermore, in order to maximize the synergistic benefits of these algorithms in always-on and intermediate edge computing settings, we specialize a 12nm scalable hardware accelerator system, integrating a fast-switching low-dropout voltage regulator (LDO), an all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL), as well as, high-density embedded non-volatile memories (eNVMs) wherein the sparse floating-point bit encodings of the shared multi-task parameters are carefully stored. Altogether, latency-aware multi-task NLP inference acceleration on the EdgeBERT hardware system generates up to 7x, 2.5x, and 53x lower energy compared to the conventional inference without early stopping, the latency-unbounded early exit approach, and CUDA adaptations on an Nvidia Jetson Tegra X2 mobile GPU, respectively."}}

However, there is still a lack of understanding of the settings in which multi-task learning has a significant effect. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical model trained in a multi-task learning setup on a set of carefully selected semantic tasks. The model is trained in a hierarchical fashion to introduce an inductive bias by supervising a set of low level tasks at the bottom layers of the model and more complex tasks at the top layers of the model. This model achieves state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition, Entity Mention Detection and Relation Extraction without hand-engineered features or external NLP tools like syntactic parsers. The hierarchical training supervision induces a set of shared semantic representations at lower layers of the model. We show that as we move from the bottom to the top layers of the model, the hidden states of the layers tend to represent more complex semantic information."}}

In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-purpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be fine-tuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device study."}}
