It is therefore important to track and evaluate the robustness of models against noisy label memorization. We propose a metric, called $\\textit{susceptibility}$, to gauge such memorization for neural networks. Susceptibility is simple and easy to compute during training. Moreover, it does not require access to ground-truth labels and it only uses unlabeled data. We empirically show the effectiveness of our metric in tracking memorization on various architectures and datasets and provide theoretical insights into the design of the susceptibility metric. Finally, we show through extensive experiments on datasets with synthetic and real-world label noise that one can utilize susceptibility and the overall training accuracy to distinguish models that maintain a low memorization on the training set and generalize well to unseen clean data.

Our metric, called gradient disparity, is the $\\ell_2$ norm distance between the gradient vectors of two mini-batches drawn from the training set. It is derived from a probabilistic upper bound on the difference between the classification errors over a given mini-batch, when the network is trained on this mini-batch and when the network is trained on another mini-batch of points sampled from the same dataset. We empirically show that gradient disparity is a very promising early-stopping criterion (i) when data is limited, as it uses all the samples for training and (ii) when available data has noisy labels, as it signals overfitting better than the validation data. Furthermore, we show in a wide range of experimental settings that gradient disparity is strongly related to the generalization error between the training and test sets, and that it is also very informative about the level of label noise."}}

They require to set aside a reliable unbiased validation set, which can be expensive in applications offering limited amounts of data. In this paper, we propose to use \\emph{gradient disparity}, which we define as the $\\ell_2$ norm distance between the gradient vectors of two batches drawn from the training set. It comes from a probabilistic upper bound on the difference between the classification errors over a given batch, when the network is trained on this batch and when the network is trained on another batch of points sampled from the same dataset. We empirically show that gradient disparity is a very promising early-stopping criterion when data is limited, because it uses all the training samples during training. Furthermore, we show in a wide range of experimental settings that gradient disparity is not only strongly related to the usual generalization error between the training and test sets, but that it is also much more informative about the level of label noise.

We shed light on this matter by linking the loss function to the output's sensitivity to its input. We find a rather strong empirical relation between the output sensitivity and the variance in the bias-variance decomposition of the loss function, which hints on using sensitivity as a metric for comparing the generalization performance of networks, without requiring labeled data. We find that sensitivity is decreased by applying popular methods which improve the generalization performance of the model, such as (1) using a deep network rather than a wide one, (2) adding convolutional layers to baseline classifiers instead of adding fully-connected layers, (3) using batch normalization, dropout and max-pooling, and (4) applying parameter initialization techniques."}}
