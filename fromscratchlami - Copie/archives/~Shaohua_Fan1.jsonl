However, by presenting a graph classification investigation on the training graphs with severe bias, surprisingly, we discover that GNNs always tend to explore the spurious correlations to make decision, even if the causal correlation always exists. This implies that existing GNNs trained on such biased datasets will suffer from poor generalization capability.  By analyzing this problem in a causal view, we find that disentangling and decorrelating the causal and bias latent variables from the biased graphs are both crucial for debiasing. Inspired by this, we propose a general disentangled GNN framework to learn the causal substructure and bias substructure, respectively. Particularly,  we design a parameterized edge mask generator to explicitly split the input graph into causal and bias subgraphs. Then two GNN modules supervised by causal/bias-aware loss functions respectively are trained to encode causal and bias subgraphs into their corresponding representations. With the disentangled representations, we synthesize the counterfactual unbiased training samples to further decorrelate causal and bias variables. Moreover, to better benchmark the severe bias problem, we construct three new graph datasets, which have controllable bias degrees and are easier to visualize and explain. Experimental results well demonstrate that our approach achieves superior generalization performance over existing baselines. Furthermore, owing to the learned edge mask, the proposed model has appealing interpretability and transferability."}}

In reality, the test data is not even available during the training process, making selection bias agnostic. Training GNNs with biased selected nodes leads to significant parameter estimation bias and greatly impacts the generalization ability on test nodes. In this paper, we first present an experimental investigation, which clearly shows that the selection bias drastically hinders the generalization ability of GNNs, and theoretically prove that the selection bias will cause the biased estimation on GNN parameters. Then to remove the bias in GNN estimation, we propose a novel Debiased Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with a differentiated decorrelation regularizer. The differentiated decorrelation regularizer estimates a sample weight for each labeled node such that the spurious correlation of learned embeddings could be eliminated. We analyze the regularizer in causal view and it motivates us to differentiate the weights of the variables based on their contribution on the confounding bias. Then, these sample weights are used for reweighting GNNs to eliminate the estimation bias, thus help to improve the stability of prediction on unknown test nodes. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several challenging graph datasets with two kinds of label selection bias. The results well verify that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and DGNN is a flexible framework to enhance existing GNNs."}}
