Specifically, we search for a meta graph, which can capture more complex semantic relations than a meta path, to determine how graph neural networks (GNNs) propagate messages along different types of edges. We formalize the problem within the framework of neural architecture search (NAS) and then perform the search in a differentiable manner. We design an expressive search space in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to represent candidate meta graphs for a HIN, and we propose task-dependent type constraint to filter out those edge types along which message passing has no effect on the representations of nodes that are related to the downstream task. The size of the search space we define is huge, so we further propose a novel and efficient search algorithm to make the total search cost on a par with training a single GNN once. Compared with existing popular NAS algorithms, our proposed search algorithm improves the search efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on different HINs and downstream tasks to evaluate our method, and experimental results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art heterogeneous GNNs and also improves efficiency compared with those methods which can implicitly learn meta paths."}}

We propose POLAR++, an active recommendation framework that utilizes Bayesian neural networks to capture the uncertainty of user preference, actively selects articles to query the user for feedback, and adaptively learns user preference with one-shot learning. For the article recommendation, we design an attention-based CNN to quantify the similarity between user preference and recommended articles, which significantly improves the performance with only a few articles rated by the users. We evaluate the proposed POLAR++ on datasets of different scale and sources. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. We have successfully deployed POLAR++ into AMiner as the recommendation engine for article recommendation, which further confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model."}}

It is key to many valuable applications, including community detection and network dismantling. Computing BC scores on large networks is computationally challenging due to its high time complexity. Many sampling-based approximation algorithms have been proposed to speed up the estimation of BC. However, these methods still need considerable long running time on large-scale networks, and their results are sensitive to even small perturbation to the networks. In this paper, we focus on the efficient identification of top-k nodes with highest BC in a graph, which is an essential task to many network applications. Different from previous heuristic methods, we turn this task into a learning problem and design an encoder-decoder based framework as a solution. Specifically, the encoder leverages the network structure to represent each node as an embedding vector, which captures the important structural information of the node. The decoder transforms each embedding vector into a scalar, which identifies the relative rank of a node in terms of its BC. We use the pairwise ranking loss to train the model to identify the orders of nodes regarding their BC. By training on small-scale networks, the model is capable of assigning relative BC scores to nodes for much larger networks, and thus identifying the highly-ranked nodes. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that, compared to existing baselines, our model drastically speeds up the prediction without noticeable sacrifice in accuracy, and even outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of accuracy on several large real-world networks."}}

Given a query, POLAR uses an attention-based CNN to estimate the relevance score between the query and related articles. The attention mechanism can help significantly improve the relevance estimation. For example, on AMiner, this can help achieve a +5.0% improvement in terms of NDCG@3. One more challenge in personalized article recommendation is how to collect statistically sufficient training data for a recommendation model. POLAR combines a one-shot learning function into the recommendation model, which further gains significant improvements. For example, on AMiner, with only \u00a01.6 feedbacks on average, POLAR achieves 2.7% improvement by NDCG@3. We evaluate the proposed POLAR on three different datasets: AMiner, Patent, and RARD. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Recently, we have successfully deployed POLAR into AMiner as the recommendation engine for article recommendation, which further confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model.
