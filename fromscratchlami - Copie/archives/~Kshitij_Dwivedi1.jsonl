While different toolboxes facilitate only single functionalities or only focus on a small subset of supervised image classification models, Net2Brain allows the extraction of activations of more than 600 DNNs trained to perform a diverse range of vision-related tasks (e.g semantic segmentation, depth estimation, action recognition, etc.), over both image and video datasets. The toolbox computes the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) over those activations and compares them to brain recordings using representational similarity analysis (RSA), weighted RSA, both in specific ROIs and with searchlight search. In addition, it is possible to add a new data set of stimuli and brain recordings to the toolbox for evaluation. We demonstrate the functionality and advantages of Net2Brain with an example showcasing how it can be used to test hypotheses of cognitive computational neuroscience."}}

Such models offer little to no interpretability about the learned skills or the actions of the agent taken in response to its environment. While past works have explored interpreting deep learning models, little attention has been devoted to interpreting embodied AI systems, which often involve reasoning about the structure of the environment, target characteristics and the outcome of one's actions. In this paper, we introduce the Interpretability System for Embodied agEnts (iSEE) for Point Goal and Object Goal navigation agents. We use iSEE to probe the dynamic representations produced by these agents for the presence of information about the agent as well as the environment. We demonstrate interesting insights about navigation agents using iSEE, including the ability to encode reachable locations (to avoid obstacles), visibility of the target, progress from the initial spawn location as well as the dramatic effect on the behaviors of agents when we mask out critical individual neurons.

The common approach is to take a pre-trained network in a similar task and finetune the model parameters. This is usually done blindly without a pre-selection from a set of pre-trained models, or by finetuning a set of models trained on different tasks and selecting the best performing one by cross-validation. We address this problem by proposing an approach to assess the relationship between visual tasks and their task-specific models. Our method uses Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA), which is commonly used to find a correlation between neuronal responses from brain data and models. With RSA we obtain a similarity score among tasks by computing correlations between models trained on different tasks. Our method is efficient as it requires only pre-trained models, and a few images with no further training. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method for generating task taxonomy on Taskonomy dataset. We next evaluate the relationship of RSA with the transfer learning performance on Taskonomy tasks and a new task: Pascal VOC semantic segmentation. Our results reveal that models trained on tasks with higher similarity score show higher transfer learning performance. Surprisingly, the best transfer learning result for Pascal VOC semantic segmentation is not obtained from the pre-trained model on semantic segmentation, probably due to the domain differences, and our method successfully selects the high performing models."}}

However, the differential contribution of OPA and PPA to scene perception remains an open research question. In this study, we take a deep neural network (DNN)-based computational approach to investigate the differences in OPA and PPA function. In a first step, we search for a computational model that predicts fMRI responses to scenes in OPA and PPA well. We find that DNNs trained to predict scene components (e.g., wall, ceiling, floor) explain higher variance uniquely in OPA and PPA than a DNN trained to predict scene category (e.g., bathroom, kitchen, office). This result is robust across several DNN architectures. On this basis, we then determine whether particular scene components predicted by DNNs differentially account for unique variance in OPA and PPA. We find that variance in OPA responses uniquely explained by the navigation-related floor component is higher compared to the variance explained by the wall and ceiling components. In contrast, PPA responses are better explained by the combination of wall and floor, that is, scene components that together contain the structure and texture of the scene. This differential sensitivity to scene components suggests differential functions of OPA and PPA in scene processing. Moreover, our results further highlight the potential of the proposed computational approach as a general tool in the investigation of the neural basis of human scene perception."}}

However, the exact function of these regions remains unknown, and thus it remains unclear how those regions together orchestrate visual perception. Here, we apply an AI-driven brain mapping approach to reveal visual brain function. This approach integrates multiple artificial deep neural networks trained on a diverse set of functions with functional recordings of the whole human brain. Our results reveal a systematic tiling of visual cortex by mapping regions to particular functions of the deep networks. Together this constitutes a comprehensive account of the functions of the distinct cortical regions of the brain that mediate human visual perception."}}

We propose a new highly efficient and accurate approach based on duality diagram similarity (DDS) between deep neural networks (DNNs). DDS is a generic framework to represent and compare data of different feature dimensions. We validate our approach on the Taskonomy dataset by measuring the correspondence between actual transfer learning performance rankings on 17 taskonomy tasks and predicted rankings. Computing DDS based ranking for $$17\\times 17$$ transfers requires less than 2\u00a0min and shows a high correlation (0.86) with actual transfer learning rankings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin ( $$10\\%$$ ) on the Taskonomy benchmark. We also demonstrate the robustness of our model selection approach to a new task, namely Pascal VOC semantic segmentation. Additionally, we show that our method can be applied to select the best layer locations within a DNN for transfer learning on 2D, 3D and semantic tasks on NYUv2 and Pascal VOC datasets."}}

State-of-the-art methods favor such deep network architectures for its accuracy performance, with the cost of having massive number of parameters and high weights redundancy. Previous works have studied how to prune such CNNs weights. In this paper, we go to another extreme and analyze the performance of a network stacked with a single convolution kernel across layers, as well as other weights sharing techniques. We name it Deep Anchored Convolutional Neural Network (DACNN). Sharing the same kernel weights across layers allows to reduce the model size tremendously, more precisely, the network is compressed in memory by a factor of L, where L is the desired depth of the network, disregarding the fully connected layer for prediction. The number of parameters in DACNN barely increases as the network grows deeper, which allows us to build deep DACNNs without any concern about memory costs. We also introduce a partial shared weights network (DACNN-mix) as well as an easy-plug-in module, coined regulators, to boost the performance of our architecture. We validated our idea on 3 datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN. Our results show that we can save massive amounts of memory with our model, while maintaining a high accuracy performance."}}

However, direct training of a DNN with fMRI data is often avoided because the size of available data is thought to be insufficient for training a complex network with numerous parameters. Instead, a pre-trained DNN usually serves as a proxy for hierarchical visual representations, and fMRI data are used to decode individual DNN features of a stimulus image using a simple linear model, which are then passed to a reconstruction module. Here, we directly trained a DNN model with fMRI data and the corresponding stimulus images to build an end-to-end reconstruction model. We accomplished this by training a generative adversarial network with an additional loss term that was defined in high-level feature space (feature loss) using up to 6,000 training data samples (natural images and fMRI responses). The above model was tested on independent datasets and directly reconstructed image using an fMRI pattern as the input. Reconstructions obtained from our proposed method resembled the test stimuli (natural and artificial images) and reconstruction accuracy increased as a function of training-data size. Ablation analyses indicated that the feature loss that we employed played a critical role in achieving accurate reconstruction.
