Despite achieving a worst-case competitive ratio that is exponential in $n$, the simple greedy algorithm, which matches each request to its nearest available free server, performs very well in practice. A major question is thus to explain greedy's strong empirical performance. In this paper, we aim to understand the performance of greedy over instances that are at least partially random. When both the requests and the servers are drawn uniformly and independently from $[0,1]$, we show that greedy is constant competitive, which improves over the previously best-known $O(\\sqrt{n})$ bound. We extend this constant competitive ratio to a setting with a linear excess of servers, which improves over the previously best-known $O(\\log^3{n})$ bound. We moreover show that in the semi-random model where the requests are still drawn uniformly and independently but where the servers are chosen adversarially, greedy achieves an $O(\\log{n})$ competitive ratio. When the requests arrive in a random order but are chosen adversarially, it was previously known that greedy is $O(n)$-competitive. Even though this one-sided randomness allows a large improvement in greedy's competitive ratio compared to the model where requests are adversarial and arrive in a random order, we show that it is not sufficient to obtain a constant competitive ratio by giving a tight $\\Omega(\\log{n})$ lower bound. These results invite further investigation about how much randomness is necessary and sufficient to obtain strong theoretical guarantees for the greedy algorithm for online minimum cost matching, on the line and beyond."}}

In each period, the seller needs to decide on the assortment of products (of cardinality at most $K$) to offer to the customers. The customer's response follows an unknown multinomial logit model (MNL) with parameters $v$. The goal of the seller is to maximize the total expected revenue given the fixed initial inventory of $N$ products. We give a policy that achieves a regret of $\\tilde O\\Big(K \\sqrt{KN T}\\Big(\\sqrt{v_{\\text{max}}} + \\frac{1}{q_{\\text{min}}}\\text{OPT}\\Big)\\Big)$, where $v_{\\text{max}}\\leq 1$ is the maximum utility for any product and $q_{\\text{min}}$ the minimum inventory level, under a mild assumption on the model parameters. In particular, our policy achieves a near-optimal $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret in a large-inventory setting. Our policy builds upon the UCB-based approach for MNL-bandit without inventory constraints in [1] and addresses the inventory constraints through an exponentially sized LP for which we present a tractable approximation while keeping the $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound."}}
