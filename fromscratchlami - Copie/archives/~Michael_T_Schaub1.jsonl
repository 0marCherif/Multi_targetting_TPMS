The proposed algorithm trades off the diversity in network samples against the depth of the neighborhood structure that is preserved. Our key innovation is to employ a colored Configuration Model with colors derived from iterations of the so-called Color Refinement algorithm. We prove that with increasing iterations the preserved structural information increases: the generated synthetic networks and the original network become more and more similar, and are eventually indistinguishable in terms of centrality measures such as PageRank, HITS, Katz centrality and eigenvector centrality. Our work enables to efficiently generate samples with a precisely controlled similarity to the original network, especially for large networks."}}

TPCC synthesizes desirable features from spectral clustering and topological data analysis and is based on considering the spectral properties of a simplicial complex associated to the considered point cloud. As it is based on considering sparse eigenvector computations, TPCC is similarly easy to interpret and implement as spectral clustering. However, by focusing not just on a single matrix associated to a graph created from the point cloud data, but on a whole set of Hodge-Laplacians associated to an appropriately constructed simplicial complex, we can leverage a far richer set of topological features to characterize the data points within the point cloud and benefit from the relative robustness of topological techniques against noise. We test the performance of TPCC on both synthetic and real-world data and compare it with classical spectral clustering."}}

So far such signals are typically processed independently of each other, and algorithms that can enforce a consistent processing of topological signals across different levels are largely lacking. Here we propose Dirac signal processing, an adaptive, unsupervised signal processing algorithm that learns to jointly filter topological signals supported on nodes, links and (filled) triangles of simplicial complexes in a consistent way. The proposed Dirac signal processing algorithm is rooted in algebraic topology and formulated in terms of the discrete Dirac operator which can be interpreted as ``square root\" of a higher-order (Hodge) Laplacian matrix acting on nodes, links and triangles of simplicial complexes. We test our algorithms on noisy synthetic data and noisy data of drifters in the ocean and find that the algorithm can learn to efficiently reconstruct the true signals outperforming algorithms based exclusively on the Hodge Laplacian."}}

In this work, we examine how different network growth interventions impact the position of minority nodes in degree rankings over time. We distinguish between two kinds of interventions: (i) group size interventions, such as introducing quotas, that regulate the ratio of incoming minority and majority nodes; and (ii) behavioural interventions, such as homophily, i.e. varying how groups interact and connect to each other. We find that even extreme group size interventions do not have a strong effect on the position of minorities in rankings if certain behavioural changes do not manifest at the same time. For example, minority representation in rankings is not increased by high quotas if the actors in the network do not adopt homophilic behaviour. As a result, a key finding of our research is that in order for the visibility of minorities to improve, group size and behavioural interventions need to be coordinated. Moreover, their potential benefit is highly dependent on pre-intervention conditions in social networks. In a real-world case study, we explore the effectiveness of interventions to reach gender parity in academia. Our work lays a theoretical and computational foundation for further studies aiming to explore the effectiveness of interventions in growing networks."}}

However, most works so far have considered signal processing problems for signals associated to only a single type of cell such as the processing of node signals, or edge signals, by considering an appropriately defined shift operator, like the graph Laplacian or the Hodge Laplacian. Here we introduce the Dirac operator as a novel kind of shift operator for signal processing on complexes. We discuss how the Dirac operator has close relations but is distinct from the Hodge-Laplacian and examine its spectral properties. Importantly, the Dirac operator couples signals defined on cells of neighboring dimensions in a principled fashion. We demonstrate how this enables us, e.g., to leverage node signals for the processing of edge flows."}}

Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that for homophilous graph data, impactful structural attacks always lead to reduced homophily, while for heterophilous graph data the change in the homophily level depends on the node degrees. These insights have practical implications for defending against attacks on real-world graphs: we deduce that separate aggregators for ego- and neighbor-embeddings, a design principle which has been identified to significantly improve prediction for heterophilous graph data, can also offer increased robustness to GNNs. Our comprehensive experiments show that GNNs merely adopting this design achieve improved empirical and certifiable robustness compared to the best-performing unvaccinated model. Additionally, combining this design with explicit defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks leads to an improved robustness with up to 18.33% performance increase under attacks compared to the best-performing vaccinated model."}}

Thus far, such non-Euclidean domains have been abstracted primarily as graphs with signals supported on the nodes, though the processing of signals on more general structures such as simplicial complexes has also been considered. In this paper, we give an introduction to signal processing on (abstract) regular cell complexes, which provide a unifying framework encompassing graphs, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes and various meshes as special cases. We discuss how appropriate Hodge Laplacians for these cell complexes can be derived. These Hodge Laplacians enable the construction of convolutional filters, which can be employed in linear filtering and non-linear filtering via neural networks defined on cell complexes."}}
