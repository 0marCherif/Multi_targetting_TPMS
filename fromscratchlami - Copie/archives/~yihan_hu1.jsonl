Training with binocular stereo images is considered as a\ngood option as the data can be easily obtained. However, the depth or disparity\nprediction results show poor performance for the object boundaries. The main\nreason is related to the handling of occlusion areas during the training. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel method to overcome this issue. Exploiting disparity maps\nproperty, we generate an occlusion mask to block the back-propagation of the occlusion\nareas during image warping. We also design new networks with flipped\nstereo images to induce the networks to learn occluded boundaries. It shows that\nour method achieves clearer boundaries and better evaluation results on KITTI\ndriving dataset and Virtual KITTI dataset."}}
