Indeed, subspaces defined by its eigenfunctions have been utilized for shape compression, treating the coordinates as smooth functions defined on the given surface. However, surfaces of shapes in nature often contain geometric structures for which the general smoothness assumption may fail to hold. At the other end, some explicit mesh compression algorithms utilize the order by which vertices that represent the surface are traversed, a property which has been ignored in spectral approaches. Here, we incorporate the order of vertices into an operator that defines a novel spectral domain. We propose a method for representing 3D meshes using the spectral geometry of the Hamiltonian operator, integrated within a sparse approximation framework. We adapt the concept of a potential function from quantum physics and incorporate vertex ordering information into the potential, yielding a novel data-dependent operator. The potential function modifies the spectral geometry of the Laplacian to focus on regions with finer details of the given\nsurface. By sparsely encoding the geometry of the shape using the proposed data-dependent basis, we improve compression performance compared to previous results that use the standard Laplacian basis and spectral graph wavelets."}}

Existing methods often show weak resilience when presented with challenges innate to real-world data such as noise, outliers, self-occlusion etc. On the other hand, auto-decoders have demonstrated strong expressive power in learning geometrically meaningful latent embeddings. However, their use in \\emph{shape analysis} has been limited. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on an auto-decoder framework, that learns a continuous shape-wise deformation field over a fixed template. By supervising the deformation field for points on-surface and regularising for points off-surface through a novel \\emph{Signed Distance Regularisation} (SDR), we learn an alignment between the template and shape \\emph{volumes}. Trained on clean water-tight meshes, \\emph{without} any data-augmentation, we demonstrate compelling performance on compromised data and real-world scans."}}

With this analysis in hand, we develop a novel spectral registration technique: Fast Sinkhorn Filters, which allows for the recovery of accurate and bijective pointwise correspondences with a superior time and memory complexity in comparison to existing approaches. Our method combines the simple and concise representation of correspondence using functional maps with the matrix scaling schemes from computational optimal transport. By exploiting the sparse structure of the kernel matrices involved in the transport map computation, we provide an efficient trade-off between acceptable accuracy and complexity for the problem of dense shape correspondence."}}

Existing formulations tackle this problem through heavy manifold optimization in the spectral domain, given hand-crafted shape descriptors. In this paper, we propose the first learning method aimed directly at partial non-rigid shape correspondence. Our approach uses the functional map framework, can be trained in a supervised or unsupervised manner, and learns descriptors directly from the data, thus both improving robustness and accuracy in challenging cases. Furthermore, unlike existing techniques, our method is also applicable to partial-to-partial non-rigid matching, in which the common regions on both shapes are unknown a priori. We demonstrate that the resulting method is data-efficient, and achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.

We use the Siamese configuration to train a neural network to solve the problem of least squares multidimensional scaling for generating maps that approximately preserve geodesic distances. By training with only a few landmarks, we show a significantly improved local and nonlocal generalization of the isometric mapping as compared to analogous non-parametric counterparts. Importantly, the combination of a deep-learning framework with a multidimensional scaling objective enables a numerical analysis of network architectures to aid in understanding their representation power. This provides a geometric perspective to the generalizability of deep learning."}}
