These tasks are usually handled separately and use corpora extracted from a single source. Current systems leverage pre-trained language models fine-tuned on D2T or T2D tasks. This approach has two main limitations: first, a separate system has to be tuned for each task and source; second, learning is limited by the scarcity of available corpora. This paper considers a more general scenario where data are available from multiple heterogeneous sources. Each source, with its specific data format and semantic domain, provides a non-parallel corpus of text and structured data. We introduce a variational auto-encoder model with disentangled style and content variables that allows us to represent the diversity that stems from multiple sources of text and data. Our model is designed to handle the tasks of D2T and T2D jointly. We evaluate our model on several datasets, and show that by learning from multiple sources, our model closes the performance gap with its supervised single-source counterpart and outperforms it in some cases."}}

If the user finds the recommended items appealing then the user may click and the recommender system receives some feedback. Two pieces of information are available to the recommender system: was the slate clicked? (the reward), and if the slate was clicked, which item was clicked? (rank). In this paper, we formulate several Bayesian models that incorporate the reward signal (Reward model), the rank signal (Rank model), or both (Full model), for non-personalized slate recommendation. In our experiments, we analyze performance gains of the Full model and show that it achieves significantly lower error as the number of products in the catalog grows or as the slate size increases."}}

Recommender systems in particular are one of the largest users of machine learning in production environments that have improved performance of real-world systems. Learning in these interactive systems requires models that combine very diverse signals, including the logs of the interactive system (indicating if the intervention succeeded or failed) augmented with other data sources including: collaborative filtering, text, and image data. Bayesian inference is a compelling method to combine these diverse signals in a principled manner, but deployment of systems based on Bayesian principles remain challenging. The reward signal in the system logs is often uneven. Accurate estimation of reward is possible for exploiting actions, but often poor for other actions (exploration). Non-Bayesian methods such as inverse propensity score methods, the reinforce algorithm, and other heuristic-based approaches currently dominate practice. These commonly-used heuristics are often ineffective at leveraging diverse data. In contrast, Bayesian methods offer a principled, robust framework for learning from uneven signals and combining different types of information. Drawing upon the bandit and reinforcement learning community, in this workshop we will explore innovations in Bayesian inference for real world interactive systems, and consider advantages and limitations of the Bayesian approach."}}

Most prior work on DPP learning focuses on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).

In this work, by deriving a differentiable relaxation of a DPP sampling algorithm, we present a novel approach for learning DPPs that minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the model and data composed of observed subsets. Through an evaluation on a real-world dataset, we show that our Wasserstein learning approach provides significantly improved predictive performance on a generative task compared to DPPs trained using MLE."}}

DPPs are conventionally parameterized by a positive semi-definite kernel matrix, and this symmetric kernel encodes only repulsive interactions between items. These so-called symmetric DPPs have significant expressive power, and have been successfully applied to a variety of machine learning tasks, including recommendation systems, information retrieval, and automatic summarization, among many others. Efficient algorithms for learning symmetric DPPs and sampling from these models have been reasonably well studied. However, relatively little attention has been given to nonsymmetric DPPs, which relax the symmetric constraint on the kernel. Nonsymmetric DPPs allow for both repulsive and attractive item interactions, which can significantly improve modeling power, resulting in a model that may better fit for some applications. We present a method that enables a tractable algorithm, based on maximum likelihood estimation, for learning nonsymmetric DPPs from data composed of observed subsets. Our method imposes a particular decomposition of the nonsymmetric kernel that enables such tractable learning algorithms, which we analyze both theoretically and experimentally. We evaluate our model on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating improved predictive performance compared to symmetric DPPs, which have previously shown strong performance on modeling tasks associated with these datasets."}}
