Here we characterise the early transmission that seeded the country-wide spread of the disease, and assess attempts to attenuate the spread through implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) at subnational level. The analysis presented uses a Bayesian hierarchical approach to model transmission based on mortality data. The statistical model encodes a causal inferential bias for generic infectious disease transmission --- deaths are generated by infections which arise from earlier infections. As transmission is heterogeneous at subnational level, from differences such as the timing of seeding and hospital capacities, this is modelled by partially pooling parameters across geographic regions, using state-level mobility covariates for the reproduction number ($R_t$), and through inference of region-specific epidemiological parameters. We report extensive heterogeneity in the initial epidemic trajectory across Brazil underscoring the importance of sub-national analyses in understanding asynchronous state-level epidemics underlying the national spread and burden of COVID-19."}}

They consist of a noising process destroying the data and a backward stage defined as the time-reversal of the noising diffusion. Building on their success, diffusion models have recently been extended to the Riemannian manifold setting. Yet, these Riemannian diffusion models require geodesics to be defined for all times. While this setting encompasses many important applications, it does not include manifolds defined via a set of inequality constraints, which are ubiquitous in many scientific domains such as robotics and protein design. In this work, we introduce two methods to bridge this gap. First, we design a noising process based on the logarithmic barrier metric induced by the inequality constraints. Second, we introduce a noising process based on the reflected Brownian motion. As existing diffusion model techniques cannot be applied in this setting, we derive new tools to define such models in our framework. We empirically demonstrate the applicability of our methods to a number of synthetic and real-world tasks, including the constrained conformational modelling of protein backbones and robotic arms."}}

Motivated by a desire to deploy Gaussian processes in novel areas of science, a rapidly-growing line of research has focused on constructively extending these models to handle non-Euclidean domains, including Riemannian manifolds, such as spheres and tori. We propose techniques that generalize this class to model vector fields on Riemannian manifolds, which are important in a number of application areas in the physical sciences. To do so, we present a general recipe for constructing gauge independent kernels, which induce Gaussian vector fields, i.e. vector-valued Gaussian processes coherent with\ngeometry, from scalar-valued Riemannian kernels. We extend standard Gaussian process training methods, such as variational inference, to this setting. This enables vector-valued Gaussian processes on Riemannian manifolds to be trained using standard methods and makes them accessible to machine learning practitioners."}}
