Unfortunately, selective classification and out-of-distribution detection are notably difficult as it is hard to anticipate all possible examples. To mitigate this challenge, we focus on the transductive setting, where unlabeled examples from the test distribution are available during training. We propose transductive confidence minimization (TCM), which minimizes prediction confidence on unlabeled test examples while simultaneously optimizing the training objective. We theoretically show that TCM learns a lower bound on the true confidence, and that this property can be leveraged to provably detect examples that are sufficiently different from training examples, regardless of what distribution they came from. In our experiments, TCM consistently shows high performance, achieving the highest OOD detection performance compared to 6 other methods on 9 out of 10 ID->OOD pairs and consistently outperforming methods for selective classification in settings where we test on data from a previously unseen distribution."}}

In this paper, we identify a property of the structure of an LLM's probability function that is useful for such detection. Specifically, we demonstrate that text sampled from an LLM tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model's log probability function. Leveraging this observation, we then define a new curvature-based criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM. This approach, which we call DetectGPT, does not require training a separate classifier, collecting a dataset of real or generated passages, or explicitly watermarking generated text. It uses only log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations of the passage from another generic pre-trained language model (e.g., T5). We find DetectGPT is more discriminative than existing zero-shot methods for model sample detection, notably improving detection of fake news articles generated by 20B parameter GPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest zero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for DetectGPT.

We validate our findings systematically across seven real-world data tasks spanning three types of distribution shifts. Theoretically, we prove that for two-layer neural networks in an idealized setting, first-layer tuning can outperform fine-tuning all layers.

An instantiation of this idea is the \\textit{Kolmogorov Structure Function} (KSF), which shows how the fit of an optimal $k$-bit description of a given string improves for increasing values of $k$. While conceptually appealing, computing the KSF is infeasible in practice due to the exponentially large search space of all descriptions of a given length, in addition to the unbounded time complexity. This paper proposes the Constrained Structure Function (CSF), a generalization of the KSF that can be computed efficiently by taking into account realistic computational constraints. In addition to being feasible to compute, the CSF of a dataset can be expressed as the sum of datapoint-wise functions which reflect the degree to which each datapoint is typical in the context of the dataset. Empirically, we demonstrate that the CSF can be used for detecting individual datapoints with characteristics such as being easy, mislabeled, or belonging to a hidden subgroup."}}
