Formally, this is known as conditional effect identification, where the goal is to determine whether a post-interventional distribution is computable from the combination of an observational distribution and assumptions about the underlying domain represented by a causal diagram. A plethora of methods was developed for solving this problem, including the celebrated do-calculus [Pearl, 1995]. In practice, these results are not always applicable since they require a fully specified causal diagram as input, which is usually not available. In this paper, we assume as the input of the task a less informative structure known as a partial ancestral graph (PAG), which represents a Markov equivalence class of causal diagrams, learnable from observational data. We make the following contributions under this relaxed setting. First, we introduce a new causal calculus, which subsumes the current state-of-the-art, PAG-calculus. Second, we develop an algorithm for conditional effect identification given a PAG and prove it to be both sound and complete. In words, failure of the algorithm to identify a certain effect implies that this effect is not identifiable by any method. Third, we prove the proposed calculus to be complete for the same task."}}

A generalization of this problem restricts the qualitative knowledge to a class of Markov equivalent causal diagrams, which, unlike a single, fully specified causal diagram, can be inferred from the observational distribution. Recent work by (Jaber et al., 2019) devised a complete algorithm for the identification of unconditional causal effects given a Markov equivalence class of causal diagrams. However, there are identifiable conditional causal effects that cannot be handled by that algorithm. In this work, we derive an algorithm to identify conditional effects, which are particularly useful for evaluating conditional plans or policies."}}

This description is given by a partial ancestral graph (PAG) that represents a Markov equivalence class of causal diagrams, i.e., diagrams that entail the same conditional independence model over observed variables, and is learnable from the observational data. Accordingly, we develop a complete algorithm to compute the causal effect of an arbitrary set of intervention variables on an arbitrary outcome set."}}

In this paper, we investigate the more general scenario where multiple observational and experimental distributions are available. We start with the simple observation that the invariances given by CIs/d-separation are just one special type of a broader set of constraints, which follow from the careful comparison of the different distributions available. Remarkably, these new constraints are intrinsically connected with do-calculus (Pearl, 1995) in the context of soft-interventions. We introduce a novel notion of interventional equivalence class of causal graphs with latent variables based on these invariances, which associates each graphical structure with a set of interventional distributions that respect the do-calculus rules. Given a collection of distributions, two causal graphs are called interventionally equivalent if they are associated with the same family of interventional distributions, where the elements of the family are indistinguishable using the invariances obtained from a direct application of the calculus rules. We introduce a graphical representation that can be used to determine if two causal graphs are interventionally equivalent. We provide a formal graphical characterization of this equivalence. Finally, we extend the FCI algorithm, which was originally designed to operate based on CIs, to combine observational and interventional datasets, including new orientation rules particular to this setting."}}

The problem is addressed by identifying the post-interventional distribution with an expression that involves only quantities estimable from the pre-interventional distribution over observed variables, given some knowledge about the causal structure. In this work, we relax the requirement of having a fully specified causal structure and study the identifiability of effects with a singleton intervention (X), supposing that the structure is known only up to an equivalence class of causal diagrams, which is the output of standard structural learning algorithms (e.g., FCI). We derive a necessary and sufficient graphical criterion for the identifiability of the effect of X on all observed variables. We further establish a sufficient graphical criterion to identify the effect of X on a subset of the observed variables, and prove that it is strictly more powerful than the current state-of-the-art result on this problem."}}
