Addressing Common Object Errors for Unseen Environments", "abstract": "We introduce a simple method that employs pre-trained CLIP encoders to enhance model generalization in the ALFRED task. In contrast to previous literature where CLIP replaces the visual encoder, we suggest using CLIP as an additional module through an auxiliary object detection objective. We validate our method on the recently proposed Episodic Transformer architecture and demonstrate that incorporating CLIP improves task performance on the unseen validation set. Additionally, our analysis results support that CLIP especially helps with leveraging object descriptions, detecting small objects, and interpreting rare words."}}

Detailed studies of the microglial response after TBI require high throughput quantification of changes in microglial count and morphology in histological sections throughout the brain. In this paper, we present a fully automated end-to-end system that is capable of assessing microglial activation in white matter regions on whole slide images of Iba1 stained sections. Our approach involves the division of the full brain slides into smaller image patches that are subsequently automatically classified into white and grey matter sections. On the patches classified as white matter, we jointly apply functional minimization methods and deep learning classification to identify Iba1-immunopositive microglia. Detected cells are then automatically traced to preserve their complex branching structure after which fractal analysis is applied to determine the activation states of the cells. The resulting system detects white matter regions with 84% accuracy, detects microglia with a performance level of 0.70 (F1 score, the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity) and performs binary microglia morphology classification with a 70% accuracy. This automated pipeline performs these analyses at a 20-fold increase in speed when compared to a human pathologist. Moreover, we have demonstrated robustness to variations in stain intensity common for Iba1 immunostaining. A preliminary analysis was conducted that indicated that this pipeline can identify differences in microglia response due to TBI. An automated solution to microglia cell analysis can greatly increase standardized analysis of brain slides, allowing pathologists and neuroscientists to focus on characterizing the associated underlying diseases and injuries."}}
