One can apply multiple algorithms to produce $N$ potentially different clustersings of the same objects, that is, partitions of the $n$ objects into $K$ groups. Even a single randomized algorithm can output different clusterings. This often happens when one samples from the posterior of a Bayesian model, or runs multiple MCMC chains from random initializations. A natural task is then to form a consensus among these different clusterings. The challenge in an unsupervised setting is that the optimal matching between clusters of different inputs is unknown. We model this problem as finding a barycenter (also known as Fr\\'{e}chet mean) relative to the misclassification rate. We show that by lifting the problem to the space of association matrices, one can derive aggregation algorithms that circumvent the knowledge of the optimal matchings. We analyze the statistical performance of aggregation algorithms under a stochastic label perturbation model, and show that a $K$-means type algorithm followed by a local refinement step can achieve near optimal performance, with a rate that decays exponentially fast in $N$. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed methods."}}

Recent studies bring proximity graph-based methods into practitioners' attention -- proximity graph-based methods outperform other solutions such as quantization, hashing, and tree-based ANN algorithm families. In current recommendation systems, data point insertions, deletions, and queries are streamed into the system in an online fashion as users and items change dynamically. As proximity graphs are constructed incrementally by inserting data points as new vertices into the graph, online insertions and queries are well-supported in proximity graph. However, a data point deletion incurs removing a vertex from the proximity graph index, while no proper graph index updating mechanisms are discussed in previous studies. To tackle the challenge, we propose an incremental proximity graph maintenance (IPGM) algorithm for online ANN. IPGM supports both vertex deletion and insertion on proximity graphs. Given a vertex deletion request, we thoroughly investigate solutions to update the connections of the vertex. The proposed updating scheme eliminates the performance drop in online ANN methods on proximity graphs, making the algorithm suitable for practical systems."}}

Finally, under some structured perturbation $\\mathbf{S}_0$, we build the connection between this model with spiked covariance model and develop a new estimation procedure.

Recommendation algorithms, e.g., matrix factorization, typically produce latent vectors to represent users or items. The recommendation services are conducted by retrieving the most relevant item vectors given the user vector, where the relevance is often defined by inner product. Therefore, developing efficient recommender systems often requires solving the so-called maximum inner product search (MIPS) problem. In the past decade, there have been many studies on efficient MIPS algorithms. This task is challenging in part because the inner product does not follow the triangle inequality of metric space. Compared with hash-based or quantization-based MIPS solutions, in recent years graph-based MIPS algorithms have demonstrated their strong empirical advantages in many real-world MIPS tasks. In this paper, we propose a new index graph construction method named norm adjusted proximity graph (NAPG), for efficient MIPS. With adjusting factors estimated on sampled data, NAPG is able to select more meaningful data points to connect with when constructing graph-based index for inner product search. Our extensive experiments on a variety of datasets verify that the improved graph-based index strategy provides another strong addition to the pool of efficient MIPS algorithms."}}

However, the applications of these fine trained recommendation models are limited to the off-line manner or the re-ranking procedure (on a pre-filtered small subset of items), due to their time-consuming computations. Fast item ranking under learned neural network based ranking measures is largely still an open question. In this paper, we formulate ranking under neural network based measures as a generic ranking task, Optimal Binary Function Search (OBFS), which does not make strong assumptions for the ranking measures. We first analyze limitations of existing fast ranking methods (e.g., ANN search) and explain why they are not applicable for OBFS. Further, we propose a flexible graph-based solution for it, Binary Function Search on Graph (BFSG). It can achieve approximate optimal efficiently, with accessible conditions. Experiments demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, in fast item ranking under typical neural network based measures."}}

A stable inverse function of the generator can be learned with the help of a variance network of the generator. The local variance of the sample distribution can be approximated by the normalized distance in the latent space. Simulation studies and likelihood testing on real-world data sets validate the proposed algorithm, which outperforms several baseline methods in these tasks.

We present a fast two-stage procedure based on spectral initialization followed by the application of a pseudo-likelihood classifier twice. Under mild regularity conditions, we establish the weak consistency of the procedure (i.e., the convergence of the misclassification rate to zero) under a general bipartite stochastic block model. We show that the procedure is optimal in the sense that it achieves the optimal convergence rate that is achievable by a biclustering oracle, adaptively over the whole class, up to constants. This is further formalized by deriving a minimax lower bound over a class of biclustering problems. The optimal rate we obtain sharpens some of the existing results and generalizes others to a wide regime of average degree growth, from sparse networks with average degrees growing arbitrarily slowly to fairly dense networks with average degrees of order $\\sqrt{n}$. As a special case, we recover the known exact recovery threshold in the $\\log n$ regime of sparsity. To obtain the consistency result, as part of the provable version of the algorithm, we introduce a sub-block partitioning scheme that is also computationally attractive, allowing for distributed implementation of the algorithm without sacrificing optimality. The provable algorithm is derived from a general class of pseudo-likelihood biclustering algorithms that employ simple EM type updates. We show the effectiveness of this general class by numerical simulations."}}
