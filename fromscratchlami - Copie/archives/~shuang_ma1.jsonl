However, there lacks a unified video action localization framework, which hinders the coordinated development of this field. Existing 3D CNN methods take fixed and limited input length at the cost of ignoring temporally long-range cross-modal interaction. On the other hand, despite having large temporal context, existing sequential methods often avoid dense cross-modal interactions for complexity reasons. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a unified framework which handles the whole video in sequential manner with long-range and dense visual-linguistic interaction in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, a lightweight relevance filtering based transformer (Ref-Transformer) is designed, which is composed of relevance filtering based attention and temporally expanded MLP. The text-relevant spatial regions and temporal clips in video can be efficiently highlighted through the relevance filtering and then propagated among the whole video sequence with the temporally expanded MLP. Extensive experiments on three sub-tasks of referring video action localization, i.e., referring video segmentation, temporal sentence grounding, and spatiotemporal video grounding, show that the proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in all referring video action localization tasks.

Inspired by large pre-trained language models, this work introduces a paradigm for pre-training a general purpose representation that can serve as a starting point for multiple tasks on a given robot.  We present the Perception-Action Causal Transformer (PACT), a generative transformer-based architecture that aims to build representations directly from robot data in a self-supervised fashion. Through autoregressive prediction of states and actions over time, our model implicitly encodes dynamics and behaviors for a particular robot. Our experimental evaluation focuses on the domain of mobile agents, where we show that this robot-specific representation can function as a single starting point to achieve distinct tasks such as safe navigation, localization and mapping. We evaluate two form factors: a wheeled robot that uses a LiDAR sensor as perception input (MuSHR), and a simulated agent that uses first-person RGB images (Habitat). We show that finetuning small task-specific networks on top of the larger pretrained model results in significantly better performance compared to training a single model from scratch for all tasks simultaneously, and comparable performance to training a separate large model for each task independently. By sharing a common good-quality representation across tasks we can lower overall model capacity and speed up the real-time deployment of such systems."}}

However, translating instructions and commands towards robotic motion generation and deployment in the real world is far from being an easy task. The challenge of combining a robot's inherent low-level geometric and kinodynamic constraints with a human's high-level semantic instructions traditionally is solved using task-specific solutions with little generalizability between hardware platforms, often with the use of static sets of target actions and commands. This work instead proposes a flexible language-based framework that allows a user to modify generic robotic trajectories. Our method leverages pre-trained language models (BERT and CLIP) to encode the user's intent and target objects directly from a free-form text input and scene images, fuses geometrical features generated by a transformer encoder network, and finally outputs trajectories using a transformer decoder, without the need of priors related to the task or robot information. We significantly extend the previous work presented in Bucker et al. (2022) by expanding the trajectory parametrization space to 3D and velocity as opposed to just XY movements. In addition, we now train the model to use actual images of the objects in the scene for context (as opposed to textual descriptions), and we evaluate the system in a diverse set of scenarios beyond manipulation, such as aerial and legged robots. Our simulated and real-life experiments demonstrate that our transformer model can successfully follow human intent, modifying the shape and speed of trajectories within multiple environments."}}

Although task-driven approaches are appealing, de-signing models specific to each application can be difficult in the face of limited data, especially when dealing with highly variable multimodal input spaces arising from different tasks in different environments. We introduce the first general-purpose pretraining pipeline, COntrastive Multimodal Pretraining for AutonomouS Systems (COMPASS), to overcome the limitations of task-specific models and existing pretraining approaches. COMPASS constructs a multimodal graph by considering the essential information for autonomous systems and the proper-ties of different modalities. Through this graph, multimodal signals are connected and mapped into two factorized spatio-temporal latent spaces: a \u201cmotion pattern space\u201d and a \u201ccurrent state space.\u201d By learning from multimodal correspondences in each latent space, COMPASS creates state representations that models necessary information such as temporal dynamics, geometry, and semantics. We pretrain COMPASS on a large-scale multimodal simulation dataset TartanAir [1] and evaluate it on drone navigation, vehicle racing, and visual odometry tasks. The experiments indicate that COMPASS can tackle all three scenarios and can also generalize to unseen environments and real-world data. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> Our code implementation can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/COMPASS"}}
