R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat. Methodol. 72 (2010) 269\u2013342) is an MCMC approach for efficiently sampling from the joint posterior distribution of the T latent states in challenging time-series models, for example, in nonlinear or non-Gaussian state-space models. It is also the main ingredient in particle Gibbs samplers which infer unknown model parameters alongside the latent states. In this work, we first prove that the i-CSMC algorithm suffers from a curse of dimension in the dimension of the states, D: it breaks down unless the number of samples (\u2018particles\u2019), N, proposed by the algorithm grows exponentially with D. Then we present a novel \u2018local\u2019 version of the algorithm which proposes particles using Gaussian random-walk moves that are suitably scaled with D. We prove that this iterated random-walk conditional sequential Monte Carlo (i-RW-CSMC) algorithm avoids the curse of dimension: for arbitrary N, its acceptance rates and expected squared jumping distance converge to nontrivial limits as \nD\n\u2192\n\u221e\n. If \nT\n=\nN\n=\n1\n, our proposed algorithm reduces to a Metropolis\u2013Hastings or Barker\u2019s algorithm with Gaussian random-walk moves and we recover the well-known scaling limits for such algorithms."}}

Our approach is based on the fully adapted auxiliary particle filter, which involves Doob's $h$-transforms that are typically intractable. We propose a computational framework to approximate these $h$-transforms by solving the underlying backward Kolmogorov equations using nonlinear Feynman-Kac formulas and neural networks. The methodology allows one to train a locally optimal particle filter prior to the data-assimilation procedure. Numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed approach can be orders of magnitude more efficient than the bootstrap particle filter in the regime of highly informative observations, when the observations are extreme under the model, and if the state dimension is large."}}

The platform has also facilitated computational detection of RNA modifications via machine learning and statistical approaches as they cause detectable shift in the current generated as the modified nucleotides pass through the pores. Nevertheless, since modifications only occur in a handful of positions along the molecules, existing techniques require segmentation of the long squiggle in order to filter off irrelevant signals and this step produces large computational and storage overhead. Inspired by the recent work in vector similarity search, we introduce a segmentation-free approach by utilizing scaled-dot product attention to perform implicit segmentation and feature extraction of raw signals that correspond to sites of interest. We further demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by achieving significant speedup while maintaining competitive performance in m6A detection against existing state-of-the-art methods."}}
