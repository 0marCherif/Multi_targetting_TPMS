Unlike mainstream approaches using global features for simultaneous multi-task learning of ReID and human parsing, or relying on semantic information for attention guidance, DROP argues that the inferior performance of the former is due to distinct granularity requirements for ReID and human parsing features. ReID focuses on instance part-level differences between pedestrian parts, while human parsing centers on semantic spatial context, reflecting the internal structure of the human body. To address this, DROP decouples features for ReID and human parsing, proposing detail-preserving upsampling to combine varying resolution feature maps. Parsing-specific features for human parsing are decoupled, and human position information is exclusively added to the human parsing branch. In the ReID branch, a part-aware compactness loss is introduced to enhance instance-level part differences. Experimental results highlight the efficacy of DROP, especially achieving a Rank-1 accuracy of 76.8% on Occluded-Duke, surpassing two mainstream methods. The codebase is accessible at https://github.com/shuguang-52/DROP."}}

In this paper, we focus on the backdoor attack on deep ReID models. Existing backdoor attack methods follow an all-to-one or all-to-all attack scenario, where all the target classes in the test set have already been seen in the training set. However, ReID is a much more complex fine-grained open-set recognition problem, where the identities in the test set are not contained in the training set. Thus, previous backdoor attack methods for classification are not applicable to ReID. To ameliorate this issue, we propose a novel backdoor attack on deep ReID under a new all-to-unknown scenario, called Dynamic Triggers Invisible Backdoor Attack (DT-IBA). Instead of learning fixed triggers for the target classes from the training set, DT-IBA can dynamically generate new triggers for any unknown identities. Specifically, an identity hashing network is proposed to first extract target identity information from a reference image, which is then injected into the benign images by image steganography. We extensively validate the effectiveness and stealthiness of the proposed attack on benchmark datasets and evaluate the effectiveness of several defense methods against our attack."}}

Although existing human parsing-based ReID methods can tackle this problem with semantic alignment at the finest pixel level, their performance is heavily affected by the human parsing model. Most supervised methods propose to train an extra human parsing model aside from the ReID model with cross-domain human parts annotation, suffering from expensive annotation cost and domain gap; Unsupervised methods integrate a feature clustering-based human parsing process into the ReID model, but lacking supervision signals brings less satisfactory segmentation results. In this paper, we argue that the pre-existing information in the ReID training dataset can be directly used as supervision signals to train the human parsing model without any extra annotation. By integrating a weakly supervised human co-parsing network into the ReID network, we propose a novel framework that exploits shared information across different images of the same pedestrian, called the Human Co-parsing Guided Alignment (HCGA) framework. Specifically, the human co-parsing network is weakly supervised by three consistency criteria, namely global semantics, local space, and background. By feeding the semantic information and deep features from the person ReID network into the guided alignment module, features of the foreground and human parts can then be obtained for effective occluded person ReID. Experiment results on two occluded and two holistic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Especially on Occluded-DukeMTMC, it achieves 70.2% Rank-1 accuracy and 57.5% mAP."}}

Thus, this paper focuses on quantifying this risk by membership inference (MI) attack. Most of the existing MI attack algorithms focus on classification models, while Re-ID follows a totally different training and inference paradigm. Re-ID is a fine-grained recognition task with complex feature embedding, and model outputs commonly used by existing MI like logits and losses are not accessible during inference. Since Re-ID focuses on modelling the relative relationship between image pairs instead of individual semantics, we conduct a formal and empirical analysis which validates that the distribution shift of the inter-sample similarity between training and test set is a critical criterion for Re-ID membership inference. As a result, we propose a novel membership inference attack method based on the inter-sample similarity distribution. Specifically, a set of anchor images are sampled to represent the similarity distribution conditioned on a target image, and a neural network with a novel anchor selection module is proposed to predict the membership of the target image. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both the Re-ID task and conventional classification task."}}

We propose an automated approach to revive static charts into Live Charts. Our method integrates GNN-based techniques to analyze the chart components and extract data from charts. Then we adopt large natural language models to generate appropriate animated visuals along with a voice-over to produce Live Charts from static ones. We conducted a thorough evaluation of our approach, which involved the model performance, use cases, a crowd-sourced user study, and expert interviews. The results demonstrate Live Charts offer a multi-sensory experience where readers can follow the information and understand the data insights better. We analyze the benefits and drawbacks of Live Charts over static charts as a new information consumption experience."}}

Energy consumption is an especially pressing issue for AutoML algorithms because it usually requires repeatedly training large numbers of computationally intensive deep models to search for optimal configurations. This paper takes one of the most essential steps in developing energy-aware (EA) NAS methods, by providing a benchmark that makes EA-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. Specifically, we present the first large-scale energy-aware benchmark that allows studying AutoML methods to achieve better trade-offs between performance and search energy consumption, named EA-HAS-Bench. EA-HAS-Bench provides a large-scale architecture/hyperparameter joint search space, covering diversified configurations related to energy consumption. Furthermore, we propose a novel surrogate model specially designed for large joint search space, which proposes a Bezier curve-based model to predict learning curves with unlimited shape and length. Based on the proposed dataset, we new energy-aware AutoML method that arms existing AutoML algorithms to consider the search energy consumption, and our experiments show that the modified energy-aware AutoML methods achieve a better trade-off between energy consumption and model performance."}}

De-identification (DeID) methods alleviate privacy issues by removing the identity-related of the ReID data. However, most of the existing DeID methods tend to remove all personal identity-related information and compromise the usability of de-identified data on the ReID task. In this paper, we aim to develop a technique that can achieve a good trade-off between privacy protection and data usability for person ReID. To achieve this, we propose a novel de-identification method designed explicitly for person ReID, named Person Identify Shift (PIS). PIS removes the absolute identity in a pedestrian image while preserving the identity relationship between image pairs. By exploiting the interpolation property of variational auto-encoder, PIS shifts each pedestrian image from the current identity to another with a new identity, resulting in images still preserving the relative identities. Experimental results show that our method has a better trade-off between privacy-preserving and model performance than existing de-identification methods and can defend against human and model attacks for data privacy."}}

The prediction score calibration provides a solution to learn the distribution of predicted scores which can explicitly make the model obtain a discriminative representation. Considering the entropy function can be utilized to measure the uncertainty of predicted scores. But, the gradient variation of it is not in line with the expectations of model optimization. To this end, we proposed a general Gaussian Score Calibrating (GSC) loss to calibrate the predicted scores produced by the deep neural networks (DNN). Extensive experiments on over 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed GSC loss can yield consistent and significant performance boosts in a variety of visual tasks. Notably, our label-independent GSC loss can be embedded into common improved methods based on the CE loss easily."}}

In this work, we focus on the noise in person search. We categorize the noise into scene-inherent noise and human-introduced noise. Scene-inherent noise comes from congestion, occlusion, and illumination changes. Human-introduced noise originates from the labeling process. For scene-inherent noise, we propose a novel context contrastive loss to take advantage of the latent contextual information from scene images. Features from context regions are utilized to construct contrastive pairs to constrain the feature discrimination among pedestrians in scene images while maintaining the feature consistency of the same identity. The network can thus learn to distinguish congested and overlapped pedestrians and more robust features can be obtained. For human-introduced noise, we propose a noise-discovery and noise-suppression training process for mislabeling robust person search. After the first training pass, the relation between feature prototypes of different identities is analyzed and the mislabeled pedestrians are discovered. During the second training pass, the label noise is suppressed to reduce the negative influence of mislabeled data. Experiments show that the proposed context-aware noise-robust (CANR) person search can achieve competitive performance. Further ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of CANR."}}
