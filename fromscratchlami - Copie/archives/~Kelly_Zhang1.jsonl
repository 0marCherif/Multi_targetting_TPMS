However, professional advice on optimal oral hygiene practices is often forgotten or abandoned by patients. Therefore patients may benefit from timely and personalized encouragement to engage in oral self-care behaviors. In this paper, we develop an online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for use in optimizing the delivery of mobile-based prompts to encourage oral hygiene behaviors. One of the main challenges in developing such an algorithm is ensuring that the algorithm considers the impact of the current action on the effectiveness of future actions (i.e., delayed effects), especially when the algorithm has been made simple in order to run stably and autonomously in a constrained, real-world setting (i.e., highly noisy, sparse data). We address this challenge by designing a quality reward which maximizes the desired health outcome (i.e., high-quality brushing) while minimizing user burden. We also highlight a procedure for optimizing the hyperparameters of the reward by building a simulation environment test bed and evaluating candidates using the test bed. The RL algorithm discussed in this paper will be deployed in Oralytics, an oral self-care app that provides behavioral strategies to boost patient engagement in oral hygiene practices."}}

However, when deploying reinforcement learning algorithms in the real world, even with domain expertise, it is often difficult to know whether it is appropriate to treat a sequential decision making problem as a CB or an MDP. In other words, do actions affect future states, or only the immediate rewards? Making the wrong assumption regarding the nature of the environment can lead to inefficient learning, or even prevent the algorithm from ever learning an optimal policy, even with infinite data. In this work we develop an online algorithm that uses a Bayesian hypothesis testing approach to learn the nature of the environment. Our algorithm allows practitioners to incorporate prior knowledge about whether the environment is that of a CB or an MDP, and effectively interpolate between classical CB and MDP-based algorithms to mitigate against the effects of misspecifying the environment. We perform simulations and demonstrate that in CB settings our algorithm achieves lower regret than MDP-based algorithms, while in non-bandit MDP settings our algorithm is able to learn the optimal policy, often achieving comparable regret to MDP-based algorithms."}}

In this work, we focus on longitudinal user data collected by a large class of adaptive sampling algorithms that are designed to optimize treatment decisions online using accruing data from multiple users. Combining or \"pooling\" data across users allows adaptive sampling algorithms to potentially learn faster. However, by pooling, these algorithms induce dependence between the sampled user data trajectories; we show that this can cause standard variance estimators for i.i.d. data to underestimate the true variance of common estimators on this data type. We develop novel methods to perform a variety of statistical analyses on such adaptively sampled data via Z-estimation. Specifically, we introduce the \\textit{adaptive} sandwich variance estimator, a corrected sandwich estimator that leads to consistent variance estimates under adaptive sampling. Additionally, to prove our results we develop novel theoretical tools for empirical processes on non-i.i.d., adaptively sampled longitudinal data which may be of independent interest. This work is motivated by our efforts in designing experiments in which online reinforcement learning algorithms optimize treatment decisions, yet statistical inference is essential for conducting analyses after experiments conclude."}}

Common challenges in designing and testing an RL algorithm in these settings include ensuring the RL algorithm can learn and run stably under real-time constraints, and accounting for the complexity of the environment, e.g., a lack of accurate mechanistic models for the user dynamics. To guide how one can tackle these challenges, we extend the PCS (predictability, computability, stability) framework, a data science framework that incorporates best practices from machine learning and statistics in supervised learning to the design of RL algorithms for the digital interventions setting. Furthermore, we provide guidelines on how to design simulation environments, a crucial tool for evaluating RL candidate algorithms using the PCS framework. We show how we used the PCS framework to design an RL algorithm for Oralytics, a mobile health study aiming to improve users\u2019 tooth-brushing behaviors through the personalized delivery of intervention messages.

In this work, we develop methods for inference on data collected in batches using a bandit algorithm. We prove that the bandit arm selection probabilities cannot generally be assumed to concentrate. Non-concentration of the arm selection probabilities makes inference on adaptively-collected data challenging because classical statistical inference approaches, such as using asymptotic normality or the bootstrap, can have inflated Type-1 error and confidence intervals with below-nominal coverage probabilities even asymptotically. In response we develop the Batched Ordinary Least Squares estimator (BOLS) that we prove is (1) asymptotically normal on data collected from both multi-arm and contextual bandits and (2) robust to non-stationarity in the baseline reward and thus leads to reliable Type-1 error control and accurate confidence intervals."}}

We still, though, do not yet have a clear understanding of how the choice of pretraining objective affects the type of linguistic information that models learn. With this in mind, we compare four objectives - language modeling, translation, skip-thought, and autoencoding - on their ability to induce syntactic and part-of-speech information.  We make a fair comparison between the tasks by holding constant the quantity and genre of the training data, as well as the LSTM architecture. We find that representations from language models consistently perform best on our syntactic auxiliary prediction tasks, even when trained on relatively small amounts of data. These results suggest that language modeling may be the best data-rich pretraining task for transfer learning applications requiring syntactic information. We also find that the representations from randomly-initialized, frozen LSTMs perform strikingly well on our syntactic auxiliary tasks, but this effect disappears when the amount of training data for the auxiliary tasks is reduced."}}

In particular, discrete inputs make it more difficult to learn a smooth encoder that preserves the complex local relationships in the input space. In this work, we propose an adversarially regularized autoencoder (ARAE) with the goal of learning more robust discrete-space representations. ARAE jointly trains both a rich discrete-space encoder, such as an RNN, and a simpler continuous space generator function, while using generative adversarial network (GAN) training to constrain the distributions to be similar. This method yields a smoother contracted code space that maps similar inputs to nearby codes, and also an implicit latent variable GAN model for generation. Experiments on text and discretized images demonstrate that the GAN model produces clean interpolations and captures the multimodality of the original space, and that the autoencoder produces improvements in semi-supervised learning as well as state-of-the-art results in unaligned text style transfer task using only a shared continuous-space representation."}}
