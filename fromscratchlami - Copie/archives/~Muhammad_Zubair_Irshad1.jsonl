We use implicit object-centric representations and learn a single geometry and articulation decoder for multiple object categories. Despite training on multiple categories, our decoder achieves a comparable reconstruction accuracy to methods that train bespoke decoders separately for each category. Combined with our stereo image encoder we infer the 3D shape, 6D pose, size, joint type, and the joint state of multiple unknown objects in a single forward pass. Our method achieves a 20.4% absolute improvement in mAP 3D IOU50 for novel instances when compared to a two-stage pipeline. Inference time is fast and can run on a NVIDIA TITAN XP GPU at 1 HZ for eight or less objects present. While only trained on simulated data, CARTO transfers to real-world object instances. Code and evaluation data is available at: http://carto.cs.uni-freiburg.de"}}

However, existing methods require expensive per-scene optimization from many views hence limiting their application to real-world unbounded urban settings where the objects of interest or backgrounds are observed from very few views. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a new approach called NeO 360, Neural fields for sparse view synthesis of outdoor scenes. NeO 360 is a generalizable method that reconstructs 360{\\deg} scenes from a single or a few posed RGB images. The essence of our approach is in capturing the distribution of complex real-world outdoor 3D scenes and using a hybrid image-conditional triplanar representation that can be queried from any world point. Our representation combines the best of both voxel-based and bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations and is more effective and expressive than each. NeO 360's representation allows us to learn from a large collection of unbounded 3D scenes while offering generalizability to new views and novel scenes from as few as a single image during inference. We demonstrate our approach on the proposed challenging 360{\\deg} unbounded dataset, called NeRDS 360, and show that NeO 360 outperforms state-of-the-art generalizable methods for novel view synthesis while also offering editing and composition capabilities.

These approaches suffer from high-computational cost and low performance in complex multi-object scenarios, where occlusions can be present. Hence, we present a simple one-stage approach to predict both the 3D shape and estimate the 6D pose and size jointly in a bounding-box free manner. In particular, our method treats object instances as spatial centers where each center denotes the complete shape of an object along with its 6D pose and size. Through this per-pixel representation, our approach can reconstruct in real-time (40 FPS) multiple novel object instances and predict their 6D pose and sizes in a single-forward pass.

This task requires the agent to navigate to a goal purely based on visual sensory inputs given natural language instructions. However, prior works formulate the problem as a navigation graph with a discrete action space. In this work, we lift the agent off the navigation graph and propose a more complex VLN setting in continuous 3D reconstructed environments. Our proposed setting, Robo-VLN, more closely mimics the challenges of real world navigation. Robo-VLN tasks have longer trajectory lengths, continuous action spaces, and challenges such as obstacles. We provide a suite of baselines inspired by state-of-the-art works in discrete VLN and show that they are less effective at this task. We further propose that decomposing the task into specialized high- and low-level policies can more effectively tackle this task. With extensive experiments, we show that by using layered decision making, modularized training, and decoupling reasoning and imitation, our proposed Hierarchical Cross-Modal (HCM) agent outperforms existing baselines in all key metrics and sets a new benchmark for Robo-VLN."}}
