More specifically, we tackle the unlabeled multi-robot motion planning problem with motion constraints as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem with some sparse global reward. In contrast with previous works, which formulate an entirely new hand-crafted optimization cost or trajectory generation algorithm for a different robot dynamic model, our framework is a general approach that is applicable to arbitrary robot models. Further, by using the velocity obstacle, we devise a smooth projection that guarantees collision free trajectories for all robots with respect to their neighbors and obstacles. The efficacy of our algorithm is demonstrated through varied simulations. A video describing our method and results can be found here."}}

Recent approaches have sought to plan, control, and execute maneuvers with large, yet deliberate, load swings for more agile, energy-optimal maneuvering. Unfortunately, the system's nonlinear dynamics make executing such trajectories a significant challenge and experimental demonstrations thus far have relied completely on a motion capture system and non-negligible simplifications like restriction of the system to a two-dimensional workspace or closing of the control loop on the quadrotor, instead of the payload. In this work, we observe the payload using a downward-facing camera and estimate its state relative to the quadrotor using an extended Kalman filter. We demonstrate closed-loop payload control in the full three-dimensional workspace, with the planning, estimation, and control pipeline implemented on an onboard processor. We show control of load swings up to 53 <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</sup> from the vertical axis. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first realization of closed-loop control of agile slung-load maneuvers and the largest achieved payload angle."}}

Given a team of N robots, each with nth-order dynamics, our algorithm finds trajectories that navigate vehicles from their start positions to non-interchangeable goal positions in a collision-free manner. The algorithm operates in two phases. In the motion planning step, a geometric algorithm finds a collision-free, piecewise-linear trajectory for each robot. In the trajectory generation step, each robot\u2019s trajectory is refined into a higher-order piecewise polynomial with a quadratic program. The novelty of our method is in this problem decomposition. The motion plan, through abstracting away robots\u2019 dynamics, can be found quickly. It is then subsequently leveraged to construct collision avoidance constraints for N decoupled quadratic programs instead of a single, coupled optimization problem, decreasing computation time. We prove that this method is safe, complete, and generates smooth trajectories that respect robots\u2019 dynamics. We demonstrate the algorithm\u2019s practicality through extensive quadrotor experiments."}}

This capability is applicable to tasks such as construction, where a single crane performing sequential tasks could be replaced by multiple quadrotors performing tasks in parallel for increased efficiency. We model this problem as a labeled multi-robot planning problem, where robots must navigate payloads from given start positions to fixed, non-interchangeable goal positions. Our system presents three novel challenges: (1.) Each vehicle has eight degrees-of-freedom, significantly increasing the size of the team\u2019s joint state space. (2.) Each vehicle is a nonlinear, $$6\\mathrm{th}$$-order dynamical system with four degrees of under-actuation. (3.) Each vehicle is a multi-body system.

In this paradigm, a team of robots at fixed start positions must navigate to pre-specified and noninterchangable goal positions. While many algorithms have been proposed for finding optimal solutions to this problem, most methods assume that the robots are kinematic agents, whereas in reality, robots often have high-order dynamics that must be respected by their trajectories. Here, we propose a centralized method for generating trajectories for teams of robots with general nth-order dynamics navigating to labeled goals. Our algorithm is safe and complete and additionally allows for decoupled optimization of each robot's trajectory as a Quadratic Program with linear constraints.

In particular, we propose a dual range planning horizon method to safely and quickly navigate quadrotors to specified goal locations in previously unknown and unstructured environments. In each planning epoch, a short-range planner uses a local map to generate a new trajectory. At the same time, a safe stopping policy is found. This allows the robot to come to an emergency halt when necessary. Our algorithm guarantees collision avoidance and demonstrates important advances in real-time planning. First, our novel short range planning method allows us to generate and re-plan trajectories that are dynamically feasible, comply with state and input constraints, and avoid obstacles in real-time. Further, previous planning algorithms abstract away the obstacle detection problem by assuming the instantaneous availability of geometric information about the environment. In contrast, our method addresses the challenge of using the raw sensor data to form a map and navigate in real-time. Finally, in addition to simulation examples, we provide physical experiments that demonstrate the entire algorithmic pipeline from obstacle detection to trajectory execution."}}

First, we plan for a multi-body system, and obstacle avoidance must be guaranteed for the quadrotor, load, and the cable. Second, our method accommodates transitions between subsystems of the hybrid dynamical system, allowing for maneuvers that would otherwise be infeasible if the cable were constrained to remain taut. Numerical and experimental results validate the proposed approach for the full hybrid system."}}

Each AUV is equipped with a stereo-hydrophone system that provides measurements of the relative bearing to the transmitter, as well as an acoustic modem that allows for inter-AUV communication and hence cooperative shark state estimation and decentralized tracking control. Online state estimation of the shark's state is performed using a Particle Filter in which measurements are shared between AUVs. The decentralized control system enables the AUVs to circumnavigate a dynamic target, (i.e. the estimated shark location). Each AUV circles the target by tracking circles of different radii and at different phase angles with respect to the target so as to obtain simultaneous sensor vantage points and minimize chance of AUV collision. A series of experiments using two AUVs were conducted in Big Fisherman's Cove in Santa Catalina Island, CA and demonstrated the ability to track a tagged leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata). The performance of the tracking was compared to standard manual tracking performed using an directional hydrophone operated by a researcher in a boat. In an additional experiment, the AUVs tracked an acoustic tag attached to the tracking boat to quantify the error of the state estimation of the system."}}
