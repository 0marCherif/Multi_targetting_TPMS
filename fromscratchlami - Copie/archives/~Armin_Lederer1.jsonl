While many of these approaches rely on the availability of state measurements, the states of a complex system are often not directly measurable. It may then be necessary to jointly estimate the dynamics and a latent state, making it considerably more challenging to design controllers with performance guarantees. This paper proposes a novel method for the computation of an optimal input trajectory for unknown nonlinear systems with latent states. Probabilistic performance guarantees are derived for the resulting input trajectory, and an approach to validate the performance of arbitrary control laws is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in a numerical simulation."}}

Existing approaches for motion planning with uncertainties often make conservative assumptions about Gaussianity and the obstacle geometry. While visual perception can deliver a more accurate representation of the environment, its use for safe motion planning is limited by the inherent miscalibration of neural networks and the challenge of obtaining adequate datasets. In order to address these imitations, we propose to employ ensembles of deep semantic segmentation networks trained with systematically augmented datasets to ensure reliable probabilistic occupancy information. For avoiding conservatism during motion planning, we directly employ the probabilistic perception via a scenario-based path planning approach. A velocity scheduling scheme is applied to the path to ensure a safe motion despite tracking inaccuracies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the systematic data augmentation in combination with deep ensembles and the proposed scenario-based planning approach in comparisons to state-of-the-art methods and validate our framework in an experiment involving a human hand."}}

To reduce noise, low-pass filters are commonly employed in order to attenuate high frequency components in the incoming signal, regardless if they come from noise or the actual signal. Therefore, low-pass filters must be carefully tuned in order to avoid significant deterioration of the signal. This tuning requires prior knowledge about the signal, which is often not available in real-world applications. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose an adaptive low-pass filter based on Gaussian process regression. By considering a constant window of previous observations, updates and predictions fast enough for real-world filtering applications can be realized. Moreover, the online optimization of hyperparameters leads to an adaptation of the low-pass behavior, such that no prior tuning is necessary. We show that the estimation error of the proposed method is uniformly bounded, and demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of the approach in several simulations."}}

This requires both adherence to safety constraints defined on the system state, as well as guaranteeing compliant behavior of the robot. If the underlying dynamical system is known exactly, the former can be addressed with the help of control barrier functions. The incorporation of elastic actuators in the robot's mechanical design can address the latter requirement. However, this elasticity can increase the complexity of the resulting system, leading to unmodeled dynamics, such that control barrier functions cannot directly ensure safety. In this paper, we mitigate this issue by learning the unknown dynamics using Gaussian process regression. By employing the model in a feedback linearizing control law, the safety conditions resulting from control barrier functions can be robustified to take into account model errors, while remaining feasible. In order to enforce them on-line, we formulate the derived safety conditions in the form of a second-order cone program. We demonstrate our proposed approach with simulations on a two-degree-of-freedom planar robot with elastic joints."}}
