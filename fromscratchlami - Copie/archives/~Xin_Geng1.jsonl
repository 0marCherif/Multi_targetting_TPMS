A large labeled training set is one of the most important factors for its success. However, it is difficult to collect sufficient training images with precise labels in some domains, such as apparent age estimation, head pose estimation, multilabel classification, and semantic segmentation. Fortunately, there is ambiguous information among labels, which makes these tasks different from traditional classification. Based on this observation, we convert the label of each image into a discrete label distribution, and learn the label distribution by minimizing a Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence between the predicted and groundtruth label distributions using deep ConvNets. The proposed deep label distribution learning (DLDL) method effectively utilizes the label ambiguity in both feature learning and classifier learning, which help prevent the network from overfitting even when the training set is small. Experimental results show that the proposed approach produces significantly better results than the state-ofthe-art methods for age estimation and head pose estimation. At the same time, it also improves recognition performance for multi-label classification and semantic segmentation tasks."}}

Most existing PLL approaches assume that the incorrect labels in each training example are randomly picked as the candidate labels and model the generation process of the candidate labels in a simple way.  However, these approaches usually do not perform as well as expected due to the fact that the generation process of the candidate labels is always instance-dependent. Therefore, it deserves to be modeled in a refined way.  In this paper, we consider instance-dependent PLL and assume that the generation process of the candidate labels could decompose into two sequential parts, where the correct label emerges first in the mind of the annotator but then the incorrect labels related to the feature are also selected with the correct label as candidate labels due to uncertainty of labeling. Motivated by this consideration, we propose a novel PLL method that performs Maximum A Posterior(MAP) based on an explicitly modeled generation process of candidate labels via decomposed probability distribution models. Extensive experiments on manually corrupted benchmark datasets and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

Here we review the label differential privacy (label DP), which means that only the labels are sensitive. The generated private labels of previous methods do not consider the label confidence corresponding to the feature and multiple sampling could be employed to identify the true labels. In the paper, a novel approach called Protective Label Enhancement (PLE) is proposed to mask the true label in the label distribution while ensuring that the protective label distribution is utility for training an effective predictive model on the server. Specifically, when we generate the label distribution, the true label is mixed up by choosing several random labels and the true label will be punished when it is at the top of the label distribution. Meanwhile, if the true label almost vanishes, it will be compensated to keep the statistical effectiveness. Furthermore, we provide the corresponding theoretical guarantee that the predictive model is classifier-consistent and that learning with the protective label distribution is ERM learnable. Finally, experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for solving the label DP problem."}}

In the last few years, the instance-independent generation process of PLs has been extensively studied, on the basis of which many practical and theoretical advances have been made in PLL, while relatively less attention has been paid to the practical setting of instance-dependent PLs, namely, the PL depends not only on the true label but the instance itself. In this paper, we propose a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach called progressive purification (POP) for instance-dependent PLL: in each epoch, POP updates the learning model while purifies each PL by progressively moving out false candidate labels for the next epoch of the model training. Theoretically, we prove that POP enlarges the region where the model is reliable by a promising rate, and eventually approximates the Bayes optimal classifier with mild assumptions; technically, POP is flexible with arbitrary losses and compatible with deep networks, so the previous advanced PLL losses can be embedded in it and the performance is often significantly improved."}}

To cope with the challenge, we investigate single-positive multi-label learning (SPMLL) where each example is annotated with only one relevant label and show that one can successfully learn a theoretically grounded multi-label classifier for the problem. In this paper,  a novel  SPMLL method named SMILE, i.e., Single-positive MultI-label learning with Label Enhancement, is proposed. Specifically, an unbiased risk estimator is derived, which could be guaranteed to approximately converge to the optimal risk minimizer of fully supervised learning and shows that one positive label of each instance is sufficient to train the predictive model. Then, the corresponding empirical risk estimator is established via recovering the latent soft label as a label enhancement process, where the posterior density of the latent soft labels is approximate to the variational Beta density parameterized by an inference model. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

Most existing PLL approaches assume that the incorrect labels in each training example are randomly picked as the candidate labels. However, this assumption is not realistic since the candidate labels are always instance-dependent. In this paper, we consider instance-dependent PLL and assume that each example is associated with a latent label distribution constituted by the real number of each label, representing the degree to each label describing the feature. The incorrect label with a high degree is more likely to be annotated as the candidate label. Therefore, the latent label distribution is the essential labeling information in partially labeled examples and worth being leveraged for predictive model training. Motivated by this consideration, we propose a novel PLL method that recovers the label distribution as a label enhancement (LE) process and trains the predictive model iteratively in every epoch. Specifically, we assume the true posterior density of the latent label distribution takes on the variational approximate Dirichlet density parameterized by an inference model. Then the evidence lower bound is deduced for optimizing the inference model and the label distributions generated from the variational posterior are utilized for training the predictive model. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Source code is available at https://github.com/palm-ml/valen."}}

One primary challenge in hierarchical classification is the small training set issue of the local module. The local classifiers in the previous hierarchical classification approaches are prone to over-fitting, which becomes a major bottleneck of hierarchical classification. Fortunately, the labels in the local module are correlated, and the siblings of the true label can provide additional supervision information for the instance. This paper proposes a novel method to deal with the small training set issue. The key idea of the method is to represent the correlation among the labels by the label distribution. It generates a label distribution that contains the supervision information of each label for the given instance, and then learns a mapping from the instance to the label distribution. Experimental results on several hierarchical classification datasets show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-theart hierarchical classification approaches."}}

The common strategy to induce predictive model is trying to disambiguate the candidate label set, such as disambiguation by identifying the ground-truth label iteratively or disambiguation by treating each candidate label equally. Nonetheless, these strategies ignore considering the generalized label distribution corresponding to each instance since the generalized label distribution is not explicitly available in the training set. In this paper, a new partial label learning strategy named PL-LE is proposed to learn from partial label examples via label enhancement. Specifically, the generalized label distributions are recovered by leveraging the topological information of the feature space. After that, a multi-class predictive model is learned by fitting a regularized multi-output regressor with the generalized label distributions. Extensive experiments show that PL-LE performs favorably against state-ofthe-art partial label learning approaches."}}

Although current approaches have achieved significant progress by fusing the multi-scale feature maps, they pay little attention to enhancing the channel-wise and spatial information of the feature maps. In this paper, we propose two novel modules to perform the enhancement of the information for the multi-person pose estimation. First, a Channel Shuffle Module (CSM) is proposed to adopt the channel shuffle operation on the feature maps with different levels, promoting cross-channel information communication among the pyramid feature maps. Second, a Spatial, Channel-wise Attention Residual Bottleneck (SCARB) is designed to boost the original residual unit with attention mechanism, adaptively highlighting the information of the feature maps both in the spatial and channel-wise context. The effectiveness of our proposed modules is evaluated on the COCO keypoint benchmark, and experimental results show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results."}}

However, in many cases, there exist deviations in manual annotations, and the landmarks marked for facial parts with occlusion and large poses are not always accurate, which means that the \u201cground truth\u201d landmarks are usually not annotated precisely. In such case, it is more reasonable to use soft labels rather than explicit hard labels. Therefore, this paper proposes to associate a bivariate label distribution (BLD) to each landmark of an image. A BLD covers the neighboring pixels around the original manually annotated point, alleviating the problem of inaccurate landmarks. After generating a BLD for each landmark, the proposed method firstly learns the mappings from an image patch to the BLD of each landmark, and then the predicted BLDs are used in a deformable model fitting process to obtain the final facial shape for the image. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than the compared state-of-the-art facial landmark detection algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed method appears to be much more robust against the landmark noise in the training set than other compared baselines."}}
