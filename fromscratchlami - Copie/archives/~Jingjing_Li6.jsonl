In this paper, we present an iterative in-place editing approach for text revision, which requires no parallel data. In this approach, we simply fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer with masked language modeling and attribute classification. During inference, the editing at each iteration is realized by two-step span replacement. At the first step, the distributed representation of the text optimizes on the fly towards an attribute function. At the second step, a text span is masked and another new one is proposed conditioned on the optimized representation. The empirical experiments on two typical and important text revision tasks, text formalization and text simplification, show the effectiveness of our approach. It achieves competitive and even better performance than state-of-the-art supervised methods on text simplification, and gains better performance than strong unsupervised methods on text formalization \\footnote{Code and model are available at \\url{https://github.com/jingjingli01/OREO}}."}}

In this paper, we propose a generic and language-independent strategy for multilingual GEC, which can train a GEC system effectively for a new non-English language with only two easy-to-access resources: 1) a pretrained cross-lingual language model (PXLM) and 2) parallel translation data between English and the language. Our approach creates diverse parallel GEC data without any language-specific operations by taking the non-autoregressive translation generated by PXLM and the gold translation as error-corrected sentence pairs. Then, we reuse PXLM to initialize the GEC model and pretrain it with the synthetic data generated by itself, which yields further improvement. We evaluate our approach on three public benchmarks of GEC in different languages. It achieves the state-of-the-art results on the NLPCC 2018 Task 2 dataset (Chinese) and obtains competitive performance on Falko-Merlin (German) and RULEC-GEC (Russian).

However, existing works assume the rule text is provided for each user question, which neglects the essential retrieval step in real scenarios. In this work, we propose and investigate an open-retrieval setting of conversational machine reading. In the open-retrieval setting, the relevant rule texts are unknown so that a system needs to retrieve question-relevant evidence from a collection of rule texts, and answer users' high-level questions according to multiple retrieved rule texts in a conversational manner. We propose MUDERN, a Multi-passage Discourse-aware Entailment Reasoning Network which extracts conditions in the rule texts through discourse segmentation, conducts multi-passage entailment reasoning to answer user questions directly, or asks clarification follow-up questions to inquiry more information. On our created OR-ShARC dataset, MUDERN achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing single-passage conversational machine reading models as well as a new multi-passage conversational machine reading baseline by a large margin. In addition, we conduct in-depth analyses to provide new insights into this new setting and our model."}}

In this work, we propose Discern, a discourse-aware entailment reasoning network to strengthen the connection and enhance the understanding for both document and dialog. Specifically, we split the document into clause-like elementary discourse units (EDU) using a pre-trained discourse segmentation model, and we train our model in a weakly-supervised manner to predict whether each EDU is entailed by the user feedback in a conversation. Based on the learned EDU and entailment representations, we either reply to the user our final decision \"yes/no/irrelevant\" of the initial question, or generate a follow-up question to inquiry more information. Our experiments on the ShARC benchmark (blind, held-out test set) show that Discern achieves state-of-the-art results of 78.3% macro-averaged accuracy on decision making and 64.0 BLEU1 on follow-up question generation.

The alternation between search and learning can be repeated for performance bootstrapping. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TGLS on two real-world natural language generation tasks, unsupervised paraphrasing and text formalization.

A major challenge in QG is to identify answer-relevant context words to finish the declarative-to-interrogative sentence transformation. Existing sequence-to-sequence neural models achieve this goal by proximity-based answer position encoding under the intuition that neighboring words of answers are of high possibility to be answer-relevant. However, such intuition may not apply to all cases especially for sentences with complex answer-relevant relations. Consequently, the performance of these models drops sharply when the relative distance between the answer fragment and other non-stop sentence words that also appear in the ground truth question increases. To address this issue, we propose a method to jointly model the unstructured sentence and the structured answer-relevant relation (extracted from the sentence in advance) for question generation. Specifically, the structured answer-relevant relation acts as the to the point context and it thus naturally helps keep the generated question to the point, while the unstructured sentence provides the full information. Extensive experiments show that to the point context helps our question generation model achieve significant improvements on several automatic evaluation metrics. Furthermore, our model is capable of generating diverse questions for a sentence which conveys multiple relations of its answer fragment."}}
