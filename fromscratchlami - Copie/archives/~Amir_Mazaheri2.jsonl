We tackle the complicated problem of video generation by regressing the latent representations of the first and last frames and employing a context-aware interpolation method to build the latent representations of in-between frames. We propose a stacking \"upPooling\" block to sequentially generate RGB frames out of each latent representations and progressively increase the resolution.

Our approach benefits from processing multimodal data (video and text) adopting the BERT encodings individually and using a novel transformer-based fusion method to fuse them together. Our method decomposes the different sources of modalities, into different BERT instances with similar architectures, but variable weights. This achieves SOTA results on the TVQA dataset. Additionally, we provide TVQA-Visual, an isolated diagnostic subset of TVQA, which strictly requires the knowledge of visual (V) modality based on a human annotator's judgment. This set of questions helps us to study the model's behavior and the challenges TVQA poses to prevent the achievement of super human performance. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and superiority of our method."}}

Compared to traditional image enhancement methods, which mostly deal with pixel-wise modifications of a given photo, our proposed task is to crop an image which is embedded within a photo and enhance the quality of the cropped image. We split our proposed approach into two deep networks: deep photo cropper and deep image enhancer. In the photo cropper network, we employ a spatial transformer to extract the embedded image. In the photo enhancer, we employ super-resolution to increase the number of pixels in the embedded image and reduce the effect of stretching and distortion of pixels. We use cosine distance loss between image features and ground truth for the cropper and the mean square loss for the enhancer. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset to train and test the proposed method. Finally, we analyze the proposed method with respect to qualitative and quantitative evaluations."}}

Despite impressive progress, these systems are known to be vulnerable to physical disturbances, such as accidental or adversarial bumps that make them drop the manipulated object. They also tend to be distracted by visual disturbances such as objects moving in the robot's field of view, even if the disturbance does not physically prevent the execution of the task. In this paper, we propose an approach for augmenting a deep visuomotor policy trained through demonstrations with Task Focused visual Attention (TFA). The manipulation task is specified with a natural language text such as \"move the red bowl to the left\". This allows the visual attention component to concentrate on the current object that the robot needs to manipulate. We show that even in benign environments, the TFA allows the policy to consistently outperform a variant with no attention mechanism. More importantly, the new policy is significantly more robust: it regularly recovers from severe physical disturbances (such as bumps causing it to drop the object) from which the baseline policy, i.e. with no visual attention, almost never recovers. In addition, we show that the proposed policy performs correctly in the presence of a wide class of visual disturbances, exhibiting a behavior reminiscent of human selective visual attention experiments."}}

The objective of this work is to provide a principled model for computing the ranking scores of a video in response to one or more concepts, where the concepts could be directly supplied by users or inferred by the system from the user queries. Indeed, how to deal with multi-concept queries has become a central component in modern video retrieval systems that accept text queries. However, it has been long overlooked and simply implemented by weighted averaging of the corresponding concept detectors\u2019 scores. Our approach, which can be considered as a latent ranking SVM, integrates the advantages of various recent works in text and image retrieval, such as choosing ranking over structured prediction, modeling inter-dependencies between querying concepts, and so on. Videos consist of shots, and we use latent variables to account for the mutually complementary cues within and across shots. Concept labels of shots are scarce and noisy. We introduce a simple and effective technique to make our model robust to outliers. Our approach gives superior performance when it is tested on not only the queries seen at training but also novel queries, some of which consist of more concepts than the queries used for training."}}

One can imagine a picture by reading a sentence or can describe a scene with some words. However, even small changes in a sentence can cause a significant semantic inconsistency with the corresponding video/image. For example, by changing the verb of a sentence, the meaning may drastically change. There have been many efforts to encode a video/sentence and decode it as a sentence/video. In this research, we study a new scenario in which both the sentence and the video are given, but the sentence is inaccurate. A semantic inconsistency between the sentence and the video or between the words of a sentence can result in an inaccurate description. This paper introduces a new problem, called Visual Text Correction (VTC), i.e., finding and replacing an inaccurate word in the textual description of a video. We propose a deep network that can simultaneously detect an inaccuracy in a sentence, and fix it by replacing the inaccurate word(s). Our method leverages the semantic interdependence of videos and words, as well as the short-term and long-term relations of the words in a sentence. In our formulation, part of a visual feature vector for every single word is dynamically selected through a gating process. Furthermore, to train and evaluate our model, we propose an approach to automatically construct a large dataset for VTC problem. Our experiments and performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed method provides very good results and also highlights the general challenges in solving the VTC problem. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first of its kind for the Visual Text Correction task."}}
