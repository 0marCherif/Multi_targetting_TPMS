Decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning methods have difficulty learning decentralized policies because of the environment appearing to be non-stationary due to other agents also learning at the same time. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a macro-action-based decentralized multi-agent double deep recurrent Q-net (MacDec-MADDRQN) which trains each decentralized Q-net using a centralized Q-net for action selection. A generalized version of MacDec-MADDRQN with two separate training environments, called Parallel-MacDec-MADDRQN, is also presented to leverage either centralized or decentralized exploration. The advantages and the practical nature of our methods are demonstrated by achieving near-centralized results in simulation and having real robots accomplish a warehouse tool delivery task in an efficient way."}}

Macro-Action Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (MacDec-POMDPs) provide a general framework for asynchronous decision making under uncertainty in fully cooperative multi-agent tasks. However, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning methods have only been developed for (synchronous) primitive-action problems. This paper proposes two Deep Q-Network (DQN) based methods for learning decentralized and centralized macro-action-value functions with novel macro-action trajectory replay buffers introduced for each case. Evaluations on benchmark problems and a larger domain demonstrate the advantage of learning with macro-actions over primitive-actions and the scalability of our approaches."}}

We address these challenges by first proposing two fundamental frameworks for learning macro-action-value function and joint macro-action-value function. Furthermore, we present two new approaches of learning decentralized macro-action-based policies, which involve a new double Q-update rule that facilitates the learning of decentralized Q-nets by using a centralized Q-net for action selection. Our approaches are evaluated both in simulation and on real robots."}}
