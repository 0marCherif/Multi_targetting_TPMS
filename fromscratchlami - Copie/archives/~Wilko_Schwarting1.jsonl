While single-agent scenarios like Time Trials are solved competitively with classical model-based or model-free feedback control, multi-agent wheel-to-wheel racing poses several challenges including planning over unknown opponent intentions as well as negotiating interactions under dynamic constraints. We propose to address these challenges via a learning-based approach that effectively combines model-based techniques, massively parallel simulation, and self-play reinforcement learning to enable zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of highly dynamic policies. We deploy our algorithm in wheel-to-wheel multi-agent races on scale hardware to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

However, most actor-critic methods come at the cost of added complexity: heuristics for stabilisation, compute requirements and wider hyperparameter search spaces. We show that a simple modification of deep Q-learning largely alleviates these issues. By combining bang-bang action discretization with value decomposition, framing single-agent control as cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), this simple critic-only approach matches performance of state-of-the-art continuous actor-critic methods when learning from features or pixels. We extend classical bandit examples from cooperative MARL to provide intuition for how decoupled critics leverage state information to coordinate joint optimization, and demonstrate surprisingly strong performance across a variety of continuous control tasks."}}

Recent advances in experience replay propose the use of Mixup [35] to further improve sample efficiency via synthetic sample generation. We build upon this idea with Neighborhood Mixup Experience Replay (NMER), a modular replay buffer that interpolates transitions with their closest neighbors in normalized state-action space. NMER preserves a locally linear approximation of the transition manifold by only performing Mixup between transitions with similar state-action features. Under NMER, a given transition\u2019s set of state-action neighbors is dynamic and episode agnostic, in turn encouraging greater policy generalizability via cross-episode interpolation. We combine our approach with recent off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithms and evaluate on several continuous control environments. We observe that NMER improves sample efficiency by an average 87% (TD3) and 29% (SAC) over baseline replay buffers, enabling agents to effectively recombine previous experiences and learn from limited data."}}

We combine latent world models with value function estimation to predict infinite-horizon returns and recover associated uncertainty via ensembling. The policy is then trained on an upper confidence bound (UCB) objective to identify and select the interactions most promising to improve long-term performance.

Solving Continuous Control with Bernoulli Policies", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control typically employs distributions whose support covers the entire action space. In this work, we investigate the colloquially known phenomenon that trained agents often prefer actions at the boundaries of that space. We draw theoretical connections to the emergence of bang-bang behavior in optimal control, and provide extensive empirical evaluation across a variety of recent RL algorithms. We replace the normal Gaussian by a Bernoulli distribution that solely considers the extremes along each action dimension - a bang-bang controller. Surprisingly, this achieves state-of-the-art performance on several continuous control benchmarks - in contrast to robotic hardware, where energy and maintenance cost affect controller choices. Since exploration, learning, and the final solution are entangled in RL, we provide additional imitation learning experiments to reduce the impact of exploration on our analysis. Finally, we show that our observations generalize to environments that aim to model real-world challenges and evaluate factors to mitigate the emergence of bang-bang solutions. Our findings emphasise challenges for benchmarking continuous control algorithms, particularly in light of potential real-world applications."}}

We present a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that guides policy learning through a value function that exhibits optimism in the face of uncertainty. We capture uncertainty over values by combining predictions from an ensemble of models and formulate an upper confidence bound (UCB) objective to recover optimistic estimates. Training the policy on ensemble rollouts with the learned value function as the terminal cost allows for projecting long-term interactions into a limited planning horizon, thus enabling deep optimistic exploration. We do not assume a priori knowledge of either the dynamics or reward function. We demonstrate that our approach can accommodate both dense and sparse reward signals, while improving sample complexity on a variety of benchmarking tasks."}}

In these scenarios, poor illumination conditions, sensor limitations, or appearance invariance may result in highly uncertain estimates. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based representation for orientation uncertainty. By characterizing uncertainty over unit quaternions with the Bingham distribution, we formulate a loss that naturally captures the antipodal symmetry of the representation. We discuss the interpretability of the learned distribution parameters and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on several challenging real-world pose estimation tasks involving uncertain orientations."}}
