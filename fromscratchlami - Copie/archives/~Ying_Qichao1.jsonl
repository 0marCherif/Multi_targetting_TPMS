To solve this problem, we introduce a generative deep network based method for hiding images into images while assuring high-quality extraction from the destructive synthesized images. An embedding network is sequentially concatenated with an attack layer, a decoupling network and an image extraction network. The addition of decoupling network learns to extract the embedded secret image from the attacked image. We also pinpoint the weaknesses of the adversarial training for robustness in previous works and build our improved real-world attack simulator. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method against typical digital attacks by a large margin, as well as the performance boost of the recovered images with the aid of progressive recovery strategy. Besides, we are the first to robustly hide three secret images."}}

We first protect the original image by introducing imperceptible perturbations. Then, typical image post-processing attacks are simulated to erode the protected image. On the recipient's side, we predict the cropping mask and recover the original image. Besides, we propose a novel Fine-Grained generative JPEG simulator (FG-JPEG) as well as a feature alignment network to improve the real-world robustness.

However, how cross-modal consistency relates to the fidelity of news and how features from different modalities affect the decision-making are still open questions. This paper presents a novel scheme of Bootstrapping Multi-view Representations (BMR) for fake news detection. Given a multi-modal news, we extract representations respectively from the views of the text, the image pattern and the image semantics. Improved Multi-gate Mixture-of-Expert networks (iMMoE) are proposed for feature refinement and fusion. Representations from each view are separately used to coarsely predict the fidelity of the whole news, and the multimodal representations are able to predict the cross-modal consistency. With the prediction scores, we reweigh each view of the representations and bootstrap them for fake news detection. Extensive experiments conducted on typical fake news detection datasets prove that the proposed BMR outperforms state-of-the-art schemes."}}

The traditional manner of concealing image content within the image are inflexible and fragile to diverse digital attack, i.e. image cropping and JPEG compression. To address this issue, we jointly train a U-Net backboned encoder, a tamper localization network and a decoder for image recovery. Given an original image, the encoder produces a visually indistinguishable immunized image.  At the recipient\u2019s side, the verifying network localizes the malicious modifications, and the original content can be approximately recovered by the decoder, despite the presence of the attacks. Several strategies are proposed to boost the training efficiency. We demonstrate that our method can recover the details of the tampered regions with a high quality despite the presence of various kinds of attacks. Comprehensive ablation studies are conducted to validate our network designs."}}

Therefore, fake news detection has garnered extensive research interest in the field of social forensics. Current methods primarily concentrate on the integration of textual and visual features but fail to effectively exploit multi-modal information at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. Furthermore, they suffer from an ambiguity problem due to a lack of correlation between modalities or a contradiction between the decisions made by each modality. To overcome these challenges, we present a Multi-grained Multi-modal Fusion Network (MMFN) for fake news detection. Inspired by the multi-grained process of human assessment of news authenticity, we respectively employ two Transformer-based pre-trained models to encode token-level features from text and images. The multi-modal module fuses fine-grained features, taking into account coarse-grained features encoded by the CLIP encoder. To address the ambiguity problem, we design uni-modal branches with similarity-based weighting to adaptively adjust the use of multi-modal features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three prevalent datasets."}}

To address this issue, this paper proposes a generalized framework for high-capacity RDHEI for both the RRBE and VRBE cases. First, an efficient embedding room generation algorithm (ERGA) is designed to produce large embedding room using pixel prediction and entropy encoding. Then, we propose two RDHEI schemes, one for RRBE, another for VRBE. In the RRBE scenario, the image owner generates the embedding room with ERGA and encrypts the preprocessed image using stream cipher with two encryption keys. Then, the data hider locates the embedding room and embeds the additional encrypted data. In the VRBE scenario, the cover image is encrypted by an improved block modulation and permutation encryption algorithm, where the spatial redundancy in the plain-text image is greatly preserved. Then, the data hider applies ERGA on the encrypted image to generate the embedding room and conducts data embedding. For both schemes, receivers with different authentication keys can conduct either error-free data extraction or error-free image recovery. The experimental results show that the two proposed schemes outperform many state-of-the-art RDHEI schemes. Besides, they can ensure high security level, where the original image can be hardly discovered from the encrypted version before or after data hiding by unauthorized users."}}

In this paper, we propose a Coverless Image Steganography Network, called CIS-Net, that synthesizes a high-quality image directly conditioned on the secret message to transfer. CIS-Net is composed of four modules, namely, the Generation, Adversarial, Extraction, and Noise Module. The receiver can extract the hidden message without any loss even the images have been distorted by JPEG compression attacks. To disguise the behaviour of steganography, we collected images in the context of profile photos and stickers and train our network accordingly. As such, the generated images are more inclined to escape from malicious detection and attack. The distinctions from previous image steganography methods are majorly the robustness and losslessness against diverse attacks. Experiments over diverse public datasets have manifested the superior ability of anti-steganalysis."}}
