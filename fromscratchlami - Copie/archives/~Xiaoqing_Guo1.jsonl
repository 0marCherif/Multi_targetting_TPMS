Due to the domain gap and label shift between two domains, pseudo-labeled target data contains mixed closed-set and open-set label noises. In this paper, we propose a simplex noise transition matrix (SimT) to model the mixed noise distributions in DA semantic segmentation, and leverage SimT to handle open-set label noise and enable novel target recognition. When handling open-set noises, we formulate the problem as estimation of SimT. By exploiting computational geometry analysis and properties of segmentation, we design four complementary regularizers, i.e. volume regularization, anchor guidance, convex guarantee, and semantic constraint, to approximate the true SimT. Specifically, volume regularization minimizes the volume of simplex formed by rows of the non-square SimT, ensuring outputs of model to fit into the ground truth label distribution. To compensate for the lack of open-set knowledge, anchor guidance, convex guarantee, and semantic constraint are devised to enable the modeling of open-set noise distribution. The estimated SimT is utilized to correct noise issues in pseudo labels and promote the generalization ability of segmentation model on target domain data. In the task of novel target recognition, we first propose closed-to-open label correction (C2OLC) to explicitly derive the supervision signal for open-set classes by exploiting the estimated SimT, and then advance a semantic relation (SR) loss that harnesses the inter-class relation to facilitate the open-set class sample recognition in target domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SimT can be flexibly plugged into existing DA methods to boost both closed-set and open-set class performance.

Current state-of-the-art approaches cope with the situations of missing modalities by fusing multi-modal images and features to learn shared representations of tumor regions, which often ignore explicitly capturing the correlations among modalities and tumor regions. Inspired by the fact that modality information plays distinct roles to segment different tumor regions, we aim to explicitly exploit the correlations among various modality-specific information and tumor-specific knowledge for segmentation. To this end, we propose a Dual Disentanglement Network (D2-Net) for brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities, which consists of a modality disentanglement stage (MD-Stage) and a tumor-region disentanglement stage (TD-Stage). In the MD-Stage, a spatial-frequency joint modality contrastive learning scheme is designed to directly decouple the modality-specific information from MRI data. To decompose tumor-specific representations and extract discriminative holistic features, we propose an affinity-guided dense\ntumor-region knowledge distillation mechanism in the TD-Stage through aligning the features of a disentangled binary teacher network with a holistic student network. By explicitly discovering relations among modalities and tumor regions, our model can learn sufficient information for segmentation even if some modalities are missing.

Previous segmentation arts of learning with noisy labels merely perform a pixel-wise manner to preserve semantics, such as pixel-wise label correction, but neglect the pair-wise manner. In fact, we observe that the pair-wise manner capturing affinity relations between pixels can greatly reduce the label noise rate. Motivated by this observation, we present a novel perspective for noisy mitigation by incorporating both pixel-wise and pair-wise manners, where supervisions are derived from noisy class and affinity labels, respectively. Unifying the pixel-wise and pair-wise manners, we propose a robust Joint Class-Affinity Segmentation (JCAS) framework to combat label noise issues in medical image segmentation. Considering the affinity in pair-wise manner incorporates contextual dependencies, a differentiated affinity reasoning (DAR) module is devised to rectify the pixel-wise segmentation prediction by reasoning about intra-class and inter-class affinity relations. To further enhance the noise resistance, a class-affinity loss correction (CALC) strategy is designed to correct supervision signals via the modeled noise label distributions in class and affinity labels. Meanwhile, CALC strategy interacts the pixel-wise and pair-wise manners through the theoretically derived consistency regularization. Extensive experiments under both synthetic and real-world noisy labels corroborate the efficacy of the proposed JCAS framework with a minimum gap towards the upper bound performance.

Existing UDA methods neglect the domain-common knowledge of two datasets, thus failing to grasp the inter-category relationship in the target domain and leading to poor performance. To address these issues, we propose a graph-based unsupervised domain adaptation framework, named Interactive Graph Network (IGNet), to effectively adapt a model to an unlabeled new domain in surgical instrument segmentation tasks. In detail, the Domain-common Prototype Constructor (DPC) is first advanced to adaptively aggregate the feature map into domain-common prototypes using the probability mixture model, and construct a prototypical graph to interact the information among prototypes from the global perspective. In this way, DPC can grasp the co-occurrent and long-range relationship for both domains. To further narrow down the domain gap, we design a Domain-common Knowledge Incorporator (DKI) to guide the evolution of feature maps towards domain-common direction via a common-knowledge guidance graph and category-attentive graph reasoning. At last, the Cross-category Mismatch Estimator (CME) is developed to evaluate the category-level alignment from a graph perspective and assign each pixel with different adversarial weights, so as to refine the feature distribution alignment. The extensive experiments on three types of tasks demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of IGNet compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, ablation studies verify the effectiveness of each component of IGNet.

Existing deep learning based models usually regarded the segmentation task as pixel-wise classification and neglected the semantic correlations of pixels across different images, leading to vague feature distribution. Moreover, pixel-wise annotated data is rare in medical domain, and the scarce annotated data usually exhibits the biased distribution against the desired one, hindering the performance improvement under the supervised learning setting. In this paper, we propose a novel Labeled-to-unlabeled Distribution Translation (L2uDT) framework with Semantic-oriented Contrastive Learning (SoCL), mainly for addressing the aforementioned issues in medical image segmentation. In SoCL, a semantic grouping module is designed to cluster pixels into a set of semantically coherent groups, and a semantic-oriented contrastive loss is advanced to constrain group-wise prototypes, so as to explicitly learn a feature space with intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. We then establish a L2uDT strategy to approximate the desired data distribution for unbiased optimization, where we translate the labeled data distribution with the guidance of extensive unlabeled data. In particular, a bias estimator is devised to measure the distribution bias, then a gradual-paced shift is derived to progressively translate the labeled data distribution to unlabeled one. Both labeled and translated data are leveraged to optimize the segmentation model simultaneously. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two benchmark datasets, EndoScene and PROSTATEx, and our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, which clearly demonstrates its effectiveness for medical image segmentation.
