This work aims to mitigate the assumption by using appropriate cryptographic tools. Particularly, we examine various scenarios with different trust demands in FL, and then design the corresponding practical protocols with lightweight cryptographic tools. Three solutions for secure and trustworthy aggregation are proposed with increasing sophistication: (1) a single verifiable moderator, (2) a single secure and verifiable moderator, and (3) multiple secure and verifiable moderators, which can handle adversarial behaviors with different levels. We evaluate the performances of all our proposed protocols on the test accuracy and the training time, showing that our protocols maintain the accuracy with time overhead from 30% to 156% depending on the secure and trustworthy levels. The protocols can be deployed in many practical FL settings with appropriate optimizations."}}

Client absence during collaborative training can seriously degrade model performances, particularly for unbalanced and non-IID client data. We address this issue by introducing the notion of data digests of the training samples from the clients. The expansion of digests called synonyms can represent the original samples on the server and thus maintain overall model accuracy, even after the clients become unavailable. We compare our CLSyn implementations against three centralized Federated Learning algorithms, namely FedAvg, FedProx, and FedNova as baselines. Results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and EMNIST show that CLSyn consistently outperforms these baselines by significant margins in various client absence scenarios."}}

Many of these applications utilize parallel processing in GPUs to achieve higher performance. However, it remains a daunting task to optimize for GPUs, and most researchers have to rely on vendor-provided libraries for such purposes. In this paper, we discuss an operator that can be used to succinctly express computational kernels in CNNs and various scientific and vision applications. This operator, called Unrolled-Memory-Inner-Product (UMI), is a computationally-efficient operator with smaller code token requirement. Since a naive UMI implementation would increase memory requirement through input data unrolling, we propose a method to achieve optimal memory fetch performance in modern GPUs. We demonstrate this operator by converting several popular applications into the UMI representation, and achieve 1.3x-26.4x speedup against frameworks such as OpenCV and Caffe."}}

Instead of performing tracking in 2D images, we search and match candidate features in local neighborhoods inside the 3D image pyramid without computing their feature descriptors. The candidates are further validated by fitting to a motion model. The resulting tracked interest points are more repeatable and resilient to noise, and descriptor computation becomes much more efficient because only those areas of the image pyramid that contain features are searched. We demonstrate our method on real-time object recognition and label augmentation running on a mobile device."}}

These biases make it difficult to recover surface extrusions and other details, especially when a non-lambertian photo-consistency measure is used. To reduce these biases, we propose a new iterative graph cuts based algorithm that operates on the Surface Distance Grid (SDG), which is a special discretization of the 3Dspace, constructed using a signed distance transform of the current surface estimate. It can be shown that SDG significantly reduces the minimal surface bias, and transforms the discretization bias into a controllable degree of surface smoothness. Experiments on 3D reconstruction of non-lambertian objects confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm over previous methods."}}
