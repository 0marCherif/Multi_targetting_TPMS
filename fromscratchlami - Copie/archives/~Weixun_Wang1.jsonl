One reason for the gap is that simulated systems always assume that agents can work normally all the time, while in practice, one or more agents may unexpectedly \u201ccrash\u201d during the coordination process due to inevitable hardware or software failures. Such crashes destroy the cooperation among agents and lead to performance degradation. In this work, we present a formal conceptualization of a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning system with unexpected crashes. To enhance the robustness of the system to crashes, we propose a coach-assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that introduces a virtual coach agent to adjust the crash rate during training. We have designed three coaching strategies (fixed crash rate, curriculum learning, and adaptive crash rate) and a re-sampling strategy for our coach agent. To our knowledge, this work is the first to study unexpected crashes in a multi-agent system. Extensive experiments on grid-world and StarCraft II micromanagement tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the adaptive strategy compared with the fixed crash rate strategy and curriculum learning strategy. The ablation study further illustrates the effectiveness of our re-sampling strategy"}}

As a result, an urgent need for MARL researchers is to develop an integrated library suite, similar to the role of RLlib in single-agent RL, that delivers reliable MARL implementation and replicable evaluation in various bechmarks. To fill such a research gap, in this paper, we propose Multi-Agent RLlib (MARLlib), a comprehensive MARL algorithm library that facilitates RLlib for solving multi-agent problems. With a novel design of agent-level distributed dataflow, MARLlib manages to unify tens of algorithms, including different types of independent learning, centralized critic, and value decomposition methods; this leads to a highly composable integration of MARL algorithms that are not possible to unify before. Furthermore, MARLlib goes beyond current work by integrating diverse environment interfaces and providing flexible parameter sharing strategies; this allows to create versatile solutions to  cooperative, competitive, and mixed tasks with minimal code modifications for end users. A plethora of experiments  are conducted to substantiate the correctness of our implementation, based on which we further derive new insights on the relationship between the  performance and the design of algorithmic components. With MARLlib, we expect researchers to be able to tackle broader real-world multi-agent problems with trustworthy solutions.

Such a curse of dimensionality results in poor scalability and low sample efficiency, inhibiting MARL for decades. To break this curse, we propose a unified agent permutation framework that exploits the permutation invariance (PI) and permutation equivariance (PE) inductive biases to reduce the multiagent state space. Our insight is that permuting the order of entities in the factored multiagent state space does not change the information. Specifically, we propose two novel implementations: a Dynamic Permutation Network (DPN) and a Hyper Policy Network (HPN). The core idea is to build separate entity-wise PI input and PE output network modules to connect the entity-factored state space and action space in an end-to-end way. DPN achieves such connections by two separate module selection networks, which consistently assign the same input module to the same input entity (guarantee PI) and assign the same output module to the same entity-related output (guarantee PE). To enhance the representation capability, HPN replaces the module selection networks of DPN with hypernetworks to directly generate the corresponding module weights. Extensive experiments in SMAC, Google Research Football and MPE validate that the proposed methods significantly boost the performance and the learning efficiency of existing MARL algorithms. Remarkably, in SMAC, we achieve 100% win rates in almost all hard and super-hard scenarios (never achieved before)."}}

Yet, reproducing the PPO's results has been challenging in the community.  While recent works conducted ablation studies to provide insight on PPO's implementation details, these works are not structured as tutorials and only focus on details concerning robotics tasks. As a result, reproducing PPO from scratch can become a daunting experience. Instead of introducing additional improvements, or doing further ablation studies, this blog post takes a step back and focuses on delivering a thorough reproduction of PPO in all accounts, as well as aggregating, documenting, and cataloging its most salient implementation details. This blog post also points out software engineering challenges in PPO and further efficiency improvement via the accelerated vectorized environments. With these, we believe this blog post will help people understand PPO faster and better, facilitating customization and research upon this versatile RL algorithm."}}

During execution durations, the environment changes are influenced by, but not synchronised with, action execution. Such a setting is ubiquitous in many real-world problems. However, most MARL methods assume actions are executed immediately after inference, which is often unrealistic and can lead to catastrophic failure for multi-agent coordination with off-beat actions. In order to fill this gap, we develop an algorithmic framework for MARL with off-beat actions. We then propose a novel episodic memory, LeGEM, for model-free MARL algorithms. LeGEM builds agents\u2019 episodic memories by utilizing agents\u2019 individual experiences. It boosts multi-agent learning by addressing the challenging temporal credit assignment problem raised by the off-beat actions via our novel reward redistribution scheme, alleviating the issue of non-Markovian reward. We evaluate LeGEM on various multi-agent scenarios with off-beat actions, including Stag-Hunter Game, Quarry Game, Afforestation Game, and StarCraft II micromanagement tasks. Empirical results show that LeGEM significantly boosts multi-agent coordination and achieves leading performance and improved sample efficiency."}}

Previous efforts alleviate the partial observability by historical hidden states with Recurrent Neural Networks, however, they do not consider the multiagent characters that either the multiagent observation consists of a number of object entities or the action space shows clear entity interactions. To tackle these issues, we propose the Agent Transformer Memory (ATM) network with a transformer-based memory. First, ATM utilizes the transformer to enable the unified processing of the factored environmental entities and memory. Inspired by the human\u2019s working memory process where a limited capacity of information temporarily held in mind can effectively guide the decision-making, ATM updates its fixed-capacity memory with the working memory updating schema. Second, as agents' each action has its particular interaction entities in the environment, ATM parses the action space to introduce this action\u2019s semantic inductive bias by binding each action with its specified involving entity to predict the state-action value or logit. Extensive experiments on the challenging SMAC and Level-Based Foraging environments validate that ATM could boost existing multiagent RL algorithms with impressive learning acceleration and performance improvement."}}

During centralized training, these methods are essentially addressing the multi-agent credit assignment problem. However, most of the existing methods \\emph{implicitly} learn the credit assignment just by ensuring that the joint Q-value satisfies the Bellman optimality equation. In contrast, we formulate an \\emph{explicit} credit assignment problem where each agent gives its suggestion about how to weight individual Q-values to explicitly maximize the joint Q-value, besides guaranteeing the Bellman optimality of the joint Q-value. In this way, we can conduct credit assignment among multiple agents and along the time horizon. Theoretically, we give a gradient ascent solution for this problem. Empirically, we instantiate the core idea with deep neural networks and propose Explicit Credit Assignment joint Q-learning (ECAQ) to facilitate multi-agent cooperation in complex problems. Extensive experiments justify that ECAQ achieves interpretable credit assignment and superior performance compared to several advanced baselines."}}

MAPTF learns which agent's policy is the best to reuse for each agent and when to terminate it by modeling multiagent policy transfer as the option learning problem. Furthermore, in practice, the option module can only collect all agent's local experiences for update due to the partial observability of the environment. While in this setting, each agent's experience may be inconsistent with each other, which may cause the inaccuracy and oscillation of the option-value's estimation. Therefore, we propose a novel option learning algorithm, the successor representation option learning to solve it by decoupling the environment dynamics from rewards and learning the option-value under each agent's preference. MAPTF can be easily combined with existing deep RL and MARL approaches, and experimental results show it significantly boosts the performance of existing methods in both discrete and continuous state spaces."}}

Similarly, in multiagent settings, the learning performance can also be promoted if agents can share knowledge between each other. However, it remains an open question of how an agent should learn from other agents' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel multiagent option-based policy transfer (MAOPT) framework to improve multiagent learning efficiency. Our framework learns what advice to give to each agent and when to terminate it by modeling multiagent policy transfer as the option learning problem. MAOPT provides different kinds of variants which can be classified into two types in terms of the experience used during training. One type is the MAOPT with the Global Option Advisor which has the access to the global information of the environment. However, in many realistic scenarios, we can only obtain each agent's local information due to the partial observation. The other type contains MAOPT with the Local Option Advisor and MAOPT with the Successor Representation Option (SRO) which are suitable for this setting and collect each agent's local experience for the update. In many cases, each agent's experience is inconsistent with each other which causes the option-value estimation to oscillate and to become inaccurate. SRO is used to handle the experience inconsistency by decoupling the dynamics of the environment from the rewards to learn the option-value function under each agent's preference. MAOPT can be easily combined with existing deep RL approaches. Experimental results show it significantly boosts the performance of existing deep RL methods in both discrete and continuous state spaces."}}
