In this paper, we focus on Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM), a fundamental topic in knowledge discovery that faces a well-known memory bottleneck. We examine generic dataset modeling techniques and show how they can be used to improve SPM algorithms in time and memory usage. In particular, we develop trie-based dataset models and associated mining algorithms that can represent as well as effectively mine orders of magnitude larger datasets compared to the state of the art. Numerical results on real-life large-size test instances show that our algorithms are also faster and more memory efficient in practice."}}

This work proposes a new general cut-and-lift procedure that exploits the combinatorial structure of 0\u20131 problems via a binary decision diagram (BDD) encoding of their constraints. We present a general framework that can be applied to a wide range of binary optimization problems and show its applicability for second-order conic inequalities. We identify conditions for which our lifted inequalities are facet-defining and derive a new BDD-based cut generation linear program. Such a model serves as a basis for a max-flow combinatorial algorithm over the BDD that can be applied to derive valid cuts more efficiently. Our numerical results show encouraging performance when incorporated into a state-of-the-art mathematical programming solver, significantly reducing the root node gap, increasing the number of problems solved, and reducing the run-time by a factor of three on average."}}

In this paper, we expand this methodology and propose constrained shortest-path models for challenging discrete variants of bilevel and robust optimization, where traditional methods (e.g., dualize-and-combine) are not applicable compared to their continuous counterparts. Specifically, we propose a framework that models problems as decision diagrams and introduces side constraints either as linear inequalities in the underlying polyhedral representation, or as state variables in shortest-path calculations. We show that the first case generalizes a common class of combinatorial bilevel problems where the follower's decisions are separable with respect to the leader's decisions. In this setting, the side constraints are indicator functions associated with arc flows, and we leverage polyhedral structure to derive an alternative single-level reformulation of the bilevel problem. The case where side constraints are incorporated as node states, in turn, generalizes classical robust optimization. For this scenario, we leverage network structure to derive an iterative augmenting state-space strategy akin to an L-shaped method. We evaluate both strategies on a bilevel competitive project selection problem and the robust traveling salesperson with time windows, observing considerable improvements in computational efficiency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods in the respective areas."}}

Tapes are the technology of choice for long-term storage in data centers due to their low cost and reliability. However, their physical structure imposes challenges to data retrieval operations reflected in classic optimization and operations research problems. In this work, we provide a theoretical and numerical performance analysis of low-complexity algorithms under deterministic, stochastic, and online settings, which are key in practice due to their interpretability and the large scale of existing data services. In the deterministic setting, we show that traditional policies, such as first-in first-out (FIFO), have arbitrarily poor performance, and we develop and investigate new constant-factor approximations. For the stochastic setting, we present a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme that weighs files based on their access frequencies. Finally, we investigate an online extension and propose a new algorithm with constant competitive-factor guarantees. Our numerical analysis on synthetic and real-world data suggest that the proposed algorithms may significantly outperform policies currently adopted in practice with respect to average reading times."}}
