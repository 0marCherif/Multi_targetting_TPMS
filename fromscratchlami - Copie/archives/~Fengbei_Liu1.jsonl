However, given the high cost of such manual annotation, new medical imaging classification problems may need to rely on machine-generated noisy labels extracted from radiology reports. Indeed, many Chest X-Ray (CXR) classifiers have been modelled from datasets with noisy labels, but their training procedure is in general not robust to noisy-label samples, leading to sub-optimal models. Furthermore, CXR datasets are mostly multi-label, so current multi-class noisy-label learning methods cannot be easily adapted. In this paper, we propose a new method designed for noisy multi-label CXR learning, which detects and smoothly re-labels noisy samples from the dataset to be used in the training of common multi-label classifiers. The proposed method optimises a bag of multi-label descriptors (BoMD) to promote their similarity with the semantic descriptors produced by language models from multi-label image annotations. Our experiments on noisy multi-label training sets and clean testing sets show that our model has state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness in many CXR multi-label classification benchmarks, including a new benchmark that we propose to systematically assess noisy multi-label methods."}}

Current approaches are commonly trained to solve a subset of those problems, but we are unaware of methods that address the three problems simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new training module called Non-Volatile Unbiased Memory (NVUM), which non-volatility stores running average of model logits for a new regularization loss on noisy multi-label problem. We further unbias the classification prediction in NVUM update for imbalanced learning problem. We run extensive experiments to evaluate NVUM on new benchmarks proposed by this paper, where training is performed on noisy multi-label imbalanced chest X-ray (CXR) training sets, formed by Chest-Xray14 and CheXpert, and the testing is performed on the clean multi-label CXR datasets OpenI and PadChest. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art CXR classifiers and previous methods that can deal with noisy labels on all evaluations.

One strategy to explore in SSL MIA is based on the pseudo labelling strategy, but it has a few shortcomings. Pseudo-labelling has in general lower accuracy than consistency learning, it is not specifically design for both multi-class and multi-label problems, and it can be challenged by imbalanced learning. In this paper, unlike traditional methods that select confident pseudo label by threshold, we propose a new SSL algorithm, called anti-curriculum pseudo-labelling (ACPL), which introduces novel techniques to select informative unlabelled samples, improving training balance and allowing the model to work for both multi-label and multi-class problems, and to estimate pseudo labels by an accurate ensemble of classifiers (improving pseudo label accuracy). We run extensive experiments to evaluate ACPL on two public medical image classification benchmarks: Chest X-Ray 14 for thorax disease multi-label classification and ISIC2018 for skin lesion multi-class classification.

However, obtaining high-quality annotations is a laboursome and expensive process due to the need of expert radiologists for the labelling task. The study of semi-supervised learning in medical image analysis is then of crucial importance given that it is much less expensive to obtain unlabelled images than to acquire images labelled by expert radiologists. Essentially, semi-supervised methods leverage large sets of unlabelled data to enable better training convergence and generalisation than using only the small set of labelled images. In this paper, we propose Self-supervised Mean Teacher for Semi-supervised (S $$^2$$ MTS $$^2$$ ) learning that combines self-supervised mean-teacher pre-training with semi-supervised fine-tuning. The main innovation of S $$^2$$ MTS $$^2$$ is the self-supervised mean-teacher pre-training based on the joint contrastive learning, which uses an infinite number of pairs of positive query and key features to improve the mean-teacher representation. The model is then fine-tuned using the exponential moving average teacher framework trained with semi-supervised learning. We validate S $$^2$$ MTS $$^2$$ on the multi-label classification problems from Chest X-ray14 and CheXpert, and the multi-class classification from ISIC2018, where we show that it outperforms the previous SOTA semi-supervised learning methods by a large margin. Our code will be available upon paper acceptance."}}

The trade-off is that surgeons lose direct visual contact with the surgical site and have limited intra-operative imaging techniques for real-time feedback. Computer vision methods as well as segmentation and tracking of the tissues and tools in the video frames, are increasingly being adopted to MIS to alleviate such limitations. So far, most of the advances in MIS have been focused on laparoscopic applications, with scarce literature on knee arthroscopy. Here for the first time, we propose a new method for the automatic segmentation of multiple tissue structures for knee arthroscopy. The training data of 3868 images were collected from 4 cadaver experiments, 5 knees, and manually contoured by two clinicians into four classes: Femur, Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL), Tibia, and Meniscus. Our approach adapts the U-net and the U-net++ architectures for this segmentation task. Using the cross-validation experiment, the mean Dice similarity coefficients for Femur, Tibia, ACL, and Meniscus are 0.78, 0.50, 0.41, 0.43 using the U-net and 0.79, 0.50, 0.51, 0.48 using the U-net++. While the reported segmentation method is of great applicability in terms of contextual awareness for the surgical team, it can also be used for medical robotic applications such as SLAM and depth mapping."}}

However, due to poor imaging conditions (e.g., low texture, overexposure, etc.), automatic semantic segmentation is a challenging scenario, which justifies the scarce literature on this topic. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation to regularise the training of the semantic segmentation in knee arthroscopy. To further regularise the depth estimation, we propose the use of clean training images captured by the stereo arthroscope of routine objects (presenting none of the poor imaging conditions and with rich texture information) to pre-train the model. We fine-tune such model to produce both the semantic segmentation and self-supervised monocular depth using stereo arthroscopic images taken from inside the knee. Using a data set containing 3868 arthroscopic images captured during cadaveric knee arthroscopy with semantic segmentation annotations, 2000 stereo image pairs of cadaveric knee arthroscopy, and 2150 stereo image pairs of routine objects, we show that our semantic segmentation regularised by self-supervised depth estimation produces a more accurate segmentation than a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approach modeled exclusively with semantic segmentation annotation."}}
