Lattice attacks, which are acknowledged in the literature as the most effective methods, fail occasionally even when the number of unknown variables is of medium size. In this paper we propose a modular disaggregation technique and a simplified lattice formulation based on which two lattice attack algorithms are further designed. We introduce the new concept \"jump points\" in our disaggregation technique, and derive inequality conditions to identify superior jump points which can more easily cut-off non-desirable short integer solutions. Empirical tests have been conducted to show that integrating the disaggregation technique with lattice attacks can effectively raise success ratios to 100% for randomly generated problems with density one and of dimensions up to 100. Finally, statistical regressions are conducted to test significant features, thus revealing reasonable factors behind the empirical success of our algorithms and techniques proposed in this paper."}}

The reformulation is a constrained convex optimization problem whose feasible region admits an easily computable projection. Our reformulation requires computing the minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian. To avoid the expensive computation of the exact minimum eigenvalue, we develop a surrogate problem to the reformulation where the exact minimum eigenvalue is replaced with an approximate one. We then apply first-order methods such as the Nesterov\u2019s accelerated projected gradient method (APG) and projected Barzilai-Borwein method to solve the surrogate problem. As our main theoretical contribution, we show that when an $$\\epsilon$$ \u03f5 -approximate minimum eigenvalue is computed by the Lanczos method and the surrogate problem is approximately solved by APG, our approach returns an $$\\epsilon$$ \u03f5 -approximate solution to CRS in $${\\tilde{O}}(\\epsilon ^{-1/2})$$ O ~ ( \u03f5 - 1 / 2 ) matrix-vector multiplications (where $${\\tilde{O}}(\\cdot )$$ O ~ ( \u00b7 ) hides the logarithmic factors). Numerical experiments show that our methods are comparable to and outperform the Krylov subspace method in the easy and hard cases, respectively. We further implement our methods as subproblem solvers of adaptive cubic regularization methods, and numerical results show that our algorithms are comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms."}}

Our algorithm is motivated by and extends a recent linear-time algorithm for the trust region subproblem by Hazan and Koren [Math. Program., 158 (2016), pp. 363--381]. However, due to the nonconvexity and noncompactness of the feasible region, such an extension is nontrivial. Our main contribution is to demonstrate that under some regularity condition, the optimal solution is in a compact and convex set and lower and upper bounds of the optimal value can be computed in linear time. Using these properties, we develop a linear-time algorithm for the GTRS."}}

While recent research has focused on strengthening convex relaxations of QCQP using the reformulation-linearization technique (RLT), the state-of-the-art methods lose their effectiveness when dealing with (multiple) nonconvex quadratic constraints in QCQP, except for direct lifting and linearization. In this research, we decompose and relax each nonconvex constraint to two second order cone (SOC) constraints and then linearize the products of the SOC constraints and linear constraints to construct some new effective valid constraints. Moreover, we extend the reach of the RLT-like techniques for almost all different types of constraint-pairs (including valid inequalities by linearizing the product of a pair of SOC constraints, and the Hadamard product or the Kronecker product of two respective valid linear matrix inequalities), examine dominance relationships among different valid inequalities, and explore almost all possibilities of gaining benefits from generating valid constraints. We also successfully demonstrate that applying RLT-like techniques to additional redundant linear constraints could reduce the relaxation gap significantly. We demonstrate the efficiency of our results with numerical experiments."}}

Several sufficient conditions to guarantee the exactness of its semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation or second order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation have been recently developed in the literature. In this paper, we consider a generalization of the extended trust region subproblem (GETRS), in which the unit ball constraint in ETRS is replaced by a general, possibly nonconvex, quadratic constraint. We demonstrate that the SDP relaxation can further be reformulated as an SOCP problem under a simultaneous diagonalization condition of the quadratic form. We then explore several sufficient conditions under which the SOCP relaxation of GETRS is exact under Slater condition."}}
