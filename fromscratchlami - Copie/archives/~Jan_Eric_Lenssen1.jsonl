We present SimNP, a method to learn category-level self-similarities, which combines the advantages of both worlds by connecting neural point radiance fields with a category-level self-similarity representation. Our contribution is two-fold. (1) We design the first neural point representation on a category level by utilizing the concept of coherent point clouds. The resulting neural point radiance fields store a high level of detail for locally supported object regions. (2) We learn how information is shared between neural points in an unconstrained and unsupervised fashion, which allows to derive unobserved regions of an object during the reconstruction process from given observations. We show that SimNP is able to outperform previous methods in reconstructing symmetric unseen object regions, surpassing methods that build upon category-level or pixel-aligned radiance fields, while providing semantic correspondences between instances"}}

Pose or motion priors are important for generating realistic new poses and for reconstructing accurate poses from noisy or partial observations. Pose-NDF learns a manifold of plausible poses as the zero level set of a neural implicit function, extending the idea of modeling implicit surfaces in 3D to the high-dimensional domain SO(3)^K, where a human pose is defined by a single data point, represented by K quaternions. The resulting high-dimensional implicit function can be differentiated with respect to the input poses and thus can be used to project arbitrary poses onto the manifold by using gradient descent on the set of 3-dimensional hyperspheres. In contrast to previous VAE-based human pose priors, which transform the pose space into a Gaussian distribution, we model the actual pose manifold, preserving the distances between poses. We demonstrate that PoseNDF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods as a prior in various downstream tasks, ranging from denoising real-world human mocap data, pose recovery from occluded data to 3D pose reconstruction from images.

We utilize graph neural networks to iteratively parameterize an adaptive anisotropic kernel that produces point weights for weighted least-squares plane fitting in local neighborhoods. The approach retains the interpretability and efficiency of traditional sequential plane fitting while benefiting from adaptation to data set statistics through deep learning. This results in a state-of-the-art surface normal estimator that is robust to noise, outliers and point density variation, preserves sharp features through anisotropic kernels and equivariance through a local quaternion-based spatial transformer. Contrary to previous deep learning methods, the proposed approach does not require any hand-crafted features or preprocessing. It improves on the state-of-the-art results while being more than two orders of magnitude faster and more parameter efficient."}}

The operator receives a sparse set of local reference frames, computed from an input point cloud and establishes end-to-end transformation equivariance through a novel dynamic routing procedure on quaternions. Further, we theoretically connect dynamic routing between capsules to the well-known Weiszfeld algorithm, a scheme for solving iterative re-weighted least squares (IRLS) problems with provable convergence properties. It is shown that such group dynamic routing can be interpreted as robust IRLS rotation averaging on capsule votes, where information is routed based on the final inlier scores. Based on our operator, we build a capsule network that disentangles geometry from pose, paving the way for more informative descriptors and a structured latent space. Our architecture allows joint object classification and orientation estimation without explicit supervision of rotations. We validate our algorithm empirically on common benchmark datasets."}}
