Existing efforts at general vision models are limited to a narrow range of tasks and offer no overarching framework to perform visual tasks holistically. We present a new comprehensive benchmark, General-purpose Visual Understanding Evaluation (G-VUE), covering the full spectrum of visual cognitive abilities with four disjoint functional domains \u2014 Perceive, Ground, Reason, and Act. The four domains are embodied in 11 carefully curated tasks, from 3D reconstruction to visual reasoning and manipulation. Along with the benchmark, we provide a general encoder-decoder framework for the tasks in G-VUE, to accommodate arbitrary visual representations on all 11 tasks. With our benchmark and framework, we evaluate 7 typical visual representations and observe that (1) transformer and more data empirically lead to more general-purpose, (2) language plays a significant role in learning versatile visual representation, and (3) correlations indicate a subtle constituent among tasks despite the distinctions, which could be evidence of general-purpose. We argue that instead of pursuing general-purpose vision models by end-to-end multi-task training, it is more reasonable to evaluate and investigate representations, which helps digest emerging pre-trained vision models and hopefully shed light on general intelligence."}}

To fill in the gap, we propose a large-scale and semantic-rich synthetic HSI dataset, denoted as HUMANISE, by aligning the captured human motion sequences with various 3D indoor scenes. We automatically annotate the aligned motions with language descriptions that depict the action and the individual interacting objects; e.g., sit on the armchair near the desk. HUMANIZE thus enables a new generation task, language-conditioned human motion generation in 3D scenes. The proposed task is challenging as it requires joint modeling of the 3D scene, human motion, and natural language. To tackle this task, we present a novel scene-and-language conditioned generative model that can produce 3D human motions of the desirable action interacting with the specified objects. Our experiments demonstrate that our model generates diverse and semantically consistent human motions in 3D scenes. \n"}}
