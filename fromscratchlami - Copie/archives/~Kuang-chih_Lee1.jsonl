We formulate the problem of profit maximization for a DSP interacting with ad exchanges in a real-time bidding environment in a cost-per-click/cost-per-action pricing model. Our proposed formulation leads to a nonconvex optimization problem due to the joint optimization over both impression allocation and bid price decisions. We use Lagrangian relaxation to develop a tractable convex dual problem, which, due to the properties of second-price auctions, may be solved efficiently with subgradient methods. We propose a two-phase solution procedure, whereby in the first phase we solve the convex dual problem using a subgradient algorithm, and in the second phase we use the previously computed dual solution to set bid prices and then solve a linear optimization problem to obtain the allocation probability variables. On several synthetic examples, we demonstrate that our proposed solution approach leads to superior performance over a baseline method that is used in practice."}}

It has been evolving into a more and more complicated structure. In this paper, we consider the problem of maximizing the revenue for the seller side via utilizing proper reserve price for the auctions in a dynamical way. Predicting the optimal reserve price for each auction in the repeated auction marketplaces is a non-trivial problem. However, we were able to come up with an efficient method of improving the seller revenue by mainly focusing on adjusting the reserve price for those high-value inventories. Previously, no dedicated work has been performed from this perspective. Inspired by Paul and Michael [16], our model first identifies the value of the inventory by predicting the top bid price bucket using a cascade of classifiers. The cascade is essential in significantly reducing the false positive rate of a single classifier. Based on the output of the first step, we build another cluster of classifiers to predict the price separations between the top two bids. We showed that although the high-value auctions are only a small portion of all the traffic, successfully identifying them and setting correct reserve price would result in a significant revenue lift. Moreover, our optimization is compatible with all other reserve price models in the system and does not impact their performance. In other words, when combined with other models, the enhancement on exchange revenue will be aggregated. Simulations on randomly sampled Yahoo ads exchange (YAXR) data showed stable and expected lift after applying our model."}}

Today the bid price per ad impression is typically decided by the expected value of how it can lead to a desired action event to the advertiser. However, this industry standard approach to decide the bid price does not consider the actual effect of the ad shown to the user, which should be measured based on the performance lift among users who have been or have not been exposed to a certain treatment of ads. In this paper, we propose a new bidding strategy and prove that if the bid price is decided based on the performance lift rather than absolute performance value, advertisers can actually gain more action events. We describe the modeling methodology to predict the performance lift and demonstrate the actual performance gain through blind A/B test with real ad campaigns. We also show that to move the demand-side platforms to bid based on performance lift, they should be rewarded based on the relative performance lift they contribute."}}

Recently proposed nonlinear factorization methods, although capable of capturing complex relationships, are computationally quite expensive and may suffer a severe learning bias in case of extreme data sparsity. Therefore, we propose a distributed, flexible nonlinear tensor factorization model, which avoids the expensive computations and structural restrictions of the Kronecker-product in the existing TGP formulations, allowing an arbitrary subset of tensor entries to be selected for training. Meanwhile, we derive a tractable and tight variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) that enables highly decoupled, parallel computations and high-quality inference. Based on the new bound, we develop a distributed, key-value-free inference algorithm in the MapReduce framework, which can fully exploit the memory cache mechanism in fast MapReduce systems such as Spark. Experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method over several state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of both predictive performance and computational efficiency."}}

We show that the existence of downstream auctions impacts the optimal floor. Moreover, it renders the classical derivation of the floor set by a monopolist inadequate and suboptimal. We derive the new downstream-corrected reserve price and compare its performance with respect to existing floors and the classical optimal monopoly price. In our application, the downstream-corrected reserve price proves superior to both. The proposed model also deals with data challenges commonly faced by exchanges: limited number of logged bids in an auction, and uncertainty regarding the bidding behavior in other exchanges. The relevance of this study transcends its particular context and is applicable to a wide range of scenarios where sequential auctions exist, and where marketplaces interact with each other."}}

Most of the advertisers typically prefer to impose the delivery constraint to spend budget smoothly over the time in order to reach a wider range of audiences and have a sustainable impact. Since lots of impressions are traded through public auctions for online advertising today, the liquidity makes price elasticity and bid landscape between demand and supply change quite dynamically. Therefore, it is challenging to perform smooth pacing control and maximize campaign performance simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a smart pacing approach in which the delivery pace of each campaign is learned from both offline and online data to achieve smooth delivery and optimal performance goals. The implementation of the proposed approach in a real DSP system is also presented. Experimental evaluations on both real online ad campaigns and offline simulations show that our approach can effectively improve campaign performance and achieve delivery goals."}}

Finding the best ad impression, i.e., the opportunity to show an ad to a user, requires the ability to estimate the probability that the user who sees the ad on his or her browser will take an action, i.e., the user will convert. However, conversion probability estimation is a challenging task since there is extreme data sparsity across different data dimensions and the conversion event occurs rarely. In this paper, we present our approach to conversion rate estimation which relies on utilizing past performance observations along user, publisher and advertiser data hierarchies. More specifically, we model the conversion event at different select hierarchical levels with separate binomial distributions and estimate the distribution parameters individually. Then we demonstrate how we can combine these individual estimators using logistic regression to accurately identify conversion events. In our presentation, we also discuss main practical considerations such as data imbalance, missing data, and output probability calibration, which render this estimation problem more difficult but yet need solving for a real-world implementation of the approach. We provide results from real advertising campaigns to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."}}

Personal photos are usually taken under uncontrolled conditions -the captured faces exhibit significant variations in pose, expression and illumination that limit the success of traditional face recognition algorithms. We show how to improve recognition rates by incorporating additional cues present in personal photo collections, such as clothing appearance and information about when the photo was taken. This is done by constructing a Markov random field (MRF) that effectively combines all available contextual cues in a principled recognition framework. Performing inference in the MRF produces markedly improved recognition results in a challenging dataset consisting of the personal photo collections of multiple people. At the same time, the computational cost of our approach remains comparable to that of standard face recognition approaches."}}

This projection is de\ufb01ned by a signi\ufb01cantly smaller number of parameters than metrics learned in input space, and thus our optimization reduces the risks of over\ufb01tting. Theory and results are presented for both a linear as well as a kernelized version of the algorithm. Overall, we achieve classi\ufb01cation rates similar, and in several cases superior, to those of support vector machines."}}
