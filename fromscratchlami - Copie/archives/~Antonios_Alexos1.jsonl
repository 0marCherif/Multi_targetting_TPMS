Most of the current methods in KOA diagnosis are very expensive commonly measuring changes in joint morphology and function. So, it is very important to diagnose KOA early, which can be achieved with early identification of significant risk factors in clinical data. Our objective in this paper is to investigate the predictive capacity of physical activity measures as risk factors in the progression of KOA. In order to achieve this, a machine learning approach is proposed here for KOA prediction using features extracted from an accelerometer bracelet. Various ML models were explored for their suitability in implementing the learning task on different combinations of feature subsets. Results up\u00a0to 74.5% were achieved indicating that physical activity measured by accelerometers may constitute an important risk factor for KOA progression prediction especially if it is combined with complementary data sources."}}

The main goal of this study is to build a prognostic tool that will predict the progression of pain in KOA patients using data collected at baseline. In order to do that we leverage a feature importance voting system for identifying the most important risk factors and various machine learning algorithms to classify, whether a patient's pain with KOA, will stabilize, increase or decrease. These models have been implemented on different combinations of feature subsets, and results up to 84.3% have been achieved with only a small amount of features. The proposed methodology demonstrated unique potential in identifying pain progression at an early stage therefore improving future KOA prevention efforts."}}

Specifically, inspired from results in neuroscience, we propose a local competition principle as a means of adversarially-robust deep learning. We argue that novel local winner-takes-all (LWTA) nonlinearities, combined with posterior sampling schemes, can greatly improve the adversarial robustness of traditional deep networks against difficult adversarial attack schemes. We combine these LWTA arguments with tools from the field of Bayesian non-parametrics, specifically the stick-breaking construction of the Indian Buffet Process, to flexibly account for the inherent uncertainty in data-driven modeling. As we experimentally show, the new proposed model achieves high robustness to adversarial perturbations on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in powerful white-box attacks, while at the same time retaining its benign accuracy to a high degree. Equally importantly, our approach achieves this result while requiring far less trainable model parameters than the existing state-of-the-art."}}
