Although concept drift is itself a well-studied phenomenon, it poses particular challenges for FL, because drifts arise staggered in time and space (across clients). Our work is the first to explicitly study data heterogeneity in both dimensions. We first demonstrate that prior solutions to drift adaptation, with their single global model, are ill-suited to staggered drifts, necessitating multiple-model solutions. We identify the problem of drift adaptation as a time-varying clustering problem, and we propose two new clustering algorithms for reacting to drifts based on local drift detection and hierarchical clustering. Empirical evaluation shows that our solutions achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing baselines, and are comparable to an idealized algorithm with oracle knowledge of the ground-truth clustering of clients to concepts at each time step."}}

We empirically study the impact of starting from a pre-trained model in federated learning using four standard federated learning benchmark datasets. Unsurprisingly, starting from a pre-trained model reduces the training time required to reach a target error rate and enables the training of more accurate models (up to 40\\%) than is possible when starting from random initialization. Surprisingly, we also find that starting federated learning from a pre-trained initialization reduces the effect of both data and system heterogeneity. We recommend that future work proposing and evaluating federated optimization methods evaluate the performance when starting from random and pre-trained initializations. We also believe this study raises several questions for further work on understanding the role of heterogeneity in federated optimization."}}

However, updating and communicating the entire model becomes prohibitively expensive when resource-constrained clients collectively aim to train a large machine learning model. Split learning provides a natural solution in such a setting, where only a (small) part of the model is stored and trained on clients while the remaining (large) part of the model only stays at the servers. Unfortunately, the model partitioning employed in split learning significantly increases the communication cost compared to the classical federated learning algorithms. This paper addresses this issue by compressing the additional communication cost associated with split learning via a novel clustering algorithm and a gradient correction technique. An extensive empirical evaluation on standard image and text benchmarks shows that the proposed method can achieve up to 490x communication cost reduction with minimal drop in accuracy, and enables a desirable performance vs. communication trade-off."}}

Naive weighted aggregation of such models causes objective inconsistency, that is, the global model converges to a stationary point of a mismatched objective function which can be arbitrarily different from the true objective. This paper provides a general framework to analyze the convergence of federated heterogeneous optimization algorithms. It subsumes previously proposed methods such as FedAvg and FedProx and provides the first principled understanding of the solution bias and the convergence slowdown due to objective inconsistency. Using insights from this analysis, we propose FedNova, a normalized averaging method that eliminates objective inconsistency while preserving fast error convergence."}}

Several works have analyzed the convergence of federated learning by accounting of data heterogeneity, communication and computation limitations, and partial client participation. However, they assume unbiased client participation, where clients are selected at random or in proportion of their data sizes. In this paper, we present the first convergence analysis of federated optimization for biased client selection strategies, and quantify how the selection bias affects convergence speed. We reveal that biasing client selection towards clients with higher local loss achieves faster error convergence. Using this insight, we propose Power-of-Choice, a communication- and computation-efficient client selection framework that can flexibly span the trade-off between convergence speed and solution bias. We also propose an extension of Power-of-Choice that is able to maintain convergence speed improvement while diminishing the selection skew. Our experiments demonstrate that Power-of-Choice strategies converge up to 3 $\\times$ faster and give $10$% higher test accuracy than the baseline random selection. "}}

However, the infrastructures variability such as high communication delay or random node slowdown greatly impedes the performance of distributed SGD algorithm, especially in a wireless system or sensor networks. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic approach named Overlap-Local-SGD (and its momentum variant) to overlap the communication and computation so as to speedup the distributed training procedure. The approach can help to mitigate the straggler effects as well. We achieve this by adding an anchor model on each node. After multiple local updates, locally trained models will be pulled back towards the synchronized anchor model rather than communicating with others. Experimental results of training a deep neural network on CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Overlap-Local-SGD. We also provide a convergence guarantee for the proposed algorithm under non-convex objective functions."}}

Asynchronous methods can alleviate stragglers, but cause gradient staleness that can adversely affect the convergence error. In this work, we present a novel theoretical characterization of the speedup offered by asynchronous methods by analyzing the trade-off between the error in the trained model and the actual training runtime(wallclock time). The main novelty in our work is that our runtime analysis considers random straggling delays, which helps us design and compare distributed SGD algorithms that strike a balance between straggling and staleness. We also provide a new error convergence analysis of asynchronous SGD variants without bounded or exponential delay assumptions. Finally, based on our theoretical characterization of the error-runtime trade-off, we propose a method of gradually varying synchronicity in distributed SGD and demonstrate its performance on CIFAR10 dataset."}}

We prove that, with appropriate choice of step-sizes, Lookahead converges to a stationary point of smooth non-convex functions. Although Lookahead is described and implemented as a serial algorithm, our analysis is based on viewing Lookahead as a multi-agent optimization method with two agents communicating periodically."}}
