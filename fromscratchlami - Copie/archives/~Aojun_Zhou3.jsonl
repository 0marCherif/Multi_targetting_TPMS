We notice that the head structures of prevailing DNNs share a similar processing pipeline, exploiting global feature dependencies while disregarding local ones. Instead, this paper presents $N$on-gl$O$bal $A$ttentive $H$ead (NOAH), a simple and universal head structure, to improve the learning capacity of DNNs. NOAH relies on a novel form of attention dubbed pairwise object category attention, which models dense local-to-global feature dependencies via a concise association of feature split, interaction and aggregation operations. As a drop-in design, NOAH can replace existing heads of many DNNs, and meanwhile, maintains almost the same model size and similar model efficiency. We validate the efficacy of NOAH mainly on the large-scale ImageNet dataset with various DNN architectures that span convolutional neural networks, vision transformers and multi-layer perceptrons when training from scratch. Without bells and whistles, experiments show that: (a) NOAH can significantly boost the performance of lightweight DNNs, e.g., bringing $3.14%$|$5.30%$|$1.90%$ top-1 accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2 ($0.5\\times$)|Deit-Tiny ($0.5\\times$)|gMLP-Tiny ($0.5\\times$); (b) NOAH can generalize well on relatively large DNNs, e.g., bringing $1.02%$|$0.78%$|$0.91%$ top-1 accuracy improvement for ResNet50|Deit-Small|MLP-Mixer-Small; (c) NOAH can still bring acceptable performance gains to large DNNs (having over 50 million parameters), e.g., $0.41%$|$0.37%$|$0.35%$ top-1 accuracy improvement for ResNet152|Deit-Base|MLP-Mixer-Base. Besides, NOAH also retains its effectiveness in the aggressive training regime (e.g., a ResNet50 model with NOAH reaches $79.32%$ top-1 accuracy, yielding $0.88%$ gain) and other image classification tasks.

However, pure Transformer architectures often require a large amount of training data or extra supervision to obtain comparable performance with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To overcome these limitations, we analyze the potential drawbacks when directly borrowing Transformer architectures from NLP. Then we propose a new Convolution-enhanced image Transformer (CeiT) which combines the advantages of CNNs in extracting low-level features, strengthening locality, and the advantages of Transformers in establishing long-range dependencies. Three modifications are made to the original Transformer: 1) instead of the straightforward tokenization from raw input images, we design an Image-to-Tokens (I2T) module that extracts patches from generated low-level features; 2) the feed-froward network in each encoder block is replaced with a Locally-enhanced Feed-Forward (LeFF) layer that promotes the correlation among neighboring tokens in the spatial dimension; 3) a Layer-wise Class token Attention (LCA) is attached at the top of the Transformer that utilizes the multi-level representations. Experimental results on ImageNet and seven downstream tasks show the effectiveness and generalization ability compared with previous Transformers and state-of-the-art CNNs, without requiring a large amount of training data and extra CNN teachers. Besides, CeiT models also demonstrate better convergence with 3xfewer training iterations, which can reduce the training cost significantly."}}

However, a fixed architecture may not be suitable for different data with high diversity. To boost the model capacity, existing methods usually employ larger convolutional kernels or deeper network layers, which incurs prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing Differentiable Dynamic Wirings (DDW), which learns the instance-aware connectivity that creates different wiring patterns for different instances. 1) Specifically, the network is initialized as a complete directed acyclic graph, where the nodes represent convolutional blocks and the edges represent the connection paths. 2) We generate edge weights by a learnable module, Router, and select the edges whose weights are larger than a threshold, to adjust the connectivity of the neural network structure. 3) Instead of using the same path of the network, DDW aggregates features dynamically in each node, which allows the network to have more representation power. To facilitate effective training, we further represent the network connectivity of each sample as an adjacency matrix. The matrix is updated to aggregate features in the forward pass, cached in the memory, and used for gradient computing in the backward pass. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with several mainstream architectures, including MobileNetV2, ResNet, ResNeXt, and RegNet.

Instead, recent research in dynamic convolution shows that learning a linear combination of n convolutional kernels weighted with their input-dependent attentions can significantly improve the accuracy of light-weight CNNs, while maintaining efficient inference. However, we observe that existing works endow convolutional kernels with the dynamic property through one dimension (regarding the convolutional kernel number) of the kernel space, but the other three dimensions (regarding the spatial size, the input channel number and the output channel number for each convolutional kernel) are overlooked. Inspired by this, we present Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv), a more generalized yet elegant dynamic convolution design, to advance this line of research. ODConv leverages a novel multi-dimensional attention mechanism with a parallel strategy to learn complementary attentions for convolutional kernels along all four dimensions of the kernel space at any convolutional layer. As a drop-in replacement of regular convolutions, ODConv can be plugged into many CNN architectures. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets show that ODConv brings solid accuracy boosts for various prevailing CNN backbones including both light-weight and large ones, e.g., 3.77%~5.71%|1.86%~3.72% absolute top-1 improvements to MobivleNetV2|ResNet family on the ImageNet dataset. Intriguingly, thanks to its improved feature learning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or outperform existing dynamic convolution counterparts with multiple kernels, substantially reducing extra parameters. Furthermore, ODConv is also superior to other attention modules for modulating the output features or the convolutional weights.

Recent innovations in Hardware Architectures (e.g. Nvidia Ampere Sparse Tensor Core) and N:M fine-grained Sparse Neural Network algorithms (i.e. every M-weights contains N non-zero values) reveal a promising research line of neural pruning. However, the existing N:M algorithms only address the challenge of how to train N:M sparse neural networks in a uniform fashion (i.e. every layer has the same N:M sparsity) and suffer from a significant accuracy drop for high sparsity (i.e. when sparsity > 80\\%). To tackle this problem, we present a novel technique -- \\textbf{\\textit{DominoSearch}} to find mixed N:M sparsity schemes from pre-trained dense deep neural networks to achieve higher accuracy than the uniform-sparsity scheme with equivalent complexity constraints (e.g. model size or FLOPs). For instance, for the same model size with 2.1M parameters (87.5\\% sparsity), our layer-wise N:M sparse ResNet18 outperforms its uniform counterpart by 2.1\\% top-1 accuracy, on the large-scale ImageNet dataset. For the same computational complexity of 227M FLOPs, our layer-wise sparse ResNet18 outperforms the uniform one by 1.3\\% top-1 accuracy.

It can be generally categorized into unstructured fine-grained sparsity that zeroes out multiple individual weights distributed across the neural network, and structured coarse-grained sparsity which prunes blocks of sub-networks of a neural network. Fine-grained sparsity can achieve a high compression ratio but is not hardware friendly and hence receives limited speed gains. On the other hand, coarse-grained sparsity cannot simultaneously achieve both apparent acceleration on modern GPUs and\ndecent performance. In this paper, we are the first to study training from scratch an N:M fine-grained structured sparse network, which can maintain the advantages of both unstructured fine-grained sparsity and structured coarse-grained sparsity simultaneously on specifically designed GPUs. Specifically, a 2 : 4 sparse network could achieve 2\u00d7 speed-up without performance drop on Nvidia A100 GPUs. Furthermore, we propose a novel and effective ingredient, sparse-refined straight-through estimator (SR-STE), to alleviate the negative influence of the approximated gradients computed by vanilla STE during optimization. We also define a metric, Sparse Architecture Divergence (SAD), to measure the sparse network\u2019s topology change during the training process.

However, current prevailing training scheme follows the previous way of adding supervision to the last layer of the network only and propagating error information up layer-by-layer. In this paper, we propose Deeply-supervised Knowledge Synergy (DKS), a new method aiming to train CNNs with improved generalization ability for image classification tasks without introducing extra computational cost during inference. Inspired by the deeply-supervised learning scheme, we first append auxiliary supervision branches on top of certain intermediate network layers. While properly using auxiliary supervision can improve model accuracy to some degree, we go one step further to explore the possibility of utilizing the probabilistic knowledge dynamically learnt by the classifiers connected to the backbone network as a new regularization to improve the training. A novel synergy loss, which considers pairwise knowledge matching among all supervision branches, is presented. Intriguingly, it enables dense pairwise knowledge matching operations in both top-down and bottom-up directions at each training iteration, resembling a dynamic synergy process for the same task. We evaluate DKS on image classification datasets using state-of-the-art CNN architectures, and show that the models trained with it are consistently better than the corresponding counterparts. For instance, on the ImageNet classification benchmark, our ResNet-152 model outperforms the baseline model with a 1.47% margin in Top-1 accuracy.

The proposed method, named as SnapQuant, has two intriguing features: (1) The posterior distribution is parameterized as a policy network trained with a reinforcement learning scheme. During the training phase, we generate binary weights on-the-fly since what we actually maintain is the policy network, and all the binary weights are used in a burn-after-reading style. At the testing phase, we can sample binary weight instances for a given recognition architecture from the learnt policy network. (2) The policy network, which has a nested parameter structure consisting of layer-wise, filter-wise and kernel-wise parameter sharing designs, is applicable to any neural network architecture. Such a nested parameterization explicitly and hierarchically models the joint posterior distribution of binary weights.

However reversely, the large size of DNN models lays a heavy burden on storage, computation and power consumption, which prohibits their deployments on the embedded and mobile systems. In this paper, we propose Explicit Loss-error-aware Quantization (ELQ), a new method that can train DNN models with very low-bit parameter values such as ternary and binary ones to approximate 32-bit floating-point counterparts without noticeable loss of predication accuracy. Unlike existing methods that usually pose the problem as a straightforward approximation of the layer-wise weights or outputs of the original full-precision model (specifically, minimizing the error of the layer-wise weights or inner products of the weights and the inputs between the original and respective quantized models), our ELQ elaborately bridges the loss perturbation from the weight quantization and an incremental quantization strategy to address DNN quantization. Through explicitly regularizing the loss perturbation and the weight approximation error in an incremental way, we show that such a new optimization method is theoretically reasonable and practically effective. As validated with two mainstream convolutional neural network families (i.e., fully convolutional and non-fully convolutional), our ELQ shows better results than the state-of-the-art quantization methods on the large scale ImageNet classification dataset.
