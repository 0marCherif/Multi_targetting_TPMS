An estimated 85% ofH. pylori\u2013colonized individuals experience no detrimental effects. Tostudy the mechanisms promoting host tolerance to the bacterium in the gastrointestinal mucosa and systemic regulatoryeffects, we investigated the dynamics of immunoregulatory mechanisms triggered byH. pyloriusing a high-performancecomputing\u2013driven ENteric Immunity SImulator multiscale model. Immune responses were simulated by integrating anagent-based model, ordinary, and partial differential equations.Results:The outputs were analyzed using 2 sequentialstages: the first used a partial rank correlation coefficient regression\u2013based and the second a metamodel-based globalsensitivity analysis. The influential parameters screened from the first stage were selected to be varied for the second stage.The outputs from both stages were combined as a training dataset to build a spatiotemporal metamodel. The Sobol indicesmeasured time-varying impact of input parameters during initiation, peak, and chronic phases of infection. The studyidentified epithelial cell proliferation and epithelial cell death as key parameters that control infection outcomes.In silicovalidation showed that colonization withH. pyloridecreased with a decrease in epithelial cell proliferation, which waslinked to regulatory macrophages and tolerogenic dendritic cells.Conclusions:The hybrid model ofH. pyloriinfectionidentified epithelial cell proliferation as a key factor for successful colonization of the gastric niche and highlighted the roleof tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory macrophages in modulating the host responses and shaping infectionoutcomes."}}

TIA is associated with high diagnostic errors because of\nthe subjective nature of findings and the lack of clinical and imaging biomarkers. The goal of this study was to\ndesign and evaluate a novel multinomial classification model, based on a combination of feature selection\nmechanisms coupled with logistic regression, to predict the likelihood of TIA, TIA mimics, and minor stroke.\nMethods: We conducted our modeling on consecutive patients who were evaluated in our health system with an\ninitial diagnosis of TIA in a 9-month period. We established the final diagnoses after the clinical evaluation by\nindependent verification from two stroke neurologists. We used Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Least\nAbsolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) for prediction modeling.\nResults: The RFE-based classifier correctly predicts 78% of the overall observations. In particular, the classifier\ncorrectly identifies 68% of the cases labeled as \u201cTIA mimic\u201d and 83% of the \u201cTIA\u201d discharge diagnosis. The LASSO\nclassifier had an overall accuracy of 74%. Both the RFE and LASSO-based classifiers tied or outperformed the ABCD2\nscore and the Diagnosis of TIA (DOT) score. With respect to predicting TIA, the RFE-based classifier has 61.1%\naccuracy, the LASSO-based classifier has 79.5% accuracy, whereas the DOT score applied to the dataset yields an\naccuracy of 63.1%.\nConclusion: The results of this pilot study indicate that a multinomial classification model, based on a combination\nof feature selection mechanisms coupled with logistic regression, can be used to effectively differentiate between\nTIA, TIA mimics, and minor stroke."}}

In\nclinical situations, low blood pressure may require prompt intervention by intravenous bolus or infusion. Differences\nin responsiveness to phenylephrine treatment are commonly observed in clinical practice. Candidate gene studies\nindicate genetic variants may contribute to this variable response.\nMethods: Pharmacological and physiological data were retrospectively extracted from routine clinical anesthetic\nrecords. Response to phenylephrine boluses could not be reliably assessed, so infusion rates were used for analysis.\nUnsupervised k-means clustering was conducted on clean data containing 4130 patients based on phenylephrine\ninfusion rate and blood pressure parameters, to identify potential phenotypic subtypes. Genome-wide association\nstudies (GWAS) were performed against average infusion rates in two cohorts: phase I (n = 1205) and phase II (n =\n329). Top genetic variants identified from the meta-analysis were further examined to see if they could differentiate\nsubgroups identified by k-means clustering.\nResults: Three subgroups of patients with different response to phenylephrine were clustered and characterized:\nresistant (high infusion rate yet low mean systolic blood pressure (SBP)), intermediate (low infusion rate and low\nSBP), and sensitive (low infusion rate with high SBP). Differences among clusters were tabulated to assess for\npossible confounding influences. Comorbidity hierarchical clustering showed the resistant group had a higher\nprevalence of confounding factors than the intermediate and sensitive groups although overall prevalence is below\n6%.

It provides a solid framework that aids the conversion of pre-clinical and clinical data into mathematical equations to enable modeling and in silico experimentation. The modeling-driven insights shed lights on some of the most pressing immunological questions and aid the design of fruitful validation experiments. A typical system of equations, mapping the interaction among various immunological entities and a pathogen, consists of a high-dimensional input parameter space that could drive the stochastic system outputs in unpredictable directions. In this paper, we perform spatio-temporal metamodel-based sensitivity analysis of immune response to Helicobacter pylori infection using the computational model developed by the ENteric Immune SImulator. We propose a two-stage procedure to obtain the estimates of the Sobol\u2019 total and first-order indices for each input parameter, for quantifying their time-varying impacts on each output of interest. In particular, we fully reuse and exploit information from an existing simulated dataset, develop a novel sampling design for constructing the two-stage metamodels, and perform metamodel-based sensitivity analysis. The proposed procedure is scalable, easily interpretable, and adaptable to any multi-input multi-output complex systems of equations with a high-dimensional input parameter space."}}

Computer simulations guide and underpin experimental and clinical efforts. This study presents ENteric Immune Simulator (ENISI), a multiscale modeling tool for modeling the mucosal immune responses. ENISI's modeling environment can simulate in silico experiments from molecular signaling pathways to tissue level events such as tissue lesion formation. ENISI's architecture integrates multiple modeling technologies including ABM (agent-based modeling), ODE (ordinary differential equations), SDE (stochastic modeling equations), and PDE (partial differential equations). This paper focuses on the implementation and developmental challenges of ENISI. A multiscale model of mucosal immune responses during colonic inflammation, including CD4+ T cell differentiation and tissue level cell-cell interactions was developed to illustrate the capabilities, power and scope of ENISI MSM.\n\nBackground\nComputational techniques are becoming increasingly powerful and modeling tools for biological systems are of greater needs. Biological systems are inherently multiscale, from molecules to tissues and from nano-seconds to a lifespan of several years or decades. ENISI MSM integrates multiple modeling technologies to understand immunological processes from signaling pathways within cells to lesion formation at the tissue level. This paper examines and summarizes the technical details of ENISI, from its initial version to its latest cutting-edge implementation.\n\nImplementation\nObject-oriented programming approach is adopted to develop a suite of tools based on ENISI. Multiple modeling technologies are integrated to visualize tissues, cells as well as proteins; furthermore, performance matching between the scales is addressed.\n\nConclusion\nWe used ENISI MSM for developing predictive multiscale models of the mucosal immune system during gut inflammation. Our modeling predictions dissect the mechanisms by which effector CD4+ T cell responses contribute to tissue damage in the gut mucosa following immune dysregulation."}}
