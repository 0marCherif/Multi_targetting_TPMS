Current approaches address this challenge by relying either on large amounts of demonstrations that span environment variations or on handcrafted reward functions that require state estimates. Both directions are not scalable to fast imitation. In this work, we present Fast Imitation of Skills from Humans (FISH), a new imitation learning approach that can learn robust visual skills with less than a minute of human demonstrations. Given a weak base policy trained by offline imitation of demonstrations, FISH computes rewards that correspond to the \u201cmatch\u201d between the robot\u2019s behavior and the demonstrations. These rewards are then used to adaptively update a residual policy that adds on to the base policy. Across all tasks, FISH requires at most twenty minutes of interactive learning to imitate demonstrations on object configurations that were not seen in the demonstrations. Importantly, FISH is constructed to be versatile, which allows it to be used across robot morphologies (e.g. xArm, Allegro, Stretch) and camera configurations (e.g. third-person, eye-in-hand). Our experimental evaluations on 9 different tasks show that FISH achieves an average success rate of 93%, which is around 3.8\u00d7 higher than prior state-of-the-art methods."}}

In this work, we present Regularized Optimal Transport (ROT), a new imitation learning algorithm that builds on recent advances in optimal transport based trajectory-matching. Our key technical insight is that adaptively combining trajectory-matching rewards with behavior cloning can significantly accelerate imitation even with only a few demonstrations. Our experiments on 20 visual control tasks across the DeepMind Control Suite, the OpenAI Robotics Suite, and the Meta-World Benchmark demonstrate an average of 7.8x faster imitation to reach 90% of expert performance compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. On real-world robotic manipulation, with just one demonstration and an hour of online training, ROT achieves an average success rate of 90.1% across 14 tasks."}}

Abstract Word representations obtained from text using the distributional hypothesis have proved to be useful for various natural language processing tasks. To prepare vector representation from the text, some researchers use predictive model (Word2vec) or dense count-based model (GloVe), whereas others attempt to explore network structure obtained from text namely, distributional thesaurus network where the neighborhood of a word is a set of words having adequate context feature overlap. Being inspired by the successful application of network embedding techniques (DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec, etc.) in various tasks, we attempt to apply network embedding techniques to turn a distributional thesaurus network into dense word vectors and investigate the usefulness of distributional thesaurus embedding in improving the overall word vector representation. This is the first attempt where we show that combining the proposed word representation obtained by distributional thesaurus embedding with the state-of-the-art word representations helps in improving the performance by a significant margin when evaluated against several NLP tasks which include intrinsic tasks like word similarity and relatedness, subspace alignment, synonym detection, analogy detection; extrinsic tasks like noun compound interpretation, sentence pair similarity task as well as subconscious intrinsic evaluation methods using neural activation pattern in the brain, etc."}}
