Mainstream approaches follow a multi-stage framework and suffer from high training costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training models (CLIP) to localize different categories with only image-level labels and without further training. To efficiently generate high-quality segmentation masks from CLIP, we propose a novel WSSS framework called CLIP-ES. Our framework improves all three stages of WSSS with special designs for CLIP: 1) We introduce the softmax function into GradCAM and exploit the zero-shot ability of CLIP to suppress the confusion caused by non-target classes and backgrounds. Meanwhile, to take full advantage of CLIP, we re-explore text inputs under the WSSS setting and customize two text-driven strategies: sharpness-based prompt selection and synonym fusion. 2) To simplify the stage of CAM refinement, we propose a real-time class-aware attention-based affinity (CAA) module based on the inherent multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in CLIP-ViTs. 3) When training the final segmentation model with the masks generated by CLIP, we introduced a confidence-guided loss (CGL) focus on confident regions. Our CLIP-ES achieves SOTA performance on Pascal VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 while only taking 10% time of previous methods for the pseudo mask generation. Code is available at this https URL."}}

However, most of them concentrate on aggregating local features, but neglect to directly model global dependencies, which results in a limited effective receptive field. Besides, how to effectively incorporate local and global components also remains challenging. To tackle these problems, we propose Asymmetric Parallel Point Transformer (APPT). Specifically, we introduce Global Pivot Attention to extract global features and enlarge the effective receptive field. Moreover, we design the Asymmetric Parallel structure to effectively integrate local and global information. Combined with these designs, APPT is able to capture features globally throughout the entire network while focusing on local-detailed features. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the priors and achieves state-of-the-art on several benchmarks for 3D point cloud understanding, such as 3D semantic segmentation on S3DIS, 3D shape classification on ModelNet40, and 3D part segmentation on ShapeNet."}}

In contrast to previous 3D MAE frameworks, which either design a complex decoder to infer masked information from maintained regions or adopt sophisticated masking strategies, we instead propose a much simpler paradigm. The core idea is to apply a \\textbf{G}enerative \\textbf{D}ecoder for MAE (GD-MAE) to automatically merges the surrounding context to restore the masked geometric knowledge in a hierarchical fusion manner. In doing so, our approach is free from introducing the heuristic design of decoders and enjoys the flexibility of exploring various masking strategies. The corresponding part costs less than \\textbf{12\\%} latency compared with conventional methods, while achieving better performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on several large-scale benchmarks: Waymo, KITTI, and ONCE. Consistent improvement on downstream detection tasks illustrates strong robustness and generalization capability. Not only our method reveals state-of-the-art results, but remarkably, we achieve comparable accuracy even with \\textbf{20\\%} of the labeled data on the Waymo dataset.

Due to the ill-posed nature of monocular imagery, existing monocular 3D detection methods highly rely on training with the manually annotated 3D box labels on the LiDAR point clouds. This annotation process is very laborious and expensive. To dispense with the reliance on 3D box labels, in this paper we explore the weakly supervised monocular 3D detection. Specifically, we first detect 2D boxes on the image. Then, we adopt the generated 2D boxes to select corresponding RoI LiDAR points as the weak supervision. Eventually, we adopt a network to predict 3D boxes which can tightly align with associated RoI LiDAR points. This network is learned by minimizing our newly-proposed 3D alignment loss between the 3D box estimates and the corresponding RoI LiDAR points.

Recent work showed that ViTs are also vulnerable to adversarial examples like CNNs. To build robust ViTs, an intuitive way is to apply adversarial training since it has been shown as one of the most effective ways to accomplish robust CNNs. However, one major limitation of adversarial training is its heavy computational cost. The self-attention mechanism adopted by ViTs is a computationally intense operation whose expense increases quadratically with the number of input patches, making adversarial training on ViTs even more time-consuming. In this work, we first comprehensively study fast adversarial training on a variety of vision transformers and illustrate the relationship between the efficiency and robustness. Then, to expediate adversarial training on ViTs, we propose an efficient Attention Guided Adversarial Training mechanism. Specifically, relying on the specialty of self-attention, we actively remove certain patch embeddings of each layer with an attention-guided dropping strategy during adversarial training. The slimmed self-attention modules accelerate the adversarial training on ViTs significantly. With only 65\\% of the fast adversarial training time, we match the state-of-the-art results on the challenging ImageNet benchmark."}}
