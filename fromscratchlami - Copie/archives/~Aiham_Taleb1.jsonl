In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised method that leverages multiple imaging modalities. We introduce the multimodal puzzle task, which facilitates representation learning from multiple image modalities. The learned modality-agnostic representations are obtained by confusing image modalities at the data-level. Together with the Sinkhorn operator, with which we formulate the puzzle solving optimization as permutation matrix inference instead of classification, they allow for efficient solving of multimodal puzzles with varying levels of complexity. In addition, we also propose to utilize generation techniques for multimodal data augmentation used for self-supervised pretraining, instead of downstream tasks directly. This aims to circumvent quality issues associated with synthetic images, while improving data-efficiency and the representations learned by self-supervised methods. Our experimental results show that solving our multimodal puzzles yields better semantic representations, compared to treating each modality independently. Our results also highlight the benefits of exploiting synthetic images for self-supervised pretraining. We showcase our approach on three segmentation tasks, and we outperform many solutions and our results are competitive to state-of-the-art."}}

Our approach aligns images and several genetic modalities in the feature space using a contrastive loss. We design our method to integrate multiple modalities of each individual person in the same model end-to-end, even when the available modalities vary across individuals.

Additionally, we show that employing Bayesian neural networks (with Monte-Carlo Dropout) during the inference phase can further enhance the results on the downstream tasks. We showcase our models on two medical imaging segmentation tasks: i) Brain Tumor Segmentation from 3D MRI, ii) Pancreas Tumor Segmentation from 3D CT.

The developed algorithms are 3D Contrastive Predictive Coding, 3D Rotation prediction, 3D Jigsaw puzzles, Relative 3D patch location, and 3D Exemplar networks. Our experiments show that pretraining models with our 3D tasks yields more powerful semantic representations, and enables solving downstream tasks more accurately and efficiently, compared to training the models from scratch and to pretraining them on 2D slices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on three downstream tasks from the medical imaging domain: i) Brain Tumor Segmentation from 3D MRI, ii) Pancreas Tumor Segmentation from 3D CT, and iii) Diabetic Retinopathy Detection from 2D Fundus images. In each task, we assess the gains in data-efficiency, performance, and speed of convergence. We achieve results competitive to state-of-the-art solutions at a fraction of the computational expense.
