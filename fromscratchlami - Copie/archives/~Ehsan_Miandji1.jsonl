This 6-D representation, which is built in a global coordinate system, can be used in both multi-camera studio capture and video fly-by capture scenarios, with various viewpoint (camera) arrangements and densities. We show that both the Region-Adaptive Hierarchical Transform (RAHT) and the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) can be extended to the proposed 6-D representation to enable the non-separable transform coding. Our method is applicable to plenoptic data with either dense or sparse sets of viewpoints, and to complete or incomplete plenoptic data, while the state-of-the-art RAHT-KLT method, which is separable in spatial and angular dimensions, is applicable only to complete plenoptic data. The \"complete'' plenoptic data refers to data that has, for each spatial point, one colour for every viewpoint (ignoring any occlusions), while \"incomplete'' data has colours only for the visible surface points at each viewpoint. We demonstrate that the proposed 6-D RAHT and 6-D GFT compression methods are able to outperform the state-of-the-art RAHT-KLT method on 3-D objects with various levels of surface specularity, and captured with different camera arrangements and different degrees of viewpoint sparsity."}}
