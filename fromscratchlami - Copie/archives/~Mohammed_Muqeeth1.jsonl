Despite their possible benefits, models with learned routing often underperform their parameter-matched densely-activated counterparts as well as models that use non-learned heuristic routing strategies. In this paper, we hypothesize that these shortcomings stem from the gradient estimation techniques used to train sparsely-activated models with non-differentiable discrete routing decisions. To test this hypothesis, we evaluate the performance of sparsely-activated models trained with various gradient estimation techniques in three settings where a high-quality heuristic routing strategy can be designed. Our experiments reveal that learned routing reaches substantially different (and worse) solutions than heuristic routing in various settings. As a first step towards remedying this gap, we demonstrate that supervising the routing decision on a small fraction of the examples is sufficient to help the model to learn better routing strategies.  Our results shed light on the difficulties of learning effective routing and set the stage for future work on conditional computation mechanisms and training techniques."}}

ICL incurs substantial computational, memory, and storage costs because it involves processing all of the training examples every time a prediction is made. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) (e.g. adapter modules, prompt tuning, sparse update methods, etc.) offers an alternative paradigm where a small set of parameters are trained to enable a model to perform the new task. In this paper, we rigorously compare few-shot ICL and PEFT and demonstrate that the latter offers better accuracy as well as dramatically lower computational costs. Along the way, we introduce a new PEFT method called (IA)^3 that scales activations by learned vectors, attaining stronger performance while only introducing a relatively tiny amount of new parameters. We also propose a simple recipe based on the T0 model called T-Few that can be applied to new tasks without task-specific tuning or modifications. We validate the effectiveness of T-Few on completely unseen tasks by applying it to the RAFT benchmark, attaining super-human performance for the first time and outperforming the state-of-the-art by 6% absolute. All of the code used in our experiments will be publicly available."}}
