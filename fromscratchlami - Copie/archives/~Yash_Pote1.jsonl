Samplers are increasingly used in a wide range of safety-critical ML applications, and hence the testing problem has gained importance. For $n$-dimensional distributions, the existing state-of-the-art algorithm, $\\mathsf{Barbarik2}$, has a worst case query complexity of exponential in $n$ and hence is not ideal for use in practice. Our primary contribution is an exponentially faster algorithm, $\\mathsf{Barbarik3}$, that has a query complexity linear in $n$ and hence can easily scale to larger instances. We demonstrate our claim by implementing our algorithm and then comparing it against $\\mathsf{Barbarik2}$. Our experiments on the samplers $\\mathsf{wUnigen3}$ and $\\mathsf{wSTS}$, find that $\\mathsf{Barbarik3}$ requires $10\\times$ fewer samples for $\\mathsf{wUnigen3}$ and $450\\times$ fewer samples for $\\mathsf{wSTS}$ as compared to $\\mathsf{Barbarik2}$."}}

In machine learning and probabilistic programming, one is often interested in understanding whether the distributions learned using PCs are close to the desired distribution. Thus, given two probabilistic circuits, a fundamental problem of interest is to determine whether their distributions are close to each other.\n\nThe primary contribution of this paper is a closeness test for PCs with respect to the total variation distance metric. Our algorithm utilizes two common PC queries, counting and sampling. In particular, we provide a poly-time probabilistic algorithm to check the closeness of two PCs, when the PCs support tractable approximate counting and sampling. We demonstrate the practical efficiency of our algorithmic framework via a detailed experimental evaluation of a prototype implementation against a set of 375 PC benchmarks. We find that our test correctly decides the closeness of all 375 PCs within 3600 seconds. "}}

Sampling is a fundamental problem in machine learning. The daunting computational complexity of sampling with formal guarantees leads designers to propose heuristics-based techniques for which no rigorous theoretical analysis exists to quantify the quality of generated distributions. This poses a challenge in designing a testing methodology to test whether a sampler under test generates samples according to a given distribution. Only recently, Chakraborty and Meel (2019) designed the first scalable verifier, called Barbarik1, for samplers in the special case when the weight function $\\mathtt{wt}$ is constant, that is, when the sampler is supposed to sample uniformly from $\\mathcal{F}$ . The techniques in Barbarik1, however, fail to handle general weight functions. The primary contribution of this paper is an affirmative answer to the above challenge: motivated by Barbarik1 but using different techniques and analysis, we design Barbarik2 an algorithm to test whether the distribution generated by a sampler is $\\varepsilon$-close or $\\eta$-far from any target distribution. In contrast to black-box sampling techniques that require a number of samples proportional to $|\\mathcal{F}|$ , Barbarik2 requires only $\\tilde{O}(tilt(\\mathtt{wt},\\varphi)^2/\\eta(\\eta - 6\\varepsilon)^3)$ samples, where the $tilt$ is the maximum ratio of weights of two satisfying assignments. Barbarik2 can handle any arbitrary weight function. We present a prototype implementation of Barbarik2 and use it to test three state-of-the-art samplers."}}

While CNF solving has witnessed significant runtime improvement over the past two decades, the same does not hold for several other classes such as the conjunction of cardinality and XOR constraints, denoted as CARD-XOR formulas. The problem of determining satisfiability of CARD-XOR formulas is a fundamental problem with wide variety of applications ranging from discrete integration in the field of artificial intelligence to maximum likelihood decoding in coding theory. The runtime behavior of random CARD-XOR formulas is unexplored in prior work. In this paper, we present the first rigorous empirical study to characterize the runtime behavior of 1-CARD-XOR formulas. We show empirical evidence of a surprising phase-transition that follows a non-linear tradeoff between CARD and XOR constraints."}}
