Conventional techniques, notably those employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are often limited by insufficient training data and their inability to utilize textual information, undermining their applicability in real-world applications. In this work, we propose ReLM, a novel framework that leverages the chemical knowledge encoded in language models (LMs) to assist GNNs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of real-world chemical reaction predictions. To further enhance the model's robustness and interpretability, we incorporate the confidence score strategy, enabling the LMs to self-assess the reliability of their predictions. Our experimental results demonstrate that ReLM improves the performance of state-of-the-art GNN-based methods across various chemical reaction datasets, especially in out-of-distribution settings.

Scrutinizing previous studies, we can reveal a common scheme consisting of three key components: (1) graph tokenizer, which breaks a molecular graph into smaller fragments (i.e., subgraphs) and converts them into tokens; (2) graph masking, which corrupts the graph with masks; (3) graph autoencoder, which first applies an encoder on the masked graph to generate the representations, and then employs a decoder on the representations to recover the tokens of the original graph. However, the previous MGM studies focus extensively on graph masking and encoder, while there is limited understanding of tokenizer and decoder. To bridge the gap, we first summarize popular molecule tokenizers at the granularity of node, edge, motif, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and then examine their roles as the MGM's reconstruction targets. Further, we explore the potential of adopting an expressive decoder in MGM. Our results show that a subgraph-level tokenizer and a sufficiently expressive decoder with remask decoding have a large impact on the encoder's representation learning. Finally, we propose a novel MGM method SimSGT, featuring a Simple GNN-based Tokenizer (SGT) and an effective decoding strategy. We empirically validate that our method outperforms the existing molecule self-supervised learning methods. Our codes and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/syr-cn/SimSGT."}}

Despite the great success in low-dimensional linear systems, it has been observed that these approaches overly exploits easier-to-fit samples, thus inevitably learning spurious edges. Worse still, the common homogeneity assumption of most causal discovery methods can be easily violated due to the widespread existence of heterogeneous data in the real world, resulting in performance vulnerability when noise distributions vary. We propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic framework to boost causal discovery performance by dynamically learning the adaptive weights for the Reweighted Score function, ReScore for short, where the learned weights tailors quantitatively to the important degree of each samples. Intuitively, we leverage the bilevel optimization scheme to alternatively train a standard DAG learner first, then upweight the samples that the DAG learner fails to fit well and downweight the samples that the DAG learner easily extracts the causation information from. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets are carried out to validate the effectiveness of ReScore. We observe consistent and significant boosts in structure learning performance. We further visualize that ReScore concurrently mitigates the influence of spurious edges and generalizes to heterogeneous data. Finally, we perform theoretical analysis to guarantee the structure identifiability and the weight adaptive properties of ReScore. Our codes are available at https://github.com/anzhang314/ReScore."}}

However, existing efforts mainly focus on the OOD issue of correlation shift. While another type, covariate shift, remains largely unexplored but is the focus of this work. From a data generation view, causal features are stable substructures in data, which play key roles in OOD generalization. While their complementary parts, environments, are unstable features that often lead to various distribution shifts. Correlation shift establishes spurious statistical correlations between environments and labels. In contrast, covariate shift means that there exist unseen environmental features in test data. Existing strategies of graph invariant learning and data augmentation suffer from limited environments or unstable causal features, which greatly limits their generalization ability on covariate shift. In view of that, we propose a novel graph augmentation strategy: Adversarial Causal Augmentation (AdvCA), to alleviate the covariate shift. Specifically, it adversarially augments the data to explore diverse distributions of the environments. Meanwhile, it keeps the causal features invariant across diverse environments. It maintains the environmental diversity while ensuring the invariance of the causal features, thereby effectively alleviating the covariate shift. Extensive experimental results with in-depth analyses demonstrate that AdvCA can outperform 14 baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets with various covariate shifts."}}

Existing work mostly follows the two-phase paradigm to interpret a prediction: feature attribution and selection. However, another important component --- regularization, which is crucial to facilitate the above paradigm --- has been seldom studied. In this work, we explore the role of regularization in GNNs explainability from the perspective of information theory. Our main findings are: 1) regularization is essentially pursuing the balance between two phases, 2) its optimal coefficient is proportional to the sparsity of explanations, 3) existing methods imply an implicit regularization effect of stochastic mechanism, and 4) its contradictory effects on two phases are responsible for the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue in post-hoc explainability. Based on these findings, we propose two common optimization methods, which can bolster the performance of the current explanation methods via sparsity-adaptive and OOD-resistant regularization schemes. Extensive empirical studies validate our findings and proposed methods. Code is available at  https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Rethink_Reg-07F0.\n"}}

Despite the promising performance, invariance worsens representation when augmentations cause aggressive semantics shifts. For example, dropping the super-node can dramatically change a social network's topology. In this case, encouraging invariance to the original graph can bring together dissimilar patterns and hurt the task of instance discrimination. To resolve the problem, we get inspiration from equivariant self-supervised learning and propose Equivariant Graph Contrastive Learning (E-GCL) to encourage the sensitivity to global semantic shifts. Viewing each graph as a transformation to others, we ground the equivariance principle as a cross-graph augmentation -- graph interpolation -- to simulate global semantic shifts. Without using annotation, we supervise the representation of cross-graph augmented views by linearly combining the representations of their original samples. This simple but effective equivariance principle empowers E-GCL with the ability of cross-graph discrimination. It shows significant improvements over the state-of-the-art GCL models in unsupervised learning and transfer learning. Further experiments demonstrate E-GCL's generalization to various graph pre-training frameworks. Code is available at \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/E-GCL/}"}}

However, most current debiasing strategies are prone to playing a trade-off game between head and tail performance, thus inevitably degrading the overall recommendation accuracy. To reduce the negative impact of popularity bias on CF models, we incorporate Bias-aware margins into Contrastive loss and propose a simple yet effective BC Loss, where the margin tailors quantitatively to the bias degree of each user-item interaction. We investigate the geometric interpretation of BC loss, then further visualize and theoretically prove that it simultaneously learns better head and tail representations by encouraging the compactness of similar users/items and enlarging the dispersion of dissimilar users/items. Over six benchmark datasets, we use BC loss to optimize two high-performing CF models. In various evaluation settings (i.e., imbalanced/balanced, temporal split, fully-observed unbiased, tail/head test evaluations), BC loss outperforms the state-of-the-art debiasing and non-debiasing methods with remarkable improvements. Considering the theoretical guarantee and empirical success of BC loss, we advocate using it not just as a debiasing strategy, but also as a standard loss in recommender models.

Unfortunately, the leading rationalization models often rely on data biases, especially shortcut features, to compose rationales and make predictions without probing the critical and causal patterns. Moreover, such data biases easily change outside the training distribution. As a result, these models suffer from a huge drop in interpretability and predictive performance on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we propose a new strategy of discovering invariant rationale (DIR) to construct intrinsically interpretable GNNs. It conducts interventions on the training distribution to create multiple interventional distributions. Then it approaches the causal rationales that are invariant across different distributions while filtering out the spurious patterns that are unstable.
