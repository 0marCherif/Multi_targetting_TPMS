The utterances were collected from 222 hospital staff members, including physicians, nurses, and insurance review and health records teams. To construct the QA dataset on structured EHR data, we conducted a poll at a university hospital and used the responses to create seed questions. We then manually linked these questions to two open-source EHR databases, MIMIC-III and eICU, and included various time expressions and held-out unanswerable questions in the dataset, which were also collected from the poll. Our dataset poses a unique set of challenges: the model needs to 1) generate SQL queries that reflect a wide range of needs in the hospital, including simple retrieval and complex operations such as calculating survival rate, 2) understand various time expressions to answer time-sensitive questions in healthcare, and 3) distinguish whether a given question is answerable or unanswerable. We believe our dataset, EHRSQL, can serve as a practical benchmark for developing and assessing QA models on structured EHR data and take a step further towards bridging the gap between text-to-SQL research and its real-life deployment in healthcare. EHRSQL is available at https://github.com/glee4810/EHRSQL."}}

Unlike traditional stochastic processes (e.g., Gaussian processes), which require specifying explicit kernel functions, NPs implicitly learn kernel functions appropriate for a given task through observed data. While this data-driven learning of stochastic processes has been shown to model various types of data, the current NPs' implicit treatment of the mean and the covariance of the output variables limits its full potential when the underlying distribution of the given data is highly complex. To address this, we introduce a new neural stochastic processes, Decoupled Kernel Neural Processes (DKNPs), which explicitly learn a separate mean and kernel function to directly model the covariance between output variables in a data-driven manner. By estimating kernel functions with self- and mixed attentive neural networks, DKNPs demonstrate improved uncertainty estimation in terms of conditional likelihood and diversity in generated samples in 1-D and 2-D regression tasks, compared to other concurrent NP variants. Also, maintaining explicit kernel functions, a key component of stochastic processes, allows the model to reveal a deeper understanding of underlying distributions."}}
