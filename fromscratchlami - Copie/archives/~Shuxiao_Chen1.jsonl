We show that TAWT is easy to implement, is computationally efficient, requires little hyperparameter tuning, and enjoys non-asymptotic learning-theoretic guarantees. The effectiveness of TAWT is corroborated through extensive experiments with BERT on four sequence tagging tasks in natural language processing (NLP), including part-of-speech (PoS) tagging, chunking, predicate detection, and named entity recognition (NER). As a byproduct, the proposed representation-based task distance allows one to reason in a theoretically principled way about several critical aspects of cross-task learning, such as the choice of the source data and the impact of fine-tuning."}}

It is common practice to (1) identify and remove outliers by looking at the data and (2) to fit OLS and form confidence intervals and p-values on the remaining data as if this were the original data collected. This standard \u201cdetect-and-forget\u201d approach has been shown to be problematic, and in this paper we highlight the fact that it can lead to invalid inference and show how recently developed tools in selective inference can be used to properly account for outlier detection and removal. Our inferential procedures apply to a general class of outlier removal procedures that includes several of the most commonly used approaches. We conduct simulations to corroborate the theoretical results, and we apply our method to three real data sets to illustrate how our inferential results can differ from the traditional detect-and-forget strategy. A companion R package, outference, implements these new procedures with an interface that matches the functions commonly used for inference with lm in R."}}

In this paper, we introduce federated $f$-differential privacy, a new notion specifically tailored to the federated setting, based on the framework of Gaussian differential privacy. Federated $f$-differential privacy operates on record level: it provides the privacy guarantee on each individual record of one client's data against adversaries. We then propose a generic private federated learning framework {PriFedSync} that accommodates a large family of state-of-the-art FL algorithms, which provably achieves federated $f$-differential privacy. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the trade-off between privacy guarantee and prediction performance for models trained by {PriFedSync} in computer vision tasks."}}

In this work, we develop a framework of estimating properly defined \"optimal\" DTRs with a time-varying instrumental variable (IV) when unmeasured covariates confound the treatment and outcome, rendering the potential outcome distributions only partially identified. We derive a novel Bellman equation under partial identification, use it to define a generic class of estimands (termed IV-optimal DTRs), and study the associated estimation problem. We then extend the IV-optimality framework to tackle the policy improvement problem, delivering IV-improved DTRs that are guaranteed to perform no worse and potentially better than a pre-specified baseline DTR. Importantly, our IV-improvement framework opens up the possibility of strictly improving upon DTRs that are optimal under the no unmeasured confounding assumption (NUCA). We demonstrate via extensive simulations the superior performance of IV-optimal and IV-improved DTRs over the DTRs that are optimal only under the NUCA. In a real data example, we embed retrospective observational registry data into a natural, two-stage experiment with noncompliance using a time-varying IV and estimate useful IV-optimal DTRs that assign mothers to high-level or low-level neonatal intensive care units based on their prognostic variables."}}

In this paper, we show how the excess risks of personalized federated learning with a smooth, strongly convex loss depend on data heterogeneity from a minimax point of view. Our analysis reveals a surprising theorem of the alternative for personalized federated learning: there exists a threshold such that (a) if a certain measure of data heterogeneity is below this threshold, the FedAvg algorithm [McMahan et al., 2017] is minimax optimal; (b) when the measure of heterogeneity is above this threshold, then doing pure local training (i.e., clients solve empirical risk minimization problems on their local datasets without any communication) is minimax optimal. As an implication, our results show that the presumably difficult (infinite-dimensional) problem of adapting to client-wise heterogeneity can be reduced to a simple binary decision problem of choosing between the two baseline algorithms. Our analysis relies on a new notion of algorithmic stability that takes into account the nature of federated learning."}}

Such datasets can be modeled by multilayer networks where each layer is a separate network itself while different layers are associated and share some common information. The present paper studies community detection in a stylized yet informative inhomogeneous multilayer network model. In our model, layers are generated by different stochastic block models, the community structures of which are (random) perturbations of a common global structure while the connecting probabilities in different layers are not related. Focusing on the symmetric two block case, we establish minimax rates for both global estimation of the common structure and individualized estimation of layer-wise community structures. Both minimax rates have sharp exponents. In addition, we provide an efficient algorithm that is simultaneously asymptotic minimax optimal for both estimation tasks under mild conditions. The optimal rates depend on the parity of the number of most informative layers, a phenomenon that is caused by inhomogeneity across layers. The method is extended to handle multiple and potentially asymmetric community cases. We demonstrate its effectiveness on both simulated examples and a real multi-modal single-cell dataset."}}

However, these transformations are often chosen heuristically and a clear theoretical framework to explain the performance benefits of data augmentation is not available. In this paper, we develop such a framework to explain data augmentation as averaging over the orbits of the group that keeps the data distribution approximately invariant, and show that it leads to variance reduction. We study finite-sample and asymptotic empirical risk minimization and work out as examples the variance reduction in certain two-layer neural networks. We further propose a strategy to exploit the benefits of data augmentation for general learning tasks."}}
