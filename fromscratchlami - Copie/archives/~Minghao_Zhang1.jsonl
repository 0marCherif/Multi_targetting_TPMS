Most existing methods only focus on reconstructing the 3D shape geometry based on image constraints. The lack of explicit modeling of structure relations among shape parts yields low-quality reconstruction results for structure-rich man-made shapes. In addition, conventional 2D-3D joint embedding architecture for image-based 3D shape reconstruction often omits the specific view information from the given image, which may lead to degraded geometry and structure reconstruction. We address these problems by introducing VGSNet, an encoder-decoder architecture for view-aware joint geometry and structure learning. The key idea is to jointly learn a multimodal feature representation of 2D image, 3D shape geometry and structure so that both geometry and structure details can be reconstructed from a single-view image. To this end, we explicitly represent 3D shape structures as part relations and employ image supervision to guide the geometry and structure reconstruction. Trained with pairs of view-aligned images and 3D shapes, the VGSNet implicitly encodes the view-aware shape information in the latent feature space. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with the state-of-the-art baseline methods as well as ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the VGSNet for structure-aware single-view 3D shape reconstruction."}}

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising paradigm for agile locomotion skills with vision inputs in simulation, it is still very challenging to deploy the RL policy in the real world. Our key insight is that aside from the discrepancy in the domain gap, in visual appearance between the simulation and the real world, the latency from the control pipeline is also a major cause of difficulty. In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR) to address this issue when training RL agents. Specifically, we simulate the latency of real hardware by using past observations, sampled with randomized periods, for both proprioception and vision. We train the RL policy for end-to-end control in a physical simulator without any predefined controller or reference motion, and directly deploy it on the real A1 quadruped robot running in the wild. We evaluate our method in different outdoor environments with complex terrains and obstacles. We demonstrate the robot can smoothly maneuver at a high speed, avoid the obstacles, and show significant improvement over the baselines.

Such challenging tasks can be decomposed into sub-tasks that are accomplishable by different robots concurrently or sequentially for better efficiency. While previous reinforcement learning approaches primarily focus on modeling the compositionality of sub-tasks, two fundamental issues are largely ignored particularly when learning cooperative strategies for two robots: (i) domination, i.e., one robot may try to solve a task by itself and leaves the other idle; (ii) conflict, i.e., one robot can interrupt another's workspace when executing different sub-tasks simultaneously, which leads to unsafe collisions. To tackle these two issues, we propose a novel technique called disentangled attention, which provides an intrinsic regularization for two robots to focus on separate sub-tasks and objects. We evaluate our method on five bimanual manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed intrinsic regularization successfully avoids domination and reduces conflicts for the policies, which leads to significantly more efficient and safer cooperative strategies than all the baselines.
