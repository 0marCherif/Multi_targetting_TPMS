Attribution maps from a trained classifier are widely used to provide pixel-level localization, but their focus tends to be restricted to a small discriminative region of the target object. An AdvCAM is an attribution map of an image that is manipulated to increase the classification score produced by a classifier before the final softmax or sigmoid layer. This manipulation is realized in an anti-adversarial manner, so that the original image is perturbed along pixel gradients in directions opposite to those used in an adversarial attack. This process enhances non-discriminative yet class-relevant features, which make an insufficient contribution to previous attribution maps, so that the resulting AdvCAM identifies more regions of the target object. In addition, we introduce a new regularization procedure that inhibits the incorrect attribution of regions unrelated to the target object and the excessive concentration of attributions on a small region of the target object. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in weakly and semi-supervised semantic segmentation, on both the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets. In weakly supervised object localization, it achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-1K datasets."}}

To improve accuracy and energy efficiency of SNNs, most previous studies have focused solely on training methods, and the effect of architecture has rarely been studied. We investigate the design choices used in the previous studies in terms of the accuracy and number of spikes and figure out that they are not best-suited for SNNs. To further improve the accuracy and reduce the spikes generated by SNNs, we propose a spike-aware neural architecture search framework called AutoSNN. We define a search space consisting of architectures without undesirable design choices. To enable the spike-aware architecture search, we introduce a fitness that considers both the accuracy and number of spikes. AutoSNN successfully searches for SNN architectures that outperform hand-crafted SNNs in accuracy and energy efficiency. We thoroughly demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoSNN on various datasets including neuromorphic datasets."}}

Among a plethora of efforts to bypass training of each candidate architecture to convergence for evaluation, the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) is emerging as a promising theoretical framework that can be utilized to estimate the performance of a neural architecture at initialization. In this work, we revisit several at-initialization metrics that can be derived from the NTK and reveal their key short-comings. Then, through the empirical analysis of the time evolution of NTK, we deduce that modern neural architectures exhibit highly non-linear characteristics, making the NTK-based metrics incapable of reliably estimating the performance of an architecture without some amount of training. To take such non-linear characteristics into account, we introduce Label-Gradient Alignment (LGA), a novel NTK-based metric whose inherent formulation allows it to capture the large amount of non-linear advantage present in modern neural architectures. With minimal amount of training, LGA obtains a meaningful level of rank correlation with the final test accuracy of an architecture. Lastly, we demonstrate that LGA, complemented with few epochs of training, successfully guides existing search algorithms to achieve competitive search performances with significantly less search cost.

Their predictions, however, are prone to be corrupted by adversarial examples that are imperceptible to humans. Current efforts to improve the robustness of neural networks against adversarial examples are focused on developing robust training methods, which update the weights of a neural network in a more robust direction. In this work, we take a step beyond training of the weight parameters and consider the problem of designing an adversarially robust neural architecture with high intrinsic robustness. We propose AdvRush, a novel adversarial robustness-aware neural architecture search algorithm, based upon a finding that independent of the training method, the intrinsic robustness of a neural network can be represented with the smoothness of its input loss landscape. Through a regularizer that favors a candidate architecture with a smoother input loss landscape, AdvRush successfully discovers an adversarially robust neural architecture. Along with a comprehensive theoretical motivation for AdvRush, we conduct an extensive amount of experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of AdvRush on various benchmark datasets. Notably, on CIFAR-10, AdvRush achieves 55.91% robust accuracy under FGSM attack after standard training and 50.04% robust accuracy under AutoAttack after 7-step PGD adversarial training."}}
