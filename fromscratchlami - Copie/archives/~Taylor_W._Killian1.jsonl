One cause of model failure is distribution shift, where the training and test data distributions differ. In this paper we investigate the benefits of training models using methods which are algorithmically stable towards improving model robustness, motivated by recent theoretical developments which show a connection between the two.  We use techniques from differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) to control the level of algorithmic stability during training. We compare the performance of algorithmically stable training procedures to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) across a variety of possible distribution shifts - specifically covariate, label, and subpopulation shifts. We find that models trained with algorithmically stable procedures result in models with consistently lower generalization gap across various types of shifts and shift severities. as well as a higher absolute test performance in label shift. Finally, we demonstrate that there is there is a tradeoff between distributional robustness, stability, and performance."}}

In practice, successful RL relies on informative latent states derived from sequential observations to develop optimal treatment strategies. To date, how best to construct such states in a healthcare setting is an open question. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of several information encoding architectures using data from septic patients in the MIMIC-III dataset to form representations of a patient state. We evaluate the impact of representation dimension, correlations with established acuity scores, and the treatment policies derived from them. We find that sequentially formed state representations facilitate effective policy learning in batch settings, validating a more thoughtful approach to representation learning that remains faithful to the sequential and partial nature of healthcare data."}}

In this paper, we propose a method for off-policy transfer by modeling the underlying generative process with a causal mechanism. We use informative priors from the source domain to augment counterfactual trajectories in the target in a principled manner. We demonstrate how this addresses data-scarcity in the presence of unobserved confounding. The causal parametrization of our sampling procedure guarantees that counterfactual quantities can be estimated from scarce observational target data, maintaining intuitive stability properties. Policy learning in the target domain is further regularized via the source policy through KL-divergence. Through evaluation on a simulated sepsis treatment task, our counterfactual policy transfer procedure significantly improves the performance of a learned treatment policy when assumptions of \"no-unobserved confounding\" are relaxed."}}

An EDSS measurement contains an overall \"EDSS\" score and several functional subscores. Typically, expert knowledge is required to interpret consult notes and generate these scores. Previous approaches used limited context length Word2Vec embeddings and keyword searches to predict scores given a consult note, but often failed when scores were not explicitly stated. In this work, we present MS-BERT, the first publicly available transformer model trained on real clinical data other than MIMIC. Next, we present MSBC, a classifier that applies MS-BERT to generate embeddings and predict EDSS and functional subscores. Lastly, we explore combining MSBC with other models through the use of Snorkel to generate scores for unlabelled consult notes. MSBC achieves state-of-the-art performance on all metrics and prediction tasks and outperforms the models generated from the Snorkel ensemble. We improve Macro-F1 by 0.12 (to 0.88) for predicting EDSS and on average by 0.29 (to 0.63) for predicting functional subscores over previous Word2Vec CNN and rule-based approaches."}}
