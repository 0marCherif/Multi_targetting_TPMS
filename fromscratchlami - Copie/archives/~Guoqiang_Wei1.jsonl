Therefore, learning causal features that are free of interference from confounders is important. Most previous causal learning based approaches employ back-door criterion to mitigate the adverse effect of certain specific confounder, which require the explicit identification of confounder. However, in real scenarios, confounders are typically diverse and difficult to be identified. In this paper, we propose a novel Confounder Identification-free Causal Visual Feature Learning (CICF) method, which obviates the need for identifying confounders. CICF models the interventions among different samples based on front-door criterion, and then approximates the global-scope intervening effect upon the instance-level interventions from the perspective of optimization. In this way, we aim to find a reliable optimization direction, which avoids the intervening effects of confounders, to learn causal features. Furthermore, we uncover the relation between CICF and the popular meta-learning strategy MAML, and provide an interpretation of why MAML works from the theoretical perspective of causal learning for the first time. Thanks to the effective learning of causal features, our CICF enables models to have superior generalization capability. Extensive experiments on domain generalization benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our CICF, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance."}}

The three existing dominant network families, i.e., CNNs, Transformers and MLPs, differ from each other mainly in the ways to fuse contextual information into a given token, leaving the design of more effective token-mixing mechanisms at the core of backbone architecture development. In ActiveMLP, we propose an innovative token-mixer, dubbed Active Token Mixer (ATM), to actively incorporate contextual information from other tokens in the global scope into the given one. This fundamental operator actively predicts where to capture useful contexts and learns how to fuse the captured contexts with the original information of the given token at channel levels. In this way, the spatial range of token-mixing is expanded and the way of token-mixing is reformed. With this design, ActiveMLP is endowed with the merits of global receptive fields and more flexible content-adaptive information fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActiveMLP is generally applicable and comprehensively surpasses different families of SOTA vision backbones by a clear margin on a broad range of vision tasks, including visual recognition and dense prediction tasks.

This is a challenging task, as the images to be matched are generally semantically misaligned due to the diversity of human poses and capture viewpoints, incompleteness of the visible bodies (due to occlusion), etc. In this paper, we propose a framework that drives the reID network to learn semantics-aligned feature representation through delicate supervision designs. Specifically, we build a Semantics Aligning Network (SAN) which consists of a base network as encoder (SA-Enc) for re-ID, and a decoder (SA-Dec) for reconstructing/regressing the densely semantics aligned full texture image. We jointly train the SAN under the supervisions of person re-identification and aligned texture generation. Moreover, at the decoder, besides the reconstruction loss, we add Triplet ReID constraints over the feature maps as the perceptual losses. The decoder is discarded in the inference and thus our scheme is computationally efficient. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. We achieve the state-of-the-art performances on the benchmark datasets CUHK03, Market1501, MSMT17, and the partial person reID dataset Partial REID."}}

However, the diversity of capturing viewpoints and the flexibility of the human poses remain some significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a view-invariant 3D human pose estimation module to alleviate the effects of viewpoint diversity. The proposed framework consists of a base network, which provides an initial estimation of a 3D pose, a view-invariant hierarchical correction network (VI-HC) on top of that to learn the 3D pose refinement under consistent views, and a view-invariant discriminative network (VID) to enforce high-level constraints over body configurations. In VI-HC, the initial 3D pose inputs are automatically transformed to consistent views for further refinements at the global body and local body parts level, respectively. For the VID, under consistent viewpoints, we use adversarial learning to differentiate between estimated 3D poses and real 3D poses to avoid implausible results. The experimental results demonstrate that the constraint on viewpoint consistency can dramatically enhance the performance of 3D human pose estimation. Our module shows robustness for different 3D pose base networks and achieves a significant improvement (about 9%) over a powerful baseline on the public 3D pose estimation benchmark Human3.6M."}}
