In this paper, we develop an unsupervised density reconstruction model for multi-dimensional time-series anomaly detection. In particular, it directly handles an important realistic setting that the detection is achieved towards raw time-series contaminated with noise for training, in contrast to most existing anomaly detection works that assume the training data is in general clean i.e., not contaminated with anomaly. It extends recent advancements in deep generative models and state space models to achieve robust anomaly detection. Our approach comprises of a novel state space based generative model, a filtering based inference model, together with a carefully-designated emission model based on robust statistics theory. Extensive experimental results are conducted to show that our approach can adapt to complex patterns even given severely contaminated training data. We also develop visualization techniques to help better understand the behavior of the anomaly detection models. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-arts on both synthetic and real-world datasets."}}

Although Transformer-based methods have significantly improved state-of-the-art results for long-term forecasting, they are not only computationally expensive but more importantly, are unable to capture the global view of time series (e.g. overall trend). To address these problems, we propose to combine Transformer with the seasonal-trend decomposition method, in which the decomposition method captures the global profile of time series while Transformers capture more detailed structures. To further enhance the performance of Transformer for long-term prediction, we exploit the fact that most time series tend to have a sparse representation in a well-known basis such as Fourier transform, and develop a frequency enhanced Transformer. Besides being more effective, the proposed method, termed as Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer (FEDformer), is more efficient than standard Transformer with a linear complexity to the sequence length. Our empirical studies with six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, Fedformer can reduce prediction error by 14.8% and 22.6% for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a robust and effective periodicity detection algorithm for time series with block missing data. We first design a robust trend filter to remove the interference of complicated trend patterns under missing data. Then, we propose a robust autocorrelation function (ACF) that can handle missing values and outliers effectively. We rigorously prove that the proposed robust ACF can still work well when the length of the missing block is less than $1/3$ of the period length. Last, by combining the time-frequency information, our algorithm can generate the period length accurately. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing periodicity detection algorithms on real-world time series datasets."}}

The Transformer architecture has achieved competitive performance on graph-level prediction by introducing general graphic embedding.

In this paper, inspired by the intrinsic properties of chemical molecules, we propose a chemistry-guided molecular graph Transformer. Specifically, motif-based spatial embedding and distance-guided multi-scale self-attention for graph Transformer are proposed to predict molecular property effectively. To evaluate the proposed methods, we have conducted experiments on two large molecular property prediction datasets, ZINC, and PCQM4M-LSC.

Firstly, how to effectively learn the temporal dependency in time series remains a challenge. Secondly, diverse and complicated anomalous subsequences as well as the lack of labels make accurate detection difficult. For example, the popular subsequence anomaly detection algorithm---time series discord---fails to handle recurring anomalies. Thirdly, many existing algorithms require a proper subsequence length for effective detection, which is difficult or impossible in practice.  In this paper, we present a novel approach to subsequence anomaly detection which combines practical heuristics of time series discords and temporal relationships with deep neural networks. By performing length selection considering multi-scale information and incorporating prior knowledge using graph neural networks, our method can adaptively learn the appropriate subsequence length as well as integrated representations from both priors and raw data favorable to anomaly detection. In particular, our graph incorporates both semantic and temporal relationships between subsequences. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which achieves superior performance on multiple time series anomaly benchmarks in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms."}}

In practice, the next-event prediction models are trained with sequential data collected at one time and need to generalize to newly arrived sequences in remote future, which requires models to handle temporal distribution shift from training to testing. In this paper, we first take a data-generating perspective to reveal a negative result that existing approaches with maximum likelihood estimation would fail for distribution shift due to the latent context confounder, i.e., the common cause for the historical events and the next event. Then we devise a new learning objective based on backdoor adjustment and further harness variational inference to make it tractable for sequence learning problems. On top of that, we propose a framework with hierarchical branching structures for learning context-specific representations. Comprehensive experiments on diverse tasks (e.g., sequential recommendation) demonstrate the effectiveness, applicability and scalability of our method with various off-the-shelf models as backbones.

Addressing this allows better utilization of the capabilities of deep learning models. To this end, we design a Frequency improved Legendre Memory model, or FiLM: it applies Legendre polynomial projections to approximate historical information, uses Fourier projection to remove noise, and adds a low-rank approximation to speed up computation. Our empirical studies show that the proposed FiLM significantly improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art models in multivariate and univariate long-term forecasting by (19.2%, 22.6%), respectively.

In addition, as more time series data are collected and stored, how to handle the huge amount of data efficiently is crucial in many applications. We note that these significant challenges exist in various tasks like forecasting, anomaly detection, and fault cause localization. Therefore, how to design effective and efficient time series models for different tasks, which are robust to address the aforementioned challenging patterns and noise in real-world scenarios, is of great theoretical and practical interests. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive and organized tutorial on the state-of-the-art algorithms of robust time series analysis, ranging from traditional statistical methods to the most recent deep learning based methods. We will not only introduce the principle of time series algorithms, but also provide insights into how to apply them effectively in practical real-world industrial applications. Specifically, we organize the tutorial in a bottom-up framework. We first present preliminaries from different disciplines including robust statistics, signal processing, optimization, and deep learning. Then, we identify and discuss those most-frequently processing blocks in robust time series analysis, including periodicity detection, trend filtering, seasonal-trend decomposition, and time series similarity.
