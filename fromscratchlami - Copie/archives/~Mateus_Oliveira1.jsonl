In this work, we introduce the notion of second-order finite automata, a formalism that combines finite automata with ordered decision diagrams, with the aim of representing possibly infinite sets of sets of strings. Our main result states that second-order finite automata can be canonized with respect to the second-order languages they represent. Using this canonization result, we show that sets of sets of strings represented by second-order finite automata are closed under the usual Boolean operations, such as union, intersection, difference and even under a suitable notion of complementation. Additionally, emptiness of intersection and inclusion are decidable. We provide two algorithmic applications for second-order automata. First, we show that several width/size minimization problems for deterministic and nondeterministic ODDs are solvable in fixed-parameter tractable time when parameterized by the width of the input ODD. In particular, our results imply FPT algorithms for corresponding width/size minimization problems for ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs) with a fixed variable ordering. Previously, only algorithms that take exponential time in the size of the input OBDD were known for width minimization, even for OBDDs of constant width. Second, we show that for each k and w one can count the number of distinct functions computable by ODDs of width at most w and length k in time h(|\u03a3|,w) \u22c5 kO(1), for a suitable h : \u2115 \u00d7 \u2115 \u2192 \u2115 $h:\\mathbb {N}\\times \\mathbb {N}\\rightarrow \\mathbb {N}$ . This improves exponentially on the time necessary to explicitly enumerate all such functions, which is exponential in both the width parameter w and in the length k of the ODDs."}}

This formalism is abstract enough to be analyzed using theoretical tools, and at the same time, concrete enough to eliminate ambiguities that would arise at implementation level. One interesting feature of Petri nets is that they can be studied from the point of view of true concurrency, where causal scenarios are specified using partial orders, instead of approaches based on interleaving. On the other hand, message sequence chart (MSC) languages, are a standard formalism for the specification of causality from a purely behavioral perspective. In other words, this formalism specifies a set of causal scenarios between actions of a system, without providing any implementation-level details about the system. In this work, we establish several new connections between MSC languages and Petri nets, and show that several computational problems involving these formalisms are decidable. Our results fill some gaps in the literature that had been open for several years. To obtain our results we develop new techniques in the realm of slice automata theory, a framework introduced one decade ago in the study of the partial order behavior of bounded Petri nets. These techniques can also be applied to establish connections between Petri nets and other well studied behavioral formalisms, such as the notion of Mazurkiewicz trace languages."}}

By consistency, we mean that $A$ accepts all strings in $P$ and rejects all strings in $N$. It is well known that this problem is NP-complete. In the literature, it is stated that this NP-hardness holds even in the case of a binary alphabet. As a standard reference for this theorem, the work of Gold from 1978 is either cited or adapted. But as a crucial detail, the work of Gold actually considered Mealy machines and not deterministic finite state automata (DFAs) as they are considered nowadays. As Mealy automata are equipped with an output function, they can be more compact than DFAs which accept the same language. We show that the adaptions of Gold's construction for Mealy machines stated in the literature have some issues and give a new construction for DFAs with a binary alphabet ourselves."}}

In this work, we introduce a general framework to convert a large class of width-based model-checking algorithms into algorithms that can be used to test the validity of graph-theoretic conjectures on classes of graphs of bounded width. Our framework is modular and can be applied with respect to several well-studied width measures for graphs, including treewidth and cliquewidth. As a quantitative application of our framework, we show that for several long-standing graph-theoretic conjectures, there exists an algorithm that takes a number $k$ as input and correctly determines in time double-exponential in $k^{O(1)}$ whether the conjecture is valid on all graphs of treewidth at most $k$. This improves significantly on upper bounds obtained using previously available techniques."}}

Building on our technique to establish decidability of mortality for , we show that the edge-to-edge reachability problem for these systems is also decidable. In this way we solve the edge-to-edge reachability case of an open problem due to Asarin, Mysore, Pnueli and Schneider [4]. This implies that the interval-to-interval version of the classical open problem of reachability for regular piecewise affine maps (PAMs) is also decidable. In other words, point-to-point reachability for regular PAMs can be effectively approximated with arbitrarily precision."}}

In this work, we push forward the study of grid CSPs by analyzing, from an experimental perspective, a symbolic parameter called smoothness. More specifically, we implement an algorithm that provably works in polynomial time on grids of polynomial smoothness. Subsequently, we compare our algorithm with standard combinatorial optimization techniques, such as SAT-solving and integer linear programming (ILP). For this comparison, we use a class of grid-CSPs encoding the pigeonhole principle. We demonstrate, empirically, that these CSPs have polynomial smoothness and that our algorithm terminates in polynomial time. On the other hand, as strong evidence that the grid-like encoding is not destroying the essence of the pigeonhole principle, we show that the standard propositional translation of pigeonhole CSPs remains hard for state-of-the-art SAT solvers, such as minisat and glucose, and even to state-of-the-art integer linear-programming solvers, such as Coin-OR CBC."}}

By consistency, we mean that A accepts all strings in $$P$$ and rejects all strings in $$N$$ . It is well known that this problem is NP-hard when parameterized only by the number of states of the automaton. Therefore, our analysis takes a more refined parameterization: we consider the number k of states in A, the size $$|\\varSigma |$$ of the alphabet, the maximum size l of a string in $$P\\cup N$$ , and the number $$c=|P\\cup N|$$ of strings in both sets. First, we prove several Pvs. NP-hard dichotomy results for these parameters when the learned automaton is drawn from different classes of finite automata. One of our dichotomy results closes a gap for the general DFA consistency problem, as here, for fixed alphabet size, the NP-hardness proofs in the literature have some issues. Interestingly, our NP-hardness results hold even for severely restricted classes of automata, such as partially-ordered automata and permutation automata. On the other hand, we provide parameterized algorithms for several combinations of parameters and show that most of them are optimal under the exponential time hypothesis."}}

A recent trend of research in artificial intelligence, called solution diversity, has focused on the development of notions of optimality that may be more appropriate in settings where subjectivity is essential. The idea is that instead of aiming at the development of algorithms that output a single optimal solution, the goal is to investigate algorithms that output a small set of sufficiently good solutions that are sufficiently diverse from one another. In this way, the user has the opportunity to choose the solution that is most appropriate to the context at hand. It also displays the richness of the solution space. When combined with techniques from parameterized complexity theory, the paradigm of diversity of solutions offers a powerful algorithmic framework to address problems of practical relevance. In this work, we investigate the impact of this combination in the field of Kemeny Rank Aggregation, a well-studied class of problems lying in the intersection of order theory and social choice theory and also in the field of order theory itself. In particular, we show that KRA is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to natural parameters providing natural formalizations of the notions of diversity and of the notion of a sufficiently good solution. Our main results work both when considering the traditional setting of aggregation over linearly ordered votes, and in the more general setting where votes are partially ordered."}}
