In approximately one-third of this population, anti-seizure medications do not control seizures. Many patients pursue surgical treatment that can include a procedure involving the implantation of electrodes for intracranial monitoring of seizure activity. For these cases, accurate mapping of the implanted electrodes on a patient\u2019s brain is crucial in planning the ultimate surgical treatment. Traditionally, electrode mapping results are presented in static figures that do not allow for dynamic interactions and visualizations. In collaboration with a clinical research team at a Level 4 Epilepsy Center, we developed N-Tools-Browser, a web-based software using WebGL and the X-Toolkit (XTK), to help clinicians interactively visualize the location and functional properties of implanted intracranial electrodes in 3D. Our software allows the user to visualize the seizure focus location accurately and simultaneously display functional characteristics (e.g., results from electrical stimulation mapping). Different visualization modes enable the analysis of multiple electrode groups or individual anatomical locations. We deployed a prototype of N-Tools-Browser for our collaborators at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. Then, we evaluated its usefulness with domain experts on clinical cases."}}

While this methodology has proved feasible and fruitful for decades, there is a need to move toward studies that leverage unstructured and naturalistic behaviors to reveal the statistical and dynamic structure of neural activity when it is not constrained to a controlled experimental setting. Here we employ a data-driven approach that shows how various signal features of high gamma band activity recorded from electrocorticography (ECoG) and stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) can differentiate naturalistic behavioral states. These signal features include both static and dynamic aspects of the spatiotemporal neural activity. Dynamic spatiotemporal patterns extracted from high gamma band activity span multiple time scales, have a global-brain spatial representation, and better fit the data in comparison to non-dynamic approaches. These patterns individually and collectively contain valuable information differentiating between naturalistic behavioral states. This work shows that neural activity in a naturalistic setting has multiple axes of variability that must be taken into consideration in the study of the neural basis of unstructured behaviors."}}

PGES is an epoch of EEG inactivity after a seizure, and the detection of PGES in clinical data is extremely difficult due to artifacts from breathing, movement and muscle activity that can adversely affect the quality of the recorded EEG data. Even clinical experts visually interpreting the EEG will have diverse opinions on the start and end of PGES for a given patient. The development of an automated EEG suppression detection tool can assist clinical personnel in the review and annotation of seizure files, and can also provide a standard for quantifying PGES in large patient cohorts, possibly leading to further clarification of the role of PGES as a biomarker of SUDEP risk. In this paper, we develop an automated system that can detect the start and end of PGES using frequency domain features in combination with boosting classification algorithms. The average power for different frequency ranges of EEG signals are extracted from the prefiltered recorded signal using the fast fourier transform and are used as the feature set for the classification algorithm. The underlying classifiers for the boosting algorithm are linear classifiers using a logistic regression model. The tool is developed using 12 seizures annotated by an expert then tested and evaluated on another 20 seizures that were annotated by 11 experts."}}

This system provides RGB-D audio-video synchronized with patient electrocorticography (ECoG), which records neural activity across cortex. We propose an automated approach to studying the human brain in a naturalistic setting. We demonstrate coarse functional mapping of ECoG electrodes correlated to contralateral arm movements. Motor electrode mapping was generated by analyzing continuous movement data recorded over several hours from epilepsy patients in hospital rooms. From these recordings we estimate the kinematics of patient hand movement behaviors using computer vision algorithms. We compare movement behaviors to neural data collected from ECoG, specifically high-\u03b3 (70-110 Hz) spectral features. We present a functional map of electrode responses to natural arm movements, generated using a statistical test. We demonstrate that our approach has the potential to aid in the development of automated functional brain mapping using continuous video and neural recordings of patients in clinical settings."}}

In our approach, Hidden-Markov Factor Analysis (HMFA), a finite set of factor analyzers are used to model the relationship between the high-dimensional ECoG neural space and a low-dimensional latent neural space; the factor analyzers at different time points are in turn linked together with a hidden Markov model. The recorded ECoG signals were band-pass filtered such that our analysis was focused on a sub-band (76-100Hz) of high gamma. HMFA affords the quantization of the ECoG neural space and dimensionality reduction in a common probabilistic space. We applied this method to the ECoG recordings of 2 subjects who responded with button presses to audiovisual stimuli in an experimental task. Using a goodness-of-fit metric that measures how well the ECoG activity of each electrode can be predicted by all the other electrodes, we found that HMFA performed best when compared with Gaussian-Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) and other related spatiotemporal modeling techniques. In contradistinction to HMFA, GPFA and the other techniques integrate temporal smoothing with dimensionality reduction. We believe that this method will provide a powerful tool for relating high-channel-count ECoG signals to the perception and behavior of subjects."}}
