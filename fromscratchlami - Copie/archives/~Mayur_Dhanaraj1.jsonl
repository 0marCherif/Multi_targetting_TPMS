In order to leverage the exceptional generalizability of CNNs on edge-devices, they need to be made efficient in terms of memory usage, model size, and power consumption, while maintaining acceptable performance. Neural architecture search (NAS) is a recent approach for developing efficient, edgedeployable CNNs. On the other hand, CNNs used for classification, albeit developed using NAS, often contain large fully-connected (FC) layers with thousands of parameters, contributing to the bulkiness of CNNs. Recent works have shown that FC layers can be compressed, with minimal loss in performance, if any, using tensor processing methods. In this work, for the first time in literature, we leverage tensor methods in the NAS framework to discover efficient CNNs. Specifically, we employ tensor contraction layers (TCLs) to compress fully connected layers in the NAS framework and control the trade-off between compressibility and classification performance by handcrafting the ranks of TCLs. Additionally, we modify the NAS procedure to incorporate automatic TCL rank search in an end-to-end fashion, without human intervention. Our numerical studies on a wide variety of datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Imagenette (a subset of ImageNet) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in the automatic discovery of CNNs, whose model sizes are manyfold smaller than other cutting-edge mobile CNNs, while maintaining similar classification performance."}}

At the same time, mod- ern datasets often comprise multimodal measurements that are naturally modeled as multi-way arrays, also known as tensors. Processing multi-way data in their tensor form can enable enhanced inference and classification accuracy. Tucker decomposition is a standard method for tensor data processing, which however has demonstrated severe sensitivity to corrupted measurements due to its L2-norm formulation. In this work, we present a selection of classification methods that employ an L1-norm-based, corruption-resistant reformulation of Tucker (L1-Tucker). Our experimental studies on multiple real datasets corroborate the corruption-resistance and classification accuracy afforded by L1-Tucker."}}

At the same time, in our big data era, there is a need for online (stochastic) algorithms for data analysis with limited storage and computation requirements. To this end, in this paper we extend batch L1-PCA and propose a novel algorithm for stochastic PC calculation based on mean absolute projection maximization, with formal convergence guarantees. Our numerical studies demonstrate the convergence and corroborate the corruption resistance of the proposed method."}}

It has numerous applications in signal processing, machine learning, and pattern recognition. Despite its popularity, standard PCA is known to be sensitive to outliers, leading to degraded performance in the presence of corrupted data. In the era of big data, stochastic PCA algorithms are preferred due to their computational efficiency and ability to dynamically adapt to shifts in the subspace. However, most of the existing stochastic PCA algorithms are susceptible to corrupted data due to their reliance on the outlier-sensitive L2-norm. In this work, we propose a robust stochastic PCA algorithm that relies on the Barron loss. The proposed method is able to process streaming data with low computational cost, effectively perform subspace estimation, and track the subspace while also providing significant resistance to faulty/outlying data. Our numerical studies on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the convergence and performance of the proposed method."}}

In practical applications, the true covariance matrix is unknown and its dominant eigenvector is estimated by principal-component analysis (PCA) of a finite collection of coherent data points. As the size of the data collection increases, its principal component (PC) tends to the covariance eigenvector. The downside of PCA is that it is very sensitive against any outliers in the data collection. L1-PCA is an increasingly popular robust alternative to standard PCA that has demonstrated sturdy resistance against outliers in a number of applications. However, to date, the asymptotic properties of L1-PCA as an eigenvector estimator are not well understood. In this work we show for the first time that, for centered elliptical distributions, as the number of samples increases, the L1-PC tends to the eigenvector of the covariance matrix, just like the standard PC."}}

This is because contrary to computer vision, in remote sensing, training data are harder to collect and targets can be very small, occupying only a few pixels in the entire image, and exhibit arbitrary perspective transformations. Detection performance can improve by fusing data from multiple remote sensing modalities, including red, green, blue, infrared, hyperspectral, multispectral, synthetic aperture radar, and light detection and ranging, to name a few. In this article, we propose YOLOrs: a new convolutional neural network, specifically designed for real-time object detection in multimodal remote sensing imagery. YOLOrs can detect objects at multiple scales, with smaller receptive fields to account for small targets, as well as predict target orientations. In addition, YOLOrs introduces a novel mid-level fusion architecture that renders it applicable to multimodal aerial imagery. Our experimental studies compare YOLOrs with contemporary alternatives and corroborate its merits."}}

In addition, owing to the availability of remote-sensing data from various imaging modalities, such as RGB, infrared, hyper-spectral, multi-spectral, synthetic aperture radar, and lidar, researchers have focused on leveraging the complementary information offered by these various modalities. Over the past few years, deep-learning methods have demonstrated enhanced performance using multi-modal data. In this work, we propose a method for vehicle detection from multi-modal aerial imagery, by means of a modified YOLOv3 deep neural network that conducts mid-level fusion. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed mid-level fusion architecture is the first of its kind to be used for vehicle detection from multi-modal aerial imagery using a hierarchical object detection network.
