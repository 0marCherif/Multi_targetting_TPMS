In this paper, we explore the efficacy of audio-visual self-supervised learning from uncurated long-form content i.e movies. Studying its differences with conventional short-form content, we identify a non-i.i.d distribution of data, driven by the nature of movies. Specifically, we find long-form content to naturally contain a diverse set of semantic concepts (semantic diversity), where a large portion of them, such as main characters and environments often reappear frequently throughout the movie (reoccurring semantic concepts). In addition, movies often contain content-exclusive artistic artifacts, such as color palettes or thematic music, which are strong signals for uniquely distinguishing a movie (non-semantic consistency). Capitalizing on these observations, we comprehensively study the effect of emphasizing within-movie negative sampling in a contrastive learning setup. Our view is different from those of prior works who consider within-video positive sampling, inspired by the notion of semantic persistency over time, and operate in a short-video regime. Our empirical findings suggest that, with certain modifications, training on uncurated long-form videos yields representations which transfer competitively with the state-of-the-art to a variety of action recognition and audio classification tasks."}}

We demonstrate that a simple model based on contrastive learning, trained on a collection of movies and TV shows, not only dramatically outperforms more complex methods which are trained on orders of magnitudes larger uncurated datasets, but also performs very competitively with the state-of-the-art that learns from large-scale curated data.

They are particularly important in describing and recognizing concepts for which no explicit training example is given, e.g., zero-shot learning. Additionally, since attributes are human describable, they can be used for efficient human-computer interaction. In this article, we propose to employ semantic segmentation to improve person-related attribute prediction. The core idea lies in the fact that many attributes describe local properties. In other words, the probability of an attribute to appear in an image is far from being uniform in the spatial domain. We build our attribute prediction model jointly with a deep semantic segmentation network. This harnesses the localization cues learned by the semantic segmentation to guide the attention of the attribute prediction to the regions where different attributes naturally show up. As a result of this approach, in addition to prediction, we are able to localize the attributes despite merely having access to image-level labels (weak supervision) during training. We first propose semantic segmentation-based pooling and gating, respectively denoted as SSP and SSG. In the former, the estimated segmentation masks are used to pool the final activations of the attribute prediction network, from multiple semantically homogeneous regions. This is in contrast to global average pooling which is agnostic with respect to where in the spatial domain activations occur. In SSG, the same idea is applied to the intermediate layers of the network. Specifically, we create multiple copies of the internal activations. In each copy, only values that fall within a certain semantic region are preserved while outside of that, activations are suppressed. This mechanism allows us to prevent pooling operation from blending activations that are associated with semantically different regions. SSP and SSG, while effective, impose heavy memory utilization since each channel of the activations is pooled/gated with all the semantic segmentation masks. To circumvent this, we propose Symbiotic Augmentation (SA), where we learn only one mask per activation channel. SA allows the model to either pick one, or combine (weighted superposition) multiple semantic maps, in order to generate the proper mask for each channel. SA simultaneously applies the same mechanism to the reverse problem by leveraging output logits of attribute prediction to guide the semantic segmentation task. We evaluate our proposed methods for facial attributes on CelebA and LFWA datasets, while benchmarking WIDER Attribute and Berkeley Attributes of People for whole body attributes. Our proposed methods achieve superior results compared to the previous works. Furthermore, we show that in the reverse problem, semantic face parsing significantly improves when its associated task is jointly learned, through our proposed Symbiotic Augmentation (SA), with facial attribute prediction. We confirm that when few training instances are available, indeed image-level facial attribute labels can serve as an effective source of weak supervision to improve semantic face parsing. That reaffirms the need to jointly model these two interconnected tasks."}}

It normalizes the layer outputs during training using the statistics of each mini-batch. BN accelerates training procedure by allowing to safely utilize large learning rates and alleviates the need for careful initialization of the parameters. In this work, we study BN from the viewpoint of Fisher kernels that arise from generative probability models. We show that assuming samples within a mini-batch are from the same probability density function, then BN is identical to the Fisher vector of a Gaussian distribution. That means batch normalizing transform can be explained in terms of kernels that naturally emerge from the probability density function that models the generative process of the underlying data distribution. Consequently, it promises higher discrimination power for the batch-normalized mini-batch. However, given the rectifying non-linearities employed in CNN architectures, distribution of the layer outputs show an asymmetric characteristic. Therefore, in order for BN to fully benefit from the aforementioned properties, we propose approximating underlying data distribution not with one, but a mixture of Gaussian densities. Deriving Fisher vector for a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), reveals that batch normalization can be improved by independently normalizing with respect to the statistics of disentangled sub-populations. We refer to our proposed soft piecewise version of batch normalization as Mixture Normalization (MN). Through extensive set of experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, using both a 5-layers deep CNN and modern Inception-V3 architecture, we show that mixture normalization reduces required number of gradient updates to reach the maximum test accuracy of the batch-normalized model by ~ 31% - 47% across a variety of training scenarios. Replacing even a few BN modules with MN in the 48-layers deep Inception-V3 architecture is sufficient to not only obtain considerable training acceleration but also betterfinal test accuracy. We show that similar observations are valid for 40 and 100-layers deep DenseNet architectures as well. We complement our study by evaluating the application of mixture normalization to the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where \u201cmode collapse\u201d hinders the training process. We solely replace a few batch normalization layers in the generator with our proposed mixture normalization. Our experiments using Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) on CIFAR-10 show that mixture-normalized DCGAN not only provides an acceleration of - 58% but also reaches lower (better) \u201cFrechet Inception Distance\u201d (FID) of 33.35 compared to 37.56 of its batch-normalized counterpart."}}
