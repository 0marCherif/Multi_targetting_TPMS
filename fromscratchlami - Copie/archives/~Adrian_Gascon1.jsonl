Bonawitz et al. (CCS 2017) presented a construction that incurs computation and communication for each client linear in the number of parties. While this functionality enables a broad range of privacy preserving computational tasks, scaling concerns limit its scope of use.\n\nWe present the first constructions for secure aggregation that achieve polylogarithmic communication and computation per client. Our constructions provide security in the semi-honest and the semi-malicious setting where the adversary controls the server and a \u03b3-fraction of the clients, and correctness with up to \u03b4-fraction dropouts among the clients. Our constructions show how to replace the complete communication graph of Bonawitz et al., which entails the linear overheads, with a k-regular graph of logarithmic degree while maintaining the security guarantees.\n\nBeyond improving the known asymptotics for secure aggregation, our constructions also achieve very efficient concrete parameters. The semi-honest secure aggregation can handle a billion clients at the per client cost of the protocol of Bonawitz et al. for a thousand clients. In the semi-malicious setting with 104 clients, each client needs to communicate only with 3% of the clients to have a guarantee that its input has been added together with the inputs of at least 5000 other clients, while withstanding up to 5% corrupt clients and 5% dropouts. We also show an application of secure aggregation to the task of secure shuffling which enables the first cryptographically secure instantiation of the shuffle model of differential privacy."}}

This addresses the scenario where a party P1 owns a confidential model that has been certified by an authority to have a certain property e.g. fairness. Subsequently, another party P2 wants to perform a prediction on the model with an assurance that the certified model was used. We present a solution for this problem based on MPC commitments. Our constructions operate in the publicly verifiable covert (PVC) security model, which is a relaxation of the malicious model of MPC, appropriate in settings where P1 faces a reputational harm if caught cheating. We introduce the notion of a PVC commitment scheme and indexed hash functions to build commitment schemes tailored to the PVC framework, and propose constructions for both arithmetic and Boolean circuits that result in very efficient circuits. From a practical standpoint, our constructions for Boolean circuits are 60x faster to evaluate securely, and use 36x less communication than baseline methods based on hashing. Moreover, we show that our constructions are tight in terms of required non-linear operations, and present a technique to amplify the security properties of our constructions that allows to efficiently recover malicious guarantees with statistical security."}}
