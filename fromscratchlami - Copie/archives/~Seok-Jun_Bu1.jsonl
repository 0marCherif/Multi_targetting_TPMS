In particular, variations between the steering systems arising from the differences in manufacturing processes according to the vehicle types extremely limit the conventional deep acoustic models. Focusing on the fact that the major hurdles addressed can be mitigated by generating and modeling the virtual impact noise, we propose an adversarial signal augmentation method for the vehicle noise modeling. The impact noise is represented based on the Fourier transform and the variance between vehicle types is alleviated using a generative adversarial network with an auxiliary classifier in order to improve the generalization performance of the model. Experiments with the dataset of 134,400,000 time-series collected from a global motor corporation show that the proposed method has more than 3% of accuracy improvement against the conventional approaches."}}

The compound is contained in most real-life chemicals, including medicines, detergents, and cosmetics. Because mutagenicity of these substances can pose a great health risk if they enter the human body, predicting mutagenicity and avoiding risk are important problems. Due to recent advances in deep learning, many studies have been conducted to predict the mutagenicity of graphically expressed aromatic compounds, and they are performing well. However, previous methods that used deep learning to predict the mutagenicity of molecules lead to the problem of dilution of local information in molecular structures. In graph neural networks, the embedding of graphs is determined by the average or sum of node embeddings, and when a particular node dominates, information from local nodes is diluted. In this paper, we propose a model that learns molecules\u2019 local information properties to be undiluted by separating them from the original graph. By partitioning the graph, we preserve local information by breaking the relationship between the dominant nodes and the non-dominant nodes so that they do not affect each other's information updates. Experiments show that we successfully partition carbon rings and functional groups in molecular graphs using the Girvan Newman algorithm, and embed the segmented graphs using the same neural networks, allowing neural networks to learn about carbon rings and functional groups. Comparisons with other neural networks confirm performance improvements on 1% accuracy."}}

However, the deep learning-based method mainly focused on the fitting of a classification task via historical URL observation shows a limitation of recall due to the characteristics of zero-day attack. In order to model the nature of a zero-day phishing attack in which URL addresses are generated and discarded immediately, an approach that utilizes the expert knowledge is promising. We introduce the integration method of deep learning and logic programmed domain knowledge to inject the real-world constraints. We design neural and logic classifiers and propose the joint learning method of each component based on the traditional neuro-symbolic integration. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets consisting of 222,541 URLs showed the highest recall among the latest deep learning methods, despite the hostile class-imbalanced condition. We demonstrate that the optimized weighting between neural and logic component has an effect of improving the recall over 3% compared to the existing methods."}}

Since there is a limitation on traditional deep learning to detect phishing URLs from only the linguistic features of URLs, attempts have been made to detect the misclassified URLs by integrating security expert knowledge with deep learning. In this paper, a genetic algorithm is proposed to find combinatorial optimization of logic programmed constraints and deep learning from given 13 components, which are 12 rule-based symbol components and a neural component. The genetic algorithm explores numerous searching spaces of combinations of 12 rules with deep learning to get an optimal combination of the components. Experiments and 10-fold cross-validation with three different real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance of $$\\beta $$ -discrepancy integration approach by achieving a 1.47% accuracy and a 2.82% recall improvement. In addition, a post-analysis of the proposed method is performed to justify the feasibility of phishing URL detection via analyzing URLs that are misclassified from either the neural or symbolic networks."}}

A recent research in psychiatry perspective demonstrates that there are no obvious reasons for ASD. However, considering a hypothesis that abnormalities in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) connected with visual cortex regions can be a critical sign of ASD, a model is required to exploit the brain functional connectivity between STS and visual cortex to reinforce the neurobiological evidence. This paper proposes a deep learning model composed of attention and convolutional recurrent neural networks that can select and extract the time-series pattern of dynamic connectivity between the two regions within the brain based on observations. By integration of extracting autism disorder features from dynamic connectivity through attention with the structure containing interlayer connections to preserve the functional connectivity loss within a neural network, the model extracts the connectivity between STS and visual cortex, leading to the increase of generalization performance. Experiments with 800 patients\u2019 fMRI imaging data known as ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) and 10-fold cross-validation to compare its performance show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art performance by achieving a 4.90% improvement in the ASD classification. Additionally, the proposed method is analyzed by visualizing dynamic brain connectivity of the neural network layers."}}

Deep learning-based approaches to learn the unified features by exploiting the local and sequential nature of control flow graph achieved the best performance. However, only considering local and sequential information from graph-based malware representation is not enough to model the semantics, such as structural and functional nature of malware. In this paper, functional nature are combined to the control flow graph by adding opcodes, and structural nature is embedded through DeepWalk algorithm. Subsequently, we propose the transformer-based malware control flow embedding to overcome the difficulty in modeling the long-term control flow and to selectively learn the code embeddings. Extensive experiments achieved performance improvement compared to the latest deep learning-based graph embedding methods, and in a 37.50% improvement in recall was confirmed for the Simda botnet attack."}}

Therefore, this study aimed to address the class imbalance issues in the URL domain, in terms of the deep learning-based URL feature space generation, and to propose a modified triplet network structure that learns the similarity between URLs. The proposed method was verified using 60,000 URL datasets collected from real-world web addresses, and it achieved a performance improvement compared to the latest deep learning based methods. The modified triplet network was evaluated by a 10-fold cross-validation per time resolution, and it demonstrated a 45 percent improvement in recall to confirm the validity of the metric learning approach in the field of phishing URL classification."}}

Via structural path the noise is perceived by the drivers' ears and it can be the cause of a repair campaign. It is importatnt to know where the collision occurs to modify the parts causing impact noise. In this paper, we performed data augmentation using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method that decomposes the original signal into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The IMFs were decomposed by descending order from high frequency to low frequency, and we add the residue each time one IMF is separated. After the data augmentation, the data were trained using the neural network model CNN-LSTM. The proposed method showed better classification performance than other classification methods. It seems that proposed method takes advantage of the impact noise characteristics concentrated at low frequency range."}}

The proposed model generates the latent space for demand peaks from data, which is transferred into convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) to finally predict the future power demand. Experiments with the dataset of UCI household power consumption composed of a total of 2,075,259 time-series data show that the proposed model reduces the error by 23.63% and outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning models including the CNN-LSTM.
