Typically, the views created from one instance are set as positive, while views from other instances are negative. This binary instance discrimination is studied extensively to improve feature representations in self-supervised learning. In this paper, we rethink the instance discrimination framework and find the binary instance labeling insufficient to measure correlations between different samples. For an intuitive example, given a random image instance, there may exist other images in a mini-batch whose content meanings are the same (i.e., belonging to the same category) or partially related (i.e., belonging to a similar category). How to treat the images that correlate similarly to the current image instance leaves an unexplored problem. We thus propose to support the current image by exploring other correlated instances (i.e., soft neighbors). We first carefully cultivate a candidate neighbor set, which will be further utilized to explore the highly-correlated instances. A cross-attention module is then introduced to predict the correlation score (denoted as positiveness) of other correlated instances with respect to the current one. The positiveness score quantitatively measures the positive support from each correlated instance, and is encoded into the objective for pretext training. To this end, our proposed method benefits in discriminating uncorrelated instances while absorbing correlated instances for SSL. We evaluate our soft neighbor contrastive learning method (SNCLR) on standard visual recognition benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. The state-of-the-art recognition performance shows that SNCLR is effective in improving feature representations from both ViT and CNN encoders. "}}

To address this challenge, we propose an effective adaptation approach for Transformer, namely AdaptFormer, which can adapt the pre-trained ViTs into many different image and video tasks efficiently. It possesses several benefits more appealing than prior arts. Firstly, AdaptFormer introduces lightweight modules that only add less than 2% extra parameters to a ViT, while it is able to increase the ViT's transferability without updating its original pre-trained parameters, significantly outperforming the existing 100% fully fine-tuned models on action recognition benchmarks. Secondly, it can be plug-and-play in different Transformers and scalable to many visual tasks. Thirdly, extensive experiments on five image and video datasets show that AdaptFormer largely improves ViTs in the target domains. For example, when updating just 1.5% extra parameters, it achieves about 10% and 19% relative improvement compared to the fully fine-tuned models on Something-Something~v2 and HMDB51, respectively."}}

While CNN encoders via SSL achieve comparable recognition performance to those via supervised learning, their network attention is under-explored for further improvement. Motivated by the transformers that explore visual attention effectively in recognition scenarios, we propose a CNN Attention REvitalization (CARE) framework to train attentive CNN encoders guided by transformers in SSL. The proposed CARE framework consists of a CNN stream (C-stream) and a transformer stream (T-stream), where each stream contains two branches. C-stream follows an existing SSL framework with two CNN encoders, two projectors, and a predictor. T-stream contains two\ntransformers, two projectors, and a predictor. T-stream connects to CNN encoders and is in parallel to the remaining C-Stream. During training, we perform SSL in both streams simultaneously and use the T-stream output to supervise C-stream. The features from CNN encoders are modulated in T-stream for visual attention enhancement and become suitable for the SSL scenario. We use these modulated\nfeatures to supervise C-stream for learning attentive CNN encoders. To this end, we revitalize CNN attention by using transformers as guidance. Experiments on several standard visual recognition benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, show that the proposed CARE framework improves CNN encoder backbones to the state-of-the-art performance."}}

(1) It can cope with various image sizes. (2) It achieves linear computational complexity to image size by using local windows. In contrast, previous MLPs have $O(N^2)$ computations due to fully spatial connections.
