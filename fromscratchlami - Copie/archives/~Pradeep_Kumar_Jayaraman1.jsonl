The depth of an octree is dependent of the scale of the input data and the desired resolution of the smallest voxels in the leaf nodes as well. Thus, it often requires a deep octree to maintain low level of geometric errors for large-scale sparse point clouds, which leads to high memory requirement and low access speed. This paper presents a new structure called truncated octree or T-Octree that truncates the octree by adaptively pruning the top hierarchy and represents the deep octree by a set of shallow sub-octrees. The structure is further extended to support random access of nodes and out-of-core streaming of large data sets. We also propose a variable length addressing scheme to adaptively choose the length of an octree\u2019s node address based on the truncation level. As a result, T-Octree provides highly efficient query performance and can save storage without losing the original structure for sparse or clustered models and scenes. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the new structure on point cloud compression and scene query tasks for sparse or clustered data."}}

In this work, we introduce a novel neural network architecture to solve this challenging task and approximate a smoothed signed distance function with an editable, constrained, prismatic CAD model. During training, our method reconstructs the input geometry in the voxel space by decomposing the shape into a series of 2D profile images and 1D envelope functions. These can then be recombined in a differentiable way allowing a geometric loss function to be defined. During inference, we obtain the CAD data by first searching a database of 2D constrained sketches to find curves which approximate the profile images, then extrude them and use Boolean operations to build the final CAD model. Our method approximates the target shape more closely than other methods and outputs highly editable constrained parametric sketches which are compatible with existing CAD software."}}

Recent approaches to generating CAD models have focused on learning sketch-and-extrude modeling sequences that are executed by a solid modeling kernel in postprocess to recover a B-rep. In this paper we present a new approach that enables learning from and synthesizing B-reps without the need for supervision through CAD modeling sequence data. Our method SolidGen, is an autoregressive neural network that models the B-rep directly by predicting the vertices, edges, and faces using Transformer-based and pointer neural networks. Key to achieving this is our Indexed Boundary Representation that references B-rep vertices, edges and faces in a well-defined hierarchy to capture the geometric and topological relations suitable for use with machine learning. SolidGen can be easily conditioned on contexts e.g., class labels, images, and voxels thanks to its probabilistic modeling of the B-rep distribution. We demonstrate qualitatively, quantitatively, and through perceptual evaluation by human subjects that SolidGen can produce high quality, realistic CAD models."}}

Neon decouples data structure from computation and back end configurations, allowing the same user code to operate on a variety of data structures and devices. Neon relies on a set of hierarchical abstractions that allow the user to write their applications as if they were sequential applications, while the runtime handles distribution across multiple GPUs and performs optimizations such as overlapping computation and communication without user intervention. We evaluate our programming model on several applications: a Lattice Boltzmann fluid solver, a finite-difference Poisson solver and a finite-element linear elastic solver. We show that these applications can be implemented concisely and scale well with the number of GPUs-achieving more than 99% of ideal efficiency."}}

CAD designers build up these assemblies by aligning individual parts to one another using constraints called joints. In this paper we introduce JoinABLe, a learning-based method that assembles parts together to form joints. JoinABLe uses the weak supervision available in standard parametric CAD files without the help of object class labels or human guidance. Our results show that by making network predictions over a graph representation of solid models we can outperform multiple baseline methods with an accuracy (79.53%) that approaches human performance (80%). Finally, to support future research we release the Fusion 360 Gallery assembly dataset, containing assemblies with rich information on joints, contact surfaces, holes, and the underlying assembly graph structure."}}
