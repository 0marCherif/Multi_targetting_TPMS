Using Sinkhorn's theorem, we show that the signal captured by the $\\chi^2$-test may be a modeling artifact, and it may disappear once we replace the Erd\u00f6s-Renyi model by a broader network model.  We show that the recent SgnQ test is more appropriate for such a setting. The test is optimal in detecting communities with sizes comparable to the whole network, but has never been studied for our setting, which is substantially different and more challenging.  Using a degree-corrected block model (DCBM), we establish phase transitions of this testing problem concerning the size of the small community and the edge densities in small and large communities.  When the size of the small community is larger than $\\sqrt{n}$, the SgnQ test is optimal  for it attains the computational lower bound (CLB), the information lower bound for methods allowing polynomial computation time. When the size of the small community is smaller than $\\sqrt{n}$, we establish the parameter regime where the SgnQ test has full power and make some conjectures of the CLB. We also study the classical information lower bound (LB) and show that there is always a gap between the CLB and LB in our range of interest. \t"}}

The estimated label of the new node is equal to the value of $k$  that maximizes this similarity metric. Our method is computationally fast and compares favorably with existing semi-supervised algorithms on numerical performance. In theory, we derive explicit bounds for the misclassification error and show the efficiency of our method by comparing it with an ideal classifier. To our best knowledge, our results provide the first semi-supervised community detection algorithm with theoretical guarantees.  "}}

This motivates alternative approaches such as using a non-convex penalty, adding a ridge regularization, or conducting a post-Lasso thresholding. In this paper, we compare Lasso with 5 other methods: Elastic net, SCAD, forward selection, thresholded Lasso, and forward backward selection. We measure their performances theoretically by the expected Hamming error, assuming that the regression coefficients are ${\\it iid}$ drawn from a two-point mixture and that the Gram matrix is block-wise diagonal. By deriving the rates of convergence of Hamming errors and the phase diagrams, we obtain useful conclusions about the pros and cons of different methods."}}

Since both the null and alternative hypotheses have many unknown parameters, \nthe challenge is, given an alternative, how to identify the null that is hardest to separate from the alternative. We approach this by proposing a degree matching strategy where the main idea is leveraging the theory for tensor scaling to create a least favorable pair of hypotheses. We present a  result on standard  minimax lower bound theory and a result on Region of Impossibility (which is more informative than the minimax lower bound). We show that our lower bounds are tight by introducing a new test that attains the lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. We also discuss the case where the hypergraphs may have mixed-memberships."}}
{"id": "H1gRdEHxIr", "cdate": 1567802485618, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "State Aggregation Learning from Markov Transition Data", "abstract": "State aggregation is a popular model reduction method rooted in optimal control. It reduces the complexity of engineering systems by mapping the system\u2019s states into a small number of meta-states. The choice of aggregation map often depends on the data analysts\u2019s knowledge and is largely ad hoc. In this paper, we propose a tractable algorithm that estimates the probabilistic aggregation map from the system\u2019s trajectory. We adopt a soft-aggregation model, where each meta-state has a signature raw state, called an anchor state. This model includes several common state aggregation models as special cases. Our proposed method is a simple two- step algorithm: The first step is spectral decomposition of empirical transition matrix, and the second step conducts a linear transformation of singular vectors to find their approximate convex hull. It outputs the aggregation distributions and disaggregation distributions for each meta-state in explicit forms, which are not obtainable by classical spectral methods. On the theoretical side, we prove sharp error bounds for estimating the aggregation and disaggregation distributions and for identifying anchor states. The analysis relies on a new entry-wise deviation bound for singular vectors of the empirical transition matrix of a Markov process, which is of independent interest and cannot be deduced from existing literature. The application of our method to Manhattan traffic data successfully generates a data-driven state aggregation map with nice interpretations."}}
