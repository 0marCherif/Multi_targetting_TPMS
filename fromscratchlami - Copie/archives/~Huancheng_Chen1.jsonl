In recent years, personalized federated learning (pFL) has emerged as a potential solution to the challenges presented by heterogeneous data. However, existing pFL methods typically enhance performance of local models at the expense of the global model's accuracy. We propose FedHKD (Federated Hyper-Knowledge Distillation), a novel FL algorithm in which clients rely on knowledge distillation (KD) to train local models. In particular, each client extracts and sends to the server the means of local data representations and the corresponding soft predictions -- information that we refer to as ``hyper-knowledge\". The server aggregates this information and broadcasts it to the clients in support of local training. Notably, unlike other KD-based pFL methods, FedHKD does not rely on a public dataset nor it deploys a generative model at the server. We analyze convergence of FedHKD and conduct extensive experiments on visual datasets in a variety of scenarios, demonstrating that FedHKD provides significant improvement in both personalized as well as global model performance compared to state-of-the-art FL methods designed for heterogeneous data settings."}}

In an FL system, a server coordinates the collaboration by collecting and aggregating clients' model updates while the clients' data remains local and private. A major challenge in federated learning arises when the local data is non-iid -- the setting in which performance of the learned global model may deteriorate significantly compared to the scenario where the data is identically distributed across the clients. In this paper we propose FedDPMS (Federated Differentially Private Means Sharing), an FL algorithm in which clients augment local datasets with data synthesized using differentially private information collected and communicated by a trusted server. In particular, the server matches the pairs of clients having complementary local datasets and facilitates differentially-private sharing of the means of latent data representations; the clients then deploy variational auto-encoders to enrich their datasets and thus ameliorate the effects of non-iid data distribution. Our experiments on deep image classification tasks demonstrate that FedDPMS outperforms competing state-of-the-art FL methods specifically developed to address the challenge of federated learning on non-iid data."}}

Recently, a new problem was introduced in the field to predict the 3D human poses from observed 2D poses. We propose Skeleton-Graph, a deep spatio-temporal graph CNN model that predicts the future 3D skeleton poses in a single pass from the 2D ones. Unlike prior works, Skeleton-Graph focuses on modeling the interaction between the skeleton joints by exploiting their spatial configuration. This is being achieved by formulating the problem as a graph structure while learning a suitable graph adjacency kernel. By the design, Skeleton-Graph predicts the future 3D poses without divergence in the long-term, unlike prior works. We also introduce a new metric that measures the divergence of predictions in the long term. Our results show an FDE improvement of at least 27% and an ADE of 4% on both the GTA-IM and PROX datasets respectively in comparison with prior works. Also, we are 88% and 93% less divergence on the long-term motion prediction in comparison with prior works on both GTA-IM and PROX datasets.
