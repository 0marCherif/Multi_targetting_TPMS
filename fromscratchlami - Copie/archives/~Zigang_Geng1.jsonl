The prior attempts all end up with suboptimal results because they fail to learn accurate inductive biases from the limited scale of training data. In particular, the queries often attend to points that are far away from the target objects, violating the locality principle in object detection. To address the limitation, we introduce a novel 3D Vertex Relative Position Encoding (3DV-RPE) method which computes position encoding for each point based on its relative position to the 3D boxes predicted by the queries in each decoder layer, thus providing clear information to guide the model to focus on points near the objects, in accordance with the principle of locality. In addition, we systematically improve the pipeline from various aspects such as data normalization based on our understanding of the task. We show exceptional results on the challenging ScanNetV2 benchmark, achieving significant improvements over the previous 3DETR in $\\rm{AP}_{25}$/$\\rm{AP}_{50}$ from 65.0\\%/47.0\\% to 77.8\\%/66.0\\%, respectively. In addition, our method sets a new record on ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D datasets.Code will be released at http://github.com/yichaoshen-MS/V-DETR."}}

Unlike existing approaches that integrate prior knowledge and pre-define the output space (e.g., categories and coordinates) for each vision task, we cast diverse vision tasks into a human-intuitive image-manipulating process whose output space is a flexible and interactive pixel space. Concretely, the model is built upon the diffusion process and is trained to predict pixels according to user instructions, such as encircling the man's left shoulder in red or applying a blue mask to the left car. InstructDiffusion could handle a variety of vision tasks, including understanding tasks (such as segmentation and keypoint detection) and generative tasks (such as editing and enhancement). It even exhibits the ability to handle unseen tasks and outperforms prior methods on novel datasets. This represents a significant step towards a generalist modeling interface for vision tasks, advancing artificial general intelligence in the field of computer vision."}}

While easy for data processing, unrealistic pose estimates are admitted due to the lack of dependency modeling between the body joints. In this paper, we present a structured representation, named Pose as Compositional Tokens (PCT), to explore the joint dependency. It represents a pose by M discrete tokens with each characterizing a sub-structure with several interdependent joints. The compositional design enables it to achieve a small reconstruction error at a low cost. Then we cast pose estimation as a classification task. In particular, we learn a classifier to predict the categories of the M tokens from an image. A pre-learned decoder network is used to recover the pose from the tokens without further post-processing. We show that it achieves better or comparable pose estimation results as the existing methods in general scenarios, yet continues to work well when occlusion occurs, which is ubiquitous in practice. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Gengzigang/PCT."}}

In this paper, we seek to unify the output space of visual tasks, so that we can also build a unified model for visual tasks. To this end, we demonstrate a single unified model that simultaneously handles two typical visual tasks of instance segmentation and depth estimation, which have discrete/fixed-length and continuous/varied-length outputs, respectively. We propose several new techniques that take into account the particularity of visual tasks: 1) Soft token. We employ soft token to represent the task output. Unlike hard tokens in the common VQ-VAE which are assigned one-hot to discrete codebooks/vocabularies, the soft token is assigned softly to the codebook embeddings. Soft token can improve the accuracy of both the next token inference and decoding of the task output; 2) Mask augmentation. Many visual tasks have corruption, undefined or invalid values in label annotations, i.e., occluded area of depth maps. We show that a mask augmentation technique can greatly benefit these tasks. With these new techniques and other designs, we show that the proposed general-purpose task-solver can perform both instance segmentation and depth estimation well. Particularly, we achieve 0.279 RMSE on the specific task of NYUv2 depth estimation, setting a new record on this benchmark. The general-purpose task-solver, dubbed AiT, is available at \\url{https://github.com/SwinTransformer/AiT}."}}

In this paper, we compare MIM with the long-dominant supervised pre-trained models from two perspectives, the visualizations and the experiments, to uncover their key representational differences. From the visualizations, we find that MIM brings locality inductive bias to all layers of the trained models, but supervised models tend to focus locally at lower layers but more globally at higher layers. That may be the reason why MIM helps Vision Transformers that have a very large receptive field to optimize. Using MIM, the model can maintain a large diversity on attention heads in all layers. But for supervised models, the diversity on attention heads almost disappears from the last three layers and less diversity harms the fine-tuning performance. From the experiments, we find that MIM models can perform significantly better on geometric and motion tasks with weak semantics or fine-grained classification tasks, than their supervised counterparts. Without bells and whistles, a standard MIM pre-trained SwinV2-L could achieve state-of-the-art performance on pose estimation (78.9 AP on COCO test-dev and 78.0 AP on CrowdPose), depth estimation (0.287 RMSE on NYUv2 and 1.966 RMSE on KITTI), and video object tracking (70.7 SUC on LaSOT). For the semantic understanding datasets where the categories are sufficiently covered by the supervised pre-training, MIM models can still achieve highly competitive transfer performance. With a deeper understanding of MIM, we hope that our work can inspire new and solid research in this direction."}}

We study the instance classification solution, which regards each instance as a category, and improve the optimization and feature quality. The proposed consistent instance classification (ConIC) approach simultaneously optimizes the classification loss and an additional consistency loss explicitly penalizing the feature dissimilarity between the augmented views from the same instance. The benefit of optimizing the consistency loss is that the learned features for augmented views from the same instance are more compact and accordingly the classification loss optimization becomes easier, thus boosting the quality of the learned representations. This differs from InstDisc and MoCo that use an estimated prototype as the classifier weight to ease the optimization. Different from SimCLR that directly compares different instances, our approach does not require large batch size. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance for linear evaluation and better performance than InstDisc, MoCo and SimCLR at downstream tasks, such as detection and segmentation, as well as competitive or superior performance compared to other methods with stronger training setting."}}

Most existing works focus on developing grouping algorithms, e.g., associative embedding, and pixel-wise keypoint regression that we adopt in our approach. We present several schemes that are rarely or unthoroughly studied before for improving keypoint detection and grouping (keypoint regression) performance. First, we exploit the keypoint heatmaps for pixel-wise keypoint regression instead of separating them for improving keypoint regression. Second, we adopt a pixel-wise spatial transformer network to learn adaptive representations for handling the scale and orientation variance to further improve keypoint regression quality. Last, we present a joint shape and heatvalue scoring scheme to promote the estimated poses that are more likely to be true poses. Together with the tradeoff heatmap estimation loss for balancing the background and keypoint pixels and thus improving heatmap estimation quality, we get the state-of-the-art bottom-up human pose estimation result.
