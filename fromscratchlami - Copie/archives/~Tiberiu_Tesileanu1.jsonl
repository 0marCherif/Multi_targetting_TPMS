As such, much effort has been put into mapping PC faithfully onto the cortex, but there are issues that remain unresolved or controversial. In particular, current implementations often involve separate value and error neurons and require symmetric forward and backward weights across different brain regions. These features have not been experimentally confirmed. In this work, we show that the PC framework in the linear regime can be modified to map faithfully onto the cortical hierarchy in a manner compatible with empirical observations. By employing a disentangling-inspired constraint on hidden-layer neural activities, we derive an upper bound for the PC objective. Optimization of this upper bound leads to an algorithm that shows the same performance as the original objective and maps onto a biologically plausible network. The units of this network can be interpreted as multi-compartmental neurons with non-Hebbian learning rules, with a remarkable resemblance to recent experimental findings. There exist prior models which also capture these features, but they are phenomenological, while our work is a normative derivation. This allows us to determine which features are necessary for the functioning of the model. For instance, the network we derive does not involve one-to-one connectivity or signal multiplexing, which the phenomenological models require, indicating that these features are not necessary for learning in the cortex. The normative nature of our algorithm in the simplified linear case also allows us to prove interesting properties of the framework and analytically understand the computational role of our network's components. The parameters of our network have natural interpretations as physiological quantities in a multi-compartmental model of pyramidal neurons, providing a concrete link between PC and experimental measurements carried out in the cortex."}}

Translations and rotations of images can be viewed as orthogonal transformations in the space of pixel intensity vectors. Every orthogonal transformation can be decomposed into rotations within irreducible two-dimensional subspaces (or representations). For sets of commuting transformations, known as toroidal groups, Cohen and Welling proposed a mathematical framework for learning the irreducible representations. We explore the possibility that the brain also learns irreducible representations using a biologically plausible learning mechanism. The first is based on SVD of the anti-symmetrized outer product of the vectors representing consecutive images and is implemented by a single-layer neural network. The second is based on PCA of the difference between consecutive frames and is implemented in a two-layer network but with greater biological plausibility. Both networks learn image rotations (replicating Cohen and Welling\u2019s results) as well as  translations. It would be interesting to search for the proposed networks in nascent connectomics and physiology datasets."}}

Such latent variables are often encoded in the dynamics that generated the signal rather than in the specific realization of the waveform. Therefore, one problem faced by the brain is to segment time series based on underlying dynamics. We present two algorithms for performing this segmentation task that are biologically plausible, which we define as acting in a streaming setting and all learning rules being local. One algorithm is model based and can be derived from an optimization problem involving a mixture of autoregressive processes. This algorithm relies on feedback in the form of a prediction error and can also be used for forecasting future samples. In some brain regions, such as the retina, the feedback connections necessary to use the prediction error for learning are absent. For this case, we propose a second, model-free algorithm that uses a running estimate of the autocorrelation structure of the signal to perform the segmentation. We show that both algorithms do well when tasked with segmenting signals drawn from autoregressive models with piecewise-constant parameters. In particular, the segmentation accuracy is similar to that obtained from oracle-like methods in which the ground-truth parameters of the autoregressive models are known. We also test our methods on data sets generated by alternating snippets of voice recordings. We provide implementations of our algorithms at https://github.com/ttesileanu/bio-time-series."}}

The way in which bacteria choose spacer sequences from a clonal phage population is not understood. Our model considers competing effects of ease of acquisition and effectiveness against infections in shaping the spacer distribution. The model suggests that a diverse spacer population results when the acquisition rate is high, or when spacers are similarly effective. At moderate acquisition rates, the spacer distribution becomes highly sensitive to spacer effectiveness. There is a rich landscape of behaviors including bacteria-phage coexistence and oscillations in the populations."}}

One such method, called statistical coupling analysis, identifies patterns of correlated mutations and uses them to find groups of coevolving residues. These groups, called protein sectors, have been reported to be relevant for various functional aspects, such as enzymatic efficiency, protein stability, or allostery. Here, we reanalyze existing data in order to assess the relative importance of two factors contributing to statistical coupling analysis, namely single-site amino acid frequencies and pairwise correlations. Although correlations have been shown to be informative in other studies, we point out that in existing large-scale data that has been analyzed with statistical coupling analysis, single-site statistics seems to be a dominating factor."}}
