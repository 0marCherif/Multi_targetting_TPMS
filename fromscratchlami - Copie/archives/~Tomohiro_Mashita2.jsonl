In this paper, we propose one of the simplest methods for this task with a nonparametric weight imprinting, named Direct ONE-shot learning (DONE). DONE adds new classes to a pretrained deep neural network (DNN) classifier with neither training optimization nor pretrained-DNN modification. DONE is inspired by Hebbian theory and directly uses the neural activity input of the final dense layer obtained from data that belongs to the new additional class as the synaptic weight with a newly-provided-output neuron for the new class, by transforming all statistical properties of the neural activity into those of synaptic weight. DONE requires just one inference for learning a new concept and its procedure is simple, deterministic, not requiring parameter tuning and hyperparameters. DONE overcomes a problem of existing weight imprinting methods that interfere with the classification of original-class images. The performance of DONE depends entirely on the pretrained DNN model used as a backbone model, and we confirmed that DONE with current well-trained backbone models perform at a decent accuracy. "}}

The method consists of a genetic algorithm to generate an arrangement of cargoes and a fitness evaluation using physics simulation. The fitness function considers not only the maximization of container density or value but also a few different constraints such as stability and fragility of the cargoes during transportation. We employed a container shaking simulation to include the effect of the constraints to the fitness evaluation. We verified that the proposed method successfully provides the optimal cargo arrangement to the small-scale problem with 10 cargoes."}}

To do so, training images are first rendered using photon mapping, and the CNN learns the correspondences between the depth images and caustic images. After learning, the CNN generates a caustic image from a depth image within 55 milliseconds. In addition, the similarity between the generated caustic images and the ground truth shows that our method is very promising for generation of the caustic images for a number of known objects. While the method does not handle objects in which ground truth is not already known.This method can play an important role in scenes used for stage video production and interactive art in the future."}}

However, the properties of biological tissues that are non-rigid and featureless require a large number of distributed features to track the movement of tissues in detail.\nMethods: With the goal of increasing the number of feature points in organ tracking, we propose a feature detection using multi-band and narrow-band imaging and a new band selection method. The depth of light penetration into an object depends on the wavelength of light based on optical characteristics. We applied typical feature detectors to detect feature points using three selected bands in a human hand. To consider surgical situations, we applied our method to a chicken liver with a variety of light conditions. \nResults: Our experimental results revealed that the image of each band exhibited a different distribution of feature points. In addition, the total number of feature points determined by the proposed method exceeded that of the R, G, and B"}}

As large amounts of data are obtained these days and it is becoming unrealistic to manually process massive number of images, automatic analysis methods are required. One of the issues for automatic image segmentation is that image-taking conditions are variable. Thus, commonly, many manual inputs are required according to each image. In this paper, we propose a bone marrow cavity (BMC) segmentation method for bone images as BMC is considered to be related to the mechanism of bone remodeling, osteoporosis, and so on. To reduce manual inputs to segment BMC, we classi\u00afed the texture pattern using wavelet transformation and support vector machine. We also integrated the result of texture pattern classi\u00afcation into the graphcuts- based image segmentation method because texture analysis does not consider spatial continuity. Our method is applicable to a particular frame in an image sequence in which the condition of \u00b0uorescent material is variable. In the experiment, we evaluated our method with nine types of mother wavelets and several sets of scale parameters. The proposed method with graph-cuts and texture pattern classi\u00afcation performs well without manual inputs by a user."}}

However, localization results are greatly affected by illumination. Including data collected under various lighting conditions can improve the robustness of the localization algorithm to lighting variation. However, this is very tedious and time consuming. By using synthesized images it is possible to easily accumulate a large variety of views under varying illumination and weather conditions. Despite continuously improving processing power and rendering algorithms, synthesized images do not perfectly match real images of the same scene, i.e. there exists a gap between real and synthesized images that also affects the accuracy of camera localization. To reduce the impact of this gap, we introduce \"REal-to-Synthetic Transform (REST).\" REST is an autoencoder-like network that converts real features to their synthetic counterpart. The converted features can then be matched against the accumulated database for robust camera localization. In our experiments REST improved feature matching accuracy under variable lighting conditions by approximately 30%. Moreover, our system outperforms state of the art CNN-based camera localization methods trained with synthetic images. We believe our method could be used to initialize local tracking and to simplify data accumulation for lighting robust localization."}}

We use an omnidirectional vision sensor in order to cover the wide range of hand operations and movement of indicated objects. The camera is mounted on the head, which enables the system to be tolerant of the occlusion problem. The method for detecting an indicated object uses a linear model with the concepts of a cognitive origin and a reference plane."}}
