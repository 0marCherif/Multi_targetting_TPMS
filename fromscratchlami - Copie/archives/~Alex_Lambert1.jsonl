In this work, we present a novel style transfer framework building upon infinite task learning and vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We instantiate the idea in emotion transfer where the goal is to transform facial images to different target emotions. The proposed approach provides a principled way to gain explicit control over the continuous style space. We demonstrate the efficiency of the technique on popular facial emotion benchmarks, achieving low reconstruction cost and high emotion classification accuracy."}}
