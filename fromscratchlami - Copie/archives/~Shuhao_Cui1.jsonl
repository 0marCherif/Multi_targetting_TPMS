ZSVC is achieved by building mappings between visual and semantic embeddings. Recently, ZSVC has been achieved by automatically mining the underlying objects in videos as attributes and incorporating external commonsense knowledge. However, the object mined from seen categories can not generalized to unseen ones. Besides, the category-object relationships are usually extracted from commonsense knowledge or word embedding, which is not consistent with video modality. To tackle these issues, we propose to mine associated objects and category-object relationships for each category from retrieved web images. The associated objects of all categories are employed as generic attributes and the mined category-object relationships could narrow the modality inconsistency for better knowledge transfer. Another issue of existing ZSVC methods is that the model sufficiently trained with labeled seen categories may not generalize well to distinct unseen categories. To encourage a more reliable transfer, we propose Task Similarity aware Representation Learning (TSRL). In TSRL, the similarity between seen categories and the unseen ones is estimated and used to regularize the model in an appropriate way. We construct a model for ZSVC based on the constructed attributes, the mined category-object relationships and the proposed TSRL. Experimental results on four public datasets, i.e., FCVID, UCF101, HMDB51 and Olympic Sports, show that our model performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.

A common solution is to minimize the Shannon Entropy to push the decision boundary away from the high density area. However, entropy minimization also leads to severe reduction of prediction diversity, and unfortunately brings harm to the domain adaptation. In this paper, we investigate the prediction discriminability and diversity by studying the structure of the classification output matrix of a randomly selected data batch. We find by theoretical analysis that the prediction discriminability and diversity could be separately measured by the Frobenius-norm and rank of the batch output matrix. The nuclear-norm is an upperbound of the former, and a convex approximation of the latter. Accordingly, we propose Batch Nuclear-norm Maximization and Minimization, which performs nuclear-norm maximization on the target output matrix to enhance the target prediction ability, and nuclear-norm minimization on the source batch output matrix to increase applicability of the source domain knowledge. We further approximate the nuclear-norm by L_{1,2}-norm, and design multi-batch optimization for stable solution on large number of categories. The fast approximation method achieves O(n^2) computational complexity and better convergence property. Experiments show that our method could boost the adaptation accuracy and robustness under three typical domain adaptation scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/cuishuhao/BNM."}}

However, source data is not always accessible in practical scenarios, which restricts the application of SSDA in real world circumstances. In this paper, we propose a novel task named Semi-supervised Source Hypothesis Transfer (SSHT), which performs domain adaptation based on source trained model, to generalize well in target domain with a few supervisions. In SSHT, we are facing two challenges: (1) The insufficient labeled target data may result in target features near the decision boundary, with the increased risk of mis-classification; (2) The data are usually imbalanced in source domain, so the model trained with these data is biased. The biased model is prone to categorize samples of minority categories into majority ones, resulting in low prediction diversity. To tackle the above issues, we propose Consistency and Diversity Learning (CDL), a simple but effective framework for SSHT by facilitating prediction consistency between two randomly augmented unlabeled data and maintaining the prediction diversity when adapting model to target domain. Encouraging consistency regularization brings difficulty to memorize the few labeled target data and thus enhances the generalization ability of the learned model. We further integrate Batch Nuclear-norm Maximization into our method to enhance the discriminability and diversity. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing SSDA methods and unsupervised model adaptation methods on DomainNet, Office-Home and Office-31 datasets.

The task is to correctly classify all samples in T including known and unknown categories. UODR is challenging due to the domain discrepancy, which becomes even harder to bridge when a large number of unknown categories exist in T. Moreover, the classification rules propagated by graph CNN (GCN) may be distracted by unknown categories and lack generalization capability. To measure the domain discrepancy for asymmetric label space between S and T, we propose Semantic-Guided Matching Discrepancy (SGMD), which first employs instance matching between S and T, and then the discrepancy is measured by a weighted feature distance between matched instances. We further design a limited balance constraint to achieve a more balanced classification output on known and unknown categories. We develop Unsupervised Open Domain Transfer Network (UODTN), which learns both the backbone classification network and GCN jointly by reducing the SGMD, enforcing the limited balance constraint and minimizing the classification loss on S. UODTN better preserves the semantic structure and enforces the consistency between the learned domain invariant visual features and the semantic embeddings. Experimental results show superiority of our method on recognizing images of both known and unknown categories."}}
