In this paper we provide the packing counterpart of these estimates. We also extend bounds to the case of r-fold covering and packing and show a packing analog of Falconer\u2019s results (Math Proc Camb Philos Soc 87:81\u201396, 1980)."}}

Then for $p>4$ we prove that with high probability $A/{\\sqrt{n}}$ has the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) provided that Euclidean norms $|X_i|$ are concentrated around $\\sqrt{n}$. We also show that the covariance matrix is well approximated by the empirical covariance matrix and establish corresponding quantitative estimates on the rate of convergence in terms of the ratio $n/N$. Moreover, we obtain sharp bounds for both problems when the decay is of the type $ \\exp({-t^{\\alpha}})$ with $\\alpha \\in (0,2]$, extending the known case $\\alpha\\in[1, 2]$."}}

Dedicate 90:45\u201348, [2002]) it was shown that a polytope with few vertices is far from being symmetric in the Banach\u2013Mazur distance. More precisely, it was shown that Banach\u2013Mazur distance between such a polytope and any symmetric convex body is large. In this note we introduce a new, averaging-type parameter to measure the asymmetry of polytopes. It turns out that, surprisingly, this new parameter is still very large, in fact it satisfies the same lower bound as the Banach\u2013Mazur distance. In a sense it shows the following phenomenon: if a convex polytope with small number of vertices is as close to a symmetric body as it can be, then most of its vertices are as bad as the worst one. We apply our results to provide a lower estimate on the vertex index of a symmetric convex body, which was recently introduced in (Bezdek, Litvak in Adv. Math. 215:626\u2013641, [2007]). Furthermore, we give the affirmative answer to a conjecture by Bezdek (Period. Math. Hung. 53:59\u201369, [2006]) on the quantitative illumination problem."}}
