But can we combine them to get provably better methods? Despite the simplicity of the question, little is known or done to find optimal combination methods that give provable improvements. In this paper, we present such a method by using a recently proposed principle of adaptation that relies on a faithful reconstruction of the gradients of the past data. Using this principle, we design a prior which combines two types of replay methods with a quadratic Bayesian weight-regularizer and achieves provably better gradient reconstructions. The combination improves performance on standard benchmarks such as Split CIFAR, Split TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1000, often achieving >80% of the batch performance by simply utilizing a memory of <10% of the past data. Our work shows that a good combination of replay and regularizer-based methods can be very effective in reducing forgetting, and can sometimes even completely eliminate it."}}

Traditional algorithms for training such models often require data to be stored on a single machine with compute performed by a single node, making them unsuitable for decentralised training on multiple devices. This deficiency has motivated the development of federated learning algorithms, which allow multiple data owners to train collaboratively and use a shared model whilst keeping local data private. However, many of these algorithms focus on obtaining point estimates of model parameters, rather than probabilistic estimates capable of capturing model uncertainty, which is essential in many applications. Variational inference (VI) has become the method of choice for fitting many modern probabilistic models. In this paper we introduce partitioned variational inference (PVI), a general framework for performing VI in the federated setting. We develop new supporting theory for PVI, demonstrating a number of properties that make it an attractive choice for practitioners; use PVI to unify a wealth of fragmented, yet related literature; and provide empirical results that showcase the effectiveness of PVI in a variety of federated settings."}}

Current practice often fixes the prior parameters to standard values or tunes them using heuristics or cross-validation. In this paper, we treat prior parameters in a distributional way by extending the model and collapsing the variational bound with respect to their posteriors. This leads to novel and tighter Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs) for performing variational inference (VI) in BNNs. Our experiments show that the new bounds significantly improve the performance of Gaussian mean-field VI applied to BNNs on a variety of data sets, demonstrating that mean-field VI works well even in deep models. We also find that the tighter ELBOs can be good optimization targets for learning the hyperparameters of hierarchical priors."}}

This is made possible by a combination of weight and function-space priors to reconstruct the gradients of the past, which recovers and generalizes many existing, but seemingly-unrelated, adaptation strategies. Training with simple first-order gradient methods can often recover the exact retrained model to an arbitrary accuracy by choosing a sufficiently large memory of the past data.

Features for each task are generated in the same way. This could be too restrictive, particularly when tasks are very distinct. We propose combining FiLM layers, a flexible way to enable task-specific feature modulation in CNNs, with an existing algorithm, Variational Continual Learning (VCL). We show that this addition consistently improves performance, particularly when tasks are more varied. Furthermore, we demonstrate how FiLM Layers can mitigate VCL's tendency to over-prune and help it use more model capacity. Finally, we find that FiLM Layers perform feature modulation as opposed to gating, making them more flexible than binary mask based approaches."}}

Recent works address this with weight regularisation. Functional regularisation, although computationally expensive, is expected to perform better, but rarely does so in practice. In this paper, we fix this issue by using a new functional-regularisation approach that utilises a few memorable past examples crucial to avoid forgetting. By using a Gaussian Process formulation of deep networks, our approach enables training in weight-space while identifying both the memorable past and a functional prior. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and opens a new direction for life-long learning where regularisation and memory-based methods are naturally combined."}}
