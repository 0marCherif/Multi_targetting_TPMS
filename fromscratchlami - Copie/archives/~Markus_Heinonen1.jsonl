We apply the approach to standard tasks in natural language inference (NLI) and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in terms of prediction accuracy and correlation with human annotation disagreements. We argue that the uncertainty representations in SWAG better reflect subjective interpretation and the natural variation that is also present in human language understanding. The results reveal the importance of uncertainty modeling, an often neglected aspect of neural language modeling, in NLU tasks."}}

These methods are often heuristics with poor theoretical justifications, and require iterative manual tuning. We propose a principled multiple shooting technique for neural ODEs that splits the trajectories into manageable short segments, which are optimized in parallel, while ensuring probabilistic control on continuity over consecutive segments. We derive variational inference for our shooting-based latent neural ODE models and propose amortized encodings of irregularly sampled trajectories with a transformer-based recognition network with temporal attention and relative positional encoding. We demonstrate efficient and stable training, and state-of-the-art performance on multiple large-scale benchmark datasets."}}

Inspired by diffusion models and the empirical success of coarse-to-fine modelling, we propose a new diffusion-like model that generates images through stochastically reversing the heat equation, a PDE that locally erases fine-scale information when run over the 2D plane of the image. We interpret the solution of the forward heat equation with constant additive noise as a variational approximation in the diffusion latent variable model. Our new model shows emergent qualitative properties not seen in standard diffusion models, such as disentanglement of overall colour and shape in images. Spectral analysis on natural images highlights connections to diffusion models and reveals an implicit coarse-to-fine inductive bias in them."}}

However, earlier works are based on approximative solutions or point estimates. We propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric model that uses Gaussian processes to infer posteriors of unknown ODE systems directly from data. We derive sparse variational inference with decoupled functional sampling to represent vector field posteriors. We also introduce a probabilistic shooting augmentation to enable efficient inference from arbitrarily long trajectories. The method demonstrates the benefit of computing vector field posteriors, with predictive uncertainty scores outperforming alternative methods on multiple ODE learning tasks."}}

Several works have proposed approaches to include specific physics-based constraints to avoid unrealistic modelling outcomes. While previous works focused on specific constraints and uniform spatial grids, we propose a novel approach for enforcing general pointwise, differential and integral constraints on unstructured spatial grids. The method is based on representing a black-box PDE model's output in terms of a function approximation and enforcing constraints directly on that function. We demonstrate applicability of our approach in learning PDE-driven systems and generating spatial fields with GANs, both on free-form spatial and temporal domains, and show how both kinds of models benefit from incorporation of physics-based constraints."}}

To avoid time-discretization approximation of the underlying process, we propose a continuous-time MBRL framework based on a novel actor-critic method. Our approach also infers the unknown state evolution differentials with Bayesian neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) to account for epistemic uncertainty. We implement and test our method on a new ODE-RL suite that explicitly solves continuous-time control systems. Our experiments illustrate that the model is robust against irregular and noisy data, is sample efficient, and can solve control problems which pose challenges to discrete-time MBRL methods."}}
