One promising solution to realize this goal is through meta-learning, also known as learning to learn, which has achieved promising results in few-shot learning. However, current approaches are still enormously different from human beings' learning process, especially in the ability to extract structural and transferable knowledge. This drawback makes current meta-learning frameworks non-interpretable and hard to extend to more complex tasks. We tackle this problem by introducing concept discovery to the few-shot learning problem, where we achieve more effective adaptation by meta-learning the structure among the data features, leading to a composite representation of the data. Our proposed method Concept-Based Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (COMAML) has been shown to achieve consistent improvements in the structured data for both synthesized datasets and real-world datasets."}}

Recently, the data augmentation based contrastive learning method has been extended from images to graphs. However, most prior works are directly adapted from the models designed for images. Unlike the data augmentation on images, the data augmentation on graphs is far less intuitive and much harder to provide high-quality contrastive samples, which are the key to the performance of contrastive learning models. This leaves much space for improvement over the existing graph contrastive learning frameworks. In this work, by introducing an adversarial graph view and an information regularizer, we propose a simple but effective method, Adversarial Graph Contrastive Learning (ARIEL), to extract informative contrastive samples within a reasonable constraint. It consistently outperforms the current graph contrastive learning methods in the node classification task over various real-world datasets and further improves the robustness of graph contrastive learning."}}

We hypothesize that capturing long-term temporal dependencies is the key to effective generation of dynamic scene graphs. We propose to learn the long-term dependencies in a video by capturing the object-level consistency and inter-object relationship dynamics over object-level long-term tracklets using transformers. Experimental results demonstrate that our Dynamic Scene Graph Detection Transformer (DSGDETR) outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on the benchmark dataset Action Genome. Our ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed approach. The source code is available at https://github.com/Shengyu-Feng/DSG-DETR"}}

Policy optimization under this setting is extremely challenging as: 1) the geometry of the objective function is hard to optimize efficiently; 2) the shift of data distributions causes high noise in the value estimation. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective policy iteration approach to batch RL using global optimization techniques known as continuation.  By constraining the difference between the learned policy and the behavior policy that generates the fixed trajectories, and continuously relaxing the constraint, our method 1) helps the agent escape local optima; 2) reduces the error in policy evaluation in the optimization procedure.   We present results on a variety of control tasks, game environments, and a recommendation task to empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method."}}

Recent work demonstrated that using a memory buffer of previous successful trajectories can result in more effective policies. However, existing methods may overly exploit past successful experiences, which can encourage the agent to adopt sub-optimal and myopic behaviors. In this work, instead of focusing on good experiences with limited diversity, we propose to learn a trajectory-conditioned policy to follow and expand diverse past trajectories from a memory buffer. Our method allows the agent to reach diverse regions in the state space and improve upon the past trajectories to reach new states. We empirically show that our approach significantly outperforms count-based exploration methods (parametric approach) and self-imitation learning (parametric approach with non-parametric memory) on various complex tasks with local optima. In particular, without using expert demonstrations or resetting to arbitrary states, we achieve the state-of-the-art scores under five billion number of frames, on challenging Atari games such as Montezuma\u2019s Revenge and Pitfall."}}
