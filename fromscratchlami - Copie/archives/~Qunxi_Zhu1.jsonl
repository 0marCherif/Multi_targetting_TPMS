Here, to achieve this task, we leverage neural networks to learn control policies using the information of the controlled systems in some prescribed regions.  Specifically, two learned control policies, i.e., the neural deterministic controller (NDC) and the neural stochastic controller (NSC), work effectively in the learning procedures that rely on, respectively, the well-known LaSalle-type theorem and the newly-established theorem for guaranteeing the stochastic stability in SDDEs. We theoretically investigate the performance of the proposed controllers in terms of convergence time and energy cost.  More practically and significantly, we improve our learned control policies through considering the situation where the controlled trajectories only evolve in some specific safety set. {\\color{black}  The practical validity of such control policies restricted in safety set is attributed to the theory that we further develop for safety and stability guarantees in SDDEs using the stochastic control barrier function and the spatial discretization}. We call this control as SYNC (\\textbf{S}afet\\textbf{Y}-aware \\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{C}ontrol).   The efficacy of all the articulated control policies, including the SYNC, is demonstrated systematically by using representative control problems."}}

Previous efforts and their developed algorithms, though falling into a category of model-free methodology, dealt with the time series mostly with a regular sampling rate. Here, we develop a data-driven and model-free framework for detecting UPOs in chaotic systems using the irregularly sampled time series. This framework articulates the neural differential equations (NDEs), a recently developed and powerful machine learning technique, with the adaptive delayed feedback (ADF) technique. Since the NDEs own the exceptional capability of accurate reconstruction of chaotic systems based on the observational time series with irregular sampling rates, UPOs detection in this scenario could be enhanced by an integration of the NDEs and the ADF technique. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the articulated framework on representative examples."}}

However, it is hard to obtain a unified and correct label via majority voting from multiple annotators for NER due to the large labeling space and complexity of this task. To address this problem, we aim to utilize the original multi-annotator labels directly. Particularly, we propose a Confidence-based Partial Label Learning (CPLL) method to integrate the prior confidence (given by annotators) and posterior confidences (learned by models) for crowd-annotated NER. This model learns a token- and content-dependent confidence via an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm by minimizing empirical risk. The true posterior estimator and confidence estimator perform iteratively to update the true posterior and confidence respectively. We conduct extensive experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets, which show that our model can improve performance effectively compared with strong baselines."}}

Recently, an augmented framework has been developed to overcome some limitations that emerged in the application of the original framework. In this paper, we propose a new class of continuous-depth neural networks with delay, named Neural Delay Differential Equations (NDDEs). To compute the corresponding gradients, we use the adjoint sensitivity method to obtain the delayed dynamics of the adjoint. Differential equations with delays are typically seen as dynamical systems of infinite dimension that possess more fruitful dynamics. Compared to NODEs, NDDEs have a stronger capacity of nonlinear representations. We use several illustrative examples to demonstrate this outstanding capacity. Firstly, we successfully model the delayed dynamics where the trajectories in the lower-dimensional phase space could be mutually intersected and even chaotic in a model-free or model-based manner. Traditional NODEs, without any argumentation, are not directly applicable for such modeling. Secondly, we achieve lower loss and higher accuracy not only for the data produced synthetically by complex models but also for the CIFAR10, a well-known image dataset. Our results on the NDDEs demonstrate that appropriately articulating the elements of dynamical systems into the network design is truly beneficial in promoting network performance."}}
