Training such models, however, can be a challenging task due to the topological constraints imposed by encoding to such structures. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically characterize obstructions to training autoencoders with geometric latent spaces. These include issues such as singularity (e.g. self-intersection), incorrect degree or winding number, and non-isometric homeomorphic embedding. We propose a method, isometric autoencoder, to improve the stability of training and convergence to an isometric mapping in geometric latent spaces. We perform an empirical evaluation of this method over 2 domains, which demonstrates that our approach can better circumvent the identified optimization problems."}}

APG samplers construct high-dimensional proposals by iterating over updates to lower-dimensional blocks of variables. We train each conditional proposal by minimizing the inclusive KL divergence with respect to the conditional posterior. To appropriately account for the size of the input data, we develop a new parameterization in terms of neural sufficient statistics. Experiments show that APG samplers can train highly structured deep generative models in an unsupervised manner, and achieve substantial improvements in inference accuracy relative to standard autoencoding variational methods."}}

Our experiments apply NVI to (a) sample from a multimodal distribution using a learned annealing path (b) learn heuristics that approximate the likelihood of future observations in a hidden Markov model and (c) to perform amortized inference in hierarchical deep generative models.

{"id": "H1N0i0luWH", "cdate": 1514764800000, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Bayesian Functional Optimization", "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BayesOpt) is a derivative-free approach for sequentially optimizing stochastic black-box functions. Standard BayesOpt, which has shown many successes in machine learning applications, assumes a finite dimensional domain which often is a parametric space. The parameter space is defined by the features used in the function approximations which are often selected manually. Therefore, the performance of BayesOpt inevitably depends on the quality of chosen features. This paper proposes a new Bayesian optimization framework that is able to optimize directly on the domain of function spaces. The resulting framework, Bayesian Functional Optimization (BFO), not only extends the application domains of BayesOpt to functional optimization problems but also relaxes the performance dependency on the chosen parameter space. We model the domain of functions as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and use the notion of Gaussian processes on a real separable Hilbert space. As a result, we are able to define traditional improvement-based (PI and EI) and optimistic acquisition functions (UCB) as functionals. We propose to optimize the acquisition functionals using analytic functional gradients that are also proved to be functions in a RKHS. We evaluate BFO in three typical functional optimization tasks: i) a synthetic functional optimization problem, ii) optimizing activation functions for a multi-layer perceptron neural network, and iii) a reinforcement learning task whose policies are modeled in RKHS."}}
