Studies on epidemic prediction and simulation have received increasing attention. However, the current methods suffer from three issues. First, most of the current studies focus on epidemic prediction, which can not provide adequate support for intervention policy making. Second, most of the current interventions are based on population groups rather than fine-grained individuals, which can not make the measures towards the infected people and may cause waste of medical resources. Third, current simulations are not efficient and flexible enough for large-scale complex systems. In this paper, we propose a new epidemic simulation framework called HMES to address the above three challenges. The proposed framework covers a full pipeline of epidemic simulation and enables comprehensive fine-grained control in a large scale. In addition, we conduct experiments on real COVID-19 data. HMES demonstrates more accurate modeling of disease transmission up to 300 million people and up to 3 times acceleration compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}}

Despite their success, many works have shown that existing approaches are mainly focused on low-frequency information which may not be pertinent to the task at hand. Recent efforts have been made to design new graph filters for wider frequency profiles, but it remains an open problem how to learn multi-scale disentangled node embeddings in the graph Fourier domain. In this paper, we propose a graph (signal) sampling and filtering framework, entitled Pyramid Graph Neural Network (PyGNN), which follows the Downsampling-Filtering-Upsampling-Decoding scheme. To be specific, we develop an \u03c9-bandlimited downsampling approach to split input graph into subgraphs for the reduction of high-frequency components, then perform spectral graph filters on subgraphs to achieve node embeddings with different frequency bands, and propose a Laplacian smoothing-based upsampling approach to extrapolate the node embedding on subgraphs to the full set of vertices on the original graph. In the end, we add frequency-aware gated units to decode node embeddings of different frequencies for downstream tasks. Results on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets show its superiority over state-of-the-art methods."}}

Learning-based methods are recently devised beyond traditional heuristic solvers. However, the efficiency and scalability hinder its applicability as reinforcement learning (RL) is often adopted in an auto-regressive node-by-node mapping manner to handle complex mapping constraints, for each coming request for mapping. Moreover, existing learning-based works often independently consider each online request, limiting the long-term online service performance. In this paper, we present a synergistic Global-And-Local learning approach for the VNE problem (GAL-VNE). At the global level across requests, RL is employed to capture the cross-request relation for better global resource accommodation to improve overall performance. At the local level within each request, we aim to replace the sequential decision-making procedure which relies much on the network size, with a more efficient one-shot solution generation scheme. The main challenge for such a one-shot model is how to encode the constraints under an end-to-end learning and inference paradigm. Accordingly, within the \"rank-then-search\" paradigm, we propose to first pretrain a graph neural network (GNN)-based node ranker with imitation supervision from an off-the-shelf solver (moderately expensive yet high quality), which is meanwhile regularized by a neighboring smooth prior. Then RL is used to finetune the GNN ranker whose supervision directly refers to the final (undifferentiable) business objectives concerning revenue and cost, etc. Experiments on benchmarks show that our method outperforms classic and learning-based methods in both efficacy and efficiency."}}

This paper aims to design an easy-to-use pipeline (termed as EasyDGL which is also due to its implementation by DGL toolkit) composed of three key modules with both strong fitting ability and interpretability. Specifically the proposed pipeline which involves encoding, training and interpreting: i) a temporal point process (TPP) modulated attention architecture to endow the continuous-time resolution with the coupled spatiotemporal dynamics of the observed graph with edge-addition events; ii) a principled loss composed of task-agnostic TPP posterior maximization based on observed events on the graph, and a task-aware loss with a masking strategy over dynamic graph, where the covered tasks include dynamic link prediction, dynamic node classification and node traffic forecasting; iii) interpretation of the model outputs (e.g., representations and predictions) with scalable perturbation-based quantitative analysis in the graph Fourier domain, which could more comprehensively reflect the behavior of the learned model. Extensive experimental results on public benchmarks show the superior performance of our EasyDGL for time-conditioned predictive tasks, and in particular demonstrate that EasyDGL can effectively quantify the predictive power of frequency content that a model learn from the evolving graph data."}}
