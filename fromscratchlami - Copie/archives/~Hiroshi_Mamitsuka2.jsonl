The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a standardized vocabulary that describes the phenotype abnormalities encountered in human disorders. However, the current HPO annotations are still incomplete. Thus, it is necessary to computationally predict human protein\u2013phenotype associations. In terms of current, cutting-edge computational methods for annotating proteins (such as functional annotation), three important features are (i) multiple network input, (ii) semi-supervised learning and (iii) deep graph convolutional network (GCN), whereas there are no methods with all these features for predicting HPO annotations of human protein."}}

We propose DIVERSE, a framework of Bayesian importance-weighted tri- and bi-matrix factorization(DIVERSE3 or DIVERSE2) to predict drug responses from data of cell lines, drugs, and gene interactions. DIVERSE integrates the data sources systematically, in a step-wise manner, examining the importance of each added data set in turn. More specifically, we sequentially integrate five different data sets, which have not all been combined in earlier bioinformatic methods for predicting drug responses. Empirical experiments show that DIVERSE clearly outperformed five other methods including three state-of-the-art approaches, under cross-validation, particularly in out-of-matrix prediction, which is closer to the setting of real use cases and more challenging than simpler in-matrix prediction.

We propose the reshaped tensor nuclear norm as a generalized approach to reshape tensors to be regularized by using the tensor nuclear norm. Furthermore, we propose the reshaped latent tensor nuclear norm to combine multiple reshaped tensors using the tensor nuclear norm. We analyze the generalization bounds for tensor completion models regularized by the proposed norms and show that the novel reshaping norms lead to lower Rademacher complexities. Through simulation and real-data experiments, we show that our proposed methods are favorably compared to existing tensor norms consolidating our theoretical claims."}}

It is thought to generalize both k-means clustering and agglomerative clustering. However, it is not known whether convex clustering preserves desirable properties of these algorithms. A common expectation is that convex clustering may learn difficult cluster types such as non-convex ones. Current understanding of convex clustering is limited to only consistency results on well-separated clusters. We show new understanding of its solutions. We prove that convex clustering can only learn convex clusters. We then show that the clusters have disjoint bounding balls with significant gaps. We further characterize the solutions, regularization hyperparameters, inclusterable cases and consistency."}}

However, 3D information of small molecules can reflect relative position of atoms more directly, which affects molecular properties. In this work, we present a new deep learning model called Drug3D-DTI for drug-target interaction prediction. Drug3D-DTI takes advantage of molecular spatial information, i.e., atom proximity in three-dimensional (3D) structures. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of Drug3D-DTI on two datasets with two tasks of regression and classification. In particular, we compared Drug3D-DTI with several existing methods including the two cutting-edge methods for compound-protein interaction prediction. From the experimental results, Drug3D-DTI clearly outperformed other methods under all settings. Further, this performance improvement was validated by ablation experiments and a case study. The implementation of Drug3D-DTI is available at (https://github.com/zhiruiliao/Drug3D-DTI)."}}
