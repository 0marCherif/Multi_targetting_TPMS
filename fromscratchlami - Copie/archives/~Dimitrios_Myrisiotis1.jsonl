In this work, we introduce and study the computational problem of determining the TV distance between two product distributions over the domain $\\{0,1\\}^n$. We establish the following results. 1. Exact computation of TV distance between two product distributions is $\\#\\mathsf{P}$-complete. This is in stark contrast with other distance measures such as KL, Chi-square, and Hellinger which tensorize over the marginals. 2. Given two product distributions $P$ and $Q$ with marginals of $P$ being at least $1/2$ and marginals of $Q$ being at most the respective marginals of $P$, there exists a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for computing the TV distance between $P$ and $Q$. In particular, this leads to an efficient approximation scheme for the interesting case when $P$ is an arbitrary product distribution and $Q$ is the uniform distribution. We pose the question of characterizing the complexity of approximating the TV distance between two arbitrary product distributions as a basic open problem in computational statistics."}}

A recent line of work exhibited \"hardness magnification\" phenomena for MCSP: A very weak lower bound for MCSP implies a breakthrough result in complexity theory. For example, McKay, Murray, and Williams (STOC 2019) implicitly showed that, for some constant \u03bc\u2081 > 0, if MCSP[2^{\u03bc\u2081\u22c5 n}] cannot be computed by a one-tape Turing machine (with an additional one-way read-only input tape) running in time N^{1.01}, then P\u2260NP. In this paper, we present the following new lower bounds against one-tape Turing machines and branching programs: 1) A randomized two-sided error one-tape Turing machine (with an additional one-way read-only input tape) cannot compute MCSP[2^{\u03bc\u2082\u22c5n}] in time N^{1.99}, for some constant \u03bc\u2082 > \u03bc\u2081. 2) A non-deterministic (or parity) branching program of size o(N^{1.5}/log N) cannot compute MKTP, which is a time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity analogue of MCSP. This is shown by directly applying the Ne\u010diporuk method to MKTP, which previously appeared to be difficult. 3) The size of any non-deterministic, co-non-deterministic, or parity branching program computing MCSP is at least N^{1.5-o(1)}. These results are the first non-trivial lower bounds for MCSP and MKTP against one-tape Turing machines and non-deterministic branching programs, and essentially match the best-known lower bounds for any explicit functions against these computational models. The first result is based on recent constructions of pseudorandom generators for read-once oblivious branching programs (ROBPs) and combinatorial rectangles (Forbes and Kelley, FOCS 2018; Viola 2019). En route, we obtain several related results: 1) There exists a (local) hitting set generator with seed length O\u0303(\u221aN) secure against read-once polynomial-size non-deterministic branching programs on N-bit inputs. 2) Any read-once co-non-deterministic branching program computing MCSP must have size at least 2^\u03a9\u0303(N)."}}

In a seminal work, Liu and Pass (FOCS 2020) proved that the average-case hardness of computing time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity is equivalent to the existence of OWFs. It remained an open problem to establish such an equivalence for the average-case hardness of some natural NP-complete problem. In this paper, we make progress on this question by studying a conditional variant of the Minimum KT-complexity Problem (MKTP), which we call McKTP, as follows. 1) First, we prove that if McKTP is average-case hard on a polynomial fraction of its instances, then there exist OWFs. 2) Then, we observe that McKTP is NP-complete under polynomial-time randomized reductions. 3) Finally, we prove that the existence of OWFs implies the nontrivial average-case hardness of McKTP. Thus the existence of OWFs is inextricably linked to the average-case hardness of this NP-complete problem. In fact, building on recently-announced results of Ren and Santhanam [Rahul Ilango et al., 2021], we show that McKTP is hard-on-average if and only if there are logspace-computable OWFs."}}

We get new and improved lower bounds for MCSP that almost match the best-known lower bounds against several circuit models. Specifically, we show that computing MCSP, on functions with a truth table of length N, requires \u2022 N3\u2212o(1)-size de Morgan formulas, improving the recent N2\u2212o(1) lower bound by Hirahara and Santhanam (CCC, 2017), \u2022 N2\u2212o(1)-size formulas over an arbitrary basis or general branching programs (no non-trivial lower bound was known for MCSP against these models), and \u2022 2\u03a9(N1/(d+1.01))-size depth-d AC0 circuits, improving the (implicit, in their work) exponential size lower bound by Allender et\u00a0al.
