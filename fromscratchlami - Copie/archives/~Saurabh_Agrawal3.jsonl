In this paper, we introduce multipoles, a novel class of linear relationships between more than two time series. A multipole is a set of time series that have strong linear dependence among themselves, with the requirement that each time series makes a significant contribution to the linear dependence. We demonstrate that most interesting multipoles can be identified as cliques of negative correlations in a correlation network. Such cliques are typically rare in a real-world correlation network, which allows us to find almost all multipoles efficiently using a clique-enumeration approach. Using our proposed framework, we demonstrate the utility of multipoles in discovering new physical phenomena in two scientific domains: climate science and neuroscience. In particular, we discovered several multipole relationships that are reproducible in multiple other independent datasets and lead to novel domain insights."}}

Recently, differential privacy was explored as a defense technique against data poisoning attacks in the typical machine learning setting. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of differential privacy against such attacks on matrix factorization based collaborative filtering systems. Concretely, we conduct extensive experiments for evaluating robustness to injection of malicious user profiles by simulating common types of shilling attacks on real-world data and comparing the predictions of typical matrix factorization with differentially private matrix factorization."}}

We define the notion of a sub-interval relationship (SIR) to capture such interactions that are prominent only in certain sub-intervals of time. To that end, we propose a fast-optimal guaranteed algorithm to find most interesting SIR relationship in a pair of time series. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of our method in climate science domain based on a real-world dataset along with its scalability scope and obtain useful domain insights."}}

Any textual data either available on the Internet or off-line (like newspaper data, Wikipedia dump, etc) is basically connected information which cannot be treated isolated for its wholesome semantics. There is a need for an automated retrieval process with proper information extraction to structure the data for relevant and fast text analytics. The first big challenge is the conversion of unstructured textual data to structured data. Unlike other databases, graph databases handle relationships and connections very elegantly. Our project aims at developing a graph based information extraction and retrieval system."}}

Discovery of complex patterns of relationships between individual time-series, using data-driven approaches can improve our understanding of real-world systems. While traditional approaches typically study relationships between two entire time series, many interesting relationships in real-world applications exist in small sub-intervals of time while remaining absent or feeble during other sub-intervals. In this paper, we define the notion of a sub-interval relationship (SIR) to capture inter- actions between two time series that are prominent only in certain sub-intervals of time. We propose a novel and efficient approach to find most interesting SIR in a pair of time series. We evaluate our proposed approach on two real-world datasets from climate science and neuroscience domain and demonstrated the scalability and computational efficiency of our proposed approach. We further evaluated our discovered SIRs based on a randomization based procedure. Our results indicated the existence of several such relationships that are statistically significant, some of which were also found to have physical interpretation."}}

Traditional approaches for mining relationships focus on discovering pair-wise relationships in the data. In this work, we define a novel relationship pattern involving three interacting time series, which we refer to as a tripole. We show that tripoles capture interesting relationship patterns in the data that are not possible to be captured using traditionally studied pair-wise relationships. We demonstrate the utility of tripoles in multiple real-world datasets from various domains including climate science and neuroscience. In particular, our approach is able to discover tripoles that are statistically significant, reproducible across multiple independent data sets, and lead to novel domain insights."}}
