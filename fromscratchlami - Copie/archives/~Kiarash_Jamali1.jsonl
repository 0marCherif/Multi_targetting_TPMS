At sufficient resolution, the cryo-EM maps, along with some knowledge about the imaged molecules, allow de novo atomic modelling. Typically, this is done through a laborious manual process. Recent advances in machine learning applications to protein structure prediction show potential for automating this process. Taking inspiration from these techniques, we have built ModelAngelo for automated model building of proteins in cryo-EM maps. ModelAngelo first uses a residual convolutional neural network (CNN) to initialize a graph representation with nodes assigned to individual amino acids of the proteins in the map and edges representing the protein chain. The graph is then refined with a graph neural network (GNN) that combines the cryo-EM data, the amino acid sequence data and prior knowledge about protein geometries. The GNN refines the geometry of the protein chain and classifies the amino acids for each of its nodes. The final graph is post-processed with a hidden Markov model (HMM) search to map each protein chain to entries in a user provided sequence file. Application to 28 test cases shows that ModelAngelo outperforms state-of-the-art and approximates manual building for cryo-EM maps with resolutions better than 3.5 A."}}

In this technique, many noisy, two-dimensional projection images of protein molecules in unknown poses are combined into one or more three-dimensional reconstructions. The presence of multiple structural states in the data represents a major bottleneck in existing processing pipelines, often requiring expert user supervision. Variational auto-encoders (VAEs) have recently been proposed as an attractive means for learning the data manifold of data sets with a large number of different states. These methods are based on a coordinate-based approach, similar to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), to make volumetric reconstructions from 2D image data in Fourier-space. Although NeRF is a powerful method for real-space reconstruction, many of the benefits of the method do not transfer to Fourier-space, e.g. inductive bias for spatial locality. We present an approach where the VAE reconstruction is expressed on a volumetric grid, and demonstrate how this model can be trained efficiently through a novel backpropagation method that exploits the sparsity of the projection operation in Fourier-space. We achieve improved results on a simulated data set and at least equivalent results on an experimental data set when compared to the coordinate-based approach, while also substantially lowering computational cost. Our approach is computationally more efficient, especially in inference, enabling interactive analysis of the latent space by the user."}}

These test samples still contain enough features to map them to the same class as their unperturbed counterpart. Current architectures exhibit rapid degradation of accuracy when trained on standard datasets but then used to classify perturbed samples of that data. To address this, we present a novel architecture named DeepConsensus that significantly improves generalization to these test-time perturbations. Our key insight is that deep neural networks should directly consider summaries of low and high level features when making classifications. Existing convolutional neural networks can be augmented with DeepConsensus, leading to improved resistance against large and small perturbations on MNIST, EMNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN datasets."}}
