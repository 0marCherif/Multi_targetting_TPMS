Abstract We propose an anomaly detection method for multi-variate scientific data based on analysis of high-order joint moments. Using kurtosis as a reliable measure of outliers, we suggest that principal kurtosis vectors, by analogy to principal component analysis (PCA) vectors, signify the principal directions along which outliers appear. The inception of an anomaly, then, manifests as a change in the principal values and vectors of kurtosis. Obtaining the principal kurtosis vectors requires decomposing a fourth order joint cumulant tensor for which we use a simple, computationally less expensive approach that involves performing a singular value decomposition (SVD) over the matricized tensor. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on synthetic data, and develop an algorithm to identify the occurrence of a spatial and/or temporal anomalous event in scientific phenomena. The algorithm decomposes the data into several spatial sub-domains and time steps to identify regions with such events. Feature moment metrics, based on the alignments of the principal kurtosis vectors, are computed at each sub-domain and time step for all features to quantify their relative importance towards the overall kurtosis in the data. Accordingly, spatial and temporal anomaly metrics for each sub-domain are proposed using the Hellinger distance of the feature moment metric distribution from a suitable nominal distribution. We apply the algorithm to two turbulent auto-ignition combustion cases and demonstrate that the anomaly metrics reliably capture the occurrence of auto-ignition in relevant spatial sub-domains at the right time steps."}}

Data are not saved at every time step to prevent excessive memory usage and because data I/O is often a bottleneck in the workflow. However, in many dynamical systems, events of interest occur locally in space and time. In these cases, a global data save across all processors at regular intervals is both inefficient and ineffective: it will result in data being saved over regions where nothing of interest is occurring, and it will miss an event of interest that occurs at time steps between data saves. What is needed is a method of automatically detecting an event of interest as it occurs so that a data save can be triggered on the relevant processors. We propose a method of detecting such events of interest using feature importance metrics. This method requires very little communication between processors, thereby lending itself to implementation in a high performance computing setting."}}

The unique challenge of adapting powerful but high-latency models to realtime network streams is the basis of our cyber security project. In this paper we discuss our use of NoSQL databases in a framework that enables the application of computationally expensive models against a real-time network data stream. We describe how this approach transforms the highly constrained (and sometimes arcane) world of real-time network analysis into a more developer friendly model that relaxes many of the traditional constraints associated with streaming data. Our primary use of the system is for conducting streaming text analysis and classification activities on a network link receiving ~200,000 emails per day."}}

Often, the rule collections extracted from existing data-mining methods can be far too large to be carefully examined and understood by the data analysts. In this paper, we address exactly this issue of overwhelmingly large rule collections by introducing and studying the following problem: Given a large collection R of association rules we want to pick a subset of them S \u2286 R that best represents the original collection R as well as the dataset from which R was extracted. We first quantify the notion of the goodness of a ruleset using two very simple and intuitive definitions. Based on these definitions we then formally define and study the corresponding optimization problems of picking the best ruleset S \u2286 R. We propose algorithms for solving these problems and present experiments to show that our algorithms work well for real datasets and lead to large reduction in the size of the original rule collection."}}
