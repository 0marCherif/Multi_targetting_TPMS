A distributed storage system (DSS) can store big amounts of data for a long time over possibly unreliable servers. As for the privacy concern of the users, much effort has been spent in trying to find systems and schemes that allow users to communicate, search, upload and download files while maintaining their privacy. One of those schemes is private information retrieval (PIR). PIR allows the users to hide the identity of files they request from a DSS. In other words, a PIR scheme allows the user to retrieve any file from a DSS without revealing the file identity to any of the servers. It goes without saying that, to achieve privacy, the user should download a bigger amount of data than the size of the desired file. The extra amount of data downloaded is quantified by the communication complexity of a PIR scheme. Naturally, downloading all the data from the DSS hides the identity of the desired file, but has a very high communication complexity, especially as the number of files in a DSS is typically very large.\u00a0Moreover, this also raises the question of the server privacy, meaning that the user should not be able to retrieve any extra information about the undesired files while retrieving a certain file. Schemes taking into account the server privacy are called symmetric PIR (SPIR) schemes. This thesis focuses on constructing PIR schemes for different DSSs with low communication cost. We study different DSSs which reduce the storage cost of the system while providing reliability. We construct PIR schemes on such systems, where we consider both cases, the case where the servers in the DSS do not communicate, and the case where some subsets of the servers communicate in an effort to figure out the desired file identity. Moreover, we consider the SPIR problem, and consider the case where some servers may be unresponsive, such that they do not respond to the sent query, and the case where the servers may be malicious or unsynchronized and thus give false information to the user. Last but not least, this thesis also considers schemes providing privacy for users requesting data from a DSS over a random linear network."}}

The DSS is coded by an (n, k, d) maximum distance separable code to store the data reliably on unreliable storage nodes. Some of these nodes can be spies which report to a third party, such as an oppressive regime, which data is being requested by the user. An information theoretic PIR scheme ensures that a user can satisfy its request while revealing no information on which data is being requested to the nodes. A user can trivially achieve PIR by downloading all the data in the DSS. However, this is not a feasible solution due to its high communication cost. We construct PIR schemes with low download communication cost. When there is b = 1 spy node in the DSS, in other words, no collusion between the nodes, we construct PIR schemes with download cost 1/1-R per unit of requested data (R = k/n is the code rate), achieving the information theoretic limit for linear schemes. The proposed schemes are universal since they depend on the code rate, but not on the generator matrix of the code. Also, if b \u2264 n-\u03b4k nodes collude, with \u03b4 = n-b/k, we construct linear PIR schemes with download cost b+\u03b4k/\u03b4."}}

As of now, PIR schemes have been proposed for several kinds of storage systems, including replicated and MDS-coded data. In this paper, the problem of constructing a PIR scheme on regenerating codes is considered. A regenerating code is a storage code whose codewords are distributed among $n$ nodes, enabling efficient storage of files, as well as low-bandwidth retrieval of files and repair of nodes. In this work, a PIR scheme on regenerating codes is constructed, using the product-matrix (PM) framework of Rashmi, Shah and Kumar. Both the minimum-bandwidth (MBR) and minimum-storage (MSR) settings are considered, and the structure given by the PM framework is used in order to reduce the download communication complexity of our schemes."}}

Much attention has been paid to the case of the database being encoded across several servers, subsets of which can collude to attempt to deduce the requested file. With the goal of studying the achievable PIR rates in realistic scenarios, we generalize results for coded data from the case of all subsets of servers of size $t$ colluding, to arbitrary subsets of the servers. We investigate the effectiveness of previous strategies in this new scenario, and present new results in the case where the servers are partitioned into disjoint colluding groups."}}
