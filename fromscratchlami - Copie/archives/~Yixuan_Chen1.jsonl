We first theoretically emphasize the importance of two properties of over-parameterized models, i.e., the convergence gap and the generalization gap. Subsequent analyses unveil that these two gaps can be upper-bounded by the ratio of the Lipschitz constant and the Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (PL) constant, a crucial term abbreviated as the \\emph{condition number}. Such discoveries have led to a structured pruning method with a novel pruning criterion. That is, we devise a gating network that dynamically detects and masks out those poorly-behaved nodes of a deep model during the training session. To this end, this gating network is learned via minimizing the \\emph{condition number} of the target model, and this process can be implemented as an extra regularization loss term. Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baselines in terms of both training efficiency and test performance, exhibiting the potential of generalizing to a variety of deep network architectures and tasks."}}

A fundamental challenge of multimodal fake news detection lies in the inherent ambiguity across different content modalities, i.e., decisions made from unimodalities may disagree with each other, which may lead to inferior multimodal fake news detection. To address this issue, we formulate the cross-modal ambiguity learning problem from an information-theoretic perspective and propose CAFE \u2014 an ambiguity-aware multimodal fake news detection method. CAFE consists of 1) a cross-modal alignment module to transform the heterogeneous unimodality features into a shared semantic space, 2) a cross-modal ambiguity learning module to estimate the ambiguity between different modalities, and 3) a cross-modal fusion module to capture the cross-modal correlations. CAFE improves fake news detection accuracy by judiciously and adaptively aggregating unimodal features and cross-modal correlations, i.e., relying on unimodal features when cross-modal ambiguity is weak and referring to cross-modal correlations when cross-modal ambiguity is strong. Experimental studies on two widely used datasets (Twitter and Weibo) demonstrate that CAFE outperforms state-of-the-art fake news detection methods by 2.2-18.9% and 1.7-11.4% on accuracy, respectively."}}

Rumors are easy to emerge and spread in the crowds especially in Online Social Network (OSN), due to its openness and extensive amount of users. Therefore, rumor detection in OSN is a very challenging and urgent issue. In this paper, we propose an Attention-Residual network combined with CNN (ARC), which is based on the content features for rumor detection. First, we build a data encoding model based on word-level data for contextual feature representation. Second, we propose a residual framework based on fine-tuned attention mechanism to capture long-range dependency. Third, we apply convolution neural network with varying window size to select important components and local features. Experiments on two twitter datasets demonstrate that the proposed model has better performance than other content-based methods both in rumor detection and early rumor verification. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first work that utilize attention model in conjunction with residual network on rumor detection."}}
