While continuous latent variables can be efficiently inferred, fitting mixed discrete-continuous models remains challenging despite recent progress, especially when the discrete factor dimensionality is large. A pressing application for such mixture representations is the analysis of single-cell omic datasets to understand neuronal diversity and its molecular underpinnings. Here, we propose an unsupervised variational framework using multiple interacting networks called cpl-mixVAE that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in high-dimensional discrete settings. cpl-mixVAE introduces a consensus constraint on discrete factors of variability across the networks, which regularizes the mixture representations at the time of training. We justify the use of this framework with theoretical results and validate it with experiments on benchmark datasets. We demonstrate that our approach discovers interpretable discrete and continuous variables describing neuronal identity in two single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, each profiling over a hundred cortical neuron types."}}

We study this problem by proposing an unsupervised framework called coupled mixture VAE (cpl-mixVAE), which utilizes multiple interacting autoencoding agents. The individual agents operate on augmented copies of training samples to learn mixture representations, while being encouraged to reach consensus on the categorical assignments. We provide theoretical justification to motivate the use of a multi-agent framework, and formulate it as a variational inference problem. We benchmark our approach on MNIST and dSprites, achieving state-of-the-art categorical assignments while preserving interpretability of the continuous factors. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach in jointly identifying cell types and type-specific, activity-regulated genes for a single-cell gene expression dataset profiling over 100 cortical neuron types."}}
