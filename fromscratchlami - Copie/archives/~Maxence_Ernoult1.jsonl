As such, it is important to explore learning algorithms that come with strong theoretical guarantees and can match the performance of backpropagation (BP) on complex tasks. One such algorithm is Difference Target Propagation (DTP), a biologically-plausible learning algorithm whose close relation with Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization has been recently established. However, the conditions under which this connection rigorously holds preclude layer-wise training of the feedback pathway synaptic weights (which is more biologically plausible). Moreover, good alignment between DTP weight updates and loss gradients is only loosely guaranteed and under very specific conditions for the architecture being trained. In this paper, we propose a novel feedback weight training scheme that ensures both that DTP approximates BP and that layer-wise feedback weight training can be restored without sacrificing any theoretical guarantees. Our theory is corroborated by experimental results and we report the best performance ever achieved by DTP on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 32$\\times$32"}}

Neuroscience suggests that biological synapses avoid this issue through the process of synaptic consolidation and metaplasticity: the plasticity itself changes upon repeated synaptic events. In this work, we show that this concept of metaplasticity can be transferred to a particular type of deep neural networks, binarized neural networks, to reduce catastrophic forgetting."}}

The parameter updates of the neural network during the credit assignment phase have been shown mathematically to approach the gradients provided by Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when the network is infinitesimally nudged toward its target. In practice, however, training a network with the gradient estimates provided by EP does not scale to visual tasks harder than MNIST. In this work, we show that a bias in the gradient estimate of EP, inherent in the use of finite nudging, is responsible for this phenomenon and that cancelling it allows training deep ConvNets by EP. We show that this bias can be greatly reduced by using symmetric nudging (a positive nudging and a negative one). We also generalize previous EP equations to the case of cross-entropy loss (by opposition to squared error). As a result of these advances, we are able to achieve a test error of 11.7% on CIFAR-10 by EP, which approaches the one achieved by BPTT and provides a major improvement with respect to the standard EP approach with same-sign nudging that gives 86% test error. We also apply these techniques to train an architecture with asymmetric forward and backward connections, yielding a 13.2% test error. These results highlight EP as a compelling biologically-plausible approach to compute error gradients in deep neural networks."}}

It applies to RNNs fed by a static input x that settle to a steady state, such as Hopfield networks. EP is similar to BP in that in the second phase of training, an error signal propagates backwards in the layers of the network, but contrary to BP, the learning rule of EP is spatially local. Nonetheless, EP suffers from two major limitations. On the one hand, due to its formulation in terms of real-time dynamics, EP entails long simulation times, which limits its applicability to practical tasks. On the other hand, the biological plausibility of EP is limited by the fact that its learning rule is not local in time: the synapse update is performed after the dynamics of the second phase have converged and requires information of the first phase that is no longer available physically. Our work addresses these two issues and aims at widening the spectrum of EP from standard machine learning models to more bio-realistic neural networks. First, we propose a discrete-time formulation of EP which enables to simplify equations, speed up training and extend EP to CNNs. Our CNN model achieves the best performance ever reported on MNIST with EP. Using the same discrete-time formulation, we introduce Continual Equilibrium Propagation (C-EP): the weights of the network are adjusted continually in the second phase of training using local information in space and time. We show that in the limit of slow changes of synaptic strengths and small nudging, C-EP is equivalent to BPTT (Theorem 1). We numerically demonstrate Theorem 1 and C-EP training on MNIST and generalize it to the bio-realistic situation of a neural network with asymmetric connections between neurons."}}

Given an input $x$ and associated target $y$, EP proceeds in two phases: in the first phase neurons evolve freely towards a first steady state; in the second phase output neurons are nudged towards $y$ until they reach a second steady state. However, in existing implementations of EP, the learning rule is not local in time: the weight update is performed after the dynamics of the second phase have converged and requires information of the first phase that is no longer available physically. In this work, we propose a version of EP named Continual Equilibrium Propagation (C-EP) where neuron and synapse dynamics occur simultaneously throughout the second phase, so that the weight update becomes local in time. Such a learning rule local both in space and time opens the possibility of an extremely energy efficient hardware implementation of EP. We prove theoretically that, provided the learning rates are sufficiently small, at each time step of the second phase the dynamics of neurons and synapses follow the gradients of the loss given by BPTT (Theorem 1). We demonstrate training with C-EP on MNIST and generalize C-EP to neural networks where neurons are connected by asymmetric connections. We show through experiments that the more the network updates follows the gradients of BPTT, the best it performs in terms of training. These results bring EP a step closer to biology by better complying with hardware constraints while maintaining its intimate link with backpropagation."}}

Equilibrium Propagation is a promising alternative to backpropagation as it only involves local computations, but hardware-oriented studies have so far focused on rate-based networks. In this work, we develop a spiking neural network algorithm called EqSpike, compatible with neuromorphic systems, which learns by Equilibrium Propagation. Through simulations, we obtain a test recognition accuracy of 97.6% on MNIST, similar to rate-based Equilibrium Propagation, and comparing favourably to alternative learning techniques for spiking neural networks. We show that EqSpike implemented in silicon neuromorphic technology could reduce the energy consumption of inference and training respectively by three orders and two orders of magnitude compared to GPUs. Finally, we also show that during learning, EqSpike weight updates exhibit a form of Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity, highlighting a possible connection with biology."}}
