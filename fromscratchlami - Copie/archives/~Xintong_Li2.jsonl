In this setting, only a subset of the labels are observed at training time, but we have access to metric information that relates the labels---a common scenario in zero-shot learning, hierarchical classification, and structured prediction. Our technique adapts trained models to produce predictions of unobserved classes. We provide three theoretical insights. First, we give a characterization of the scenarios in which it is possible to predict any unobserved class. Next, we introduce an optimal active learning-like next class selection procedure for when it is not possible to do so. Lastly, we study learning-theoretic tradeoffs between label space richness, sample complexity, and model dimension. Empirical results show that it is possible to use our approach to gain up to 19.5% improvement on pre-trained zero-shot models like CLIP."}}

It replaces hand-labeling data with aggregating multiple noisy-but-cheap label estimates expressed by labeling functions (LFs). While it has been used successfully in many domains, weak supervision's application scope is limited by the difficulty of constructing labeling functions for domains with complex or high-dimensional features. To address this, a handful of methods have proposed automating the LF design process using a small set of ground truth labels. In this work, we introduce AutoWS-Bench-101: a framework for evaluating automated WS (AutoWS) techniques in challenging WS settings---a set of diverse application domains on which it has been previously difficult or impossible to apply traditional WS techniques. While AutoWS is a promising direction toward expanding the application-scope of WS, the emergence of powerful methods such as zero-shot foundation models reveal the need to understand how AutoWS techniques compare or cooperate with modern zero-shot or few-shot learners. This informs the central question of AutoWS-Bench-101: given an initial set of 100 labels for each task, we ask whether a practitioner should use an AutoWS method to generate additional labels or use some simpler baseline, such as zero-shot predictions from a foundation model or supervised learning. We observe that it is necessary for AutoWS methods to incorporate signal from foundation models if they are to outperform simple few-shot baselines, and AutoWS-Bench-101 promotes future research in this direction. We conclude with a thorough ablation study of AutoWS methods. "}}
