Our \"lazy\" method leverages a novel unified objective, Performance Difference via Advantage in Model, to capture the performance difference between the learned policy and expert policy under the true dynamics. This objective demonstrates that optimizing the expected policy advantage in the learned model under an exploration distribution is sufficient for policy computation, resulting in a significant boost in computational efficiency compared to traditional planning methods. Additionally, the unified objective uses a value moment matching term for model fitting, which is aligned with the model's usage during policy computation. We present two no-regret algorithms to optimize the proposed objective, and demonstrate their statistical and computational gains compared to existing MBRL methods through simulated benchmarks."}}

The framework mitigates the challenges that arise in both pure offline and online RL settings, allowing for the design of simple and highly effective algorithms, in both theory and practice. We demonstrate these advantages by adapting the classical Q learning/iteration algorithm to the hybrid setting, which we call Hybrid Q-Learning or Hy-Q. In our theoretical results, we prove that the algorithm is both computationally and statistically efficient whenever the offline dataset supports a high-quality policy and the environment has bounded bilinear rank. Notably, we require no assumptions on the coverage provided by the initial distribution, in contrast with guarantees for policy gradient/iteration methods. In our experimental results, we show that Hy-Q with neural network function approximation outperforms state-of-the-art online, offline, and hybrid RL baselines on challenging benchmarks, including Montezuma\u2019s Revenge."}}

The goal is to design an algorithm that (1) finds an $\\varepsilon$-equilibrium policy sample efficiently without prior knowledge of the environment or the representation, and (2) permits a deep-learning friendly implementation. We leverage representation learning and present a model-based and a model-free approach to construct an effective representation from collected data. For both approaches, the algorithm achieves a sample complexity of poly$(H,d,A,1/\\varepsilon)$, where $H$ is the game horizon, $d$ is the dimension of the feature vector, $A$ is the size of the joint action space and $\\varepsilon$ is the optimality gap. When the number of players is large, the above sample complexity can scale exponentially with the number of players in the worst case. To address this challenge, we consider Markov Games with a factorized transition structure and present an algorithm that escapes such exponential scaling. To our best knowledge, this is the first sample-efficient algorithm for multi-agent general-sum Markov games that incorporates (non-linear) function approximation.
