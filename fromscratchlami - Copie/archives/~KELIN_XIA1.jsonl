Biologically, protein\u2013protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 surface spike (S) protein and human ACE2 protein are the key mechanism behind the COVID-19 disease. In this study, we provide insights into interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and ACE2, and propose topological indices to quantitatively characterize the impact of mutations on binding affinity changes (\u0394\u0394G). In our model, a series of nested simplicial complexes and their related adjacency matrices at various different scales are generated from a specially designed filtration process, based on the 3D structures of spike-ACE2 protein complexes. We develop a set of multiscale simplicial complexes-based topological indices, for the first time. Unlike previous graph network models, which give only a qualitative analysis, our topological indices can provide a quantitative prediction of the binding affinity change caused by mutations and achieve great accuracy. In particular, for mutations that happened at specifical amino acids, such as Polar amino acids or Arginine amino acids, the correlation between our topological gravity model index and binding affinity change, in terms of Pearson correlation coefficient, can be higher than 0.8. As far as we know, this is the first time multiscale topological indices have been used in the quantitative analysis of protein\u2013protein interactions."}}

In this paper, we explain why structures that are persistent with respect to changes in length and time scales are proper effective variables, and illustrate how persistent structures can be identified from the spectra and Fiedler vector of the graph Laplacian at different stages of the topological data analysis (TDA) filtration process for twelve toy models. We then investigated four market crashes, three of which were related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In all four crashes, a persistent gap opens up in the Laplacian spectra when we go from a normal phase to a crash phase. In the crash phase, the persistent structure associated with the gap remains distinguishable up to a characteristic length scale \u03f5* where the first non-zero Laplacian eigenvalue changes most rapidly. Before \u03f5*, the distribution of components in the Fiedler vector is predominantly bi-modal, and this distribution becomes uni-modal after \u03f5*. Our findings hint at the possibility of understanding market crashs in terms of both continuous and discontinuous changes. Beyond the graph Laplacian, we can also employ Hodge Laplacians of higher order for future research."}}

In our feature learning process, sequence information is transformed into a fingerprint vector, and structural information is encoded through a GAT module into another vector.

Efficient characterization of PPIs at the molecular level is key to the fundamental understanding of PPI mechanisms. Even with the gigantic amount of PPI models from graphs, networks, geometry and topology, it remains as a great challenge to design functional models that efficiently characterize the complicated multiphysical information within PPIs. Here we propose persistent Tor-algebra (PTA) model for a unified algebraic representation of the multiphysical interactions. Mathematically, our PTA is inherently algebraic data analysis. In our PTA model, protein structures and interactions are described as a series of face rings and Tor modules, from which PTA model is developed. The multiphysical information within/between biomolecules are implicitly characterized by PTA and further represented as PTA barcodes. To test our PTA models, we consider PTA-based ensemble learning for PPI binding affinity prediction. The two most commonly used datasets, i.e. SKEMPI and AB-Bind, are employed. It has been found that our model outperforms all the existing models as far as we know.

However, a great challenge still remains for highly efficient molecular representations. Currently, covalent-bond-based molecular graphs are the de facto standard for representing molecular topology at the atomic level. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that molecular graphs constructed only from non-covalent bonds can achieve similar or even better results than covalent-bond-based models in molecular property prediction. This demonstrates the great potential of novel molecular representations beyond the de facto standard of covalent-bond-based molecular graphs. Based on the finding, we propose molecular geometric deep learning (Mol-GDL). The essential idea is to incorporate a more general molecular representation into GDL models. In our Mol-GDL, molecular topology is modeled as a series of molecular graphs, each focusing on a different scale of atomic interactions. In this way, both covalent interactions and non-covalent interactions are incorporated into the molecular representation on an equal footing. We systematically test Mol-GDL on fourteen commonly-used benchmark datasets. The results show that our Mol-GDL can achieve a better performance than state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

They are developed to incorporate the geometric and topological information of non-Euclidian data into the end-to-end deep learning architectures. Motivated by the recent success of discrete Ricci curvature in graph neural network (GNNs), we propose TorGNN, an analytic Torsion enhanced Graph Neural Network model. The essential idea is to characterize graph local structures with an analytic torsion based weight formula. Mathematically, analytic torsion is a topological invariant that can distinguish spaces which are homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic. In our TorGNN, for each edge, a corresponding local simplicial complex is identified, then the analytic torsion (for this local simplicial complex) is calculated, and further used as a weight (for this edge) in message-passing process. Our TorGNN model is validated on link prediction tasks from sixteen different types of networks and node classification tasks from three types of networks. It has been found that our TorGNN can achieve superior performance on both tasks, and outperform various state-of-the-art models. This demonstrates that analytic torsion is a highly efficient topological invariant in the characterization of graph structures and can significantly boost the performance of GNNs."}}

Although developing chromosome conformation capture (3C) methods, such as Hi-C, which can generate chromosomal contact data characterized genome-wide chromosomal structural properties, understanding 3D genomic nature-based on Hi-C data remains lacking. Here, we propose a persistent spectral simplicial complex (PerSpectSC) model to describe Hi-C data for the first time. Specifically, a filtration process is introduced to generate a series of nested simplicial complexes at different scales. For each of these simplicial complexes, its spectral information can be calculated from the corresponding Hodge Laplacian matrix. PerSpectSC model describes the persistence and variation of the spectral information of the nested simplicial complexes during the filtration process. Different from all previous models, our PerSpectSC-based features provide a quantitative global-scale characterization of chromosome structures and topology. Our descriptors can successfully classify cell types and also cellular differentiation stages for all the 24 types of chromosomes simultaneously. In particular, persistent minimum best characterizes cell types and Dim (1) persistent multiplicity best characterizes cellular differentiation. These results demonstrate the great potential of our PerSpectSC-based models in polymeric data analysis."}}
