Existing approaches mainly use convolutional neural networks, yet current revolutionary vision transformer models have been less explored. In this paper, we investigate the use of transformer models under the SSL setting for action recognition. To this end, we introduce SVFormer, which adopts a steady pseudo-labeling framework (ie, EMA-Teacher) to cope with unlabeled video samples. While a wide range of data augmentations have been shown effective for semi-supervised image classification, they generally produce limited results for video recognition. We therefore introduce a novel augmentation strategy, Tube TokenMix, tailored for video data where video clips are mixed via a mask with consistent masked tokens over the temporal axis. In addition, we propose a temporal warping augmentation to cover the complex temporal variation in videos, which stretches selected frames to various temporal durations in the clip. Extensive experiments on three datasets Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and HMDB-51 verify the advantage of SVFormer. In particular, SVFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art by 31.5% with fewer training epochs under the 1% labeling rate of Kinetics-400. Our method can hopefully serve as a strong benchmark and encourage future search on semi-supervised action recognition with Transformer networks."}}

By contrast, Text-to-Video (T2V) still falls short of expectations though attracting increasing interests. Existing works either train from scratch or adapt large T2I model to videos, both of which are computation and resource expensive. In this work, we propose a Simple Diffusion Adapter (SimDA) that fine-tunes only 24M out of 1.1B parameters of a strong T2I model, adapting it to video generation in a parameter-efficient way. In particular, we turn the T2I model for T2V by designing light-weight spatial and temporal adapters for transfer learning. Besides, we change the original spatial attention to the proposed Latent-Shift Attention (LSA) for temporal consistency. With similar model architecture, we further train a video super-resolution model to generate high-definition (1024x1024) videos. In addition to T2V generation in the wild, SimDA could also be utilized in one-shot video editing with only 2 minutes tuning. Doing so, our method could minimize the training effort with extremely few tunable parameters for model adaptation."}}

This motivates a growing interest in video editing tasks, where videos are edited according to provided text descriptions. However, most existing approaches only focus on video editing for short clips and rely on time-consuming tuning or inference. We are the first to propose Video Instruction Diffusion (VIDiff), a unified foundation model designed for a wide range of video tasks. These tasks encompass both understanding tasks (such as language-guided video object segmentation) and generative tasks (video editing and enhancement). Our model can edit and translate the desired results within seconds based on user instructions. Moreover, we design an iterative auto-regressive method to ensure consistency in editing and enhancing long videos. We provide convincing generative results for diverse input videos and written instructions, both qualitatively and quantitatively. More examples can be found at our website https://ChenHsing.github.io/VIDiff."}}

However, the generation process of diffusion models involves denoising for dozens of steps to produce photorealistic images/videos, which is computationally expensive. Unlike previous methods that design ``one-size-fits-all'' approaches for speed up, we argue denoising steps should be sample-specific conditioned on the richness of input texts. To this end, we introduce AdaDiff, a lightweight framework designed to learn instance-specific step usage policies, which are then used by the diffusion model for generation. AdaDiff is optimized using a policy gradient method to maximize a carefully designed reward function, balancing inference time and generation quality. We conduct experiments on three image generation and two video generation benchmarks and demonstrate that our approach achieves similar results in terms of visual quality compared to the baseline using a fixed 50 denoising steps while reducing inference time by at least 33%, going as high as 40%. Furthermore, our qualitative analysis shows that our method allocates more steps to more informative text conditions and fewer steps to simpler text conditions."}}

It severely deteriorates the conventional CNNs and vision Transformers on panoramas. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective architecture named PanoSwin to learn panorama representations with ERP. To deal with the challenges brought by equirectangular projection, we explore a pano-style shift windowing scheme and novel pitch attention to address the boundary discontinuity and the spatial distortion, respectively. Besides, based on spherical distance and Cartesian coordinates, we adapt absolute positional embeddings and relative positional biases for panoramas to enhance panoramic geometry information. Realizing that planar image understanding might share some common knowledge with panorama understanding, we devise a novel two-stage learning framework to facilitate knowledge transfer from the planar images to panoramas. We conduct experiments against the state-of-the-art on various panoramic tasks, i.e., panoramic object detection, panoramic classification, and panoramic layout estimation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PanoSwin in panorama understanding."}}

Due to their impressive generative capabilities, diffusion models are gradually superseding methods based on GANs and auto-regressive Transformers, demonstrating exceptional performance not only in image generation and editing, but also in the realm of video-related research. However, existing surveys mainly focus on diffusion models in the context of image generation, with few up-to-date reviews on their application in the video domain. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of video diffusion models in the AIGC era. Specifically, we begin with a concise introduction to the fundamentals and evolution of diffusion models. Subsequently, we present an overview of research on diffusion models in the video domain, categorizing the work into three key areas: video generation, video editing, and other video understanding tasks. We conduct a thorough review of the literature in these three key areas, including further categorization and practical contributions in the field. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by research in this domain and outline potential future developmental trends. A comprehensive list of video diffusion models studied in this survey is available at https://github.com/ChenHsing/Awesome-Video-Diffusion-Models."}}

Existing works usually leverage only high-level information and perform matching in a single region. However, both low-level and high-level information are helpful to establish fine-grained correspondence. Besides, we argue that matching different regions between each sketch-image pair can further boost model robustness. Therefore, we propose Multi-Level Region Matching (MLRM) for FG-SBIR, which consists of two modules: a Discriminative Region Extraction module (DRE) and a Region and Level Attention module (RLA). In DRE, we propose Light-weighted Attention Map Augmentation (LAMA) to extract local feature from different regions. In RLA, we propose a transformer-based attentive matching module to learn attention weights to explore different importance from different image/sketch regions and feature levels. Furthermore, to ensure that the geometrical and semantic distinctiveness is well modeled, we also explore a novel LAMA overlapping penalty and a local region-negative triplet loss in our proposed MLRM method. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five datasets (i.e., Sketchy, QMUL-ChairV2, QMUL-ShoeV2, QMUL-Chair, QMUL-Shoe) demonstrate effectiveness of our method."}}

Our ideas are based on two observations: First, the actions are the fundamental units for people to understand these videos. Second, the humans summarize a video by iteratively observing and refining, i.e., observing segments in video and hierarchically refining the boundaries of important actions. Based on the above insights, we generate action proposals to construct the structure of the video and formulate the summarization process as a hierarchical refining process. We also train a hierarchical summarization network with deep Q-learning (HQSN) to achieve the refining process and explore temporal dependency. Besides, we collect a new dataset that consists of structured game videos with fine-grain actions and importance annotations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}
