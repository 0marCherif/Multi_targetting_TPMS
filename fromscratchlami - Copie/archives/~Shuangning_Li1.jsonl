The motivation for this problem is that large data sets may contain numerous associations that are statistically significant and yet misleading, as they are induced by confounders or sampling imperfections. However, associations consistently replicated under different conditions may be more interesting. In fact, consistency sometimes provably leads to valid causal inferences even if conditional associations do not. While the proposed method is flexible and can be deployed in a wide range of applications, this paper highlights its relevance to genome-wide association studies, in which consistency across populations with diverse ancestries mitigates confounding due to unmeasured variants. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by simulations and applications to the UK Biobank data."}}

Our definition is analogous to the standard definition of the average direct effect, and can be expressed without needing to compare outcomes across multiple randomized experiments. We show that the proposed indirect effect satisfies a universal decomposition theorem, whereby the sum of the average direct and indirect effects always corresponds to the average effect of a policy intervention. We also consider a number of parametric models for interference considered by applied researchers, and find that our (non-parametrically defined) indirect effect remains a natural estimand when re-expressed in the context of these models."}}

This model has recently gained popularity as means of incorporating interference effects into the Neyman--Rubin potential outcomes framework; and several authors have considered estimation of various causal targets, including the direct and indirect effects of treatment. In this paper, we consider large-sample asymptotics for treatment effect estimation under network interference in a setting where the exposure graph is a random draw from a graphon. When targeting the direct effect, we show that -- in our setting -- popular estimators are considerably more accurate than existing results suggest, and provide a central limit theorem in terms of moments of the graphon. Meanwhile, when targeting the indirect effect, we leverage our generative assumptions to propose a consistent estimator in a setting where no other consistent estimators are currently available. We also show how our results can be used to conduct a practical assessment of the sensitivity of randomized study inference to potential interference effects. Overall, our results highlight the promise of random graph asymptotics in understanding the practicality and limits of causal inference under network interference."}}
