We first prove that we can obtain two equivalence forms of the multimarginal POT problem in terms of the multimarginal optimal transport problem via novel extensions of cost tensor. The first equivalence form is derived under the assumptions that the total masses of each measure are sufficiently close while the second equivalence form does not require any conditions on these masses but at the price of more sophisticated extended cost tensor. Our proof techniques for obtaining these equivalence forms rely on novel procedures of moving mass in graph theory to push transportation plan into appropriate regions. Finally, based on the equivalence forms, we develop optimization algorithm, named ApproxMPOT algorithm, that builds upon the Sinkhorn algorithm for solving the entropic regularized multimarginal optimal transport. We demonstrate that the ApproxMPOT algorithm can approximate the optimal value of multimarginal POT problem with a computational complexity upper bound of the order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(m^3(n+1)^{m}/ \\varepsilon^2)$ where $\\varepsilon > 0$ stands for the desired tolerance."}}

We show that the complexity of the Sinkhorn algorithm for finding an $\\varepsilon$-approximate solution to the UOT problem is of order $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^2/ \\varepsilon)$, which is near-linear time. To the best of our knowledge, this complexity is better than the complexity of the Sinkhorn algorithm for solving the Optimal Transport (OT) problem, which is of order $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^2/\\varepsilon^2)$. Our proof technique is based on the geometric convergence of the Sinkhorn updates to the optimal dual solution of the entropic regularized UOT problem and some properties of the primal solution. It is also different from the proof for the complexity of the Sinkhorn algorithm for approximating the OT problem since the UOT solution does not have to meet the marginal constraints."}}
