The deep learning technique developed in recent years has gradually been applied to iris recognition techniques. As we all know, applying deep learning techniques requires a large number of data sets with high-quality manual labels. The larger the amount of data, the better the algorithm performs. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework utilizing the pix2pix conditional adversarial network for generating unlimited diversified iris images. Then, the generated iris images are used to train the iris segmentation network to achieve state-of-the-art performance. We also propose an algorithm to generate iris masks based on 11 tunable parameters, which can be generated randomly. Such a framework can generate an unlimited amount of photo-realistic training data for down-stream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieved promising results in all commonly used metrics. The proposed framework can be easily generalized to any object segmentation task with a simple fine-tuning of the mask generation algorithm."}}

Among the major components of self-supervised learning, the data augmentation pipeline is one key factor in enhancing the resulting performance. However, most researchers manually designed the augmentation pipeline, and the limited collections of transformation may cause the lack of robustness of the learned feature representation. In this work, we proposed Multi-Augmentations for Self-Supervised Representation Learning (MA-SSRL), which fully searched for various augmentation policies to build the entire pipeline to improve the robustness of the learned feature representation. MA-SSRL successfully learns the invariant feature representation and presents an efficient, effective, and adaptable data augmentation pipeline for self-supervised pre-training on different distribution and domain datasets. MA-SSRL outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on transfer and semi-supervised benchmarks while requiring fewer training epochs.

However, the main challenge is generating different views with random cropping; the semantic feature might exist differently across different views leading to inappropriately maximizing similarity objective. We tackle this problem by introducing Heuristic Attention Representation Learning (HARL). This self-supervised framework relies on the joint embedding architecture in which the two neural networks are trained to produce similar embedding for different augmented views of the same image. HARL framework adopts prior visual object-level attention by generating a heuristic mask proposal for each training image and maximizes the abstract object-level embedding on vector space instead of whole image representation from previous works. As a result, HARL extracts the quality semantic representation from each training sample and outperforms existing self-supervised baselines on several downstream tasks. In addition, we provide efficient techniques based on conventional computer vision and deep learning methods for generating heuristic mask proposals on natural image datasets. Our HARL achieves +1.3% advancement in the ImageNet semi-supervised learning benchmark and +0.9% improvement in AP50 of the COCO object detection task over the previous state-of-the-art method BYOL. Our code implementation is available for both TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks."}}
