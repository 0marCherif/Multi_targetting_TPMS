In this work we develop a 3D recurrent convolutional neural\n    network (RCNN) capable of super-resolving dMRI volumes in the angular (q-space)\n    domain. Our approach formulates the task of angular super-resolution as a patch-wise regression\n    using a 3D autoencoder conditioned on target b-vectors. Within the network we use a\n    convolutional long short term memory (ConvLSTM) cell to model the relationship between\n    q-space samples. We compare model performance against a baseline spherical harmonic\n    interpolation and a 1D variant of the model architecture. We show that the 3D model has the\n    lowest error rates across different subsampling schemes and b-values. The relative performance\n    of the 3D RCNN is greatest in the very low angular resolution domain. Code for this project is\n    available at github.com/m-lyon/dMRI-RCNN."}}
