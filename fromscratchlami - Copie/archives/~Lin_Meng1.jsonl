With the rise of graph neural networks, researchers have recently proposed methods based on graph neural networks to solve the recommendation problem. However, such models do not consider evolving stages in their life cycles. In this paper, we study the dynamic recommendation problem and propose a novel model named Stage Evolving Graph Neural Network (SEGNN). SEGNN learns the life stage representation by the Gated Stage Attention Unit (GSAU) and then uses a fully connected layer as the rating score predictor. GSAU adopts two types of attention layers to learn the preferences of users and products within one coupled life stage and discover the preferences over life stages, respectively. GSAU also utilizes a memory mechanism to ensure that the evolutionary patterns are maintained in the final representations of users and products. Due to the lack of information caused by data sparsity, SEGNN designs a masked loss function to train the model. Extensive experiments are done on real-world datasets, and the experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed model."}}

With the identified shared users across networks, it will provide researchers with the opportunity to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of users' social activities both within and across networks. Social network alignment is a very difficult problem. Besides the challenges introduced by the network heterogeneity, the network alignment can be reduced to a combinatorial optimization problem with an extremely large search space. The learning effectiveness and efficiency of existing alignment models will be degraded significantly as the network size increases. In this paper, we focus on studying the scalable heterogeneous social network alignment problem and propose to address it with a novel two-stage network alignment model, namely Scalable Heterogeneous Network Alignment (SHNA). Based on a group of intra- and inter-network meta diagrams, SHNA first partitions the social networks into a group of sub-networks synergistically. Via the partially known anchor links, SHNA can extract the partitioned sub-network correspondence relationships. Instead of aligning the complete input network, SHNA proposes to identify the anchor links between the matched sub-network pairs, while those between the unmatched sub-networks will be pruned to effectively shrink the search space. Extensive experiments have been done to compare SHNA with the state-of-the-art baseline methods on a real-world aligned social networks dataset. The experimental results have demonstrated both the effectiveness and efficiency of SHNA in addressing the problem."}}

While graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently proven to be effective in representation learning, one of the limitations is that most investigations focus on homogeneous graphs. Existing investigations on heterogeneous graphs often make direct use of meta-path type structures. Meta-path-based approaches often require a priori designation of meta-paths based on heuristic foreknowledge regarding the characteristics of heterogeneous graphs under investigation. In this paper, we propose a model without any a priori selection of meta-paths. We utilize locally-sampled (heterogeneous) context graphs \u201ccentered\u201d at a target node in order to extract relevant representational information for that target node. To deal with the heterogeneity in the graph, given the different types of nodes, we use different linear transformations to map the features in different domains into a unified feature space. We use the classical Graph Convolution Network (GCN) model as a tool to aggregate node features and then aggregate the context graph feature vectors to produce the target node's feature representation. We evaluate our model on three real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed model has better performance when compared with four baseline models."}}

Formally, we name the regression problem of multiple inter-connected data entities as the \"dynamic network regression\" in this paper. Within the problem of stock forecasting or traffic speed prediction, we need to consider both the trends of the entities and the relationships among the entities. A majority of existing approaches can't capture that information together. Some of the approaches are proposed to deal with the sequence data, like LSTM. The others use the prior knowledge in a network to get a fixed graph structure and do prediction on some unknown entities, like GCN. To overcome the limitations in those methods, we propose a novel graph neural network, namely Graph Neural Lasso (GNL), to deal with the dynamic network problem. GNL extends the GDU (gated diffusive unit) as the base neuron to capture the information behind the sequence. Rather than using a fixed graph structure, GNL can learn the dynamic graph structure automatically. By adding the attention mechanism in GNL, we can learn the dynamic relations among entities within each network snapshot. Combining these two parts, GNL is able to model the dynamic network problem well. Experimental results provided on two networked sequence datasets, i.e., Nasdaq-100 and METR-LA, show that GNL can address the network regression problem very well and is also very competitive among the existing approaches."}}
