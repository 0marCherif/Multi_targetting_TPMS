Manually finding adequate augmentation methods and parameters for a given pipeline is however rapidly cumbersome. In particular, while intuition can guide this decision for images, the design and choice of augmentation policies remains unclear for more complex types of data, such as neuroscience signals. Besides, class-dependent augmentation strategies have been surprisingly unexplored in the literature, although it is quite intuitive: changing the color of a car image does not change the object class to be predicted, but doing the same to the picture of an orange does. This paper investigates gradient-based automatic data augmentation algorithms  amenable to class-wise policies with exponentially larger search spaces. Motivated by supervised learning applications using EEG signals for which good augmentation policies are mostly unknown, we propose a new differentiable relaxation of the problem. In the class-agnostic setting, results show that our new relaxation leads to optimal performance with faster training than competing gradient-based methods, while also outperforming gradient-free methods in the class-wise setting. This work proposes also novel differentiable augmentation operations relevant for sleep stage classification."}}

We present in this setting a new class of scalable multi-task estimators which promote sparsity, while preserving the dynamics structure and leveraging available physical insight. An implementation leading to consistent feature selection is suggested, allowing to obtain accurate models. An additional regularizer is also proposed to help in recovering realistic hidden representations of the dynamics. We illustrate our method by applying it to an aircraft trajectory optimization problem. Our numerical results based on real flight data from 25 medium haul aircraft, totaling 8 millions observations, show that our approach is competitive with existing methods for this type of application."}}

Additionally, we want to avoid optimized trajectories that go too far away from the domain occupied by the data, since the model validity is not guaranteed outside this region. This motivates the need for a proximity indicator between a given trajectory and a set of reference trajectories. In this presentation, we propose such an indicator based on a parametric estimator of the training set density. We then introduce it as a penalty term in the optimal control problem. Our approach is illustrated with an aircraft minimal consumption problem and recorded data from real flights. We observe in our numerical results the expected trade-off between the consumption and the penalty term."}}

We define a probabilistic criterion for such a purpose, based on the marginal density functions of an underlying random process. For practical applications, a class of estimators based on the aggregation of multivariate density estimators is introduced and proved to be consistent. We illustrate the effectiveness of our estimators, as well as the practical usefulness of the proposed criterion, by applying our method to a dataset of real aircraft trajectories."}}
