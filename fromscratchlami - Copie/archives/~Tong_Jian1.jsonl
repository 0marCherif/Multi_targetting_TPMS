However, the training efficiency of a CL system is under-investigated, which limits the real-world application of CL systems under resource-limited scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Sparse Continual Learning (SparCL), which is the first study that leverages sparsity to enable cost-effective continual learning on edge devices. SparCL achieves both training acceleration and accuracy preservation through the synergy of three aspects: weight sparsity, data efficiency, and gradient sparsity. Specifically, we propose task-aware dynamic masking (TDM) to learn a sparse network throughout the entire CL process, dynamic data removal (DDR) to remove less informative training data, and dynamic gradient masking (DGM) to sparsify the gradient updates. Each of them not only improves efficiency, but also further mitigates catastrophic forgetting.  SparCL consistently improves the training efficiency of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) CL methods by at most 23X less training FLOPs, and, surprisingly, further improves the SOTA accuracy by at most 1.7%. SparCL also outperforms competitive baselines obtained from adapting SOTA sparse training methods to the CL setting in both efficiency and accuracy. We also evaluate the effectiveness of SparCL on a real mobile phone, further indicating the practical potential of our method."}}

In addition to the usual cross-entropy loss, we add regularization terms for every intermediate layer to ensure that the latent representations retain useful information for output prediction while reducing redundant information. We show that the HSIC bottleneck enhances robustness to adversarial attacks both theoretically and experimentally. In particular, we prove that the HSIC bottleneck regularizer reduces the sensitivity of the classifier to adversarial examples. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and architectures demonstrate that incorporating an HSIC bottleneck regularizer attains competitive natural accuracy and improves adversarial robustness, both with and without adversarial examples during training. Our code and adversarially robust models are publicly available."}}

This way, devices can be directly identified at the physical layer by analyzing the unprocessed received waveform - thus avoiding energy-expensive upper-layer cryptography that resource-challenged embedded devices may not be able to afford. Recent advances have proven that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - thanks to their multidimensional mappings - can achieve fingerprinting accuracy levels impossible to achieve by traditional low-dimensional algorithms. The same research, however, has also suggested that the wireless channel may negatively impact the accuracy of CNN-based radio fingerprinting algorithms by making device-unique hardware imperfections much harder to recognize.In spite of the growing interest in radio fingerprinting research by academia and DARPA, the wireless research community still lacks (i) a large-scale open dataset for radio fingerprinting collected in diverse environments and rich, diverse, channel conditions; and (ii) a full-fledged, systematic, quantitative investigation of the impact of the wireless channel on the accuracy of CNN-based radio fingerprinting algorithms. The key contribution of this paper is to bridge this gap by (i) collecting and sharing with the community more than 7TB of wireless data obtained from 20 wireless devices with identical RF circuitry (and thus, worst-case scenario for fingerprinting) over the course of several days in (a) an anechoic chamber, (b) in-the-wild testbed, and (c) with cable connections; and (ii) providing a first-of-its-kind evaluation of the impact of the wireless channel on CNN-based fingerprinting algorithms through (a) the 7TB experimental dataset and (b) a 400GB dataset provided by DARPA containing hundreds of thousands of transmissions from thousands of WiFi and ADS-B devices with different SNR conditions. Experimental results conclude that (i) the wireless channel impacts the classification accuracy significantly, i.e., from 85% to 9% and from 30% to 17% in the experimental and DARPA dataset, respectively; and that (ii) equalizing I/Q data can increase the accuracy to a significant extent (i.e., by up to 23%) when the number of devices increases significantly."}}

Our deep convolutional neural network architectures take raw and processed IQ samples as input to identify devices under a variety of practical conditions, including changing channels, noise levels, training data sizes, and computational overheads, among others. The contributions of the article are as follows: (i) This is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, reporting on RF fingerprinting and scalability issues on very large device populations, in the range of 50-10,000 devices. (ii) We investigate how to mitigate the effect of the wireless channel through a feature engineering step that we refer to as partial equalization.

In this paper, we propose a learn-prune-share (LPS) algorithm which addresses the challenges of catastrophic forgetting, parsimony, and knowledge reuse simultaneously. LPS splits the network into task-specific partitions via an ADMM-based pruning strategy. This leads to no forgetting, while maintaining parsimony. Moreover, LPS integrates a novel selective knowledge sharing scheme into this ADMM optimization framework. This enables adaptive knowledge sharing in an end-to-end fashion. Comprehensive experimental results on two lifelong learning benchmark datasets and a challenging real-world radio frequency fingerprinting dataset are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our experiments show that LPS consistently outperforms multiple state-of-the-art competitors."}}

We demonstrate that classifying transmission slices enables classification of a transmission with a fixed-length input deep classifier, enhances shift-invariance, and, most importantly, makes the classifier resistant to MAC ID spoofing. This is a consequence of the fact that the classifier does not learn to use the MAC ID to classifying among transmissions, but relies on other inherent discriminating signals, e.g., device imperfections. We demonstrate this via experiments on transmissions generated using two protocols, namely, WiFi and ADS-B."}}

Deep learning-based approaches learn radio fingerprints without hand-engineering features. One persisting drawback in deep learning methods is they identify only devices that are previously observed in a training set: if a radio signal from a new, unseen, device is passed through the classifier, the source device will be classified as one of the known devices. We propose a novel approach that facilitates new class detection without retraining a neural network, and perform extensive analysis of the proposed model both in terms of model parameters and real-world datasets. We accomplish this by first breaking down a longer transmission burst into smaller slices, and assessing classifier confidence on a new transmission based on per slice statistics: our approach detects a new device with 76% accuracy, while reducing the classification accuracy of 500 previously seen devices by no more than 10%."}}

This paper proposes a method for covert wireless communications that can be used to authenticate a device or exchange private information between devices. Our approach, called Impairment Shift Keying (ISK), introduces small yet controlled modifications to the radio transmitter hardware, which distorts regular standards-compliant waveforms, such as WiFi, with only 1% increase in bit error rate. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to learn these overlay signal variations, which serves as a low-overhead classifier returning a binary 0 or 1 per detected impairment pattern. By mapping device-specific injected impairment patterns to signal variations, ISK validates device IDs with only few inphase (I) and quadrature (Q) samples. Furthermore, through an experimental testbed, ISK is shown to be resilient to channel and SNR level variations, allowing a throughput of 93-1500 Kbps on the covert channel that is undetected by other receivers."}}
