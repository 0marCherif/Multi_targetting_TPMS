However, the recent success of MARL relies heavily on the convenient paradigm of purely decentralized execution, where there is no action correlation among agents for scalability considerations. In this work, we introduce a Bayesian network to inaugurate correlations between agents' action selections in their joint policy. Theoretically, we establish a theoretical justification for why action dependencies are beneficial by deriving the multi-agent policy gradient formula under such a Bayesian network joint policy and proving its global convergence to Nash equilibria under tabular softmax policy parameterization in cooperative Markov games. Further, by equipping existing MARL algorithms with a recent method of differentiable directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we develop practical algorithms to learn the context-aware Bayesian network policies in scenarios with partial observability and various difficulty. We also dynamically decrease the sparsity of the learned DAG throughout the training process, which leads to weakly or even purely independent policies for decentralized execution. Empirical results on a range of MARL benchmarks show the benefits of our approach."}}

In this paper, we focus on exploiting Euclidean symmetries inherent in certain cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems and prevalent in many applications. We begin by formally characterizing a subclass of Markov games with a general notion of symmetries that admits the existence of symmetric optimal values and policies. Motivated by these properties, we design neural network architectures with symmetric constraints embedded as an inductive bias for multi-agent actor-critic methods. This inductive bias results in superior performance in various cooperative MARL benchmarks and impressive generalization capabilities such as zero-shot learning and transfer learning in unseen scenarios with repeated symmetric patterns.

Communicating agents must simultaneously learn to whom to communicate (i.e., communication topology) and how to interpret the received message for decision-making. Although agents can efficiently learn communication interpretation by end-to-end backpropagation, learning communication topology is much trickier since the binary decisions of whether to communicate impede end-to-end differentiation. As evidenced in our experiments, existing solutions, such as reparameterization tricks and reformulating topology learning as reinforcement learning, often fall short. This paper introduces a meta-learning framework that aims to discover and continually adapt the update rules for communication topology learning. Empirical results show that our meta-learning approach outperforms existing alternatives in a range of cooperative MARL tasks and demonstrates a reasonably strong ability to generalize to tasks different from meta-training. Preliminary analyses suggest that, interestingly, the discovered update rules occasionally resemble the human-designed rules such as policy gradients, yet remaining qualitatively different in most cases."}}
