To facilitate and accelerate large scale annotation, one has to adopt semi-automatic approaches such as proofreading by experts. In this work, we focus on uncertainty estimation for such tasks, so that highly uncertain, and thus error-prone structures can be identified for human annotators to verify. Unlike most existing works, which provide pixel-wise uncertainty maps, we stipulate it is crucial to estimate uncertainty in the units of topological structures, e.g., small pieces of connections and branches. To achieve this, we leverage tools from topological data analysis, specifically discrete Morse theory (DMT), to first capture the structures, and then reason about their uncertainties. To model the uncertainty, we (1) propose a joint prediction model that estimates the uncertainty of a structure while taking the neighboring structures into consideration (inter-structural uncertainty); (2) propose a novel Probabilistic DMT to model the inherent uncertainty within each structure (intra-structural uncertainty) by sampling its representations via a perturb-and-walk scheme. On various 2D and 3D datasets, our method produces better structure-wise uncertainty maps compared to existing works. Code available at https://github.com/Saumya-Gupta-26/struct-uncertainty"}}

To alleviate the burden of obtaining pixel-wise annotations, semi-supervised learning methods learn from large amounts of unlabeled data. Nevertheless, existing semi-supervised methods overlook the topological information hidden in the unlabeled images and are thus prone to topological errors, e.g., missing or incorrectly merged/separated glands or nuclei. To address this issue, we propose TopoSemiSeg, the first semi-supervised method that learns the topological representation from unlabeled data. In particular, we propose a topology-aware teacher-student approach in which the teacher and student networks learn shared topological representations. To achieve this, we introduce topological consistency loss, which contains signal consistency and noise removal losses to ensure the learned representation is robust and focuses on true topological signals. Extensive experiments on public pathology image datasets show the superiority of our method, especially on topology-wise evaluation metrics.

The traditional image signal processing (ISP) pipeline in a smartphone camera consists of several image processing steps performed sequentially to reconstruct a high quality sRGB image from the raw sensor data. These steps consist of demosaicing, denoising, white balancing, gamma correction, colour enhancement, etc. Since each of them are performed sequentially using hand-crafted algorithms, the residual error from each processing module accumulates in the final reconstructed signal. Thus, the traditional ISP pipeline has limited reconstruction quality in terms of generalizability across different lighting conditions and associated noise levels while capturing the image. Deep learning methods using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have become popular in solving many image-related tasks such as image denoising, contrast enhancement, super resolution, deblurring, etc. Furthermore, recent approaches for the RAW to sRGB conversion using deep learning methods have also been published, however, their immense complexity in terms of their memory requirement and number of Mult-Adds make them unsuitable for mobile camera ISP. In this paper we propose DelNet - a single end-to-end deep learning model - to learn the entire ISP pipeline within reasonable complexity for smartphone deployment. Del-Net is a multi-scale architecture that uses spatial and channel attention to capture global features like colour, as well as a series of lightweight modified residual attention blocks to help with denoising. For validation, we provide results to show the proposed Del-Net achieves compelling reconstruction quality."}}

Follicles are tracked over the in-vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle, and this analysis is usually performed manually by a medical practitioner. It is a challenging manual analysis and is prone to error as it is largely operator dependent. In this paper we propose a two-stage framework to address the clinical need for follicular growth tracking. The first stage comprises of an unsupervised deep learning network SFR-Net to automate registration of each and every follicle across the IVF cycle. SFR-Net is composed of the standard 3DUNet [1] and Multi-Scale Residual Blocks (MSRB) [2] in order to register follicles of varying sizes. In the second stage we use the registration result to track individual follicles across the IVF cycle. The 3D Transvaginal Ultrasound (3D TVUS) volumes were acquired from 26 subjects every 2-3 days, resulting in a total of 96 volume pairs for the registration and tracking task. On the test dataset we have achieved an average DICE score of 85.84% for the follicle registration task, and we are successfully able to track follicles above 4 mm. Ours is the novel attempt towards automated tracking of follicular growth [3].Clinical Relevance\u2014 Accurate tracking of follicle count and growth is of paramount importance to increase the effectiveness of IVF procedure. Correct predictions can help doctors provide better counselling to the patients and individualize treatment for ovarian stimulation. Favorable outcome of this assisted reproductive technique depends on the estimates of the quality and quantity of the follicular pool. Therefore, automated longitudinal tracking of follicular growth is highly demanded in Assisted Reproduction clinical practice. [4]"}}
