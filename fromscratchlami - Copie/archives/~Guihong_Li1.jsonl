The problem stems from the large number of operations (e.g., floating point multiplications and additions) and memory consumption required during training by the back-propagation algorithm. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a new gradient filtering approach which enables on-device CNN model training. More precisely, our approach creates a special structure with fewer unique elements in the gradient map, thus significantly reducing the computational complexity and memory consumption of back propagation during training. Extensive experiments on image classification and semantic segmentation with multiple CNN models (e.g., MobileNet, DeepLabV3, UPerNet) and devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano) demonstrate the effectiveness and wide applicability of our approach. For example, compared to SOTA, we achieve up to 19$\\times$ speedup and 77.1% memory savings on ImageNet classification with only 0.1% accuracy loss. Finally, our method is easy to implement and deploy; over 20$\\times$ speedup and 90% energy savings have been observed compared to highly optimized baselines in MKLDNN and CUDNN on NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Consequently, our approach opens up a new direction of research with a huge potential for on-device training."}}

Based on this theoretical analysis, we propose a new zero-shot proxy, ZiCo, the first proxy that works consistently better than #Params. We demonstrate that ZiCo works better than State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) proxies on several popular NAS-Benchmarks (NASBench101, NATSBench-SSS/TSS, TransNASBench-101) for multiple applications (e.g., image classification/reconstruction and pixel-level prediction). Finally, we demonstrate that the optimal architectures found via ZiCo are as competitive as the ones found by one-shot and multi-shot NAS methods, but with much less search time. For example, ZiCo-based NAS can find optimal architectures with 78.1%, 79.4%, and 80.4% test accuracy under inference budgets of 450M, 600M, and 1000M FLOPs, respectively, on ImageNet within 0.4 GPU days.

The motion and audio signals captured by these sensors can be used for recognizing a variety of user physical activities. Compared to motion data, audio data contains rich contextual information of human activities, but continuous audio sensing also poses extra data sampling burdens and privacy issues. Given such challenges, this paper studies a novel approach to augment IMU models for human activity recognition (HAR) with the superior acoustic knowledge of activities. Specifically, we propose a teacher-student framework to derive an IMU-based HAR model. Instead of training with motion data alone, an advanced audio-based teacher model is incorporated to guide the student HAR model. Once trained, the HAR model only takes as inputs motion data for inference. Based on a semi-controlled study with 15 participants, we show that an IMU model augmented with the proposed framework outperforms the original baseline model without augmentation (74.4% versus 70.0% accuracy) for recognizing 23 activities of daily living. We further discuss a few insights regarding the difference of model performance with and without our framework and possible trade-offs for actual deployment."}}
