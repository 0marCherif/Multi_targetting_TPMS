This paper demonstrates several practical scenarios where similarity metrics fail to agree with human perception, because they: (1) vary with clean references; (2) rely on attributes that humans factor out when considering quality, and (3) are sensitive to imperceptible signal level differences. In those scenarios, we show that no-reference metrics do not suffer from such shortcomings and correlate better with human perception. We conclude therefore that similarity serves as an unreliable proxy for audio quality."}}

The aim of the HEAR benchmark is to develop a general-purpose audio representation that provides a strong basis for learning in a wide variety of tasks and scenarios. HEAR evaluates audio representations using a benchmark suite across a variety of domains, including speech, environmental sound, and music. HEAR was launched as a NeurIPS 2021 shared challenge. In the spirit of shared exchange, each participant submitted an audio embedding model following a common API that is general-purpose, open-source, and freely available to use. Twenty-nine models by thirteen external teams were evaluated on nineteen diverse downstream tasks derived from sixteen datasets. Open evaluation code, submitted models and datasets are key contributions, enabling comprehensive and reproducible evaluation, as well as previously impossible longitudinal studies. It still remains an open question whether one single general-purpose audio representation can perform as holistically as the human ear."}}

Our work introduces SAQAM which uses a multi-task learning framework to assess listening quality (LQ) and spatialization quality (SQ) between any given pair of binaural signals without using any subjective data. We model LQ by training on a simulated dataset of triplet human judgments, and SQ by utilizing activation-level distances from networks trained for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. We show that SAQAM correlates well with human responses across four diverse datasets. Since it is a deep network, the metric is differentiable, making it suitable as a loss function for other tasks.

Many existing full-reference models correlate well with human perception, but cannot be used in real-world scenarios where ground truth clean reference recordings are not available. On the other hand no-reference metrics typically suffer from several shortcomings, such as lack of robustness to unseen perturbations and reliance on (limited) labeled data for training. Moreover, noise or large variance among the labels makes it difficult to learn generalizable representations, especially for recordings with subtle differences. This paper proposes a learning framework for estimating the quality of a recording without any reference, and without any human judgments. The main component of this framework is a pairwise quality-preference strategy that reduces label noise, thereby making learning more robust. From pairwise preferences, we first learn a content invariant quality ordering; and then we re-target the model to predict quality on an absolute scale. We show that the resulting learned metric is well-calibrated with human judgments. Since it is a deep network, the metric is differentiable, making it suitable as a loss function for downstream tasks. For example, we show that adding this metric to an existing speech enhancement method yields significant improvement."}}

Objective SQA methods that rely on the availability of the corresponding clean reference have been the primary go-to approaches for SQA. Clearly, these methods fail in real-world scenarios where the ground truth clean references are not available. In recent years, non-intrusive methods that train neural networks to predict ratings or scores have attracted much attention, but they suffer from several shortcomings such as lack of robustness, reliance on labeled data for training and so on. In this work, we propose a new direction for speech quality assessment. Inspired by human's innate ability to compare and assess the quality of speech signals even when they have non-matching contents, we propose a novel framework that predicts a subjective relative quality score for the given speech signal with respect to any provided reference without using any subjective data. We show that neural networks trained using our framework produce scores that correlate well with subjective mean opinion scores (MOS) and are also competitive to methods such as DNSMOS, which explicitly relies on MOS from humans for training networks. Moreover, our method also provides a natural way to embed quality-related information in neural networks, which we show is helpful for downstream tasks such as speech enhancement. "}}

The DPAM approach of Manocha et al. [1] learns a full-reference metric trained directly on human judgments, and thus correlates well with human perception. However, it requires a large number of human annotations and does not generalize well outside the range of perturbations on which it was trained. This paper introduces CDPAM \u2013a metric that builds on and advances DPAM. The primary improvement is to combine contrastive learning and multi-dimensional representations to build robust models from limited data. In addition, we collect human judgments on triplet comparisons to improve generalization to a broader range of audio perturbations. CDPAM correlates well with human responses across nine varied datasets. We also show that adding this metric to existing speech synthesis and enhancement methods yields significant improvement, as measured by objective and subjective tests."}}
