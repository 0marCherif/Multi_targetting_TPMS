To alleviate their excessive computational demands, developers have traditionally resorted to cloud offloading, inducing high infrastructure costs and a strong dependence on networking conditions. On the other end, the emergence of powerful SoCs is gradually enabling on-device execution. Nonetheless, low- and mid-tier platforms still struggle to run state-of-the-art CNNs sufficiently. In this article, we present DynO, a distributed inference framework that combines the best of both worlds to address several challenges, such as device heterogeneity, varying bandwidth, and multi-objective requirements. Key components that enable this are its novel CNN-specific data packing method, which exploits the variability of precision needs in different parts of the CNN when onloading computation, and its novel scheduler, which jointly tunes the partition point and transferred data precision at runtime to adapt inference to its execution environment. Quantitative evaluation shows that DynO outperforms the current state of the art, improving throughput by over an order of magnitude over device-only execution and up to 7.9\u00d7 over competing CNN offloading systems, with up to 60\u00d7 less data transferred."}}

FL has been successfully applied to certain machine learning tasks, such as training smart keyboard models and keyword spotting. Despite FL's initial success, many important deep learning use cases, such as ranking and recommendation tasks, have been limited from on-device learning. One of the key challenges faced by practical FL adoption for DL-based ranking and recommendation is the prohibitive resource requirements that cannot be satisfied by modern mobile systems. We propose Federated Ensemble Learning (FEL) as a solution to tackle the large memory requirement of deep learning ranking and recommendation tasks. FEL enables large-scale ranking and recommendation model training on-device by simultaneously training multiple model versions on disjoint clusters of client devices. FEL integrates the trained sub-models via an over-arch layer into an ensemble model that is hosted on the server. Our experiments demonstrate that FEL leads to 0.43-2.31% model quality improvement over traditional on-device federated learning - a significant improvement for ranking and recommendation system use cases."}}

In this paper, we perform the first holistic study of DNN usage in the wild in an attempt to track deployed models and match how these run on widely deployed devices. To this end, we analyse over 16k of the most popular apps in the Google Play Store to characterise their DNN usage and performance across devices of different capabilities, both across tiers and generations. Simultaneously, we measure the models' energy footprint, as a core cost dimension of any mobile deployment. To streamline the process, we have developed gaugeNN, a tool that automates the deployment, measurement and analysis of DNNs on devices, with support for different frameworks and platforms. Results from our experience study paint the landscape of deep learning deployments on smartphones and indicate their popularity across app developers. Furthermore, our study shows the gap between bespoke techniques and real-world deployments and the need for optimised deployment of deep learning models in a highly dynamic and heterogeneous ecosystem."}}

In large-scale deployments, client heterogeneity is a fact and constitutes a primary problem for fairness, training performance and accuracy. Although significant efforts have been made into tackling statistical data heterogeneity, the diversity in the processing capabilities and network bandwidth of clients, termed system heterogeneity, has remained largely unexplored. Current solutions either disregard a large portion of available devices or set a uniform limit on the model's capacity, restricted by the least capable participants.In this work, we introduce Ordered Dropout, a mechanism that achieves an ordered, nested representation of knowledge in Neural Networks and enables the extraction of lower footprint submodels without the need for retraining. We further show that for linear maps our Ordered Dropout is equivalent to SVD. We employ this technique, along with a self-distillation methodology, in the realm of FL in a framework called FjORD. FjORD alleviates the problem of client system heterogeneity by tailoring the model width to the client's capabilities. Extensive evaluation on both CNNs and RNNs across diverse modalities shows that FjORD consistently leads to significant performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining its nested structure."}}
