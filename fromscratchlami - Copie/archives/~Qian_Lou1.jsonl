Such attacks occur when Trojan models behave normally for standard inputs but generate malicious output for inputs that contain a specific trigger. Syntactic-structure triggers, which are invisible, are becoming more popular for Trojan attacks because they are difficult to detect and defend against. However, these types of attacks require a large corpus of training data to generate poisoned samples with the necessary syntactic structures for Trojan insertion. Obtaining such data can be difficult for attackers, and the process of generating syntactic poisoned triggers and inserting Trojans can be time-consuming. This paper proposes a solution called TrojText, which aims to determine whether invisible textual Trojan attacks can be performed more efficiently and cost-effectively without training data. The proposed approach, called the Representation-Logit Trojan Insertion (RLI) algorithm, uses smaller sampled test data instead of large training data to achieve the desired attack. The paper also introduces two additional techniques, namely the accumulated gradient ranking (AGR) and Trojan Weights Pruning (TWP), to reduce the number of tuned parameters and the attack overhead. The TrojText approach was evaluated on three datasets (AG\u2019s News, SST-2, and OLID) using three NLP models (BERT, XLNet, and DeBERTa). The experiments demonstrated that the TrojText approach achieved a 98.35% classification accuracy for test sentences in the target class on the BERT model for the AG\u2019s News dataset.

HE can be used for privacy-preserving outsourced computation and analysis, allowing data to be encrypted and outsourced to commercial cloud environments for processing while encrypted or sensitive data. HE enables new services by removing privacy barriers inhibiting data sharing or increasing the security of existing services. A convolution neural network (CNN) with shallow architecture can be homomorphically evaluated using addition and multiplication by replacing the activation function, such as ReLU, with a low polynomial degree. To achieve the same performance as the ReLU activation function, we study the impact of applying the ensemble techniques to solve the accuracy problem. Our experimental results empirically show that the ensemble approach can reduce bias, and variance, increasing accuracy to achieve the same ReLU performance with parallel and sequential techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method using three data sets: MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 "}}

Singular value decomposition (SVD) plays a vital role in this compression strategy, approximating a learned matrix with fewer parameters. However, SVD minimizes the squared error toward reconstructing the original matrix without gauging the importance of the parameters, potentially giving a larger reconstruction error for those who affect the task accuracy more. In other words, the optimization objective of SVD is not aligned with the trained model's task accuracy. We analyze this previously unexplored problem, make observations, and address it by introducing Fisher information to weigh the importance of parameters affecting the model prediction. This idea leads to our method: Fisher-Weighted SVD (FWSVD). Although the factorized matrices from our approach do not result in smaller reconstruction errors, we find that our resulting task accuracy is much closer to the original model's performance. We perform analysis with the transformer-based language models, showing our weighted SVD largely alleviates the mismatched optimization objectives and can maintain model performance with a higher compression rate. Our method can directly compress a task-specific model while achieving better performance than other compact model strategies requiring expensive model pre-training. Moreover, the evaluation of compressing an already compact model shows our method can further reduce 9% to 30% parameters with an insignificant impact on task accuracy."}}

DictFormer significantly reduces the redundancy in the transformer's parameters by replacing the prior transformer's parameters with a compact, shared dictionary, few unshared coefficients, and indices.

Training dictionary and coefficients are not trivial since indices used for looking up dictionary are not differentiable. We adopt a sparse-constraint training with $l_1\\,\\,norm$ relaxation to learn coefficients and indices in DictFormer. DictFormer is flexible to support different model sizes by dynamically changing dictionary size. Compared to existing lightweight Transformers, DictFormer consistently reduces model size over Transformer on multiple tasks, e.g., machine translation, abstractive summarization, and language modeling. Extensive experiments show that DictFormer reduces $3.6\\times$ to $8.9\\times$ model size with similar accuracy over multiple tasks, compared to Transformer.   "}}

A cryptographic neural network inference service is an efficient way to allow two parties to execute neural network inference without revealing either party\u2019s data or model. Nevertheless, existing cryptographic neural network inference services suffer from huge running latency; in particular, the latency of communication-expensive cryptographic activation function is 3 orders of magnitude higher than plaintext-domain activation function. And activations are the necessary components of the modern neural networks. Therefore, slow cryptographic activation has become the primary obstacle of efficient cryptographic inference. \n\nIn this paper, we propose a new technique, called SAFENet, to enable a Secure, Accurate and Fast nEural Network inference service. To speedup secure inference and guarantee inference accuracy, SAFENet includes channel-wise activation approximation with multiple-degree options. This is implemented by keeping the most useful activation channels and replacing the remaining, less useful, channels with various-degree polynomials. SAFENet also supports mixed-precision activation approximation by automatically assigning different replacement ratios to various layer; further increasing the approximation ratio and reducing inference latency.

Recent network quantization techniques quantize each weight kernel in a convolutional layer independently for higher inference accuracy, since the weight kernels in a layer exhibit different variances and hence have different amounts of redundancy. The quantization bitwidth or bit number (QBN) directly decides the inference accuracy, latency, energy and hardware overhead. To effectively reduce the redundancy and accelerate CNN inferences, various weight kernels should be quantized with different QBNs. However, prior works use only one QBN to quantize each convolutional layer or the entire CNN, because the design space of searching a QBN for each weight kernel is too large. The hand-crafted heuristic of the kernel-wise QBN search is so sophisticated that domain experts can obtain only sub-optimal results. It is difficult for even deep reinforcement learning (DRL) DDPG-based agents to find a kernel-wise QBN configuration that can achieve reasonable inference accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical-DRL-based kernel-wise network quantization technique, AutoQ, to automatically search a QBN for each weight kernel, and choose another QBN for each activation layer. Compared to the models quantized by the state-of-the-art DRL-based schemes, on average, the same models quantized by AutoQ reduce the inference latency by 54.06%, and decrease the inference energy consumption by 50.69%, while achieving the same inference accuracy."}}

Several Leveled-HE (LHE)-enabled Convolutional Neural Networks (LHECNNs) are proposed to implement MLaaS to avoid the large bootstrapping overhead. However, prior LHECNNs have to pay significant computational overhead but achieve only low inference accuracy, due to their polynomial approximation activations and poolings. Stacking many polynomial approximation activation layers in a network greatly reduces the inference accuracy, since the polynomial approximation activation errors lead to a low distortion of the output distribution of the next batch normalization layer. So the polynomial approximation activations and poolings have become the obstacle to a fast and accurate LHECNN model.  In this paper, we propose a Shift-accumulation-based LHE-enabled deep neural network (SHE) for fast and accurate inferences on encrypted data. We use the binary-operation-friendly leveled-TFHE (LTFHE) encryption scheme to implement ReLU activations and max poolings. We also adopt the logarithmic quantization to accelerate inferences by replacing expensive LTFHE multiplications with cheap LTFHE shifts. We propose a mixed bitwidth accumulator to expedite accumulations. Since the LTFHE ReLU activations, max poolings, shifts and accumulations have small multiplicative depth, SHE can implement much deeper network architectures with more convolutional and activation layers. Our experimental results show SHE achieves the state-of-the-art inference accuracy and reduces the inference latency by 76.21% ~ 94.23% over prior LHECNNs on MNIST and CIFAR-10. "}}
