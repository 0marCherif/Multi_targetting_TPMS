This work shows how off-the-shelf, large-scale, image-to-text and text-to-image models, trained on vast amounts of data, can be leveraged to automatically find such failures. In essence, a conditional text-to-image generative model is used to generate large amounts of synthetic, yet realistic, inputs given a ground-truth label. A captioning model is used to describe misclassified inputs. Descriptions are used in turn to generate more inputs, thereby assessing whether specific descriptions induce more failures than expected. As failures are grounded to natural language, we automatically obtain a high-level, human-interpretable explanation of each failure. We use this pipeline to demonstrate that we can effectively interrogate classifiers trained on ImageNet to find specific failure cases and discover spurious correlations. We also show that we can scale the approach to generate adversarial datasets targeting specific classifier architectures. This work demonstrates the utility of large-scale generative models to automatically discover bugs in vision models in an open-ended manner. We also describe a number of limitations and pitfalls related to this approach."}}

Overall, we train more than 85K models. Our experimental framework can be easily extended to include new methods, shifts, and datasets. We find, unlike previous work [Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz, 2021], that progress has been made over a standard ERM baseline; in particular, pre-training and augmentations (learned or heuristic) offer large gains in many cases.

On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, this translates into a sizable robust-accuracy gap between models trained solely on data from the original training set and those trained with additional data extracted from the \"80 Million Tiny Images\" dataset (TI-80M). In this paper, we explore how generative models trained solely on the original training set can be leveraged to artificially increase the size of the original training set and improve adversarial robustness to $\\ell_p$ norm-bounded perturbations. We identify the sufficient conditions under which incorporating additional generated data can improve robustness, and demonstrate that it is possible to significantly reduce the robust-accuracy gap to models trained with additional real data. Surprisingly, we even show that even the addition of non-realistic random data (generated by Gaussian sampling) can improve robustness. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and TinyImageNet against $\\ell_\\infty$ and $\\ell_2$ norm-bounded perturbations of size $\\epsilon = 8/255$ and $\\epsilon = 128/255$, respectively. We show large absolute improvements in robust accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Against $\\ell_\\infty$ norm-bounded perturbations of size $\\epsilon = 8/255$, our models achieve 66.10% and 33.49% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively (improving upon the state-of-the-art by +8.96% and +3.29%). Against $\\ell_2$ norm-bounded perturbations of size $\\epsilon = 128/255$, our model achieves 78.31% on CIFAR-10 (+3.81%). These results beat most prior works that use external data."}}

In this paper, we focus on reducing robust overfitting by using common data augmentation schemes. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, when combined with model weight averaging, data augmentation can significantly boost robust accuracy. Furthermore, we compare various augmentations techniques and observe that spatial composition techniques work the best for adversarial training. Finally, we evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 against $\\ell_\\infty$ and $\\ell_2$ norm-bounded perturbations of size $\\epsilon = 8/255$ and $\\epsilon = 128/255$, respectively. We show large absolute improvements of +2.93% and +2.16% in robust accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. In particular, against $\\ell_\\infty$ norm-bounded perturbations of size $\\epsilon = 8/255$, our model reaches 60.07% robust accuracy without using any external data.

This is challenging; it requires comprehensively understanding the 3D scene from images. As a result, current methods typically use multiple images, train on ground-truth depth, or are limited to synthetic data. We propose a novel end-to-end model for this task using a single image at test time; it is trained on real images without any ground-truth 3D information. To this end, we introduce a novel differentiable point cloud renderer that is used to transform a latent 3D point cloud of features into the target view. The projected features are decoded by our refinement network to inpaint missing regions and generate a realistic output image. The 3D component inside of our generative model allows for interpretable manipulation of the latent feature space at test time, e.g. we can animate trajectories from a single image. Additionally, we can generate high resolution images and generalise to other input resolutions. We outperform baselines and prior work on the Matterport, Replica, and RealEstate10K datasets."}}
