Particular attention is paid to a recently published approach: dynamic causal Bayesian optimisation (DCBO). We propose that DCBO can act as a blue agent when provided with a view of a simulated network and a causal model of how a red agent spreads within that network. To investigate how DCBO can perform optimal interventions on host nodes, in order to reduce the cost of intrusions caused by the red agent. Through this we demonstrate a complete cyber-simulation system, which we use to generate observational data for DCBO and provide numerical quantitative results which lay the foundations for future work in this space."}}

This problem arises in a variety of domains including healthcare, operational research and policy design. Our approach, which we call Dynamic Causal Bayesian Optimisation (DCBO), brings together ideas from decision making, causal inference and Gaussian process (GP) emulation. DCBO is useful in scenarios where the causal effects are changing over time. Indeed, at every time step, DCBO identifies a local optimal intervention by integrating both observational and past interventional data collected from the system. We give theoretical results detailing how one can transfer interventional information across time steps and define a dynamic causal GP model which can be used to find optimal interventions in practice. Finally, we demonstrate how DCBO identifies optimal interventions faster than competing approaches in multiple settings and applications."}}

New defensive methods need to be developed to counter these threats. Some cybersecurity professionals are speculating AI will enable corresponding new classes of active cyber defence measures -- is this realistic, or currently mostly hype? The Alan Turing Institute, with expert guidance from the UK National Cyber Security Centre and Defence Science Technology Laboratory, published a research roadmap for AI for ACD last year. This position paper updates the roadmap for two of the most promising AI approaches -- reinforcement learning and causal inference - and describes why they could help tip the balance back towards defenders."}}

Practically the reward distribution of each bandit is governed by the same non-trivial dependence structure, which is a dynamic causal model. Dynamic because we allow for each causal MAB to depend on the preceding MAB and in doing so are able to transfer information between agents. Our contribution, the Chronological Causal Bandit (CCB), is useful in discrete decision-making settings where the causal effects are changing across time and can be informed by earlier interventions in the same system. In this paper, we present some early findings of the CCB as demonstrated on a toy problem."}}

Therein appears both Bayesian non-parametric latent feature models, as well as methods for automatically determining the statistical data type (e.g. ordinal or categorical) of the attributes present in the data. We present a model which combines both of these attractive features in an end-to-end framework. By jointly learning the model complexity and statistical type of the data, we demonstrate that redundant information can be discarded while higher accuracy statistical type estimates are produced on real experimental data."}}

Large well-defined heterogeneous compositions of activity throughout the city are sometimes difficult to acquire, yet are a necessity in order to learn 'busyness' and consequently make safe policy decisions. One component of our project within this space is to utilise existing infrastructure to estimate social distancing adherence by the general public. Our method enables near immediate sampling and contextualisation of activity and physical distancing on the streets of London via live traffic camera feeds. We introduce a framework for inspecting and improving upon existing methods, whilst also describing its active deployment on over 900 real-time feeds."}}
