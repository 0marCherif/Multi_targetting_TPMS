Most model-based clustering algorithms assume that the data are either discrete or continuous, possibly allowing both types to be present in separate features. In this paper, we introduce a model-based approach for clustering feature vectors of mixed type, allowing each feature to simultaneously take on both categorical and real values. Such data may be encountered, for instance, in chemical and biological analyses, in the analysis of survey data, as well as in image analysis. Our model is formulated within a Bayesian predictive framework, where clustering solutions correspond to random partitions of the data. Using conjugate analysis, the posterior probability for each possible partition can be determined analytically, enabling the utilization of efficient computational search strategies for finding the posterior optimal partition. The derived model is illustrated using several synthetic and real datasets."}}

A majority of the classifiers are built on the assumption of intrinsic discreteness of the considered data features or on the discretization of them prior to the modeling. On the other hand, Gaussian mixture classifiers have also been utilized to a large extent for continuous features in the Bayesian framework. Often the primary reason for discretization in the classification context is the simplification of the analytical and numerical properties of the models. However, the discretization can be problematic due to its \\textit{ad hoc} nature and the decreased statistical power to detect the correct classes in the resulting procedure. We introduce an unsupervised classification approach for fuzzy feature vectors that utilizes a discrete model structure while preserving the continuous characteristics of data. This is achieved by replacing the ordinary likelihood by a binomial quasi-likelihood to yield an analytical expression for the posterior probability of a given clustering solution. The resulting model can be justified from an information-theoretic perspective. Our method is shown to yield highly accurate clusterings for challenging synthetic and empirical data sets."}}
