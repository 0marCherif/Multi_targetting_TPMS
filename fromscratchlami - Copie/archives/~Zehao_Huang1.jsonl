However, the cost of such BEV feature maps is quadratic to the detection range, making it not suitable for long-range detection. Fully sparse architecture is gaining attention as they are highly efficient in long-range perception. In this paper, we study how to effectively leverage image modality in the emerging fully sparse architecture. Particularly, utilizing instance queries, our framework integrates the well-studied 2D instance segmentation into the LiDAR side, which is parallel to the 3D instance segmentation part in the fully sparse detector. This design achieves a uniform query-based fusion framework in both the 2D and 3D sides while maintaining the fully sparse characteristic. Extensive experiments showcase state-of-the-art results on the widely used nuScenes dataset and the long-range Argoverse 2 dataset. Notably, the inference speed of the proposed method under the long-range LiDAR perception setting is 2.7 $\\times$ faster than that of other state-of-the-art multimodal 3D detection methods.

The past few decades have witnessed development of related theories and algorithms. The prevalent learning-based methods call for a large-scale TTC dataset in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a large-scale object oriented TTC dataset in the driving scene for promoting the TTC estimation by a monocular camera. To collect valuable samples and make data with different TTC values relatively balanced, we go through thousands of hours of driving data and select over 200K sequences with a preset data distribution. To augment the quantity of small TTC cases, we also generate clips using the latest Neural rendering methods. Additionally, we provide several simple yet effective TTC estimation baselines and evaluate them extensively on the proposed dataset to demonstrate their effectiveness. The proposed dataset is publicly available at https://open-dataset.tusen.ai/TSTTC."}}

However, in 3D space, data association is not so hard. Only with a 3D Kalman Filter, the online object tracker can associate the detections from LiDAR. In this paper, we rethink the data association in 2D MOT and utilize the 3D object representation to separate each object in the feature space. Unlike the existing depth-based MOT methods, the 3D object representation can be jointly learned with the object association module. Besides, the object's 3D representation is learned from the video and supervised by the 2D tracking labels without additional manual annotations from LiDAR or pretrained depth estimator. With 3D object representation learning from Pseudo 3D object labels in monocular videos, we propose a new 2D MOT paradigm, called P3DTrack. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method. We achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset."}}

Existing methods mainly establish 3D representations from multi-view images and adopt a dense detection head for object detection, or employ object queries distributed in 3D space to localize objects. In this paper, we design Multi-View 2D Objects guided 3D Object Detector (MV2D), which can lift any 2D object detector to multi-view 3D object detection. Since 2D detections can provide valuable priors for object existence, MV2D exploits 2D detectors to generate object queries conditioned on the rich image semantics. These dynamically generated queries help MV2D to recall objects in the field of view and show a strong capability of localizing 3D objects. For the generated queries, we design a sparse cross attention module to force them to focus on the features of specific objects, which suppresses interference from noises. The evaluation results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the dynamic object queries and sparse feature aggregation can promote 3D detection capability. MV2D also exhibits a state-of-the-art performance among existing methods. We hope MV2D can serve as a new baseline for future research."}}

The motivation is that given a differentiable performance estimation function, we can directly optimize the architecture towards higher performance by simple gradient ascent. Specifically, we adopt a neural predictor as the performance predictor. Surprisingly, PredNAS can achieve state-of-the-art performances on NAS benchmarks with only a few training samples (less than 100). To validate the universality of our method, we also apply our method on large-scale tasks and compare our method with RegNet on ImageNet and YOLOX on MSCOCO. The results demonstrate that our PredNAS can explore novel architectures with competitive performances under specific computational complexity constraints."}}

The most common and effective way to promote small object detection is to use high-resolution images or feature maps. However, both approaches induce costly computation since the computational cost grows squarely as the size of images and features increases. To get the best of two worlds, we propose QueryDet that uses a novel query mechanism to accelerate the inference speed of feature-pyramid based object detectors. The pipeline composes two steps: it first predicts the coarse locations of small objects on low-resolution features and then computes the accurate detection results using high-resolution features sparsely guided by those coarse positions. In this way, we can not only harvest the benefit of high-resolution feature maps but also avoid useless computation for the background area. On the popular COCO dataset, the proposed method improves the detection mAP by 1.0 and mAP-small by 2.0, and the high-resolution inference speed is improved to 3.0x on average. On VisDrone dataset, which contains more small objects, we create a new state-of-the-art while gaining a 2.3x high-resolution acceleration on average.
