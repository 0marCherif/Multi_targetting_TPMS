When scaling up the underlying graphs of GNNs to a larger size, we are forced to either train on the complete graph and keep the full graph adjacency and node embeddings in memory (which is often infeasible) or mini-batch sample the graph (which results in exponentially growing computational complexities with respect to the number of GNN layers). Various sampling-based and historical-embedding-based methods are proposed to avoid this exponential growth of complexities. However, none of these solutions eliminates the linear dependence on graph size. This paper proposes a sketch-based algorithm whose training time and memory grow sublinearly with respect to graph size by training GNNs atop a few compact sketches of graph adjacency and node embeddings. Based on polynomial tensor-sketch (PTS) theory, our framework provides a novel protocol for sketching non-linear activations and graph convolution matrices in GNNs, as opposed to existing methods that sketch linear weights or gradients in neural networks. In addition, we develop a locality sensitive hashing (LSH) technique that can be trained to improve the quality of sketches. Experiments on large-graph benchmarks demonstrate the scalability and competitive performance of our Sketch-GNNs versus their full-size GNN counterparts."}}

State-of-the-art approaches rely on matching the gradients between the real and synthetic data and are recently applied to condense large-scale graphs for node classification tasks. Although dataset condensation may be efficient when we need to train multiple models for hyperparameter optimization, there is no theoretical guarantee on the generalizability of the condensed data, and it can generalize poorly across hyperparameters/architectures in practice; while on graphs, we find and prove this overfitting is much more severe. This paper considers a different condensation objective specifically for hyperparameter search. We aim to generate the synthetic dataset so that the validation-performance ranking of different models under different hyperparameters on the condensed and original datasets are comparable. We propose a novel hyperparameter-calibrated dataset condensation (HCDC) algorithm, which learns the synthetic validation data by matching the hyperparameter gradients computed by implicit differentiation and efficient inverse Hessian approximation. HCDC employs a supernet with differentiable hyperparameters, making it suitable for modeling GNNs with widely different convolution filters. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively maintains the validation-performance rankings of GNNs and speeds up hyperparameter/architecture search on graphs."}}

While recent efforts have focused on reducing communication complexity, existing algorithms assume that each participating client is able to download the current and full set of parameters, which may not be a practical assumption depending on the memory constraints of clients such as mobile devices. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm Comfetch, which allows clients to train large networks using compressed versions of the global architecture via Count Sketch, thereby reducing communication and local memory costs. We provide a theoretical convergence guarantee and experimentally demonstrate that it is possible to learn large networks, such as a deep convolutional network and an LSTM, through federated agents training on their sketched counterparts. The resulting global models exhibit competitive test accuracy when compared against the state-of-the-art FetchSGD and the classical FedAvg, both of which require clients to download the full architecture."}}

The distilled purpose of the vanilla power method is to determine the largest eigenvalue (in absolute modulus) and its eigenvector of a matrix. A momentum-based scheme can be used to accelerate the power method, but achieving an optimal convergence rate with existing algorithms critically relies on additional spectral information that is unavailable at run-time, and sub-optimal initializations can result in divergence. In this paper, we provide a pair of novel momentum-based power methods, which we call the delayed momentum power method (DMPower) and a streaming variant, the delayed momentum streaming method (DMStream). Our methods leverage inexact deflation and are capable of achieving near-optimal convergence with far less restrictive hyperparameter requirements. We provide convergence analyses for both algorithms through the lens of perturbation theory. Further, we experimentally demonstrate that DMPower routinely outperforms the vanilla power method and that both algorithms match the convergence speed of an oracle running existing accelerated methods with perfect spectral knowledge."}}
