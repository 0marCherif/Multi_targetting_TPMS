The ultra-reliability and low-latency requirements of IoV have posed urgent demand for the provision of precise relative network geometry and efficient data transmission. In this paper, we propose a vision-based relative localization scheme in the presence of communication constraints. First, the relative squared position error bound (SPEB) is derived via subspace projection of the Fisher information matrix. Next, we determine the local convexity of the relative SPEB with respect to bit allocation vectors and propose two bit allocation algorithms. Furthermore, we exploit the vision-based relative geometry and develop two localization algorithms based on Euclidean distance matrix completion. The simulation results validate that the proposed vision-based localization algorithms achieve near-optimal performance in terms of the relative SPEB under bandwidth constraints, as well as demonstrate the superiority of adopting cooperation among mobile agents."}}

In view of its promising applications including formation control and autonomous driving, the vision-based localization mechanism has attracted intensive attention for its outstanding performance in terms of accuracy and flexibility. However, the high mobility and fast switching features of IoV put a strain on communication resources, which can impair the real-time transmission of high-quality images for cooperative localization. In this paper, we propose ajoint position sensing and bandwidthconstrained communication framework for vision localization. First, we derive the relative squared position error bound (SPEB) by implementing subspace projection on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of absolute positions given quantized observations. Then we exploit the relative geometry of vehicles and images to develop two localization algorithms, which estimate the relative positions of vehicles by incorporating the idea of Euclidean distance matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed localization algorithms is verified via numerical simulations, which offers guidelines for joint sensing and communication in future IoV scenarios."}}
