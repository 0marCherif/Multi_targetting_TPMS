Unfortunately, the efficiency of parallel computing infrastructures varies widely with neural network models, which hinders the exploration of the design space to find high-performance neural network architectures on specific computing platforms for a given application. To address such a challenge, we propose a deep learning-based method, ResPerfNet, which trains a residual neural network with representative datasets obtained on the target platform to predict the performance for a deep neural network. Our experimental results show that ResPerfNet can accurately predict the execution time of individual neural network layers and full network models on a variety of platforms. In particular, ResPerfNet achieves 8.4% of mean absolute percentage error for LeNet, AlexNet and VGG16 on the NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti, which is substantially lower than the previously published works."}}
