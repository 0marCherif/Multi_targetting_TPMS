The usual representation of these data sets is an information table, assuming the independence of attributes. However, very often, they are actually interdependent on one another, either explicitly or implicitly. Limited research has been conducted in analyzing such attribute interactions, which causes the analysis results to be more local than global. This paper proposes the coupled heterogeneous attribute analysis to capture the interdependence among mixed data by addressing coupling context and coupling weights in unsupervised learning. Such global couplings integrate the interactions within discrete attributes, within numerical attributes and across them to form the coupled representation for mixed-type objects based on dimension conversion and feature selection. This work makes one step forward towards explicitly modeling the interdependence of heterogeneous attributes among mixed data, verified by the applications in data structure analysis, data clustering evaluation, and density comparison. Substantial experiments on 12 UCI data sets show that our approach can effectively capture the global couplings of heterogeneous attributes and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, supported by statistical analysis."}}

In real-world data, attributes are more or less interacted and coupled via explicit or implicit relationships. Limited research has been conducted on analyzing such attribute interactions, which only describe a local picture of attribute couplings in an implicit way. This paper proposes a framework of the coupled attribute analysis to capture the global dependency of continuous attributes. Such global couplings integrate the intra-coupled interaction within an attribute (i.e. the correlations between attributes and their own powers) and inter-coupled interaction among different attributes (i.e. the correlations between attributes and the powers of others) to form a coupled representation for numerical objects by the Taylor-like expansion. This work makes one step forward towards explicitly addressing the global interactions of continuous attributes, verified by the applications in data structure analysis, data clustering, and data classification. Substantial experiments on 13 UCI data sets demonstrate that the coupled representation can effectively capture the global couplings of attributes and outperforms the traditional way, supported by statistical analysis."}}

However, it usually considers each base clustering independently, and treats the similarity measure roughly with either 0 or 1. To address these two issues, we propose a coupled framework of clustering ensembles CCE, and exemplify it with the coupled version CCSPA for CSPA. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CCSPA over baseline approaches in terms of the clustering accuracy."}}
