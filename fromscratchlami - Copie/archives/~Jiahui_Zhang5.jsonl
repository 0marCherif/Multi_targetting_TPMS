Prior work in reinforcement learning require expert supervision, in the form of demonstrations or rich reward functions, to learn long-horizon tasks. Instead, our approach BOSS (BOotStrapping your own Skills) learns to accomplish new tasks by performing \"skill bootstrapping,\" where an agent with a set of primitive skills interacts with the environment to practice new skills without receiving reward feedback for tasks outside of the initial skill set. This bootstrapping phase is guided by large language models (LLMs) that inform the agent of meaningful skills to chain together. Through this process, BOSS builds a wide range of complex and useful behaviors from a basic set of primitive skills. We demonstrate through experiments in realistic household environments that agents trained with our LLM-guided bootstrapping procedure outperform those trained with naive bootstrapping as well as prior unsupervised skill acquisition methods on zero-shot execution of unseen, long-horizon tasks in new environments.

SPRINT pre-trains an agent\u2019s policy to execute a diverse set of semantically meaningful skills that it can leverage to learn new tasks faster. Prior work on offline pre-training required tedious manual definition of pre-training tasks or learned semantically meaningless skills via random goal-reaching. Instead, our approach SPRINT (Scalable Pre-training via Relabeling Language INsTructions) leverages natural language instruction labels on offline agent experience, collected at scale (e.g., via crowd-sourcing), to define a rich set of tasks with minimal human effort. Furthermore, by using natural language to define tasks, SPRINT can use pre-trained large language models to automatically expand the initial task set. By relabeling and aggregating task instructions, even across multiple training trajectories, we can learn a large set of new skills during pre-training. In experiments using a realistic household simulator, we show that agents pre-trained with SPRINT learn new long-horizon household tasks substantially faster than with previous pre-training approaches."}}
