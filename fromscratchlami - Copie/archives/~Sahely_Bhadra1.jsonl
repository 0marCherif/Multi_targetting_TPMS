Understanding Latent Affective Bias in Large Pre-trained Neural Language Models", "abstract": "Groundbreaking inventions and highly significant performance improvements in deep learning based Natural Language Processing are witnessed through the development of transformer based large Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). The wide availability of unlabeled data within human generated data deluge along with self-supervised learning strategy helps to accelerate the success of large PLMs in language generation, language understanding, etc. But at the same time, latent historical bias/unfairness in human minds towards a particular gender, race, etc., encoded unintentionally/intentionally into the corpora harms and questions the utility and efficacy of large PLMs in many real-world applications, particularly for the protected groups. In this paper, we present an extensive investigation towards understanding the existence of \"Affective Bias\" in large PLMs to unveil any biased association of emotions such as anger, fear, joy, etc., towards a particular gender, race or religion with respect to the downstream task of textual emotion detection. We conduct our exploration of affective bias from the very initial stage of corpus level affective bias analysis by searching for imbalanced distribution of affective words within a domain, in large scale corpora that are used to pre-train and fine-tune PLMs. Later, to quantify affective bias in model predictions, we perform an extensive set of class-based and intensity-based evaluations using various bias evaluation corpora. Our results show the existence of statistically significant affective bias in the PLM based emotion detection systems, indicating biased association of certain emotions towards a particular gender, race, and religion."}}

Detecting anomalies, or irregular and rare events, in time series data, can enable us to find abnormal events in any natural phenomena, which may require special treatment. Moreover, labeled instances of anomaly are hard to get in time series data. On the other hand, time series data, due to its nature, often exhibits localized expansions and compressions in the time dimension which is called warping. These two challenges make it hard to detect anomalies in time series as often such warpings could get detected as anomalies erroneously. Our objective is to build an anomaly detection model that is robust to such warping variations. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised time series anomaly detection method, WaRTEm-AD, that operates in two stages. Within the key stage of representation learning, we employ data augmentation through bespoke time series operators which are passed through a twin autoencoder architecture to learn warping-robust representations for time series data. Second, adaptations of state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods are employed on the learnt representations to identify anomalies. We will illustrate that WaRTEm-AD is designed to detect two types of time series anomalies: point and sequence anomalies. We compare WaRTEm-AD with the state-of-the-art baselines and establish the effectiveness of our method both in terms of anomaly detection performance and computational efficiency."}}

PCA is able to capture the main modes of variability in a set of experiments and does not make many prior assumptions about the data, but does not inherently take into account the flux mode structure of metabolism. Stoichiometric flux analysis methods, such as Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and Elementary Mode Analysis, on the other hand, are able to capture the metabolic flux modes, however, they are primarily designed for the analysis of single samples at a time, and not best suited for exploratory analysis on a large sets of samples. Results We propose a new methodology for the analysis of metabolism, called Principal Metabolic Flux Mode Analysis (PMFA), which marries the PCA and stoichiometric flux analysis approaches in an elegant regularized optimization framework. In short, the method incorporates a variance maximization objective form PCA coupled with a stoichiometric regularizer, which penalizes projections that are far from any flux modes of the network. For interpretability, we also introduce a sparse variant of PMFA that favours flux modes that contain a small number of reactions. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility and capabilities of our methodology. The proposed method can be applied to genome-scale metabolic network in efficient way as PMFA does not enumerate elementary modes. In addition, the method is more robust on out-of-steady steady-state experimental data than competing flux mode analysis approaches. Availability and implementation Matlab software for PMFA and SPMFA and dataset used for experiments are available in https://github.com/aalto-ics-kepaco/PMFA . Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."}}
