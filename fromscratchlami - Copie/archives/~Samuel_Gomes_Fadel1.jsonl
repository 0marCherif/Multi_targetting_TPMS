However, straightforward linear interpolations show unexpected side effects, as interpolation paths lie outside the area where samples are observed. This is caused by the standard choice of Gaussian base distributions and can be seen in the norms of the interpolated samples as they are outside the data manifold. This observation suggests that changing the way of interpolating should generally result in better interpolations, but it is not clear how to do that in an unambiguous way. In this paper, we solve this issue by enforcing a specific manifold and, hence, change the base distribution, to allow for a principled way of interpolation. Specifically, we use the Dirichlet and von Mises-Fisher base distributions on the probability simplex and the hypersphere, respectively. Our experimental results show superior performance in terms of bits per dimension, Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) scores for interpolation, while maintaining the generative performance."}}

As a consequence, social media turns into a valuable source of data for understanding those events. Due to their destructive potential, natural disasters are among events of particular interest to response operations and environmental monitoring agencies. However, this amount of information also makes it challenging to identify relevant content pertaining to those events. In this paper, we use a relational neural network model for identifying this type of content. The model is particularly suitable for unstructured text, that is, text with no particular arrangement of words, such as tags, which is commonplace in social media data. In addition, our method can be combined with a CNN for handling multimodal data where text and visual data are available. We perform experiments in three different scenarios, where different modalities are evaluated: visual, textual, and both. Our method achieves competitive performance in both modalities by themselves, while significantly outperforms the baseline on the multimodal scenario. We also demonstrate the behavior of the proposed method in different applications by performing additional experiments in the CUB-200-2011 multimodal dataset."}}

Typically, they map data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional visual space, preserving distance or neighborhood structures on the produced layout. Despite the advances, with faster and highly precise techniques, existing methods still carry deficiencies that impair their use as exploratory tools. An example is the mismatching that can occur between what the user considers similar/dissimilar and what is conveyed by the visual representation. Recently, a class of projection techniques aims at addressing this limitation, allowing users to control the projection process by changing the distance relationships using small data samples. Among such methods, Local Affine Multidimensional Projection has proved to be the state-of-the-art regarding the effectiveness of user intervention. Although Local Affine Multidimensional Projection has attained a relative success, it is limited to certain application domains. Since it relies on feature vector representations with data instances described by vectors embedded into a Euclidean space, scenarios that offer only distance information or a distance function cannot be handled. In this article, we present a novel multidimensional projection technique, called User-assisted Projection Technique for Distance Information, which takes advantage of the solid mathematical framework provided by Local Affine Multidimensional Projection, adapting it to scenarios where only distance information or a distance function is available. The results show that User-assisted Projection Technique for Distance Information is as fast, accurate, robust, and flexible as the existing state-of-the-art techniques, enabling the application of the refined user control provided by Local Affine Multidimensional Projection on domains not previously covered. Its versatility is illustrated in an application that involves the organization of book collections that employs an external source of information for the recommendation of new readings."}}

However, the use of temporal contextual information, often modeled as dynamic graphs that encode the evolution of user-item relationships over time, has been overlooked in link prediction problems. In this paper, we consider the hypothesis that leveraging such information enables models to make better predictions, proposing a new neural network approach for this. Our experiments, performed on the widely used ML-100k and ML-1M datasets, show that our approach produces better predictions in scenarios where the pattern of user-item relationships change over time. In addition, they suggest that existing approaches are significantly impacted by those changes."}}

Therefore, it is fundamental to monitor these disasters to define prevention strategies and help authorities in damage control. With the wide use of portable devices (e.g., smartphones), there is an increase of the documentation and communication of flood events in social media. However, the use of these data in monitoring systems is not straightforward and depends on the creation of effective recognition strategies. In this paper, we propose a fusion-based recognition system for detecting flooding events in images extracted from social media. We propose two new graph-based early-fusion methods, which consider multiple descriptions and modalities to generate an effective image representation. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methods yield better results than a traditional early-fusion method and a specialized deep neural network fusion solution."}}

Artificial neural networks currently achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. Although such networks are typically used as black-boxes, they are also widely believed to learn (high-dimensional) higher-level representations of the original observations. In this paper, we propose using dimensionality reduction for two tasks: visualizing the relationships between learned representations of observations, and visualizing the relationships between artificial neurons. Through experiments conducted in three traditional image classification benchmark datasets, we show how visualization can provide highly valuable feedback for network designers. For instance, our discoveries in one of these datasets (SVHN) include the presence of interpretable clusters of learned representations, and the partitioning of artificial neurons into groups with apparently related discriminative roles."}}
