We further propose a scalable approach to estimate the gradients of quantum dynamics using a forward pass with Monte Carlo sampling, which leads to a quantum stochastic gradient descent algorithm for scalable gradient-based training in our framework. Applying our framework to quantum optimization and control, we observe a significant advantage of differentiable analog quantum computing against SOTAs based on parameterized digital quantum circuits by {\\em orders of magnitude}.

However, there still exista lot of challenging cases, such as occluded keypoints, in-visible keypoints and complex background, which cannot bewell addressed. In this paper, we present a novel networkstructure called Cascaded Pyramid Network (CPN) whichtargets to relieve the problem from these \u201chard\u201d keypoints.More specifically, our algorithm includes two stages: Glob-alNet and RefineNet. GlobalNet is a feature pyramid net-work which can successfully localize the \u201csimple\u201d key-points like eyes and hands but may fail to precisely rec-ognize the occluded or invisible keypoints. Our RefineNettries explicitly handling the \u201chard\u201d keypoints by integrat-ing all levels of feature representations from the Global-Net together with an online hard keypoint mining loss. Ingeneral, to address the multi-person pose estimation prob-lem, a top-down pipeline is adopted to first generate a setof human bounding boxes based on a detector, followed byour CPN for keypoint localization in each human boundingbox. Based on the proposed algorithm, we achieve state-of-art results on the COCO keypoint benchmark, with averageprecision at 73.0 on the COCO test-dev dataset and 72.1 onthe COCO test-challenge dataset, which is a 19% relativeimprovement compared with 60.5 from the COCO 2016 key-point challenge. Code and the detection results for personused will be publicly available for further research."}}
