Due to the massive success of deep learning applied to Earth Observation (EO) problems, the focus of the community has been largely on the development of ever-more sophisticated deep neural network architectures and training strategies largely ignoring the overall importance of datasets. For that purpose, numerous task-specific datasets have been created that were largely ignored by previously published review articles on AI for Earth observation. With this article, we want to change the perspective and put machine learning datasets dedicated to Earth observation data and applications into the spotlight. Based on a review of the historical developments, currently available resources are described and a perspective for future developments is formed. We hope to contribute to an understanding that the nature of our data is what distinguishes the Earth observation community from many other communities that apply deep learning techniques to image data, and that a detailed understanding of EO data peculiarities is among the core competencies of our discipline."}}
