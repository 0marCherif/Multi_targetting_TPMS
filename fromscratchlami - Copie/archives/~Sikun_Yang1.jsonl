Our goal is to infertheimplicitcommunity structure underlying the temporal interactions among entities, and also to exploit how thecommunity structure influences the interaction dynamics among these nodes. To this end, we model the reciprocatinginteractions between individuals using mutually-exciting Hawkes processes. The base rate of the Hawkes processfor each pair of individuals is built upon the latent representations inferred using the hierarchical gamma processedge partition model (HGaP-EPM). In particular, our model allows the interaction dynamics between each pair ofindividuals to be modulated by their respective affiliated communities. Moreover, our model can flexibly incorporatethe auxiliary individuals\u2019 attributes, or covariates associated with interaction events. Efficient Gibbs sampling andExpectation-Maximization algorithms are developed to perform inference via P\u00f3lya-Gamma data augmentation strategy.Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model not only achieves competitive performancefor temporal link prediction compared with state-of-the-art methods, but also discovers interpretable latent structurebehind the observed temporal interactions."}}

The latent memberships evolve according to a Markov process. The optimal\r\nnumber of latent groups can be determined by data itself. The computational complexity of our method scales with the number of non-zero links, which makes it scalable to large sparse dynamic relational data. We present batch and online Gibbs sampling algorithms to perform model inference. Finally, we demonstrate the model\u2019s performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to state-of-the-art\r\nmethods."}}
