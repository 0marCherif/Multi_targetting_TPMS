Writing is personal and usually the processing is done on-device. Ink generative models thus need to produce high quality content quickly, in a resource constrained environment. In this work, we study ways to maximize the quality of the output of a trained digital ink generative model, while staying within an inference time budget. We use and compare the effect of multiple sampling and ranking techniques, in the first ablation study of its kind in the digital ink domain. We confirm our findings on multiple datasets - writing in English and Vietnamese, as well as mathematical formulas - using two model types and two common ink data representations. In all combinations, we report a meaningful improvement in the recognizability of the synthetic inks, in some cases more than halving the character error rate metric, and describe a way to select the optimal combination of sampling and ranking techniques for any given computational budget."}}

Decoupling the segmentation from the recognition unlocks the potential to further utilize the result of the recognition. We specifically focus on the scenario where the transcription is known beforehand, in which case the character segmentation becomes an assignment problem between sampling points of the stylus trajectory and characters in the text. Inspired by the k-means clustering algorithm, we view it from the perspective of cluster assignment and present a Transformer-based architecture where each cluster is formed based on a learned character query in the Transformer decoder block. In order to assess the quality of our approach, we create character segmentation ground truths for two popular on-line handwriting datasets, IAM-OnDB and HANDS-VNOnDB, and evaluate multiple methods on them, demonstrating that our approach achieves the overall best results."}}

We show that the commonly used models for this task fail to generalize to long-form data and how this problem can be solved by augmenting the training data, changing the model architecture and the inference procedure. These methods use contrastive learning technique and are tailored specifically for the handwriting domain. They can be applied to any encoder-decoder model that works with digital ink. We demonstrate that our method reduces the character error rate on long-form English data by half compared to baseline RNN and by 16% compared to the previous approach that aims at addressing the same problem. We show that all three parts of the method improve recognizability of generated inks. In addition, we evaluate synthesized data in a human study and find that people perceive most of generated data as real."}}

We show that existing automatic evaluation metrics do not fully capture and are not correlated with the human perception of the quality of the spelling correction, and propose new ones that correlate with human perception. We additionally surface an interesting phenomenon: a trade-off between the similarity and recognizability of the spell-corrected inks. We further create a family of models corresponding to different points on the Pareto frontier between those two axes. We show that Inkorrect's Pareto frontier dominates the points that correspond to prior work."}}

Many state-of-the-art approaches now use sequence models to solve this problem but their training can be affected by biases that decrease their efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a new training procedure that confronts the algorithm to its own mistakes while explicitly attempting to minimize the number of switches, which results in better training. We propose an iterative scheme of building a rich training set and using it to learn a scoring function that is an explicit proxy for the target tracking metric. Whether using only simple geometric features or more sophisticated ones that also take appearance into account, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on several MOT benchmarks."}}

The reduction of camera prices allows for the generalization of static multi-camera set-ups. Using joint visual information from multiple synchronized cameras gives the opportunity to improve detection performance. In this paper, we present a new large-scale and high-resolution dataset. It has been captured with seven static cameras in a public open area, and unscripted dense groups of pedestrians standing and walking. Together with the camera frames, we provide an accurate joint (extrinsic and intrinsic) calibration, as well as 7 series of 400 annotated frames for detection at a rate of 2 frames per second. This results in over 40,000 bounding boxes delimiting every person present in the area of interest, for a total of more than 300 individuals. We provide a series of benchmark results using baseline algorithms published over the recent months for multi-view detection with deep neural networks, and trajectory estimation using a non-Markovian model."}}

This grouping typically relies on imposing local smoothness constraints but almost never on enforcing more global ones on the trajectories. In this paper, we propose a non-Markovian approach to imposing global consistency by using behavioral patterns to guide the tracking algorithm. When used in conjunction with state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, this further increases their already good performance on multiple challenging datasets. We show significant improvements both in supervised settings where ground truth is available and behavioral patterns can be learned from it, and in completely unsupervised settings."}}

In this paper, we propose a generic and principled approach to modeling the interaction between the ball and the players while also imposing appropriate physical constraints on the ball's trajectory. We show that our approach, formulated in terms of a Mixed Integer Program, is more robust and more accurate than several state-of-the-art approaches on real-life volleyball, basketball, and soccer sequences."}}
