Inspired by the scene-voxel-point hierarchy in downstream 3D object detectors, we design masking and reconstruction strategies accounting for voxel distributions in the scene and local point distributions within the voxel. We employ a Reversed-Furthest-Voxel-Sampling strategy to address the uneven distribution of LiDAR points and propose MV-JAR, which combines two techniques for modeling the aforementioned distributions, resulting in superior performance. Our experiments reveal limitations in previous data-efficient experiments, which uniformly sample fine-tuning splits with varying data proportions from each LiDAR sequence, leading to similar data diversity across splits. To address this, we propose a new benchmark that samples scene sequences for diverse fine-tuning splits, ensuring adequate model convergence and providing a more accurate evaluation of pre-training methods. Experiments on our Waymo benchmark and the KITTI dataset demonstrate that MV-JAR consistently and significantly improves 3D detection performance across various data scales, achieving up to a 6.3% increase in mAPH compared to training from scratch."}}

However, they typically assume all the objects are static and directly aggregate features across frames. This work begins with a theoretical and empirical analysis to reveal that ignoring the motion of moving objects can result in serious localization bias. Therefore, we propose to model Dynamic Objects in RecurrenT (DORT) to tackle this problem. In contrast to previous global BirdEye-View (BEV) methods, DORT extracts object-wise local volumes for motion estimation that also alleviates the heavy computational burden. By iteratively refining the estimated object motion and location, the preceding features can be precisely aggregated to the current frame to mitigate the aforementioned adverse effects. The simple framework has two significant appealing properties. It is flexible and practical that can be plugged into most camera-based 3D object detectors. As there are predictions of object motion in the loop, it can easily track objects across frames according to their nearest center distances. Without bells and whistles, DORT outperforms all the previous methods on the nuScenes detection and tracking benchmarks with 62.8% NDS and 57.6% AMOTA, respectively.

However, they fail to perform as accurately in real-world scenarios, where the category distribution of objects naturally comes with a long tail. Instances of head classes dominate a long-tailed dataset and they serve as negative samples of tail categories. The overwhelming gradients of negative samples on tail classes lead to a biased learning process for classifiers. Consequently, objects of tail categories are more likely to be misclassified as backgrounds or head categories. To tackle this problem, we propose Seesaw Loss to dynamically re-balance gradients of positive and negative samples for each category, with two complementary factors, i.e., mitigation factor and compensation factor. The mitigation factor reduces punishments to tail categories w.r.t. the ratio of cumulative training instances between different categories. Meanwhile, the compensation factor increases the penalty of misclassified instances to avoid false positives of tail categories. We conduct extensive experiments on Seesaw Loss with mainstream frameworks and different data sampling strategies. With a simple end-to-end training pipeline, Seesaw Loss obtains significant gains over Cross-Entropy Loss, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on LVIS dataset without bells and whistles.

This is aligned with our intuition that we usually only need to compare a little region of the body of target objects to distinguish them from other objects. We build the hierarchical representation in levels of (1) target body parts, (2) the whole target body, and  (3) the union area of the target and other objects of overlap.  Furthermore, with the spatio-temporal attention mechanism by transformer, we can solve the tracking in a global fashion and keeps the process online.  We design our method by combining the representation with the transformer and name it Hierarchical Part-Whole Attention, or HiPWA for short. The experiments on multiple datasets suggest its good effectiveness.  Moreover, previous methods mostly focus on leveraging transformers to exploit long temporal context during association which requires heavy computation resources. But HiPWA focuses on a more informative representation of objects on every single frame instead. So it is more robust with the length of temporal context and more computationally economic. "}}

The motion model is a key component of many MOT methods and is commonly used to predict an object's future position. However, mainstream motion models in MOT naively assume that object motion is linear. They rely on detections on each frame as the observation value to supervise motion models. However, in practice, the observations can be noisy and even missing, especially in crowded scenes, which greatly degrade the performance of existing MOT methods. In this work, we show that a simple filtering-based motion model can still obtain state-of-the-art tracking performance if proper care is given to missing observations and noisy estimates. We emphasize the role of observations when recovering tracks from being lost and reducing the error accumulated by the assumption of linear motion when the target is lost. In contrast to the popular motion-based method SORT, which is estimation-centric, we name our method Observation-Centric SORT (OC-SORT). It remains simple, online, and real-time but improves robustness over occlusion and non-linear motion. It achieves state-of-the-art on multiple MOT benchmarks, including MOT17, MOT20, KITTI, head tracking, and especially DanceTrack where the object motion is highly non-linear."}}

Monocular 3D detection, a representative general setting among image-based approaches, provides a more economical solution than conventional settings relying on LiDARs but still yields unsatisfactory results. This paper first presents a systematic study on this problem. We observe that the current monocular 3D detection can be simplified as an instance depth estimation problem: The inaccurate instance depth blocks all the other 3D attribute predictions from improving the overall detection performance. Moreover, recent methods directly estimate the depth based on isolated instances or pixels while ignoring the geometric relations across different objects. To this end, we construct geometric relation graphs across predicted objects and use the graph to facilitate depth estimation. As the preliminary depth estimation of each instance is usually inaccurate in this ill-posed setting, we incorporate a probabilistic representation to capture the uncertainty. It provides an important indicator to identify confident predictions and further guide the depth propagation. Despite the simplicity of the basic idea, our method, PGD, obtains significant improvements on KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks, achieving 1st place out of all monocular vision-only methods while still maintaining real-time efficiency.
