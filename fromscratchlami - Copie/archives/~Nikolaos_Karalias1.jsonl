In this work, we address both difficulties for set functions, which capture many important discrete problems. First, we develop a framework for extending set functions onto low-dimensional continuous domains, where many extensions are naturally defined. Our framework subsumes many well-known extensions as special cases. Second, to avoid undesirable low-dimensional neural network bottlenecks, we convert low-dimensional extensions into representations in high-dimensional spaces, taking inspiration from the success of semidefinite programs for combinatorial optimization. Empirically, we observe benefits of our extensions for unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization, in particular with high-dimensional representations."}}

However, many tasks that involve discrete choices are defined via (combinatorial) set functions, and thereby pose challenges for end-to-end training. In this work, we explore a general framework to construct continuous extensions of such discrete functions that enables training via gradient methods. Our framework includes well-known extensions such as the Lovasz extension of submodular set functions and facilitates the design of novel continuous extensions based on problem-specific considerations, including constraints. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on tasks ranging from combinatorial optimization to image classification. "}}

The absence of ordering in graphs poses a significant challenge to conventional compression algorithms, limiting their attainable gains as well as their ability to discover relevant patterns. On the other hand, most graph compression approaches rely on domain-dependent handcrafted representations and cannot adapt to different underlying graph distributions. This work aims to establish the necessary principles a lossless graph compression method should follow to approach the entropy storage lower bound. Instead of making rigid assumptions about the graph distribution, we formulate the compressor as a probabilistic model that can be learned from data and generalise to unseen instances. Our \u201cPartition and Code\u201d framework entails three steps: first, a partitioning algorithm decomposes the graph into subgraphs, then these are mapped to the elements of a small dictionary on which we learn a probability distribution, and finally,  an entropy encoder translates the representation into bits.  All the components (partitioning, dictionary and distribution) are parametric and can be trained with gradient descent. We theoretically compare the compression quality of several graph encodings and prove, under mild conditions, that PnC achieves compression gains that grow either linearly or quadratically with the number of vertices. Empirically, PnC yields significant compression improvements on diverse real-world networks."}}

This work proposes an unsupervised learning framework for CO problems on graphs that can provide integral solutions of certified quality. Inspired by Erdos' probabilistic method, we use a neural network to parametrize a probability distribution over sets. Crucially, we show that when the network is optimized w.r.t. a suitably chosen loss, the learned distribution contains, with controlled probability, a low-cost integral solution that obeys the constraints of the combinatorial problem. The probabilistic proof of existence is then derandomized to decode the desired solutions. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach to obtain valid<br /> solutions to the maximum clique problem and to perform local graph clustering. Our method achieves competitive results on both real datasets and synthetic hard instances."}}
