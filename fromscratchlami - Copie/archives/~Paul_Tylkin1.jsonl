In addition to being able to learn high-quality control, NCP networks are designed with a small number of neurons. This property allows for the learned policies to be interpreted at the neuron level and interrogated, leading to more robust understanding of why the artificial agents make the decisions that they do. We also demonstrate transfer of the learned policy to physical flight hardware by deploying a small NCP (200 KB of memory) capable of real-time inference on a Raspberry Pi Zero controlling a DJI Tello drone. Designing interpretable artificial agents is crucial for building trustworthy AIs, both as fully autonomous systems and also for parallel autonomy, where humans and AIs work on collaboratively solving problems in the same environment."}}

We show robust performance of these so-called Helper-AIs when paired with different kinds of partners (both human and artificial agents), including partners that they have not previously encountered during training. In particular, while pairing an expert AI with a non-expert AI leads to performance that is worse than when pairing the non-expert AI with a copy of itself, these Helper-AIs provide a substantial boost in joint performance."}}

A pernicious concern, though, is that of vote buying, which occurs when a bad actor seeks to buy ballots, paying someone to vote against their own intent. This becomes possible whenever a voter is able to sell evidence of which way she voted. We show how to thwart vote buying through decoy ballots, which are not counted but are indistinguishable from real ballots to a buyer. We show that an Election Authority can significantly reduce the power of vote buying through a small number of optimally distributed decoys, and model societal processes by which decoys could be distributed."}}

By committing to play a specific policy, the agent with the correct model can steer the behavior of the other agent, and seek to improve utility. We model this setting as a multi-view decision process, which we use to formally analyze the positive effect of steering policies. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm for computing the agents' achievable joint policy, and we experimentally show that it can lead to a large utility increase when the agents' models diverge."}}
