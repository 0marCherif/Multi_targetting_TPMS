The current ABSA works, however, are mostly limited to the scenario of a single text piece, leaving the study in dialogue contexts unexplored. To bridge the gap between fine-grained sentiment analysis and conversational opinion mining, in this work, we introduce a novel task of conversational aspect-based sentiment quadruple analysis, namely DiaASQ, aiming to detect the quadruple of target-aspect-opinion-sentiment in a dialogue. We manually construct a large-scale high-quality DiaASQ dataset in both Chinese and English languages. We deliberately develop a neural model to benchmark the task, which advances in effectively performing end-to-end quadruple prediction, and manages to incorporate rich dialogue-specific and discourse feature representations for better cross-utterance quadruple extraction. We hope the new benchmark will spur more advancements in the sentiment analysis community."}}

Recently, a growing interest has been built for unified NER, tackling the above three jobs concurrently with one single model. Current best-performing methods mainly include span-based and sequence-to-sequence models, where unfortunately the former merely focus on boundary identification and the latter may suffer from exposure bias. In this work, we present a novel alternative by modeling the unified NER as word-word relation classification, namely W^2NER. The architecture resolves the kernel bottleneck of unified NER by effectively modeling the neighboring relations between entity words with Next-Neighboring-Word (NNW) and Tail-Head-Word-* (THW-*) relations. Based on the W^2NER scheme we develop a neural framework, in which the unified NER is modeled as a 2D grid of word pairs. We then propose multi-granularity 2D convolutions for better refining the grid representations. Finally, a co-predictor is used to sufficiently reason the word-word relations. We perform extensive experiments on 14 widely-used benchmark datasets for flat, overlapped, and discontinuous NER (8 English and 6 Chinese datasets), where our model beats all the current top-performing baselines, pushing the state-of-the-art performances of unified NER."}}

This work presents a novel multiplex cascade framework for unified ABSA and maintaining such interactions. First, we model total seven subtasks as a hierarchical dependency in the easy-to-hard order, based on which we then propose a multiplex decoding mechanism, transferring the sentiment layouts and clues in lower tasks to upper ones. The multiplex strategy enables highly-efficient subtask interflows and avoids repetitive training; meanwhile it sufficiently utilizes the existing data without requiring any further annotation. Further, based on the characteristics of aspect-opinion term extraction and pairing, we enhance our multiplex framework by integrating POS tag and syntactic dependency information for term boundary and pairing identification. The proposed Syntax-aware Multiplex (SyMux) framework enhances the ABSA performances on 28 subtasks (7\u00d74 datasets) with big margins."}}

Existing DiaRE methods either simply concatenate the utterances in a dialogue into a long piece of text, or employ naive words, sentences or entities to build dialogue graphs, while the structural characteristics in dialogues have not been fully utilized. In this work, we investigate a novel dialogue-level mixed dependency graph (D2G) and an argument reasoning graph (ARG) for DiaRE with a global relation reasoning mechanism. First, we model the entire dialogue into a unified and coherent D2G by explicitly integrating both syntactic and discourse structures, which enables richer semantic and feature learning for relation extraction. Second, we stack an ARG graph on top of D2G to further focus on argument inter-dependency learning and argument representation refinement, for sufficient argument relation inference. In our global reasoning framework, D2G and ARG work collaboratively, iteratively performing lexical, syntactic and semantic information exchange and representation learning over the entire dialogue context. On two DiaRE benchmarks, our framework shows considerable improvements over the current state-of-the-art baselines. Further analyses show that the model effectively solves the long-range dependence issue, and meanwhile gives explainable predictions."}}

Therefore EE and CE are frequently utilized as auxiliary tasks for better feature learning, modeled via multi-task learning (MTL) framework by prior works to achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) ECPE results. However, existing MTL-based methods either fail to simultaneously model the specific features and the interactive feature in between, or suffer from the inconsistency of label prediction. In this work, we consider addressing the above challenges for improving ECPE by performing two alignment mechanisms with a novel A^2Net model. We first propose a feature-task alignment to explicitly model the specific emotion-&cause-specific features and the shared interactive feature. Besides, an inter-task alignment is implemented, in which the label distance between the ECPE and the combinations of EE&CE are learned to be narrowed for better label consistency. Evaluations of benchmarks show that our methods outperform current best-performing systems on all ECA subtasks. Further analysis proves the importance of our proposed alignment mechanisms for the task."}}

Most prior work focuses on extracting flat events while neglecting overlapped or nested ones. A few models for overlapped and nested EE includes several successive stages to extract event triggers and arguments,which suffer from error propagation. Therefore, we design a simple yet effective tagging scheme and model to formulate EE as word-word relation recognition, called OneEE. The relations between trigger or argument words are simultaneously recognized in one stage with parallel grid tagging, thus yielding a very fast event extraction speed. The model is equipped with an adaptive event fusion module to generate event-aware representations and a distance-aware predictor to integrate relative distance information for word-word relation recognition, which are empirically demonstrated to be effective mechanisms. Experiments on 3 overlapped and nested EE benchmarks, namely FewFC, Genia11, and Genia13, show that OneEE achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, the inference speed of OneEE is faster than those of baselines in the same condition, and can be further substantially improved since it supports parallel inference."}}

Unfortunately several important characteristics of the CSRL task have been overlooked by the existing works, such as the structural information integration, near-neighbor influence. In this work, we investigate the integration of a latent graph for CSRL. We propose to automatically induce a predicate-oriented latent graph (POLar) with a predicate-centered gaussian mechanism, by which the nearer and informative words to the predicate will be allocated with more attention. The POLar structure is then dynamically pruned and refined so as to best fit the task need. We additionally introduce an effective dialogue-level pre-trained language model, CoDiaBERT, for better supporting multiple utterance sentences and handling the speaker coreference issue in CSRL. Our system outperforms best-performing baselines on three benchmark CSRL datasets with big margins, especially achieving over 4% F1 score improvements on the cross-utterance argument detection. Further analyses are presented to better understand the effectiveness of our proposed methods."}}
