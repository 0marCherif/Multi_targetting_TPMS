Polarization camera is known to be able to capture the polarization of reflected lights that preserves rich geometric cues of an object surface. Inspired by the recent applications in surface normal reconstruction from polarization images, in this paper, we attempt to estimate human pose and shape from single polarization images by leveraging the polarization-induced geometric cues. A dedicated two-stage pipeline is proposed: given a single polarization image, stage one (Polar2Normal) focuses on the fine detailed human body surface normal estimation; stage two (Polar2Shape) then reconstructs clothed human shape from the polarization image and the estimated surface normal. To empirically validate our approach, a dedicated dataset (PHSPD) is constructed, consisting of over 500K frames with accurate pose and parametric shape annotations. Empirical evaluations on this real-world dataset as well as a synthetic dataset, SURREAL, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. It suggests polarization camera as a promising alternative to the more conventional RGB camera for human pose and shape estimation."}}

The generated motions are expected to be sufficiently diverse to explore the text-grounded motion space, and more importantly, accurately depicting the content in prescribed text descriptions. Here we tackle this problem with a two-stage approach: text2length sampling and text2motion generation. Text2length involves sampling from the learned distribution function of motion lengths conditioned on the input text. This is followed by our text2motion module using temporal variational autoen-coder to synthesize a diverse set of human motions of the sampled lengths. Instead of directly engaging with pose sequences, we propose motion snippet code as our internal motion representation, which captures local semantic motion contexts and is empirically shown to facilitate the generation of plausible motions faithful to the input text. Moreover, a large-scale dataset of scripted 3D Human motions, HumanML3D, is constructed, consisting of 14,616 motion clips and 44,970 text descriptions."}}

The key issue lies in the ability to synthesize multiple distinct motion sequences that are realistic in their visual appearances. It is achieved in this paper by a two-step process that maintains internal 3D pose and shape representations, action2motion and motion2video. Action2motion stochastically generates plausible 3D pose sequences of a prescribed action category, which are processed and rendered by motion2video to form 2D videos. Specifically, the Lie algebraic theory is engaged in representing natural human motions following the physical law of human kinematics; a temporal variational auto-encoder is developed that encourages diversity of output motions. Moreover, given an additional input image of a clothed human character, an entire pipeline is proposed to extract his/her 3D detailed shape, and to render in videos the plausible motions from different views. This is realized by improving existing methods to extract 3D human shapes and textures from single 2D images, rigging, animating, and rendering to form 2D videos of human motions. It also necessitates the curation and reannotation of 3D human motion datasets for training purpose. Thorough empirical experiments including ablation study, qualitative and quantitative evaluations manifest the applicability of our approach, and demonstrate its competitiveness in addressing related tasks, where components of our approach are compared favorably to the state-of-the-arts."}}

To tackle the existing challenges, especially to enable the generation of multiple distinct motions from the same text, and to avoid the undesirable production of trivial motionless pose sequences, we propose the use of motion token, a discrete and compact motion representation. This provides one level playing ground when considering both motions and text signals, as the motion and text tokens, respectively. Moreover, our motion2text module is integrated into the inverse alignment process of our text2motion training pipeline, where a significant deviation of synthesized text from the input text would be penalized by a large training loss; empirically this is shown to effectively improve performance. Finally, the mappings in-between the two modalities of motions and texts are facilitated by adapting the neural model for machine translation (NMT) to our context. This autoregressive modeling of the distribution over discrete motion tokens further enables non-deterministic production of pose sequences, of variable lengths, from an input text. Our approach is flexible, could be used for both text2motion and motion2text tasks. Empirical evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on both tasks over a variety of state-of-the-art methods.

Events, on the other hand, have their unique challenges: rather than capturing static body postures, the event signals are best at capturing local motions. This leads us to propose a two-stage deep learning approach, called EventHPE. The first-stage, FlowNet, is trained by unsupervised learning to infer optical flow from events. Both events and optical flow are closely related to human body dynamics, which are fed as input to the ShapeNet in the second stage, to estimate 3D human shapes. To mitigate the discrepancy between image-based flow (optical flow) and shape-based flow (vertices movement of human body shape), a novel flow coherence loss is introduced by exploiting the fact that both flows are originated from the identical human motion. An in-house event-based 3D human dataset is curated that comes with 3D pose and shape annotations, which is by far the largest one to our knowledge. Empirical evaluations on DHP19 dataset and our in-house dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}}

Importantly, the set of generated motions are expected to maintain its diversity to be able to explore the entire action-conditioned motion space; meanwhile, each sampled sequence faithfully resembles a natural human body articulation dynamics. Motivated by these objectives, we follow the physics law of human kinematics by adopting the Lie Algebra theory to represent the natural human motions; we also propose a temporal Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) that encourages a diverse sampling of the motion space.

When leveraging emotional signals, the existing methods focus on exploiting the emotions of news contents that conveyed by the publishers (i.e., publisher emotion). However, fake news often evokes high-arousal or activating emotions of people, so the emotions of news comments aroused in the crowd (i.e., social emotion) should not be ignored. Furthermore, it remains to be explored whether there exists a relationship between publisher emotion and social emotion (i.e., dual emotion), and how the dual emotion appears in fake news. In this paper, we verify that dual emotion is distinctive between fake and real news and propose Dual Emotion Features to represent dual emotion and the relationship between them for fake news detection. Further, we exhibit that our proposed features can be easily plugged into existing fake news detectors as an enhancement. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (one in English and the others in Chinese) show that our proposed feature set: 1) outperforms the state-of-the-art task-related emotional features; 2) can be well compatible with existing fake news detectors and effectively improve the performance of detecting fake news."}}
