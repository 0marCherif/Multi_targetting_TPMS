Practical applications are commonly limited to a certain cost per inference. Cascades of pretrained models with conditional execution address these requirements based on the intuition that some inputs are easy enough that they can be processed correctly by a small model allowing for an early exit. If the small model is not sufficiently confident in its prediction, the input is passed on to a larger model. The selection of the confidence threshold allows to trade off compute effort against accuracy. In this work, we explore the effective design of model cascades, and thoroughly evaluate the impact on the accuracy-compute trade-off. We find that they not only interpolate favorably between pretrained models, but that this trade-off curve commonly outperforms single models. This allows us to redefine most of the ImageNet Pareto front already with 2-model cascades, achieving an average reduction in compute effort at equal accuracy of almost 3.1x above 86% and more than 1.9x between 80% and 86% top-1 accuracy. We confirm the wide applicability and effectiveness of the method on the GLUE benchmark. We release the code to reproduce our experiments in the supplementary material and use only publicly available models and datasets."}}

However, for practical use on mobile devices these networks often require too many FLOPs and reducing the FLOPs of a convolution layer, also reduces its parameter count. This is problematic in view of the recent finding that heavily over-parameterized neural networks are often the ones that generalize best. In this paper we propose to use HyperNetworks to break the fixed ratio of FLOPs to parameters of standard convolutions. This allows us to exceed previous state-of-the-art architectures in SSIM and MS-SSIM on the Zurich RAW-to-DSLR (ZRR) data-set at > 10x reduced FLOP-count. On ZRR we further observe generalization curves consistent with 'double-descent' behavior at fixed FLOP-count, in the large image limit. Finally we demonstrate the same technique can be applied to an existing network (VDN) to reduce its computational cost while maintaining fidelity on the Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD). Code for key functions is given in the supplemental."}}

We can identify certain common operations which contribute to the bulk of the computations of these workloads and thus also to the overall energy footprint. Besides data-transport and generic multiply-accumulate operations, convolutions with relatively small kernels constitute a substantial part of today\u2019s AI workloads. In this paper we will investigate potential and limitations of optical convolutional processors for AI workloads to improve their energy efficiency. We underline our findings with a thorough system analysis and with simulation and measurement results of a sequential lattice filter type optical convolutional processor on silicon."}}

This fixed function approach severely limits the sensors' ability to capture high-dynamic-range (HDR) scenes and resolve high-speed dynamics. Spatially varying pixel exposures have been introduced as a powerful computational photography approach to optically encode irradiance on a sensor and computationally recover additional information of a scene, but existing approaches rely on heuristic coding schemes and bulky spatial light modulators to optically implement these exposure functions. Here, we introduce neural sensors as a methodology to optimize per-pixel shutter functions jointly with a differentiable image processing method, such as a neural network, in an end-to-end fashion. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage emerging programmable and re-configurable sensor-processors to implement the optimized exposure functions directly on the sensor. Our system takes specific limitations of the sensor into account to optimize physically feasible optical codes and we evaluate its performance for snapshot HDR and high-speed compressive imaging both in simulation and experimentally with real scenes."}}

In addition to their compactness and non-volatility features, they are characterized by computationally relevant physical properties, such as state-dependence, non-linear conductance changes, and intrinsic variability in both their switching threshold and conductance values, that make them ideal devices for emulating the bio-physics of real synapses. In this paper we present a spiking neural network architecture that supports the use of memristive devices as synaptic elements, and propose mixed-signal analog-digital interfacing circuits which mitigate the effect of variability in their conductance values and exploit their variability in the switching threshold, for implementing stochastic learning. The effect of device variability is mitigated by using pairs of memristive devices configured in a complementary push-pull mechanism and interfaced to a current-mode normalizer circuit. The stochastic learning mechanism is obtained by mapping the desired change in synaptic weight into a corresponding switching probability that is derived from the intrinsic stochastic behavior of memristive devices. We demonstrate the features of the CMOS circuits and apply the architecture proposed to a standard neural network hand-written digit classification benchmark based on the MNIST data-set. We evaluate the performance of the approach proposed on this benchmark using behavioral-level spiking neural network simulation, showing both the effect of the reduction in conductance variability produced by the current-mode normalizer circuit, and the increase in performance as a function of the number of memristive devices used in each synapse."}}

However, the intrinsic stochasticity in their switching behavior, non-linear characteristics, and variability limit their operation in real systems. In this paper we propose spike-based learning circuits designed to exploit the stochastic properties of memristors. This implements a probabilistic version of a local gradient descent rule, namely the delta rule, for online learning in neuromorphic chips. The circuits proposed translate the delta error to the slope of a ramp voltage which modulates the probability of resistive switching in very low resolution (i.e. binary) memristive devices. We demonstrate the feasibility and computational power of such approach, using a spiking neural network simulator to carry out system level behavioral simulations of the neuromorphic architecture applied to a classification task of digits 0 to 4 in the MNIST data-set."}}

This is achieved by performing computation on an analog focal-plane processor that analyses frames captured through a vibrating liquid focus-tunable lens. The optical system provides shallow depth of focus images and fast sweeps of optical power, while the use of pixel-level processing removes the sensor-processor bandwidth limitations of depth-from-focus systems built using conventional imaging and processor technologies. All-in-focus images are also obtained."}}
