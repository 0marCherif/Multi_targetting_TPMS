As people who speak different languages share biologically similar visual systems, various unsupervised multi-modal machine translation (UMMT) models have been proposed to improve the performances of UMT by employing visual contents in natural images to facilitate alignment. Commonly, relation information is the important semantic in a sentence. Compared with images, videos can better present the interactions between objects and the ways in which an object transforms over time. However, current state-of-the-art methods only explore scene-level or object-level information from images without explicitly modeling objects relation; thus, they are sensitive to spurious correlations, which poses a new challenge for UMMT models. In this paper, we employ a spatial-temporal graph obtained from videos to exploit object interactions in space and time for disambiguation purposes and to promote latent space alignment in UMMT. Our model employs multi-modal back-translation and features pseudo-visual pivoting, in which we learn a shared multilingual visual-semantic embedding space and incorporate visually pivoted captioning as additional weak supervision. Experimental results on the VATEX Translation 2020 and HowToWorld datasets validate the translation capabilities of our model on both sentence-level and word-level and generalizes well when videos are not available during the testing phase."}}

It can significantly reduce the requirement of large amounts of task-specific data by sufficiently sharing medical knowledge among different tasks. However, due to the challenges of designing strongly generalizable models with limited and complex medical data, most existing approaches tend to develop task-specific models. To take a step towards MAGI, we propose a new paradigm called Medical-knOwledge-enhanced mulTimOdal pretRaining (MOTOR). In MOTOR, we combine two kinds of basic medical knowledge, i.e., general and specific knowledge, in a complementary manner to boost the general pretraining process. As a result, the foundation model with comprehensive basic knowledge can learn compact representations from pretraining radiographic data for better cross-modal alignment. MOTOR unifies the understanding and generation, which are two kinds of core intelligence of an AI system, into a single medical foundation model, to flexibly handle more diverse medical tasks. To enable a comprehensive evaluation and facilitate further research, we construct a medical multimodal benchmark including a wide range of downstream tasks, such as chest x-ray report generation and medical visual question answering. Extensive experiments on our benchmark show that MOTOR obtains promising results through simple task-oriented adaptation. The visualization shows that the injected knowledge successfully highlights key information in the medical data, demonstrating the excellent interpretability of MOTOR. Our MOTOR successfully mimics the human practice of fulfilling a \"medical student\" to accelerate the process of becoming a \"specialist\". We believe that our work makes a significant stride in realizing MAGI."}}

Recently, researchers have enhanced data-driven neural networks with medical knowledge graphs to eliminate the severe visual and textual bias in this task. The structures of such graphs are exploited by using the clinical dependencies formed by the disease topic tags via general knowledge and usually do not update during the training process. Consequently, the fixed graphs can not guarantee the most appropriate scope of knowledge and limit the effectiveness. To address the limitation, we propose a knowledge graph with Dynamic structure and nodes to facilitate medical report generation with Contrastive Learning, named DCL. In detail, the fundamental structure of our graph is pre-constructed from general knowledge. Then we explore specific knowledge extracted from the retrieved reports to add additional nodes or redefine their relations in a bottom-up manner. Each image feature is integrated with its very own updated graph before being fed into the decoder module for report generation. Finally, this paper introduces Image-Report Contrastive and Image-Report Matching losses to better represent visual features and textual information. Evaluated on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, our DCL outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on these two benchmarks."}}

However, beyond the common difficulties faced in the natural image captioning, medical report generation specifically requires the model to describe a medical image with a fine-grained and semantic-coherence paragraph that should satisfy both medical commonsense and logic. Previous works generally extract the global image features and attempt to generate a paragraph that is similar to referenced reports; however, this approach has two limitations. Firstly, the regions of primary interest to radiologists are usually located in a small area of the global image, meaning that the remainder parts of the image could be considered as irrelevant noise in the training procedure. Secondly, there are many similar sentences used in each medical report to describe the normal regions of the image, which causes serious data bias. This deviation is likely to teach models to generate these inessential sentences on a regular basis. To address these problems, we propose an Auxiliary Signal-Guided Knowledge Encoder-Decoder (ASGK) to mimic radiologists\u2019 working patterns. Specifically, the auxiliary patches are explored to expand the widely used visual patch features before fed to the Transformer encoder, while the external linguistic signals help the decoder better master prior knowledge during the pre-training process. Our approach performs well on common benchmarks, including CX-CHR, IU X-Ray, and COVID-19 CT Report dataset (COV-CTR), demonstrating combining auxiliary signals with transformer architecture can bring a significant improvement in terms of medical report generation. The experimental results confirm that auxiliary signals driven Transformer-based models are with solid capabilities to outperform previous approaches on both medical terminology classification and paragraph generation metrics."}}

However, interactions with motor vehicles remain a key barrier to increased cycling participation. The ability to detect potentially dangerous interactions from on-bike sensing could provide important information to riders and policy makers. Thus, automated detection of conflict between cyclists and drivers has attracted researchers from both computer vision and road safety communities. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark, called Cyc-CP, towards cycling close pass near miss event detection from video streams. We first divide this task into scene-level and instance-level problems. Scene-level detection asks an algorithm to predict whether there is a close pass near miss event in the input video clip. Instance-level detection aims to detect which vehicle in the scene gives rise to a close pass near miss. We propose two benchmark models based on deep learning techniques for these two problems. For training and testing those models, we construct a synthetic dataset and also collect a real-world dataset. Our models can achieve 88.13% and 84.60% accuracy on the real-world dataset, respectively. We envision this benchmark as a test-bed to accelerate cycling close pass near miss detection and facilitate interaction between the fields of road safety, intelligent transportation systems and artificial intelligence. Both the benchmark datasets and detection models will be available at https://github.com/SustainableMobility/cyc-cp to facilitate experimental reproducibility and encourage more in-depth research in the field."}}

To endow models with the capability of incorporating expert knowledge, we propose a Cross-modal clinical Graph Transformer (CGT) for ophthalmic report generation (ORG), in which clinical relation triples are injected into the visual features as prior knowledge to drive the decoding procedure. However, two major common Knowledge Noise (KN) issues may affect models' effectiveness. 1) Existing general biomedical knowledge bases such as the UMLS may not align meaningfully to the specific context and language of the report, limiting their utility for knowledge injection. 2) Incorporating too much knowledge may divert the visual features from their correct meaning. To overcome these limitations, we design an automatic information extraction scheme based on natural language processing to obtain clinical entities and relations directly from in-domain training reports. Given a set of ophthalmic images, our CGT first restores a sub-graph from the clinical graph and injects the restored triples into visual features. Then visible matrix is employed during the encoding procedure to limit the impact of knowledge. Finally, reports are predicted by the encoded cross-modal features via a Transformer decoder.

Unlike traditional timer-series forecasting tasks, M-LSTF tasks are more challenging from two aspects: 1) M-LSTF models need to learn time-series patterns both within and between multiple time features; 2) Under the rolling forecasting setting, the similarity between two consecutive training samples increases with the increasing prediction length, which makes models more prone to overfitting. In this paper, we propose a generalizable memory-driven Transformer to target M-LSTF problems. Specifically, we first propose a global-level memory component to drive the forecasting procedure by integrating multiple time-series features. In addition, we adopt a progressive fashion to train our model to increase its generalizability, in which we gradually introduce Bernoulli noises to training samples. Extensive experiments have been performed on five different datasets across multiple fields. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can be seamlessly plugged into varying Transformer-based models to improve their performances up to roughly 30%. Particularly, this is the first work to specifically focus on the M-LSTF tasks to the best of our knowledge."}}
