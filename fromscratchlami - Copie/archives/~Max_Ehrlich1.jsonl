While video compression continues to mature, for many, and particularly for extreme, compression settings, quality loss is still noticeable. These extreme settings nevertheless have important applications to the efficient transmission of videos over bandwidth constrained or otherwise unstable connections. In this work, we develop a deep learning architecture capable of restoring detail to compressed videos which leverages the underlying structure and motion information embedded in the video bitstream. We show that this improves restoration accuracy compared to prior compression correction methods and is competitive when compared with recent deep-learning-based video compression methods on rate-distortion while achieving higher throughput."}}

Many problems which were severely limited using classical solutions are now seeing unprecedented success. The rapid proliferation of deep learning methods has led to a sharp increase in their use in consumer and embedded applications. One consequence of consumer and embedded applications is lossy multimedia compression which is required to engineer the efficient storage and transmission of data in these real-world scenarios. As such, there has been increased interest in a deep learning solution for multimedia compression which would allow for higher compression ratios and increased visual quality. The deep learning approach to multimedia compression, so called Learned Multimedia Compression, involves computing a compressed representation of an image or video using a deep network for the encoder and the decoder. While these techniques have enjoyed impressive academic success, their industry adoption has been essentially non-existent. Classical compression techniques like JPEG and MPEG are too entrenched in modern computing to be easily replaced. This dissertation takes an orthogonal approach and leverages deep learning to improve the compression fidelity of these classical algorithms. This allows the incredible advances in deep learning to be used for multimedia compression without threatening the ubiquity of the classical methods. The key insight of this work is that methods which are motivated by first principles, i.e., the underlying engineering decisions that were made when the compression algorithms were developed, are more effective than general methods. By encoding prior knowledge into the design of the algorithm, the flexibility, performance, and/or accuracy are improved at the cost of generality..."}}

A deep understanding of these examples can provide new insights towards the development of more effective attacks and defenses. Driven by the common misconception that adversarial examples are high-frequency noise, we present a frequency-based understanding of adversarial examples, supported by theoretical and empirical findings. Our analysis shows that adversarial examples are neither in high-frequency nor in low-frequency components, but are simply dataset dependent. Particularly, we highlight the glaring disparities between models trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-derived datasets. Utilizing this framework, we analyze many intriguing properties of training robust models with frequency constraints, and propose a frequency-based explanation for the commonly observed accuracy vs. robustness trade-off."}}

With better systems for diagnosis, many cases of vision loss caused by retinal disease could be entirely avoided. In this work, we present ReLaX, a novel deep learning framework for explainable, accurate classification of retinal pathologies which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Furthermore, we emphasize producing both qualitative and quantitative explanations of the model's decisions. While previous works use pixel-level attribution methods for generating model explanations, our work uses a novel retinal layer attribution method for producing rich qualitative and quantitative model explanations. ReLaX determines the importance of each retinal layer by combining heatmaps with an OCT segmentation model. Our work is the first to produce detailed quantitative explanations of a model's predictions in this way. The combination of accuracy and interpretability can be clinically applied for accessible, high-quality patient care."}}
