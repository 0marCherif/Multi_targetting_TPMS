Rather than rely on the points of the cloud itself, we identify a smooth implicit surface to represent the boundary of the cloud. By constructing a scalar field using a semantically-informative pseudopotential function, we take an arbitrary-resolution iso-surface and apply standard computer vision morphological transformations and edge detection on 2D slices of the pseudopotential field. When recombined, these slices comprise a new point-cloud representing the 3D boundary of the object as determined by the chosen isosurface. Our method leverages the strength and accessibility of 2D vision tools to identify smooth and semantically significant boundaries of ill-defined 3D objects, and additionally provides a continuous scalar field containing insight regarding the internal structure of the object. Our method enables a powerful and easily implementable pipeline for 3D boundary identification, particularly in domains where natural candidates for pseudopotential functions are already present."}}

A common strategy to diminish this cost is to reduce data used in training, however this often comes at the expense of the model's accuracy or an additional computational cost in training. We propose progressive data dropout (PDD), an adaptive training strategy which performs class-level data dropout from the training set as the network develops an understanding for each class. Our experiments on large-scale image classification demonstrate PDD reduces the total number of datapoints needed to train the network by a factor of 10, reducing the overall training time without significantly impacting accuracy or modifying the model architecture. We additionally demonstrate improvements via experiments and ablations on computer vision benchmarks, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets."}}

Real world data is diverse and can vary over time - sensors may become damaged, environments may change, or users may provide malicious inputs. While substantial research has focused separately on processing specific image distortions or on defending against types of adversarial attack, some real-world applications will require vision models to generalize to corruptions, while additionally maintaining image quality. We propose a simple training strategy to leverage image reconstruction, with similarities to a GAN training process, to reduce image data corruptions while maintaining the visual integrity of the image. Our approach is demonstrated on several corruptions for the task of image classification, and compared with established approaches, with qualitative and quantitative improvements.

However, most existing studies on performance prediction for cloud applications in multitenant clouds are at the system level and may require access to performance counters in hypervisors. In this work, we propose uPredict, a user-level profiler-based performance predictive framework for single-VM (virtual machine) applications in multitenant clouds. We designed three micro-benchmarks to assess the contention of CPUs, memory and disks in a VM, respectively. Based on the measured performance of an application and micro-benchmarks, the application and VM-specific predictive models are derived by exploiting various regression and neural network based techniques. These models can then be used to predict the application's performance using the in-situ profiled resource contention with the micro-benchmarks. We evaluated uPredict extensively with representative benchmarks from PARSEC, NAS Parallel Benchmarks and CloudSuite, on a private cloud and two public clouds. The results show that the average prediction errors are between 10.4% to 17% for various predictive models on the private cloud with high resource contention, while the errors are within 4% on public clouds. A smart load-balancing scheme powered by uPredict is presented and can effectively reduce the execution and turnaround times of the considered application by 19% and 10%, respectively."}}

While it is a well-studied computer vision problem, most state-of-the-art models require large amounts of labeled data, which is limited in this specific domain. An additional consideration in eye tracking is the capacity for real-time predictions, necessary for responsive AR/VR interfaces. In this work, we propose EyeSeg, an encoder-decoder architecture designed for accurate pixel-wise few-shot semantic segmentation with limited annotated data. We report results from the OpenEDS2020 Challenge, yielding a 94.5% mean Intersection Over Union (mIOU) score, which is a 10.5% score increase over the baseline approach. The experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while preserving a low latency framework. Source code is available: http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~fernandez/segmentation.html ."}}

These adversarial examples drift model predictions away from the original intent of the network and are a growing concern in practical security. In order to combat these attacks, neural networks can leverage traditional image processing approaches or state-of-the-art defensive models to reduce perturbations in the data. Defensive approaches that take a global approach to noise reduction are effective against adversarial attacks, however their lossy approach often distorts important data within the image. In this work, we propose a visual saliency based approach to cleaning data affected by an adversarial attack. Our model leverages the salient regions of an adversarial image in order to provide a targeted countermeasure while comparatively reducing loss within the cleaned images. We measure the accuracy of our model by evaluating the effectiveness of state-of-the-art saliency methods prior to attack, under attack, and after application of cleaning methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in comparison with related defenses and against established adversarial attack methods, across two saliency datasets. Our targeted approach shows significant improvements in a range of standard statistical and distance saliency metrics, in comparison with both traditional and state-of-the-art approaches."}}

Software defined networks (SDN) point to a promising solution, as a network paradigm which decouples the centralized control intelligence from the forwarding logic.
