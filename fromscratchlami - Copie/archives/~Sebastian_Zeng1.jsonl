That is, given a capacity measure of the underlying hypothesis class - in our case, empirical Rademacher complexity - to what extent can we (a priori) constrain this class while retaining an empirical error on a par with the unconstrained regime? To assess excess capacity in modern architectures (such as residual networks), we extend and unify prior Rademacher complexity bounds to accommodate function composition and addition, as well as the structure of convolutions. The capacity-driving terms in our bounds are the Lipschitz constants of the layers and a (2,1) group norm distance to the initializations of the convolution weights. Experiments on benchmark datasets of varying task difficulty indicate that (1) there is a substantial amount of excess capacity per task, and (2) capacity can be kept at a surprisingly similar level across tasks. Overall, this suggests a notion of compressibility with respect to weight norms, complementary to classic compression via weight pruning.

Most approaches, ranging from traditional statistical methods to recent learning-based techniques with neural networks, directly operate on raw time series observations. As an extension, we study whether local topological properties, as captured via persistent homology, can serve as a reliable signal that provides complementary information for learning to forecast. To this end, we propose topological attention, which allows attending to local topological features within a time horizon of historical data. Our approach easily integrates into existing end-to-end trainable forecasting models, such as N-BEATS, and, in combination with the latter exhibits state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale M4 benchmark dataset of 100,000 diverse time series from different domains. Ablation experiments, as well as a comparison to recent techniques in a setting where only a single time series is available for training, corroborate the beneficial nature of including local topological information through an attention mechanism."}}
