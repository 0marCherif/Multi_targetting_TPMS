This study examines reading challenges, how participation in them has changed throughout the years, and how they influence users reading productivity. To do so, we analyze Goodreads, a social book cataloging website, with a yearly challenge feature. We further show that gender is a significant factor in how successful individuals are in their challenges. Additionally, we investigate the association between participation in reading challenges and the number of books people read."}}
