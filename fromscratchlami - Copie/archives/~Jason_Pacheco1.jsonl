Variational MI approximations are widely used as flexible estimators for this purpose, but computing them typically requires solving a costly nonconvex optimization. We prove that a widely used class of variational MI estimators can be solved via moment matching operations in place of the numerical optimization methods that are typically required. We show that the same moment matching solution yields variational estimates for so-called \u201cimplicit\u201d models that lack a closed form likelihood function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this moment matching solution has multiple orders of magnitude computational speed up compared to the standard optimization based solutions. We show that theoretical results are supported by numerical evaluation in fully parameterized Gaussian mixture models and a generalized linear model with implicit likelihood due to nuisance variables. We also demonstrate on the implicit simulation-based likelihood SIR epidemiology model, where we avoid costly likelihood free inference and observe many orders of magnitude speedup."}}

State-of-the-art decoders deployed in human iBCIs are derived from a Kalman filter that assumes Markov dynamics on the angle of intended movement, and a unimodal dependence on intended angle for each channel of neural activity. Due to errors made in the decoding of noisy neural data, as a user attempts to move the cursor to a goal, the angle between cursor and goal positions may change rapidly. We propose a dynamic Bayesian network that includes the on-screen goal position as part of its latent state, and thus allows the person\u2019s intended angle of movement to be aggregated over a much longer history of neural activity. This multiscale model explicitly captures the relationship between instantaneous angles of motion and long-term goals, and incorporates semi-Markov dynamics for motion trajectories. We also introduce a multimodal likelihood model for recordings of neural populations which can be rapidly calibrated for clinical applications. In offline experiments with recorded neural data, we demonstrate significantly improved prediction of motion directions compared to the Kalman filter. We derive an efficient online inference algorithm, enabling a clinical trial participant with tetraplegia to control a computer cursor with neural activity in real time. The observed kinematics of cursor movement are objectively straighter and smoother than prior iBCI decoding models without loss of responsiveness."}}

We develop a particle-based max-product algorithm which maintains a diverse set of posterior mode hypotheses, and is robust to initialization. At each iteration, the set of hypotheses at each node is augmented via stochastic proposals, and then reduced via an efficient selection algorithm. The integer program underlying our optimization-based particle selection minimizes errors in subsequent max-product message updates. This objective automatically encourages diversity in the maintained hypotheses, without requiring tuning of application-specific distances among hypotheses. By avoiding the stochastic resampling steps underlying particle sum-product algorithms, we also avoid common degeneracies where particles collapse onto a single hypothesis. Our approach significantly outperforms previous particle-based algorithms in experiments focusing on the estimation of human pose from single images."}}
