For instance, increased greenhouse gas concentrations are predicted to lead to drastic decreases in low cloud cover, referred to as a climatological tipping point. In this paper, we learn the evolution of such non-stationary dynamical systems using a novel recurrent neural operator (RNO), which learns mappings between function spaces. After training RNO on only the pre-tipping dynamics, we employ it to detect future tipping points using an uncertainty-based approach. In particular, we propose a conformal prediction framework to forecast tipping points by monitoring deviations from physics con- straints (such as conserved quantities and partial differential equations), enabling forecasting of these abrupt changes along with a rigorous measure of uncertainty. We illustrate our proposed methodology on non-stationary ordinary and partial differential equations, such as the Lorenz-63 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations. We also apply our methods to forecast a climate tipping point in stratocumulus cloud cover. In our experiments, we demonstrate that even partial or approximate physics constraints can be used to accurately forecast future tipping points."}}

These challenges limited prior neural operator modelsMemory complexity and data scarcity are two main pressing challenges in learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDE) at high resolutions. These challenges limited prior neural operator models to low/mid-resolution problems rather than full scale real-world problems. Yet, these problems possess spatially local structures that is not used by previous approaches. We propose to exploit this natural structure of real-world phenomena to predict solutions locally and unite them into a global solution. Specifically, we introduce a neural operator that scales to large resolutions by leveraging local and global structures through decomposition of both the input domain and the operator's parameter space. It consists of a multi-grid tensorized  neural operator (MG-TFNO), a new data efficient and highly parallelizable operator learning approach with reduced memory requirement and better generalization. MG-TFNO employs a novel multi-grid based domain decomposition approach to exploit the spatially local structure in the data. Using the FNO as a backbone, its parameters are represented in a high-order latent subspace of the Fourier domain, through a global tensor factorization, resulting in an extreme reduction in the number of parameters and improved generalization. In addition, the low-rank regularization it applies to the parameters enables efficient learning in low-data regimes, which is particularly relevant for solving PDEs where obtaining ground-truth predictions is extremely costly and samples, therefore, are limited. We empirically verify the efficiency of our method on the turbulent Navier-Stokes equations where we demonstrate superior performance, with 2.5 times lower error, 10X compression of the model parameters, and 1.8X compression of the input domain size. Our tensorization approach yields up to 400x reduction in the number of parameter without loss in accuracy. Similarly, our domain decomposition method gives a 7x reduction in the domain size while slightly improving accuracy. Furthermore, our method can be trained with much fewer samples than previous approaches, outperforming the FNO when trained with just half the samples."}}

Despite this unpredictable behavior, for many dissipative systems the statistics of the long term trajectories are governed by an invariant measure supported on a set, known as the global attractor; for many problems this set is finite dimensional, even if the state space is infinite dimensional. For Markovian systems, the statistical properties of long-term trajectories are uniquely determined by the solution operator that maps the evolution of the system over arbitrary positive time increments. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework to learn the underlying solution operator for dissipative chaotic systems, showing that the resulting learned operator accurately captures short-time trajectories and long-time statistical behavior. Using this framework, we are able to predict various statistics of the invariant measure for the turbulent Kolmogorov Flow dynamics with Reynolds numbers up to $5000$."}}

They can be classified into two broad categories: solution function approximation, and operator learning. The Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is an example of the former while the Fourier neural operator (FNO) is an example of the latter. Both these approaches have shortcomings. The optimization in PINN is challenging and prone to failure, especially on multi-scale dynamic systems. FNO does not suffer from this optimization issue since it carries out supervised learning on a given dataset, but obtaining such data may be too expensive or infeasible. In this work, we propose the physics-informed neural operator (PINO), where we combine the operating-learning and function-optimization frameworks, and this improves convergence rates and accuracy over both PINN and FNO models. In the operator-learning phase, PINO learns the solution operator over multiple instances of the parametric PDE family. In the test-time optimization phase, PINO optimizes the pre-trained operator ansatz for the querying instance of the PDE. Experiments show PINO outperforms previous ML methods on many popular PDE families while retaining the extraordinary speed-up of FNO compared to solvers. In particular, PINO accurately solves long temporal transient flows and chaotic Kolmogorov flows, while PINN and other methods fail to converge to a reasonable accuracy.  "}}

Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The Fourier neural operator is the first ML-based method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers. Additionally, it achieves superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under fixed resolution."}}

The purpose of this work is to generalize neural networks so that they can learn mappings between infinite-dimensional spaces (operators). We formulate approximation of the infinite-dimensional mapping by composing nonlinear activation functions and a class of integral operators. The kernel integration is computed by message passing on graph networks. This approach has substantial practical consequences which we will illustrate in the context of mappings between input data to partial differential equations (PDEs) and their solutions. In this context, such learned networks can generalize among different approximation methods for the PDE (such as finite difference or finite element methods) and among approximations corresponding to different underlying levels of resolution and discretization. Experiments confirm the purposed graph kernel network does have the desired properties and show competitive performance compared to the stat of the art solvers."}}
