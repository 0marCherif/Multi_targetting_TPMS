Thus one of the key challenges in Visual Dialogue task is to learn a more comprehensive and semantic-rich image representation that can adaptively attend to the visual content referred by variant questions. In this paper, we first propose a novel scheme to depict an image from both visual and semantic views. Specifically, the visual view aims to capture the appearance-level information in an image, including objects and their visual relationships, while the semantic view enables the agent to understand high-level visual semantics from the whole image to the local regions. Furthermore, on top of such dual-view image representations, we propose a Dual Encoding Visual Dialogue (DualVD) module, which is able to adaptively select question-relevant information from the visual and semantic views in a hierarchical mode. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DualVD, we propose two novel visual dialogue models by applying it to the Late Fusion framework and Memory Network framework. The proposed models achieve state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets. A critical advantage of the DualVD module lies in its interpretability. We can analyze which modality (visual or semantic) has more contribution in answering the current question by explicitly visualizing the gate values. It gives us insights in understanding of information selection mode in the Visual Dialogue task. The code is available at https://github.com/JXZe/Learning_DualVD."}}

One limitation of existing FVQA solutions is that they jointly embed all kinds of information with- out fine-grained selection, which introduces unexpected noises for reasoning the final answer. How to capture the question-oriented and information- complementary evidence remains a key challenge to solve the problem. In this paper, we depict an image by a multi-modal heterogeneous graph, which contains multiple layers of information corresponding to the visual, semantic and factual features. On top of the multi-layer graph representations, we propose a modality-aware heterogeneous graph convolutional network to capture evidence from different layers that is most relevant to the given question. Specifically, the intra-modal graph convolution selects evidence from each modality and cross-modal graph convolution aggregates relevant information across different modalities. By stacking this process multiple times, our model performs iterative reasoning and predicts the optimal answer by analyzing all question-oriented evidence. We achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on the FVQA task and demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model with extensive experiments.

However, the performance of Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is unsatisfactory when faced with biased data in real-world scenarios. Conventional debiasing research mainly studies from the view of balancing data distribution or learning unbiased models and representations, ignoring the correlations among the biased classes. In this work, we analyze this problem from a novel cognition perspective: automatically building a hierarchical cognitive structure from the biased predictions and nav- igating that hierarchy to locate the relationships, making the tail relationships receive more attention in a coarse-to-fine mode. To this end, we pro- pose a novel debiasing Cognition Tree (CogTree) loss for unbiased SGG. We first build a cognitive structure CogTree to organize the relationships based on the prediction of a biased SGG model. The CogTree distinguishes remarkably different relationships at first and then focuses on a small portion of easily confused ones. Then, we pro- pose a debiasing loss specially for this cognitive structure, which supports coarse-to-fine distinction for the correct relationships. The loss is model- agnostic and consistently boosting the performance of several state-of-the-art models. The code is available at: https://github.com/CYVincent/Scene- Graph-Transformer-CogTree."}}

One limitation of existing solutions is that they capture relevant knowledge from text-only knowledge bases, which merely contain facts expressed by first-order predicates or language descriptions while lacking complex but indispensable multimodal knowledge for visual understanding. How to construct vision-relevant and explainable multimodal knowledge for the VQA scenario has been less studied. In this paper, we propose MuKEA to represent multimodal knowledge by an explicit triplet to correlate visual objects and fact answers with implicit relations. To bridge the heterogeneous gap, we propose three objective losses to learn the triplet representations from complementary views: embedding structure, topological relation and semantic space. By adopting a pre-training and fine-tuning learning strategy, both basic and domain-specific multimodal knowledge are progressively accumulated for answer prediction. We outperform the state-of-the-art by 3.35% and 6.08% respectively on two challenging knowledge-required datasets: OK-VQA and KRVQA. Experimental results prove the complementary benefits of the multimodal knowledge with existing knowledge bases and the advantages of our end-to-end framework over the existing pipeline methods.

However, aggregating massive (unlabeled) 3D medical images like computerized tomography (CT) remains challenging due to its high imaging cost and privacy restrictions. In this paper, we advocate bringing a wealth of 2D images like chest X-rays as compensation for the lack of 3D data, aiming to build a universal medical self-supervised representation learning framework, called UniMiSS. The following problem is how to break the dimensionality barrier, i.e., making it possible to perform SSL with both 2D and 3D images? To achieve this, we design a pyramid U-like medical Transformer (MiT). It is composed of the switchable patch embedding (SPE) module and Transformers. The SPE module adaptively switches to either 2D or 3D patch embedding, depending on the input dimension. The embedded patches are converted into a sequence regardless of their original dimensions. The Transformers model the long-term dependencies in a sequence-to-sequence manner, thus enabling UniMiSS to learn representations from both 2D and 3D images. With the MiT as the backbone, we perform the UniMiSS in a self-distillation manner. We conduct expensive experiments on six 3D/2D medical image analysis tasks, including segmentation and classification. The results show that the proposed UniMiSS achieves promising performance on various downstream tasks, outperforming the ImageNet pre-training and other advanced SSL counterparts substantially. \n"}}

In this paper, we present a novel method of language attention-based VQA that learns decomposed linguistic representations of questions and utilizes the representations to infer answers for overcoming language priors. We introduce a modular language attention mechanism to parse a question into three phrase representations: type representation, object representation, and concept representation. We use the type representation to identify the question type and the possible answer set (yes/no or specific concepts such as colors or numbers), and the object representation to focus on the relevant region of an image. The concept representation is verified with the attended region to infer the final answer. The proposed method decouples the language-based concept discovery and vision-based concept verification in the process of answer inference to prevent language priors from dominating the answering process. Experiments on the VQA-CP dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}}

Existing VQA models can answer a compositional question well, but cannot work well in terms of reasoning consistency in answering the compositional question and its sub-questions. For example, a compositional question for an image is: \u201cAre there any elephants to the right of the white bird?\u201d and one of its sub-questions is \u201c Is any bird visible in the scene?\u201d. The models may answer \u201cyes\u201d to the compositional question, but \u201cno\u201d to the sub-question. This paper presents a dialog-like reasoning method for maintaining reasoning consistency in answering a compositional question and its sub-questions. Our method integrates the reasoning processes for the sub-questions into the reasoning process for the compositional question like a dialog task, and uses a consistency constraint to penalize inconsistent answer predictions. In order to enable quantitative evaluation of reasoning consistency, we construct a GQASub dataset based on the well-organized GQA dataset. Experimental results on the GQA dataset and the GQA-Sub dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}}

In this paper we propose a content-based sparse attention method, as an alternative to dense self-attention, aiming to reduce the computation complexity while retaining the ability to model long-range dependencies. Specifically, we cluster and then aggregate key and value tokens, as a content-based method of reducing the total token count. The resulting clustered-token sequence retains the semantic diversity of the original signal, but can be processed at a lower computational cost. Besides, we further extend the clustering-guided attention from single-scale to multi-scale, which is conducive to dense prediction tasks. We label the proposed Transformer architecture ClusTR, and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision tasks but at lower computational cost and with fewer parameters. For instance, our ClusTR small model with 22.7M parameters achieves 83.2% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Source code and ImageNet models will be made publicly available."}}

However, recent findings show that the captions generated by these methods tend to be biased toward the \"average\" caption that only captures the most general mode (a.k.a, language pattern) in the training corpus, i.e., the so-called mode collapse problem. Affected by it, the generated captions are limited in diversity and usually less informative than natural image descriptions made by humans. In this paper, we seek to avoid this problem by proposing a Discrete Mode Learning (DML) paradigm for image captioning. Our innovative idea is to explore the rich modes in the training caption corpus to learn a set of \"mode embeddings\", and further use them to control the mode of the generated captions for existing image captioning models. Specifically, the proposed DML optimizes a dual architecture that consists of an image-conditioned discrete variational autoencoder (CdVAE) branch and a mode-conditioned image captioning (MIC) branch. The CdVAE branch maps each image caption to one of the mode embeddings stored in a learned codebook, and is trained with a pure non-autoregressive generation objective to make the modes distinct and representative. The MIC branch can be simply modified from an existing image captioning model, where the mode embedding is added to the original word embeddings as the control signal. In the experiments, we apply the proposed DML to two widely used image captioning models, Transformer and AoANet. The results show that the learned mode embedding successfully facilitates these models to generate high-quality image captions with different modes, further leading to better performance for both diversity and quality on the MS COCO dataset."}}

Deeming low-loss instances as clean data is one of the most promising strategies in tackling label noise and has been widely adopted by state-of-the-art methods. However, prior works tend to drop high-loss instances directly, neglecting their valuable information. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end framework named Co-LDL, which incorporates the low-loss sample selection strategy with label distribution learning. Specifically, we simultaneously train two deep neural networks and let them communicate useful knowledge by selecting low-loss and high-loss samples for each other. Low-loss samples are leveraged conventionally for updating network parameters. On the contrary, high-loss samples are trained in a label distribution learning manner to update network parameters and label distributions concurrently. Moreover, we propose a self-supervised module to further boost the model performance by enhancing the learned representations. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets are provided to demonstrate the superiority of our Co-LDL method over state-of-the-art approaches in learning with noisy labels."}}
