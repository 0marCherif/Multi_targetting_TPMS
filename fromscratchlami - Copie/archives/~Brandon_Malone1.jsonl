The ribosome is responsible for translating mRNA into proteins, so information about its occupancy offers a detailed view of ribosome density and position which could be used to discover new translated open reading frames (ORFs), among other things. In this work, we propose RP-BP, an unsupervised Bayesian approach to predict translated ORFs from ribosome profiles. We use state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to estimate posterior distributions of the likelihood of translation of each ORF. Hence, an important feature of RP-BP is its ability to incorporate and propagate uncertainty in the prediction process. A second novel contribution is automatic Bayesian selection of read lengths and ribosome P-site offsets (BPPS). We empirically demonstrate that our read length selection technique modestly improves sensitivity by identifying more canonical and noncanonical ORFs. Proteomics- and quantitative translation initiation sequencing-based validation verifies the high quality of all of the predictions. Experimental comparison shows that RP-BP results in more peptide identifications and proteomics-validated ORF predictions compared to another recent tool for translation prediction."}}

In this work, we demonstrate that multirelational knowledge graph completion achieves state-of-the-art results on the polypharmacy side effect prediction problem. Empirical results show that our approach is particularly effective when the protein targets of the drugs are well-characterized. In contrast to prior work, our approach provides more interpretable predictions and hypotheses for wet lab validation."}}

Mutation associated antigens are considered major targets given their specificity to tumor cells. These mutations are specific to the patients and require a tailor-made vaccine targeting mutations identified in each tumor. Many mutations are identified in the tumoral genome in most patients, but only a small fraction (around 1%) is suitable as vaccine target. Herein, we report data documenting the prediction performance of the algorithm used for the design of TG4050, a clinical stage patient specific viral-based neoantigen vaccine. We have trained a set of independent machine learning algorithms to score each candidate neoantigen for several steps of the MHC antigen presentation pathway, including MHC binding, intracellular processing, similarity to self, and likelihood to elicit a T-cell response in peptide stimulated ELISPOT. Further, we have developed a novel graph neural network to combine all these scores to predict the likelihood that a neoantigen will elicit a T-cell response while also incorporating patientspecific factors, such as expression level and conservation of the mutation across different clones. To validate the system, we collected samples from 6 patients diagnosed with NSCLC, sequenced healthy and tumor tissue, identified mutations and ranked them using our algorithm; then, to evaluate immunogenicity, we focused our analysis on CD8+ T cell and measured the frequency of IFNg+ cells against predicted peptides in autologous PBMC. Immunogenicity of peptides was assayed in 5 pools then deconvoluted against individual peptides. From 3339 to 4782 somatic variants were detected in tumor tissue samples. After applying technical filtering, removing synonymous mutations, and filtering on transcript expression we detected a median of 281 (192-471) expressed tumor mutations resulting in a median of 2767 candidate class I epitopes (1769 - 4573). The model resulted in high accuracy allowing us to identify peptides with pre-existing ex vivo immunogenic responses in 5 out of 6 patients. Immunogenicity of peptide pools was correlated with ranking by the algorithm. Immunogenicity of the 6 top ranking individual epitopes in each patient showed a median of 5 (2-6) immunogenic peptides resulting in a 77% of true positive rate (TP). It should be noted that when no response was detected, it cannot be excluded that a response could be primed by a vaccine. In a similar setting, the netMHC 4.0 algorithm yielded a TP of 30% and only identified 39% of positive calls of our algorithm. We demonstrate that the prediction algorithm is accurate in identifying immunogenic cancer mutations even among a large set of candidates. Ongoing TG4050 clinical studies (NCT03839524 and NCT04183166) will allow further validation of the antitumor activity of the elicited immune response."}}

The goals of this study were to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict blueprints for designing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, that contain a sufficiently broad repertoire of T-cell epitopes capable of providing coverage and protection across the global population. To help achieve these aims, we profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population, using host-infected cell surface antigen presentation and immunogenicity predictors from the NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools, and generated comprehensive epitope maps. We then used these epitope maps as input for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to identify statistically significant ``epitope hotspot'' regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types. We then removed epitope hotspots that shared significant homology with proteins in the human proteome to reduce the chance of inducing off-target autoimmune responses. We also analyzed the antigen presentation and immunogenic landscape of all the nonsynonymous mutations across 3400 different sequences of the virus, to identify a trend whereby SARS-COV-2 mutations are predicted to have reduced potential to be presented by host-infected cells, and consequently detected by the host immune system. A sequence conservation analysis then removed epitope hotspots that occurred in less-conserved regions of the viral proteome. Finally, we used a database of the HLA genotypes of approximately 22 000 individuals to develop a ``digital twin'' type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hotspots would work in a diverse human population, and used the approach to identify an optimal constellation of epitopes hotspots that could provide maximum coverage in the global population. By combining the antigen presentation to the infected-host cell surface and immunogenicity predictions of the NEC Immune Profiler with a robust Monte Carlo and digital twin simulation, we have managed to profile the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identify a subset of epitope hotspots that could be harnessed in a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population."}}

Patients are often missing data relative to each other; the data comes in a variety of modalities, such as multivariate time series, free text, and categorical demographic information; important relationships among patients can be difficult to detect; and many others. In this work, we propose a novel approach to address these first three challenges using a representation learning scheme based on message passing. We show that our proposed approach is competitive with or outperforms the state of the art for predicting in-hospital mortality (binary classification), the length of hospital visits (regression) and the discharge destination (multiclass classification)."}}

Predicting precisely the binding and presentation of peptides to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles is an important step toward such therapies. Recent data suggest that presentation of both class I and II epitopes are critical for the induction of a sustained effective immune response. However, the prediction performance for MHC class II has been limited compared to class I.\n\nResults\n\nWe present a transformer neural network model which leverages self-supervised pretraining from a large corpus of protein sequences. We also propose a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework to deconvolve mass spectrometry data where multiple potential MHC alleles may have presented each peptide. We show that pretraining boosted the performance for these tasks. Combining pretraining and the novel MIL approach, our model outperforms state-of-the-art models based on peptide and MHC sequence only for both binding and cell surface presentation predictions."}}

No single algorithm dominates the others in speed, and, given a problem instance, it is a priori unclear which algorithm will perform best and how fast it will solve the problem. Estimating the runtimes directly is extremely difficult as they are complicated functions of the instance. The main contribution of this paper is characterization of the empirical hardness of an instance for a given algorithm based on a novel collection of non-trivial, yet efficiently computable features. Our empirical results, based on the largest evaluation of state-of-the-art BNS learning algorithms to date, demonstrate that we can predict the runtimes to a reasonable degree of accuracy, and effectively select algorithms that perform well on a particular instance. Moreover, we also show how the results can be utilized in building a portfolio algorithm that combines several individual algorithms in an almost optimal manner."}}

Whenever the lower bound of a search path exceeds the upper bound, the path is guaranteed to lead to suboptimal solutions and is discarded immediately. This paper introduces methods for tightening the bounds. The lower bound is tightened by using more informed variable groupings when creating the pattern databases, and the upper bound is tightened using an anytime learning algorithm. Empirical results show that these bounds improve the efficiency of Bayesian network learning by two to three orders of magnitude."}}
