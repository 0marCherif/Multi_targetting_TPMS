The algorithms are then applied to each future instance according to this cascading schedule, until some algorithm in the schedule succeeds. Cascading algorithm scheduling has proven to be effective in several applications, including QBF solving and the generation of ImageNet classification models.  It is known that the computation of an optimal cascading schedule in the offline phase is NP-hard. In this paper we study the parameterized complexity of this problem and establish its fixed-parameter tractability by utilizing structural properties of the success relation between algorithms and test instances.  Our findings are significant as they reveal that in spite of the intractability of the problem in its general form, one can indeed exploit sparseness or density of the success relation to obtain non-trivial runtime guarantees for finding an optimal cascading schedule."}}

It is a well-studied problem in both robotic motion planning and wireless computing that has been shown to be NP-hard in various settings. In this work, we extend the study of Minimum Constraint Removal. We start by presenting refined NP-hardness reductions for the two cases: (1) when all the obstacles are axes-parallel rectangles, and (2) when all the obstacles are line segments such that no three intersect at the same point. These results improve on existing results in the literature. As a byproduct of our NP-hardness reductions, we prove that, unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails, Minimum Constraint Removal cannot be solved in subexponential time 2 o ( n ) , where n is the number of obstacles in the instance. This shows that significant improvement on the brute-force 2 O ( n ) -time algorithm is unlikely. We then present a subexponential-time algorithm for instances of Minimum Constraint Removal in which the number of obstacles that overlap at any point is constant; the algorithm runs in time 2 O (\u221a N ) , where N is the number of the vertices in the auxiliary graph associated with the instance of the problem. We show that significant improvement on this algorithm is unlikely by showing that, unless ETH fails, Minimum Constraint Removal with bounded overlap number cannot be solved in time 2 o (\u221a N ) . We describe several exact algorithms and approximation algorithms that leverage heuristics and discuss their performance in an extensive empirical simulation."}}

Whereas some NP-complete problems are amenable to efficient computational methods, others are yet to show any such sign. It becomes a major challenge to develop a theoretical framework that is more fine-grained than the theory of NP-completeness, and that can explain the distinction between the exact complexities of various NP-complete problems. This distinction is highly relevant for constraint satisfaction problems under natural restrictions, where various shades of hardness can be observed in practice.\r\n\r\nAcknowledging the NP-hardness of such problems, one has to look beyond polynomial time computation. The theory of subexponential-time complexity provides such a framework, and has been enjoying increasing popularity in complexity theory. An instance of the constraint satisfaction problem with n variables over a domain of d values can be solved by brute-force in dn steps (omitting a polynomial factor). In this paper we study the existence of subexponential-time algorithms, that is, algorithms running in do(n) steps, for various natural restrictions of the constraint satisfaction problem. We consider both the constraint satisfaction problem in which all the constraints are given extensionally as tables, and that in which all the constraints are given intensionally in the form of global constraints. We provide tight characterizations of the subexponential-time complexity of the aforementioned problems with respect to several natural structural parameters, which allows us to draw a detailed landscape of the subexponential-time complexity of the constraint satisfaction problem. Our analysis provides fundamental results indicating whether and when one can significantly improve on the brute-force search approach for solving the constraint satisfaction problem."}}
