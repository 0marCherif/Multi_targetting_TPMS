However, existing SSL methods still suffer from the problem of unreliable predictions on unannotated data due to the lack of manual annotations for them. In this paper, we propose an unreliability-diluted consistency training (UDiCT) mechanism to dilute the unreliability in SSL by assembling reliable annotated data into unreliable unannotated data. Specifically, we first propose an uncertainty-based data pairing module to pair annotated data with unannotated data based on a complementary uncertainty pairing rule, which avoids two hard samples being paired off. Secondly, we develop SwapMix, a mixed sample data augmentation method, to integrate annotated data into unannotated data for training our model in a low-unreliability manner. Finally, UDiCT is trained by minimizing a supervised loss and an unreliability-diluted consistency loss, which makes our model robust to diverse backgrounds. Extensive experiments on three chest CT datasets show the effectiveness of our method for semi-supervised CT lesion segmentation."}}

To address this issue, we propose an intuitive but effective method to equalize the $l_2$ norms of sample features. Concretely, we $l_2$-normalize each sample feature before batch normalization, and therefore the features are of the same magnitude. Since the proposed method combines the $l_2$ normalization and batch normalization, we name our method $L_2$BN. The $L_2$BN can strengthen the compactness of intra-class features and enlarge the discrepancy of inter-class features. The $L_2$BN is easy to implement and can exert its effect without any additional parameters and hyper-parameters. Therefore, it can be used as a basic normalization method for neural networks. We evaluate the effectiveness of $L_2$BN through extensive experiments with various models on image classification and acoustic scene classification tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the $L_2$BN can boost the generalization ability of various neural network models and achieve considerable performance improvements."}}

Although tremendous efforts have been made to recall precise and complete locations for each class, existing methods still commonly suffer from the unsolicited Out-of-Candidate (OC) error predictions that not belongs to the label candidates, which could be avoidable since the contradiction with image-level class tags is easy to be detected. In this paper, we develop a group ranking-based Out-of-Candidate Rectification (OCR) mechanism in a plug-and-play fashion. Firstly, we adaptively split the semantic categories into In-Candidate (IC) and OC groups for each OC pixel according to their prior annotation correlation and posterior prediction correlation. Then, we derive a differentiable rectification loss to force OC pixels to shift to the IC group. Incorporating our OCR with seminal baselines (e.g., AffinityNet, SEAM, MCTformer), we can achieve remarkable performance gains on both Pascal VOC (+3.2%, +3.3%, +0.8% mIoU) and MS COCO (+1.0%, +1.3%, +0.5% mIoU) datasets with negligible extra training overhead, which justifies the effectiveness and generality of our OCR."}}

Although typical attempts focus on ameliorating the inevitable error-prone pseudo-labeling, we think differently and resort to exhausting informative semantics from multiple probably correct candidate labels. In this paper, we introduce Fuzzy Positive Learning (FPL) for accurate SSL semantic segmentation in a plug-and-play fashion, targeting adaptively encouraging fuzzy positive predictions and suppressing highly-probable negatives. Being conceptually simple yet practically effective, FPL can remarkably alleviate interference from wrong pseudo labels and progressively achieve clear pixel-level semantic discrimination. Concretely, our FPL approach consists of two main components, including fuzzy positive assignment (FPA) to provide an adaptive number of labels for each pixel and fuzzy positive regularization (FPR) to restrict the predictions of fuzzy positive categories to be larger than the rest under different perturbations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on Cityscapes and VOC 2012 with consistent performance gain justify the superiority of our approach."}}

To quantitively measure the magnetic susceptibility, the nuclei should be accurately segmented, which is a tedious task for clinicians. In this paper, we proposed a double-branch residual-structured U-Net (DB-ResUNet) based on 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically segment such brain gray matter nuclei. To better tradeoff between segmentation accuracy and the memory efficiency, the proposed DB-ResUNet fed image patches with high resolution and the patches with low resolution but larger field of view into the local and global branches, respectively. Experimental results revealed that by jointly using QSM and T$_\\text{1}$ weighted imaging (T$_\\text{1}$WI) as inputs, the proposed method was able to achieve better segmentation accuracy over its single-branch counterpart, as well as the conventional atlas-based method and the classical 3D-UNet structure. The susceptibility values and the volumes were also measured, which indicated that the measurements from the proposed DB-ResUNet are able to present high correlation with values from the manually annotated regions of interest."}}
