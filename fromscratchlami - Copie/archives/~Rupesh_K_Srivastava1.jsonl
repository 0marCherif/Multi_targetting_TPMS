Ghosh et al. proved that Goal-Conditional Supervised Learning (GCSL) -- which can be viewed as a simplified version of UDRL -- optimizes a lower bound on goal-reaching performance. This raises expectations that such algorithms may enjoy guaranteed convergence to the optimal policy in arbitrary environments, similar to certain well-known traditional RL algorithms. Here we show that for a specific episodic UDRL algorithm (eUDRL, including GCSL), this is not the case, and give the causes of this limitation. To do so, we first introduce a helpful rewrite of eUDRL as a recursive policy update. This formulation helps to disprove its convergence to the optimal policy for a wide class of stochastic environments. Finally, we provide a concrete example of a very simple environment where eUDRL diverges. Since the primary aim of this paper is to present a negative result, and the best counterexamples are the simplest ones, we restrict all discussions to finite (discrete) environments, ignoring issues of function approximation and limited sample size.

In this family, learning at each iteration consists of sampling a batch of trajectories using the current policy and fitting a new policy to maximize a return-weighted log-likelihood of actions. Although RWR is known to yield monotonic improvement of the policy under certain circumstances, whether and under which conditions RWR converges to the optimal policy have remained open questions. In this paper, we provide for the first time a proof that RWR converges to a global optimum when no function approximation is used, in a general compact setting. Furthermore, for the simpler case with finite state and action spaces we prove R-linear convergence of the state-value function to the optimum. "}}

Recent work in this area has largely focused on learning command-conditioned policies. We investigate the potential of one such method -- upside-down reinforcement learning -- to work with commands that specify a desired relationship between some scalar value and the observed return. We show that upside-down reinforcement learning can learn to carry out such commands online in a tabular bandit setting and in CartPole with non-linear function approximation. By doing so, we demonstrate the power of this family of methods and open the way for their practical use under more complicated command structures. "}}

UDRL is based purely on supervised learning, and bypasses some prominent issues in RL: bootstrapping, off-policy corrections, and discount factors. While previous work with UDRL demonstrated it in a traditional online RL setting, here we show that this single algorithm can also work in the imitation learning and offline RL settings, be extended to the goal-conditioned RL setting, and even the meta-RL setting. With a general agent architecture, a single UDRL agent can learn across all paradigms. "}}

The M-density in $\\mathbb{R}^{Md}$ is smoother than the original density in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, easier to learn and sample from, yet for large $M$ the two problems are mathematically equivalent since clean data can be estimated exactly given a multimeasurement noisy observation using the Bayes estimator. To formulate the problem, we derive the Bayes estimator for Poisson and Gaussian MNMs in closed form in terms of the unnormalized M-density. This leads to a simple least-squares objective for learning parametric energy and score functions. We present various parametrization schemes of interest including one in which studying Gaussian M-densities directly leads to multidenoising autoencoders\u2014this is the first theoretical connection made between denoising autoencoders and empirical Bayes in the literature.  Samples in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ are obtained by walk-jump sampling (Saremi & Hyvarinen, 2019) via underdamped Langevin MCMC (walk) to sample from M-density and the multimeasurement Bayes estimation (jump). We study permutation invariant Gaussian M-densities on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ-256 datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework for realizing fast-mixing stable Markov chains in high dimensions."}}

In these algorithms, gradients of the total reward with respect to the policy parameters are estimated using a population of solutions drawn from a search distribution, and then used for policy optimization with stochastic gradient ascent. A common choice in the community is to use the Adam optimization algorithm for obtaining an adaptive behavior during gradient ascent, due to its success in a variety of supervised learning settings. As an alternative to Adam, we propose to enhance classical momentum-based gradient ascent with two simple techniques: gradient normalization and update clipping. We argue that the resulting optimizer called ClipUp (short for \"clipped updates\") is a better choice for distribution-based policy evolution because its working principles are simple and easy to understand and its hyperparameters can be tuned more intuitively in practice. Moreover, it removes the need to re-tune hyperparameters if the reward scale changes. Experiments show that ClipUp is competitive with Adam despite its simplicity and is effective on challenging continuous control benchmarks, including the Humanoid control task based on the Bullet physics simulator."}}

Unlike traditional algorithms, UDRL does not use reward prediction or search for an optimal policy. Instead, it trains agents to follow commands such as \"obtain so much total reward in so much time.\" Many of its general principles are outlined in a companion report; the goal of this paper is to develop a practical learning algorithm and show that this conceptually simple perspective on agent training can produce a range of rewarding behaviors for multiple episodic environments. Experiments show that on some tasks UDRL's performance can be surprisingly competitive with, and even exceed that of some traditional baseline algorithms developed over decades of research. Based on these results, we suggest that alternative approaches to expected reward maximization have an important role to play in training useful autonomous agents."}}
