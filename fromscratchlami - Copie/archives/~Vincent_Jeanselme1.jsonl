This data-generating process often constitutes an informative process. Prediction models often ignore this process or only partially leverage it, potentially hampering performance and transportability when this interaction evolves. This work explores how current models may suffer from shifts in this clinical presence process and proposes a multi-task recurrent neural network to tackle this issue. The proposed joint modelling competes with state-of-the-art predictive models on a real-world prediction task. More importantly, the approach appears more robust to change in the clinical presence setting. This analysis emphasises the importance of modelling clinical presence to improve performance and transportability. "}}

The sampling process is often highly irregular and itself constitutes an informative process. When using such data to develop prediction models, this phenomenon is often ignored, leading to sub-optimal performance and generalisability of models when practices evolve. We propose a multi-task recurrent neural network which models three clinical presence dimensions -- namely the longitudinal, the inter-observation and the missingness processes -- in parallel to the survival outcome. On a prediction task using MIMIC III laboratory tests, explicit modelling of these three processes showed improved performance in comparison to state-of-the-art predictive models (C-index at 1 day horizon: 0.878). More importantly, the proposed approach was more robust to change in the clinical presence setting, demonstrated by performance comparison between patients admitted on weekdays and weekends. This analysis demonstrates the importance of studying and leveraging clinical presence to improve performance and create more transportable clinical models."}}

These pairwise constraints, which come in the form of must-link and cannot-link pairs, arise naturally in many applications and are intuitive for users to provide. However, the common practice of relaxing discrete constraints to a continuous domain to ease optimization when learning kernels or metrics can harm generalization, as information which only encodes linkage is transformed to informing distances. We introduce a new constrained clustering algorithm that jointly clusters data and learns a kernel in accordance with the available pairwise constraints. To generalize well, our method is designed to maximize constraint satisfaction without relaxing pairwise constraints to a continuous domain where they inform distances. We show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on a large number of diverse publicly available datasets, and we discuss how our method can scale to handling large data."}}

In such scenarios, the event-time distribution may have temporal dependencies at different time scales that are not easily captured by classical survival models that assume training data points to be independent. In this paper, we describe a fully parametric approach to model censored time-to-event outcomes with time varying covariates. It involves learning representations of the input temporal data using Recurrent Neural Networks such as LSTMs and GRUs, followed by describing the conditional event distribution as a fixed mixture of parametric distributions. The use of the recurrent neural networks allows the learned representations to model long-term dependencies in the input data while jointly estimating the Time-to-Event. We benchmark our approach on MIMIC III: a large, publicly available dataset collected from Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, focusing on predicting duration of their ICU stays and their short term life expectancy, and we demonstrate competitive performance of the proposed approach compared to established time-to-event regression models."}}

We developed a machine learning model to predict the initial hypotension event among intensive care unit (ICU) patients and designed an alert system for bedside implementation.\n\nMaterials and methods\nFrom the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-3) dataset, minute-by-minute vital signs were extracted. A hypotension event was defined as at least five measurements within a 10-min period of systolic blood pressure\u2009\u2264\u200990 mmHg and mean arterial pressure\u2009\u2264\u200960 mmHg. Using time series data from 30-min overlapping time windows, a random forest (RF) classifier was used to predict risk of hypotension every minute. Chronologically, the first half of extracted data was used to train the model, and the second half was used to validate the trained model. The model\u2019s performance was measured with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC). Hypotension alerts were generated using risk score time series, a stacked RF model. A lockout time were applied for real-life implementation.\n\nResults\nWe identified 1307 subjects (1580 ICU stays) as the hypotension group and 1619 subjects (2279 ICU stays) as the non-hypotension group. The RF model showed AUROC of 0.93 and 0.88 at 15 and 60 min, respectively, before hypotension, and AUPRC of 0.77 at 60 min before. Risk score trajectories revealed 80% and\u2009>\u200960% of hypotension predicted at 15 and 60 min before the hypotension, respectively. The stacked model with 15-min lockout produced on average 0.79 alerts/subject/hour (sensitivity 92.4%).\n\nConclusion\nClinically significant hypotension events in the ICU can be predicted at least 1 h before the initial hypotension episode. With a highly sensitive and reliable practical alert system, a vast majority of future hypotension could be captured, suggesting potential real-life utility."}}
