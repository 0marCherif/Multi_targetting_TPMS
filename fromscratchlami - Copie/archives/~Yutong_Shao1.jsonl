A simple way to develop a speech-to-SQL parser is to pass the speech to an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, and pass the transcription to a text-to-SQL parser. However, ASR is still error-prone. We propose an ASR correction method, DBATI (DataBase-Aware TaggerILM). The method first detects erroneous spans in the input, and rewrites each span. Our method leverages a novel joint representation of text and the database (DB). Our experiments show that our method yields better performance on both text quality and downstream SQL accuracy, compared to existing ASR error correction methods."}}

Compared to other types of interfaces, such as  command line interfaces (CLIs) or graphical user interfaces (GUIs), NLIs stand to enable more people to have access to functionality behind databases or APIs as they only require knowledge of natural languages. Many NLI applications involve structured data for the domain (e.g., applications such as hotel booking, product search, and factual question answering.) Thus, to fully process user questions, in addition to natural language comprehension, understanding of structured data is also crucial for the model.\nIn this paper, we study neural network methods for building Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) with a  focus on learning structure data representations that can generalize to novel  data sources and schemata not seen at training time. Specifically, we review two  tasks related to natural language interfaces: i) semantic parsing where we  focus on text-to-SQL  for database access,  and ii) task-oriented dialog  systems for API access. We survey representative methods for   text-to-SQL and  task-oriented dialog tasks,  focusing  on representing and incorporating structured data. Lastly, we  present two of our original studies on structured data representation methods for NLIs  to enable access to i)  databases, and ii) visualization APIs."}}

To facilitate the development of such agents, we introduce ChartDialogs, a new multi-turn dialog dataset, covering a popular plotting library, matplotlib. The dataset contains over 15,000 dialog turns from 3,200 dialogs covering the majority of matplotlib plot types. Extensive experiments show the best-performing method achieving 61% plotting accuracy, demonstrating that the dataset presents a non-trivial challenge for future research on this task."}}

We introduce a dataset, CIBB (Chinese Idioms Blacklists Bank), and perform an evaluation of a state-of-the-art Chinese\u2192English neural MT system. Our evaluation confirms that a sizable number of idioms in our test set are mistranslated (46.1%), that literal translation error is a common error type, and that our blacklist method is effective at identifying literal translation errors."}}
