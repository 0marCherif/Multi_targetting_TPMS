Most previous works explore temporal redundancy by detecting and compressing a motion map to warp the reference frame towards the target frame. Yet, it failed to adequately take advantage of the historical priors in the sequential reference frames. In this paper, we propose an Advanced Learned Video Compression (ALVC) approach with the in-loop frame prediction module, which is able to effectively predict the target frame from the previously compressed frames, without consuming any bit-rate. The predicted frame can serve as a better reference than the previously compressed frame, and therefore it benefits the compression performance. The proposed in-loop prediction module is a part of the end-to-end video compression and is jointly optimized in the whole framework. We propose the recurrent and the bi-directional in-loop prediction modules for compressing P-frames and B-frames, respectively. The experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our ALVC approach in learned video compression. We also outperform the default hierarchical B mode of x265 in terms of PSNR and beat the slowest mode of the SSIM-tuned x265 on MS-SSIM. The project page: https://github.com/RenYang-home/ALVC."}}

Recently, prior work applied INRs to image compressing. Such compression algorithms are promising candidates as a general purpose approach for any coordinate-based data modality. However, in order to live up to this promise current INR-based compression algorithms need to improve their rate-distortion performance by a large margin. This work progresses on this problem. First, we propose meta-learned initializations for INR-based compression which improves rate-distortion performance. As a side effect it also leads to leads to faster convergence speed. Secondly, we introduce a simple yet highly effective change to the network architecture compared to prior work on INR-based compression. Namely, we combine SIREN networks with positional encodings which improves rate distortion performance. Our contributions to source compression with INRs vastly outperform prior work. We show that our INR-based compression algorithm, meta-learning combined with SIREN and positional encodings, outperforms JPEG2000 and Rate-Distortion Autoencoders on Kodak with 2x reduced dimensionality for the first time and closes the gap on full resolution images. To underline the generality of INR-based source compression, we further perform experiments on 3D shape compression where our method greatly outperforms Draco - a traditional compression algorithm."}}

We employ the recurrent auto-encoder-based compression network as the generator, and most importantly, we propose a recurrent conditional discriminator, which judges raw vs. compressed video conditioned on both spatial and temporal features, including the latent representation, temporal motion and hidden states in recurrent cells. This way, the adversarial training pushes the generated video to be not only spatially photo-realistic but also temporally consistent with the groundtruth and coherent among video frames. The experimental results show that the learned PLVC model compresses video with good perceptual quality at low bit-rate, and that it outperforms the official HEVC test model (HM 16.20) and the existing learned video compression approaches for several perceptual quality metrics and user studies.

To fully explore the mutual information across two stereo images, we use a deep regression model to estimate the homography matrix, i.e., H matrix. Then, the left image is spatially transformed by the H matrix, and only the residual information between the left and right images is encoded to save bit-rates. A two-branch auto-encoder architecture is adopted in HESIC, corresponding to the left and right images, respectively. For entropy coding, we propose two conditional stereo entropy models, i.e., Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based and context based entropy models, to fully explore the correlation between the two images to reduce the coding bit-rates. In decoding, a cross quality enhancement module is proposed to enhance the image quality based on inverse H matrix. Experimental results show that our HESIC outperforms state-of-the-art SIC methods on InStereo2K and KITTI datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively."}}

Considering the powerful representation capability of neural networks, it is feasible to improve the data compression performance by employing the advanced deep learning technologies. To this end, the deep leaning based compression approaches have recently received increasing attention from both academia and industry in the field of computer vision and signal processing."}}
