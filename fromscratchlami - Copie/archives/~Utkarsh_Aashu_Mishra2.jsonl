Skill chaining is a practical approach to solving unseen tasks by combining learned skill priors. However, such methods are myopic if sequenced greedily and face scalability issues with search-based planning strategy. To address these challenges, we introduce Generative Skill Chaining (GSC), a probabilistic framework that learns skill-centric diffusion models and composes their learned distributions to generate long-horizon plans during inference. GSC samples from all skill models in parallel to efficiently solve unseen tasks while enforcing geometric constraints. We evaluate the method on various long-horizon tasks and demonstrate its capability in reasoning about action dependencies, constraint handling, and generalization, along with its ability to replan in the face of perturbations. We show results in simulation and on real robot to validate the efficiency and scalability of GSC, highlighting its potential for advancing long-horizon task planning.

While certain goals can be achieved by picking and placing the objects of interest directly, object reorientation is needed for precise placement in most of the tasks. In such scenarios, the object must be reoriented and re-positioned into intermediate poses that facilitate accurate placement at the target pose. To this end, we propose a reorientation planning method, ReorientDiff, that utilizes a diffusion model-based approach. The proposed method employs both visual inputs from the scene, and goal-specific language prompts to plan intermediate reorientation poses. Specifically, the scene and language-task information are mapped into a joint scene-task representation feature space, which is subsequently leveraged to condition the diffusion model. The diffusion model samples intermediate poses based on the representation using classifier-free guidance and then uses gradients of learned feasibility-score models for implicit iterative pose-refinement. The proposed method is evaluated using a set of YCB-objects and a suction gripper, demonstrating a success rate of 96.5\\% in simulation. Overall, our study presents a promising approach to address the reorientation challenge in manipulation by learning a conditional distribution, which is an effective way to move towards more generalizable object manipulation.

These actions are in turn used to significantly accelerate the outer loop Mf-RL. We show that our formulation is generic for a broad class of MPC based policies and objectives, and includes some of the well-known Mb-Mf approaches. We finally introduce a new algorithm: Mirror-Descent Model Predictive RL (M-DeMoRL), which uses Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) with elite fractions for the inner loop. Our experiments show faster convergence of the proposed hierarchical approach on benchmark MuJoCo tasks. We also demonstrate hardware training for trajectory tracking in a 2R leg, and hardware transfer for robust walking in a quadruped. We show that the inner-loop Mb-RL significantly decreases the number of training iterations required in the hardware setting, thereby validating the proposed approach."}}

In particular, we propose a new control pipeline, wherein the high-level trajectory modulator shapes the end-foot ellipsoidal trajectories, and the low-level gait controller regulates the torso and ankle orientation. The foot-trajectory modulator uses a linear policy and the regulator uses a linear PD control law. As opposed to neural network based policies, the proposed linear policy has only 13 learnable parameters, thereby not only guaranteeing sample efficient learning but also enabling simplicity and interpretability of the policy. This is achieved with no loss of performance on challenging terrains like slopes, stairs and outdoor landscapes. We first demonstrate robust walking in the custom simulation environment, MuJoCo, and then directly transfer to hardware with no modification of the control pipeline. We subject the biped to a series of pushes and terrain height changes, both indoors and outdoors, thereby validating the presented work."}}

A wide range of methods have been proposed to enable efficient learning, leading to sample complexities similar to those in the full state setting. However, moving beyond carefully curated pixel data sets (centered crop, appropriate lighting, clear background, etc.) remains challenging. In this paper, we adopt a more difficult setting, incorporating background distractors, as a first step towards addressing this challenge. We present a simple baseline approach that can learn meaningful representations with no metric-based learning, no data augmentations, no world-model learning, and no contrastive learning. We then analyze when and why previously proposed methods are likely to fail or reduce to the same performance as the baseline in this harder setting and why we should think carefully about extending such methods beyond the well-curated environments. Our results show that finer categorization of benchmarks on the basis of characteristics like the density of reward, planning horizon of the problem, presence of task-irrelevant components, etc., is crucial in evaluating algorithms. Based on these observations, we propose different metrics to consider when evaluating an algorithm on benchmark tasks. We hope such a data-centric view can motivate researchers to rethink representation learning when investigating how to best apply RL to real-world tasks."}}

We learn this policy via a model-free and a gradient free learning algorithm, Augmented Random Search (ARS), in the two robot platforms Rabbit and Digit. Our contributions are two-fold: a) By using torso and support plane orientation as inputs, we achieve robust walking on slopes of upto 20\u00b0 in simulation. b) We demonstrate additional behaviors like walking backwards, stepping-in-place, and recovery from external pushes of upto 120 N. The end-result is a robust and a fast feedback control law for bipedal walking on terrains with varying slopes. Towards the end, we also provide preliminary results of hardware transfer to Digit."}}
