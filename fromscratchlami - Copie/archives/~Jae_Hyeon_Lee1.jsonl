We find that a non-contrastive (positive-pair only) auxiliary task aids in supervised training of Euclidean neural networks (E3NNs) and increases manifold smoothness (MS) around point-cloud geometries. We demonstrate this property for multiple drug-activity prediction tasks while maintaining relevant performance metrics, and propose an extension of MS to probabilistic and regression settings. We provide an analysis of representation collapse, finding substantial effects of task-weighting, latent dimension, and regularization. We expect the presented protocol to aid in the development of reliable E3NNs from molecular conformers, even for small-data drug discovery programs."}}

We obtain log probability scores from a GPT-2 model for each sampled CDR3 and demonstrate that multi-segment preserving sampling generates reasonable designs while maintaining the desired, preserved regions."}}
