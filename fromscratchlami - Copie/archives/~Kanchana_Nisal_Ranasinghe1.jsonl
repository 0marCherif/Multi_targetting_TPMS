From a given video, we create local and global spatiotemporal views with varying spatial sizes and frame rates. Our self-supervised objective seeks to match the features of these different views representing the same video, to be invariant to spatiotemporal variations in actions. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first to alleviate the dependency on negative samples or dedicated memory banks in Self-supervised Video Transformer (SVT). Further, owing to the flexibility of Transformer models, SVT supports slow-fast video processing within a single architecture using dynamically adjusted positional encodings and supports long-term relationship modeling along spatiotemporal dimensions. Our approach performs well on four action recognition benchmarks (Kinetics-400, UCF-101, HMDB-51, and SSv2) and converges faster with small batch sizes."}}

These models are based on multi-head self-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image patches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such flexibility (in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch) can facilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain shifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We systematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments encompassing three ViT families and provide comparisons with a high-performing convolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following intriguing properties of ViT: (a)Transformers are highly robust to severe occlusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content. (b)The robustness towards occlusions is not due to texture bias, instead we show that ViTs are significantly less biased towards local textures, compared to CNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate shape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system, previously unmatched in the literature. (c)Using ViTs to encode shape representation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic segmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d)Off-the-shelf features from a single ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble,  leading to high accuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional and few-shot learning paradigms.

{"id": "f0GMTyzUui", "cdate": 1609459200000, "mdate": 1667333804088, "content": {"title": "Orthogonal Projection Loss", "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable performance on a range of classification tasks, with softmax crossentropy (CE) loss emerging as the de-facto objective function. The CE loss encourages features of a class to have a higher projection score on the true class-vector compared to the negative classes. However, this is a relative constraint and does not explicitly force different class features to be well-separated. Motivated by the observation that ground-truth class representations in CE loss are orthogonal (one-hot encoded vectors), we develop a novel loss function termed \u2018Orthogonal Projection Loss' (OPL) which imposes orthogonality in the feature space. OPL augments the properties of CE loss and directly enforces inter-class separation alongside intra-class clustering in the feature space through orthogonality constraints on the mini-batch level. As compared to other alternatives of CE, OPL offers unique advantages e.g., no additional learnable parameters, does not require careful negative mining and is not sensitive to the batch size. Given the plug-and-play nature of OPL, we evaluate it on a diverse range of tasks including image recognition (CIFAR-100), large-scale classification (ImageNet), domain generalization (PACS) and few-shot learning (mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS, tiered-ImageNet and Meta-dataset) and demonstrate its effectiveness across the board. Furthermore, OPL offers better robustness against practical nuisances such as adversarial attacks and label noise. Code is available at: https://github.com/kahnchana/opl."}}

We propose a novel general-purpose framework for conditional generation in multimodal spaces, that uses latent variables to model generalizable learning patterns while minimizing a family of regression cost functions. At inference, the latent variables are optimized to find solutions corresponding to multiple output modes. Compared to existing generative solutions, our approach demonstrates faster and more stable convergence, and can learn better representations for downstream tasks. Importantly, it provides a simple generic model that can perform better than highly engineered pipelines tailored using domain expertise on a variety of tasks, while generating diverse outputs.
