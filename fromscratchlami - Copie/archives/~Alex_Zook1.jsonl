Our approach leverages a State-of-the-art Latent Diffusion model with some notable modifications to adapt it to the task of material generation. Specifically, we employ circular-padded convolution layers in place of standard convolution layers. This unique adaptation ensures the production of seamless tiling textures, as the circular padding facilitates seamless blending at image edges. Moreover, we extend the capabilities of our model by training additional decoders to generate various material properties such as surface normals, roughness, and ambient occlusions. Each decoder utilizes the same latent tensor generated by the de-noising UNet to produce a specific material channel. Furthermore, to enhance real-time performance and user interactivity, we optimize our model using NVIDIA TensorRT, resulting in improved inference speed for an efficient and responsive tool."}}

Current MARL algorithms often assume that the number of agents within a group remains fixed throughout an experiment. However, in many practical problems, an agent may terminate before their teammates. This early termination issue presents a challenge: the terminated agent must learn from the group's success or failure which occurs beyond its own existence. We refer to propagating value from rewards earned by remaining teammates to terminated agents as the Posthumous Credit Assignment problem. Current MARL methods handle this problem by placing these agents in an absorbing state until the entire group of agents reaches a termination condition. Although absorbing states enable existing algorithms and APIs to handle terminated agents without modification, practical training efficiency and resource use problems exist. In this work, we first demonstrate that sample complexity increases with the quantity of absorbing states in a toy supervised learning task for a fully connected network, while attention is more robust to variable size input. Then, we present a novel architecture for an existing state-of-the-art MARL algorithm which uses attention instead of a fully connected layer with absorbing states. Finally, we demonstrate that this novel architecture significantly outperforms the standard architecture on tasks in which agents are created or destroyed within episodes as well as standard multi-agent coordination tasks."}}

However, these datasets had no guarantees or analysis of human activities, poses, or context diversity. Additionally, privacy, legal, safety, and ethical concerns may limit the ability to collect more human data. An emerging alternative to real-world data that alleviates some of these issues is synthetic data. However, creation of synthetic data generators is incredibly challenging and prevents researchers from exploring their usefulness. Therefore, we release a human-centric synthetic data generator PeopleSansPeople which contains simulation-ready 3D human assets, a parameterized lighting and camera system, and generates 2D and 3D bounding box, instance and semantic segmentation, and COCO pose labels. Using PeopleSansPeople, we performed benchmark synthetic data training using a Detectron2 Keypoint R-CNN variant [1]. We found that pre-training a network using synthetic data and fine-tuning on various sizes of real-world data resulted in a keypoint AP increase of $+38.03$ ($44.43 \\pm 0.17$ vs. $6.40$) for few-shot transfer (limited subsets of COCO-person train [2]), and an increase of $+1.47$ ($63.47 \\pm 0.19$ vs. $62.00$) for abundant real data regimes, outperforming models trained with the same real data alone. We also found that our models outperformed those pre-trained with ImageNet with a keypoint AP increase of $+22.53$ ($44.43 \\pm 0.17$ vs. $21.90$) for few-shot transfer and $+1.07$ ($63.47 \\pm 0.19$ vs. $62.40$) for abundant real data regimes. This freely-available data generator should enable a wide range of research into the emerging field of simulation to real transfer learning in the critical area of human-centric computer vision."}}

Any given game is one instance from a design space of alternatives. Navigating a design space to achieve a designer's goals requires knowledge of how design choices shape the play space in a game. We present algorithms to automatically measure play patterns using statistical models that predict how design choices alter player behavior. We present Monte Carlo tree search as a way to sample behaviors from a play space, action metrics to automate play space measurement, and predictive modeling techniques to model design spaces. We demonstrate these techniques in two simplified, perfect information, adversarial game domains based on Scrabble and Hearthstone showing their use for automated design space modeling."}}

Designers usually explore this space through human playtesting, which can be time-consuming and of limited effectiveness in exhausting the space of possible behaviors. In this paper, we propose the use of automated planning agents to simulate humans of varying skill levels to generate game playthroughs. Metrics can then be gathered from these playthroughs to evaluate the current game design and identify its potential flaws. We demonstrate this technique in two games: the popular word game Scrabble and a collectible card game of our own design named Cardonomicon. Using these case studies, we show how using simulated agents to model humans of varying skill levels allows us to extract metrics to describe game balance (in the case of Scrabble) and highlight potential design flaws (in the case of Cardonomicon)."}}

Playtesting, however, is expensive: human testers must be recruited, playtest results must be aggregated and interpreted, and changes to game designs must be extrapolated from these results. Can automated methods reduce this expense? We show how active learning techniques can formalize and automate a subset of playtesting goals. Specifically, we focus on the low-level parameter tuning required to balance a game once the mechanics have been chosen. Through a case study on a shoot-`em-up game we demonstrate the efficacy of active learning to reduce the amount of playtesting needed to choose the optimal set of game parameters for two classes of (formal) design objectives. This work opens the potential for additional methods to reduce the human burden of performing playtesting for a variety of relevant design concerns."}}

One key property of a generative method for a particular domain is how effectively the approach allows a designer to express the properties and constraints they care about. Generative methods have been applied much less frequently to dynamic artifacts such as boss behaviors, in part because the complex representation required to describe boss morphology and behavior is not amenable to existing generative techniques. It is challenging to describe a generative space of varied yet valid behaviors. Expanding on previous work that introduced a programming language for representing boss behaviors, we illustrate how such a language can be used by a designer to describe desirable design properties and constraints for bosses. That is, we define a generative space of bosses as a space of well-formed programs. We present a constructive algorithm that extends generative grammars to efficiently generate well-formed programs, and we show a complete example of generating Mega-Man-like bosses with complex attack patterns. We conclude that designing a generative space of dynamic behaviors can be fruitfully framed as a programming-language design problem."}}
