While a large number of methods for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) have been developed, they are misaligned with the desiderata of a modern DL researcher. Since often only a few trials are possible in the development of new DL methods, manual experimentation is still the most prevalent approach to set hyperparameters,\nrelying on the researcher\u2019s intuition and cheap preliminary explorations. To resolve this shortcoming of HPO for DL, we propose PriorBand, an HPO algorithm tailored to DL, able to utilize both expert beliefs and cheap proxy tasks. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficiency of PriorBand across a range of DL models and tasks using as little as the cost of 10 training runs and show its robustness against poor expert beliefs and misleading proxy tasks."}}

Entropy Search and Predictive Entropy Search both consider the entropy over the optimum in the input space, while the recent Max-value Entropy Search considers the entropy over the optimal value in the output space. We propose Joint Entropy Search (JES), a novel information-theoretic acquisition function that considers an entirely new quantity, namely the entropy over the joint optimal probability density over both input and output space. To incorporate this information, we consider the reduction in entropy from conditioning on fantasized optimal input/output pairs. The resulting approach primarily relies on standard GP machinery and  removes complex approximations typically associated with information-theoretic methods. With minimal computational overhead, JES shows superior decision-making, and yields state-of-the-art performance for information-theoretic approaches across a wide suite of tasks.

For a learning problem, a robot operator can typically specify the type and range of values of the parameters. Nevertheless, given their prior experience, robot operators should be able to help the learning process further by providing educated guesses about where in the parameter space potential optimal solutions could be found. Interestingly, such prior knowledge is not exploited in current robot learning frameworks. We introduce an approach that combines user priors and Bayesian optimization to allow fast optimization of robot industrial tasks at robot deployment time. We evaluate our method on three tasks that are learned in simulation as well as on two tasks that are learned directly on a real robot system. Additionally, we transfer knowledge from the corresponding simulation tasks by automatically constructing priors from well-performing configurations for learning on the real system.
