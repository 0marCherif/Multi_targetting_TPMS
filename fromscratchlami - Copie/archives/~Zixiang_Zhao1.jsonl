Recently, deep learning has emerged as an important tool for image fusion. This paper presents CSCFuse, which contains three deep convolutional sparse coding (CSC) networks for three kinds of image fusion tasks (i.e., infrared and visible image fusion, multi-exposure image fusion, and multi-spectral image fusion). The CSC model and the iterative shrinkage and thresholding algorithm are generalized into dictionary convolution units. As a result, all hyper-parameters are learned from data. Our extensive experiments and comprehensive comparisons reveal the superiority of CSCF use with regard to quantitative evaluation and visual inspection."}}

However, effectively training such fusion models is difficult due to the lack of ground truth fusion data. To address this issue, we propose the Equivariant Multi-Modality imAge fusion (EMMA) paradigm for end-to-end self-supervised learning. Our approach is based on the prior knowledge that natural images are equivariant to specific transformations. Thus, we introduce a novel training framework that includes a fusion module and a learnable pseudo-sensing module, which allow the network training to follow the principles of physical sensing and imaging process, and meanwhile satisfy the equivariant prior for natural images. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality fusion results for both infrared-visible and medical images, while facilitating downstream multi-modal segmentation and detection tasks. The code will be released."}}

To leverage strong generative priors and address challenges such as unstable training and lack of interpretability for GAN-based generative methods, we propose a novel fusion algorithm based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). The fusion task is formulated as a conditional generation problem under the DDPM sampling framework, which is further divided into an unconditional generation subproblem and a maximum likelihood subproblem. The latter is modeled in a hierarchical Bayesian manner with latent variables and inferred by the expectation-maximization algorithm. By integrating the inference solution into the diffusion sampling iteration, our method can generate high-quality fused images with natural image generative priors and cross-modality information from source images. Note that all we required is an unconditional pre-trained generative model, and no fine-tuning is needed. Our extensive experiments indicate that our approach yields promising fusion results in infrared-visible image fusion and medical image fusion. The code will be released."}}

The critical step of this task is to effectively extract domain-shared and domain-private RGB/depth features. In addition, three detailed issues, namely blurry edges, noisy surfaces, and over-transferred RGB texture, need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose the Spherical Space feature Decomposition Network (SSDNet) to solve the above issues. To better model cross-modality features, Restormer block-based RGB/depth encoders are employed for extracting local-global features. Then, the extracted features are mapped to the spherical space to complete the separation of private features and the alignment of shared features. Shared features of RGB are fused with the depth features to complete the GDSR task. Subsequently, a spherical contrast refinement (SCR) module is proposed to further address the detail issues. Patches that are classified according to imperfect categories are input to the SCR module, where the patch features are pulled closer to the ground truth and pushed away from the corresponding imperfect samples in the spherical feature space via contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art results on four test datasets and can successfully generalize to real-world scenes. Code will be released."}}

In this paper, a model-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model, referred to as Algorithm Unrolling Image Fusion (AUIF), is proposed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional CNN-based IVIF models. The proposed AUIF model starts with the iterative formulas of two traditional optimization models, which are established to accomplish two-scale decomposition, i.e., separating low-frequency base information and high-frequency detail information from source images. Then the algorithm unrolling is implemented where each iteration is mapped to a CNN layer and each optimization model is transformed into a trainable neural network. Compared with the general network architectures, the proposed framework combines the model-based prior information and is designed more reasonably. After the unrolling operation, our model contains two decomposers (encoders) and an additional reconstructor (decoder). In the training phase, this network is trained to reconstruct the input image. While in the test phase, the base (or detail) decomposed feature maps of infrared/visible images are merged respectively by an extra fusion layer, and then the decoder outputs the fusion image. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the superiority of our model, which can robustly generate fusion images containing highlight targets and legible details, exceeding the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our network has fewer weights and faster speed."}}

To solve the challenges in interpreting the working mechanism, extracting cross-modal features and RGB texture over-transferred, we propose a novel Discrete Cosine Transform Network (DCTNet) to alleviate the problems from three aspects. First, the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) module reconstructs the multi-channel HR depth features by using DCT to solve the channel-wise optimization problem derived from the image domain. Second, we introduce a semi-coupled feature extraction module that uses shared convolutional kernels to extract common information and private kernels to extract modality-specific information. Third, we employ an edge attention mechanism to highlight the contours informative for guided upsampling. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our DCTNet, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with a relatively small number of parameters.

Its principle is to fuse the input high-resolution single-channel panchromatic (PAN) image and low-resolution multi-spectral image and to obtain a high-resolution multi-spectral (HRMS) image. The existing deep learning pansharpening method has two shortcomings. First, features of two input images need to be concatenated along the channel dimension to reconstruct the HRMS image, which makes the importance of PAN images not prominent, and also leads to high computational cost. Second, the implicit information of features is difficult to extract through the manually designed loss function. To this end, we propose a generative adversarial network via the fast guided filter (FGF) for pansharpening. In generator, traditional channel concatenation is replaced by FGF to better retain the spatial information while reducing the number of parameters. Meanwhile, the fusion objects can be highlighted by the spatial attention module. In addition, the latent information of features can be preserved effectively through adversarial training. Numerous experiments illustrate that our network generates high-quality HRMS images that can surpass existing methods, and with fewer parameters."}}
