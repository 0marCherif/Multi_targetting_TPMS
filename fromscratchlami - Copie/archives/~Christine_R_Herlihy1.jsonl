We propose an automated, task-informed document retrieval framework for CORD-19 that leverages latent factors learned through topic models to select a set of research articles most relevant to the tasks at hand. Compared to na\u00efve keyword-based approaches, our approach broadens the qualification of relevance from the presence of specific terms to the activity of latent topics. We show that our approach provides an overlapping yet notably different set of selections, as the latent factors account for meaningful document-wise co-occurrences that individual keywords fail to capture. Upon both qualitative and quantitative examination of retrieval results, we further provide recommendations regarding task creation intended for unsupervised document retrieval in large, heterogeneous, natural language datasets."}}

That understanding comes from efforts to augment, combine, and compare models of related phenomena. We propose SemanticModels.jl, a system that leverages techniques from static and dynamic program analysis to process executable versions of scientific models to perform such metamodeling tasks. By framing these metamodeling tasks as metaprogramming problems, SemanticModels.jl enables writing programs that generate and expand models. To this end, we present a category theory-based framework for defining metamodeling tasks, and extracting semantic information from model implementations, and show how this framework can be used to enhance scientific workflows in a working case study."}}
