The goal of this kind of adversarial attack is to modify the input text to fool a classifier while maintaining the original meaning of the text. Although most existing adversarial attacks claim to fulfill the constraint of semantics preservation, careful scrutiny shows otherwise. We show that the problem lies in the text encoders used to determine the similarity of adversarial examples, specifically in the way they are trained. Unsupervised training methods make these encoders more susceptible to problems with antonym recognition. To overcome this, we introduce a simple, fully supervised sentence embedding technique called Semantics-Preserving-Encoder (SPE). The results show that our solution minimizes the variation in the meaning of the adversarial examples generated. It also significantly improves the overall quality of adversarial examples, as confirmed by human evaluators. Furthermore, it can be used as a component in any existing attack to speed up its execution while maintaining similar attack success."}}

Such a feat would require scaling up current simulation sizes to allow for enough computational capacity. Understanding complex computations happening in cellular automata and other systems capable of emergence poses many challenges, especially in large-scale systems. We propose methods for coarse-graining cellular automata based on frequency analysis of cell states, clustering and autoencoders. These innovative techniques facilitate the discovery of large-scale structure formation and complexity analysis in those systems. They emphasize interesting behaviors in elementary cellular automata while filtering out background patterns. Moreover, our methods reduce large 2D automata to smaller sizes and enable identifying systems that behave interestingly at multiple scales."}}

We discuss several ways how a metric for measuring the complexity growth can be defined. This includes approaches based on compression algorithms and artificial neural networks. We believe such a metric can be useful for designing systems that could exhibit open-ended evolution, which itself might be a prerequisite for development of general artificial intelligence. We conduct experiments on 1D and 2D grid worlds and demonstrate that using the proposed metric we can automatically construct computational models with emerging properties similar to those found in the Conway\u2019s Game of Life, as well as many other emergent phenomena. Interestingly, some of the patterns we observe resemble forms of artificial life. Our metric of structural complexity growth can be applied to a wide range of complex systems, as it is not limited to cellular automata."}}
