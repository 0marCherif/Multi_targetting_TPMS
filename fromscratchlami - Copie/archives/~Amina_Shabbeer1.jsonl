The model uses two high-throughput biomarkers: spacer oligonucleotide types (spoligotypes) and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU) types to represent strains of MTBC, since these are routinely gathered from MTBC isolates of tuberculosis (TB) patients. KBBN provides an elegant and simple way to incorporate existing widely accepted visual rules for MTBC sublineages into a classifier designed to capture known properties of the MTBC biomarkers. Unlike prior knowledge-based SVM approaches which require rules expressed as polyhedral sets, KBBN directly incorporates the rules without any modification. Computational results show that KBBN achieves much higher accuracy than methods based purely on rules, and than Bayesian networks trained on biomarker data alone."}}

We present a new visualization approach, host-pathogen maps, for simultaneously examining MTBC strains genotyped by multiple DNA fingerprinting methods such as spoligotyping and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) typing along with associated patient surveillance data. The host-pathogen maps are dynamically coupled with spoligoforests or other phylogenetic tree approaches to allow easy navigation within the pathogen genotyping space. Visualization of New York State and New York City (NYC) TB patient data from 2001-2007 is used to illustrate how host-pathogen maps can be used to rapidly identify potential instances of uncontrolled spread of tuberculosis versus disease resulting from latent reactivation of prior infection, a critical distinction in tuberculosis control. Host-pathogen maps also reveal trends and anomalies in the relationships between patient groups and MTBC genetic lineages which can provide critical clues in epidemiology and contact investigations of TB."}}

Among the biomarkers of MTBC, spacer oligonucleotide type (spoligotype) and Mycobacterium Interspersed Repetitive Unit (MIRU) patterns are commonly used to genotype clinical MTBC strains. In this study, we present an evolution model of spoligotype rearrangements using MIRU patterns to disambiguate the ancestors of spoligotypes, in a large patient dataset from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Based on the contiguous deletion assumption and rare observation of convergent evolution, we first generate the most parsimonious forest of spoligotypes, called a spoligoforest, using three genetic distance measures. An analysis of topological attributes of the spoligoforest and number of variations at the direct repeat (DR) locus of each strain reveals interesting properties of deletions in the DR region. First, we compare our mutation model to existing mutation models of spoligotypes and find that our mutation model produces as many within-lineage mutation events as other models, with slightly higher segregation accuracy. Second, based on our mutation model, the number of descendant spoligotypes follows a power law distribution. Third, contrary to prior studies, the power law distribution does not plausibly fit to the mutation length frequency. Finally, the total number of mutation events at consecutive DR loci follows a bimodal distribution, which results in accumulation of shorter deletions in the DR region. The two modes are spacers 13 and 40, which are hotspots for chromosomal rearrangements. The change point in the bimodal distribution is spacer 34, which is absent in most MTBC strains. This bimodal separation results in accumulation of shorter deletions, which explains why a power law distribution is not a plausible fit to the mutation length frequency."}}

MTBC is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), which remains one of the leading causes of disease and morbidity world-wide. DNA fingerprinting methods such as MIRU and spoligotyping are key components in the control and tracking of modern TB. Results CBN is designed to exploit background knowledge about MTBC biomarkers. It can be trained on large historical TB databases of various subsets of MTBC biomarkers. During TB control efforts not all biomarkers may be available. So, CBN is designed to predict the major lineage of isolates genotyped by any combination of the PCR-based typing methods: spoligotyping and MIRU typing. CBN achieves high accuracy on three large MTBC collections consisting of over 34,737 isolates genotyped by different combinations of spoligotypes, 12 loci of MIRU, and 24 loci of MIRU. CBN captures distinct MIRU and spoligotype signatures associated with each lineage, explaining its excellent performance. Visualization of MIRU and spoligotype signatures yields insight into both how the model works and the genetic diversity of MTBC. Conclusions CBN conforms to the available PCR-based biological markers and achieves high performance in identifying major lineages of MTBC. The method can be readily extended as new biomarkers are introduced for TB tracking and control. An online tool ( http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~bennek/tbinsight/tblineage ) makes the CBN model available for TB control and research efforts."}}

We present a tensor clustering framework to group MTBC strains into sublineages of the known major lineages based on two biomarkers: spacer oligonucleotide type (spoligotype) and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU). We represent genotype information of MTBC strains in a high-dimensional array in order to include information about spoligotype, MIRU, and their coexistence using multiple-biomarker tensors. We use multiway models to transform this multidimensional data about the MTBC strains into two-dimensional arrays and use the resulting score vectors in a stable partitive clustering algorithm to classify MTBC strains into sublineages. We validate clusterings using cluster stability and accuracy measures, and find stabilities of each cluster. Based on validated clustering results, we present a sublineage structure of MTBC strains and compare it to the sublineage structures of SpolDB4 and MIRU-VNTRplus."}}
