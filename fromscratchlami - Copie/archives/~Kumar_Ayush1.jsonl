Given\nan image with a simple linear algebraic equation system and a question in natural\nlanguage based on the variables in the image, we propose an end-to-end deep\nlearning model that produces accurate answers to questions pertaining to the value\nof the variables and other related questions. Modeling the problem of solving simple\nlinear equations as a VQA task makes it interesting as the system now requires\nthree kinds of understanding a) visual understanding to recognize digits, variables,\noperators and equal sign b) conceptual understanding of the symbolic meanings of\ncoefficients, constants, variables, operators and equality and realizing the role of\nnumbers as mathematical entities which can undergo mathematical operations and\nc) high level understanding of the interaction between the image and the questions\nin order to accurately answer them. We also create an open-source dataset for the\nsame and compare the performance of our model with different baselines."}}

The paper is aimed towards mitigating this labeling effort by leveraging the recent concept of generative adversarial network(GAN) wherein a generator maps latent noise space to realistic images while a discriminator differentiates between samples drawn from database and generator. We extend this concept to a multi task learning wherein a discriminator-classifier network differentiates between fake/real examples and also assigns correct class labels. Though our concept is generic, we applied it for the challenging task of vessel segmentation in fundus images. We show that proposed method is more data efficient than a CNN. Specifically, with 150K, 30K and 15K training examples, proposed method achieves mean AUC of 0.962, 0.945 and 0.931 respectively, whereas the simple CNN achieves AUC of 0.960, 0.921 and 0.916 respectively."}}
