However, their efficacy is undermined by undesired and inconsistent behaviors, including hallucination, unfaithful reasoning, and toxic content. A promising approach to rectify these flaws is self-correction, where the LLM itself is prompted or guided to fix problems in its own output. Techniques leveraging automated feedback -- either produced by the LLM itself or some external system -- are of particular interest as they are a promising way to make LLM-based solutions more practical and deployable with minimal human feedback. This paper presents a comprehensive review of this emerging class of techniques. We analyze and taxonomize a wide array of recent work utilizing these strategies, including training-time, generation-time, and post-hoc correction. We also summarize the major applications of this strategy and conclude by discussing future directions and challenges."}}

It is a chat-based nudge assistant that can boost (encourage) and sense (ask) the motivation, ability and propensity of users to walk and help them in achieving their step count targets, similar to a human coach. We demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness and acceptability of PACE by directly comparing to human coaches in a Wizard-of-Oz deployment study with 33 participants over 21 days. We tracked coach-participant conversations, step counts and qualitative survey feedback. Our findings indicate that the PACE framework strongly emulated human coaching with no significant differences in the overall number of active days, step count and engagement patterns. The qualitative user feedback suggests that PACE cultivated a coach-like experience, offering barrier resolution via motivational and educational support. We use traditional human-computer interaction approaches, to interrogate the conversational data and report positive PACE-participant interaction patterns with respect to addressal, disclosure, collaborative target settings, and reflexivity. As a post-hoc analysis, we annotated the conversation logs from the human coaching arm and trained machine learning (ML) models on these data sets to predict the next boost (AUC 0.73 \u00b1 0.02) and sense (AUC 0.83 \u00b1 0.01) action. In future, such ML-based models could be made increasingly personalized and adaptive based on user behaviors."}}

Several recent works suggest that convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) based models generate richer\nand more expressive feature embeddings and\nhence also perform well on relation prediction.\nHowever, we observe that these KG embeddings treat triples independently and thus fail\nto cover the complex and hidden information\nthat is inherently implicit in the local neighborhood surrounding a triple. To this effect, our\npaper proposes a novel attention-based feature\nembedding that captures both entity and relation features in any given entity\u2019s neighborhood. Additionally, we also encapsulate relation clusters and multi-hop relations in our\nmodel. Our empirical study offers insights\ninto the efficacy of our attention-based model\nand we show marked performance gains in\ncomparison to state-of-the-art methods on all\ndatasets."}}

Despite several interesting GNN variants being proposed recently for node and graph classification tasks, when faced with scarce labeled examples in the few-shot setting, these GNNs exhibit significant loss in classification performance. Here, we present an approach where a probability measure is assigned to each graph based on the spectrum of the graph\u2019s normalized Laplacian. This enables us to accordingly cluster the graph base-labels associated with each graph into super-classes, where the L^p Wasserstein distance serves as our underlying distance metric. Subsequently, a super-graph constructed based on the super-classes is then fed to our proposed GNN framework which exploits the latent inter-class relationships made explicit by the super-graph to achieve better class label separation among the graphs. We conduct exhaustive empirical evaluations of our proposed method and show that it outperforms both the adaptation of state-of-the-art graph classification methods to few-shot scenario and our naive baseline GNNs. Additionally, we also extend and study the behavior of our method to semi-supervised and active learning scenarios."}}
