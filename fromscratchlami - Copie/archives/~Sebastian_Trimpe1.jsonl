Fully data-driven dynamics models promise to ease the process of modeling and analysis, but require considerable amounts of data for training and often do not generalize well to unseen parts of the state space. Combining data-driven modeling with prior analytical knowledge is an attractive alternative as the inclusion of structural knowledge into a regression model improves the model's data efficiency and physical integrity. In this article, we survey supervised regression models that combine rigid-body mechanics with data-driven modeling techniques. We analyze the different latent functions (such as kinetic energy or dissipative forces) and operators (such as differential operators and projection matrices) underlying common descriptions of rigid-body mechanics. Based on this analysis, we provide a unified view on the combination of data-driven regression models, such as neural networks and Gaussian processes, with analytical model priors. Furthermore, we review and discuss key techniques for designing structured models such as automatic differentiation."}}

Although these criteria are often solved separately with different tools to maintain formal guarantees, it is also common practice in reinforcement learning (RL) to simply modify reward functions by penalizing failures, with the penalty treated as a mere heuristic. We rigorously examine the relationship of both safety and optimality to penalties, and formalize sufficient conditions for <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">safe value functions (SVFs):</i> value functions that are both optimal for a given task, and enforce safety constraints. We reveal this structure by examining when rewards preserve viability under optimal control, and show that there always exists a finite penalty that induces an SVF. This penalty is not unique, but upper-unbounded: larger penalties do not harm optimality. Although it is often not possible to compute the minimum required penalty, we reveal clear structure of how the penalty, rewards, discount factor, and dynamics interact. This insight suggests practical, theory-guided heuristics to design reward functions for control problems where safety is important."}}

This paper studies approximations of such MPC controllers via neural networks (NNs) to achieve fast online evaluation. We propose safety augmentation that yields deterministic guarantees for convergence and constraint satisfaction despite approximation inaccuracies. We approximate the entire input sequence of the MPC with NNs, which allows us to verify online if it is a feasible solution to the MPC problem. We replace the NN solution by a safe candidate based on standard MPC techniques whenever it is infeasible or has worse cost. Our method requires a single evaluation of the NN and forward integration of the input sequence online, which is fast to compute on resource-constrained systems. The proposed control framework is illustrated on three non-linear MPC benchmarks of different complexity, demonstrating computational speedups orders of magnitudes higher than online optimization. In the examples, we achieve deterministic safety through the safety-augmented NNs, where naive NN implementation fails."}}

From a mathematical point of view, these methods rest on the concept of kernels and function spaces generated by kernels, so called reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Motivated by recent developments of learning approaches in the context of interacting particle systems, we investigate kernel methods acting on data with many measurement variables. We show the rigorous mean field limit of kernels and provide a detailed analysis of the limiting reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Furthermore, several examples of kernels, that allow a rigorous mean field limit, are presented."}}

Establishing these properties is challenging, especially when no analytical model is available and they are to be inferred directly from measurement data. The presence of noise further complicates this analysis, as standard notions of distinguishability are tailored to deterministic systems. We build on distributional distinguishability, which extends the deterministic notion by comparing distributions of outputs of stochastic systems. We first show that both concepts are equivalent for a class of systems that includes linear systems. We then present a method to assess and quantify distributional distinguishability from output data. Specifically, our quantification measures how much data is required to tell apart two initial states, inducing a continuous spectrum of distinguishability. We propose a statistical test to determine a threshold above which two states can be considered distinguishable with high confidence. We illustrate these tools by computing distinguishability maps over the state space in simulation, then leverage the test to compare sensor configurations on hardware."}}

A standard approach is training recurrent models on measurement data. While these models typically provide exact short-term predictions, accumulating errors yield deteriorated long-term behavior. In contrast, models with reliable long-term predictions can often be obtained, either by training a robust but less detailed model, or by leveraging physics-based simulations. In both cases, inaccuracies in the models yield a lack of short-time details. Thus, different models with contrastive properties on different time horizons are available. This observation immediately raises the question: Can we obtain predictions that combine the best of both worlds? Inspired by sensor fusion tasks, we interpret the problem in the frequency domain and leverage classical methods from signal processing, in particular complementary filters. This filtering technique combines two signals by applying a high-pass filter to one signal, and low-pass filtering the other. Essentially, the high-pass filter extracts high-frequencies, whereas the low-pass filter extracts low frequencies. Applying this concept to dynamics model learning enables the construction of models that yield accurate long- and short-term predictions. Here, we propose two methods, one being purely learning-based and the other one being a hybrid model that requires an additional physics-based simulator."}}

However, these methods rely on human expertise and entail the time-consuming processes of data and parameter tuning. To overcome these challenges, we propose an easily implemented framework that can directly handle heterogeneous data sources for classification tasks. Our data-versus-data approach automatically quantifies distinctive differences in distributions in a high-dimensional space via kernel two-sample testing between two sets extracted from multimodal data (e.g., images, sounds, haptic signals). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by benchmarking against expertly engineered classifiers for visual-audio-haptic surface recognition due to the industrial relevance, difficulty, and competitive baselines of this application; ablation studies confirm the utility of key components of our pipeline. As shown in our open-source code, we achieve 97.2% accuracy on a standard multi-user dataset with 108 surface classes, outperforming the state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithm by 6% on a more difficult version of the task. The fact that our classifier obtains this performance with minimal data processing in the standard algorithm setting reinforces the powerful nature of kernel methods for learning to recognize complex patterns."}}

In this context, the field of explainable artificial intelligence has proposed the generation of high-level explanations of the prediction process of CNNs through concept extraction. While these methods can detect whether or not a concept is present in an image, they are unable to determine its location. What is more, a fair comparison of such approaches is difficult due to a lack of proper validation procedures. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for automatic concept extraction and localization based on representations obtained through pixel-wise aggregations of CNN activation maps. Further, we introduce a process for the validation of concept-extraction techniques based on synthetic datasets with pixel-wise annotations of their main components, reducing the need for human intervention. Extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives."}}

In most existing algorithms, each agent tries to detect faults by checking its own behavior. But what if one agent becomes unable to recognize misbehavior, for example due to failure in its onboard fault detection? To improve resilience and avoid propagation of individual errors to the multi-agent system, agents should check each other remotely for malfunction or misbehavior. In this paper, we build upon a recently proposed predictive triggering architecture that involves communication priorities shared throughout the network to manage limited bandwidth. We propose a fault detection method that uses these priorities to detect errors in other agents. The resulting algorithms is not only able to detect faults, but can also run on a low-power microcontroller in real-time, as we demonstrate in hardware experiments."}}
