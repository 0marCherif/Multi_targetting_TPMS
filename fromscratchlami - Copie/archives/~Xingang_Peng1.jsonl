Current autoregressive model suffers from two major drawbacks. First, it is hard to  capture local geometric patterns as only one atom is generated at each step. Second, most of the autoregressive models generate atoms and chemical bonds in two separate processes, which causes a number of problems such as incorrect counts of rings, a bias distribution of bond lengths, and inaccurate 3D molecular structures. To tackle this problem, we designed a model, named FragDiff, to generate 3D molecules fragment-by-fragment for pockets. In each generation step, FragDiff places a molecular fragment around the pocket by using E(3)-equivariant diffusion generative models to simultaneously predict the atom types, atom coordinates and the chemical bonds of the fragment. Extensive experimental results confirm our assumption that unifying the atoms and bonds generations could significantly improve the quality of the sampled 3D molecules in terms of more accurate distributions of 2D subgraphs and 3D substructures."}}

Recently, the inclusion of 3D structures during targeted drug design shows superior performance to other target-free models as the atomic interaction in the 3D space is explicitly modeled. However, current 3D target-aware models either rely on the voxelized atom densities or the autoregressive sampling process, which are not equivariant to rotation or easily violate geometric constraints resulting in unrealistic structures. In this work, we develop a 3D equivariant diffusion model to solve the above challenges. To achieve target-aware molecule design, our method learns a joint generative process of both continuous atom coordinates and categorical atom types with a SE(3)-equivariant network. Moreover, we show that our model can serve as an unsupervised feature extractor to estimate the binding affinity under proper parameterization, which provides an effective way for drug screening. To evaluate our model, we propose a comprehensive framework to evaluate the quality of sampled molecules from different dimensions. Empirical studies show our model could generate molecules with more realistic 3D structures and better affinities towards the protein targets, and improve binding affinity ranking and prediction without retraining."}}

The limited representational power of MPNNs inspires the study of provably powerful GNN architectures. However, knowing one model is more powerful than another gives little insight about what functions they can or cannot express. It is still unclear whether these models are able to approximate specific functions such as counting certain graph substructures, which is essential for applications in biology, chemistry and social network analysis. Motivated by this, we propose to study the counting power of Subgraph MPNNs, a recent and popular class of powerful GNN models that extract rooted subgraphs for each node, assign the root node a unique identifier and encode the root node's representation within its rooted subgraph. Specifically, we prove that Subgraph MPNNs fail to count more-than-4-cycles at node level, implying that node representations cannot correctly encode the surrounding substructures like ring systems with more than four atoms. To overcome this limitation, we propose I$^2$-GNNs to extend Subgraph MPNNs by assigning different identifiers for the root node and its neighbors in each subgraph. I$^2$-GNNs' discriminative power is shown to be strictly stronger than Subgraph MPNNs and partially stronger than the 3-WL test. More importantly, I$^2$-GNNs are proven capable of counting all 3, 4, 5 and 6-cycles, covering common substructures like benzene rings in organic chemistry, while still keeping linear complexity. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first linear-time GNN model that can count 6-cycles with theoretical guarantees. We validate its counting power in cycle counting tasks and demonstrate its competitive performance in molecular prediction benchmarks."}}

The binding between antibodies and antigens is mainly determined by the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) of the antibodies. In this work, we develop a deep generative model that jointly models sequences and structures of CDRs based on diffusion probabilistic models and equivariant neural networks. Our method is the first deep learning-based method that generates antibodies explicitly targeting specific antigen structures and is one of the earliest diffusion probabilistic models for protein structures. The model is a \"Swiss Army Knife\" capable of sequence-structure co-design, sequence design for given backbone structures, and antibody optimization. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the quality of both sequences and structures of designed antibodies. We find that our model could yield competitive results in binding affinity measured by biophysical energy functions and other protein design metrics."}}

To compress the model, we develop an &#8467;0-based sparse group lasso model called MobilePrune which can generate extremely compact neural network models for both desktop and mobile platforms. We adopt group lasso penalty to enforce sparsity at the group level to benefit General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) and develop the very first algorithm that can optimize the &#8467;0 norm in an exact manner and achieve the global convergence guarantee in the deep learning context. MobilePrune also allows complicated group structures to be applied on the group penalty (i.e., trees and overlapping groups) to suit DNN models with more complex architectures. Empirically, we observe the substantial reduction of compression ratio and computational costs for various popular deep learning models on multiple benchmark datasets compared to the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the compression models are deployed on the android system to confirm that our approach is able to achieve less response delay and battery consumption on mobile phones."}}

In this work, we focus on a new type of drug design problem -- generating a small \"linker\" to physically attach two independent molecules with their distinct functions. The main computational challenges include: 1) the generation of linkers is conditional on the two given molecules, in contrast to generating full molecules from scratch in previous works; 2) linkers heavily depend on the anchor atoms of the two molecules to be connected, which are not known beforehand; 3) 3D structures and orientations of the molecules need to be considered to avoid atom clashes, for which equivariance to E(3) group are necessary. To address these problems, we propose a conditional generative model, named 3DLinker, which is able to predict anchor atoms and jointly generate linker graphs and their 3D structures based on an E(3) equivariant graph variational autoencoder. So far as we know, there are no previous models that could achieve this task. We compare our model with multiple conditional generative models modified from other molecular design tasks and find that our model has a significantly higher rate in recovering molecular graphs, and more importantly, accurately predicting the 3D coordinates of all the atoms."}}
