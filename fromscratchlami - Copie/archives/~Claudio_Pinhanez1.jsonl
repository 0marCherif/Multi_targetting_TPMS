Recent years have seen the possibilities for content curators to instruct conversational machines in the customer service domain (i.e., Machine Teaching). The activities of curating specialized data are time-consuming. These activities have a learning curve for the domain expert, and they rely on collaborators beyond the domain experts, including product owners, technology expert curators, management, marketing, and communication employees. However, recent research has looked at making this task easier for domain experts with a lack of knowledge in the Machine Learning system, and few papers have investigated the work practices and collaborations involved in this role. This paper aims to fill this gap, presenting and unveiling practices extracted from eleven semi-structured interviews and four design workshops with experts in Banking, Technical support, Humans Resources, Telecommunications, and Automotive sectors. First, we investigate the articulation work of the content curators and tech curators in training conversational machines. Second, we inspect the curatorial and collaboration strategies they use, which are not afforded by current conversational platforms. Third, we draw the design implications and possibilities to support individual and collaboration curating practices. We reflect on how those practices rely on self and collaboration with others for curation, trust, and data tracking and ownership."}}

Although recent work has shown that there can be significant improvements in OOS detection when the intent classes are represented as dense-vectors based on domain specific knowledge, we argue in this paper that such gains are more likely due to advantages of dense-vector to one-hot encoding methods in representing the complexity of the OOS space. We start by showing how dense-vector encodings can create OOS spaces with much richer topologies than one-hot encoding methods. We then demonstrate empirically, using four standard intent classification datasets, that knowledge-free, randomly generated dense-vector encodings of intent classes can yield massive, over 20% gains over one-hot encodings, and also outperform the previous, domain knowledge-based, SOTA of one of the datasets. We finish by describing a novel algorithm to search for good dense-vector encodings and present initial but promising experimental results of its use."}}

However, these NLU services provide curatorial tools that do not always follow mental models resembling that of the content curators. Moreover, we present an interface for content curators that are aligned with concepts management embedded in taxonomies. We conducted a workshop to understand content creators\u2019 work practices, created a prototype interface, and conducted a user evaluation to identify usability and productivity aspects. Based on our prototype\u2019s evaluation insights, we provide implications for designing user interfaces of NLU services to support curators\u2019 work practices and enhance collaboration."}}

Key causes include an often deceptive portrayal of the language comprehension capabilities of the system and, in many cases, a problematic impersonation of human characters by computers. We argue here that a major challenge of pervasive computing is to rethink language-based interaction with applications and devices. Inspired by the imaginary pervasive conversations of Sci-Fi movies, we suggest a new design principle where machines should only utter statements that they can comprehend, which we call What You Hear Is What You Say (WYHIWYS). We provide some examples of WYHIWYS in language interactions with pervasive applications, including a deployment in an art exhibit, and discuss some key research challenges it poses to HCI, AI, and pervasive computing."}}

This is done in the context of a real-world practice of curators of conversational systems who often embed taxonomically-structured meta-knowledge into their documentation. The paper provides evidence that the practice is quite common among curators, that is used as part of their collaborative practices, and that the embedded knowledge can be mined by algorithms. Further, this meta-knowledge can be integrated, using neuro-symbolic algorithms, to the machine learning-based conversational system, to improve its run-time accuracy and to enable tools to support curatorial tasks. Those results point towards new ways of designing development tools which explore an integrated use of code and documentation by machines."}}

These systems have improved operational efficiency by reducing the cost of customer service and more and more are used in customer service channels. More recently, with the addition of speech capabilities added to those systems, bot language modifications have to be done in order to improve user experience. In this paper, we analyze the language used in those systems using datasets collected from real chatbots. For that, we first propose models that are able to identify the language style (writing, speech, and computer-mediated) using as linguist features syntactic (Biber's dimensions) and sentence embeddings as well as state-of-art datasets. Our results show that our models were able to distinguish among the three classes with an accuracy of up to 66%. Finally, we evaluate real chatbots systems, either speech- and text-based ones, using our proposed models. We found that these real chatbots are generally using a computer-mediated style, but there is indication that their developers tend to adapt the language style to be more speech-like when text-to-speech is used."}}
