As a variant of ordinary linear regression, it requires estimating not only the regression variable, but also permutational correspondences between the covariates and responses. While existing formulations require the underlying ground-truth correspondences to be an ideal bijection such that all pieces of data should match, such a requirement barely holds in real-world applications due to either missing data or outliers. In this work, we generalize the formulation of shuffled linear regression to a broader range of conditions where only a part of the data should correspond. To this end, the effective recovery condition and NP-hardness of the proposed formulation are also studied. Moreover, we present a simple yet effective algorithm for deriving the solution. Its global convergence property and convergence rate are also analyzed in detail. Distinct tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed formulation and the solution method."}}

However, existing methods assume that each action clip is manually trimmed to contain one specific action, which requires a significant amount of effort for annotation. To solve this problem, we consider a novel problem of skeleton-based weakly-supervised temporal action localization (S-WTAL), where we need to recognize and localize human action segments in untrimmed skeleton videos given only the video-level labels. Although this task is challenging due to the sparsity of skeleton data and the lack of contextual clues from interaction with other objects and the environment, we present a frame-level label refinement framework based on a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) to overcome these difficulties. We use multiple instance learning (MIL) with video-level labels to generate the frame-level predictions. Inspired by advances in handling the noisy label problem, we introduce a label cleaning strategy of the frame-level pseudo labels to guide the learning process. The network parameters and the frame-level predictions are alternately updated to obtain the final results. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our learning approach on skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks. The state-of-the-art experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can recognize and localize action segments of the skeleton data."}}

Early methods considered registration as a purely geometric problem, presenting excellent extensibility for various tasks due to their explicit handling of correspondences; statistical methods were later introduced to handle noise. However, the two categories of algorithms have evolved independently without sharing much in common. In this paper, we leverage the concept of information geometry to theoretically unify the two classes together by interpreting them as the same operation but in different spaces associated with respective metrics. Moreover, based on the proposed unification, we also develop a novel bandwidth estimation strategy to solve the long-standing problem of statistical registration algorithms, and demonstrate its theoretical and practical advantages over deterministic annealing, the most commonly used technique. We also present a case study to show how geometric and statistical approaches can benefit from each other."}}

Recent progress in rotation-invariant point cloud analysis is mainly driven by converting point clouds into their respective canonical poses, and principal component analysis (PCA) is a practical tool to achieve this. Due to the imperfect alignment of PCA, most of the current works are devoted to developing powerful network structures and features to overcome this deficiency, without thoroughly analyzing the PCA-based canonical poses themselves. In this work, we present a detailed study w.r.t. the PCA-based canonical poses of point clouds. Our investigation reveals that the ambiguity problem associated with the PCA-based canonical poses is handled insufficiently in some recent works. To this end, we develop a simple pose selector module for disambiguation, which presents noticeable enhancement (i.e., 5.3% classification accuracy) over state-of-the-art approaches on the challenging real-world dataset. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>"}}

The key idea is to embed an implicit representation of the point cloud, namely the distance field, into neural networks. One neural network is used to embed a portion of the distance field around a point. The resulting network weights are concatenated to be used as a representation of the corresponding point cloud instance. To enable comparison among the weights, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is employed as the embedding network. Invariance to scale and coordinate change can be achieved by introducing a scale commutative activation layer to the ELM, and aligning the distance field into a canonical pose. Experimental results using our representation demonstrate that our proposal is capable of similar or better classification and segmentation performance compared to the state-of-the-art point-based methods, while requiring less time for training."}}

The key idea is to parametrize a distance field around an individual shape into a unique, canonical, and compact vector in an unsupervised manner. We firstly project a distance field to a $4$D canonical space using singular value decomposition. We then train a neural network for each instance to non-linearly embed its distance field into network parameters. We employ a bias-free Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with ReLU activation units, which has scale-factor commutative property between layers. We demonstrate the descriptiveness of the instance-wise, shape-embedded network parameters by using them to classify shapes in $3$D datasets. Our learning-based representation requires minimal augmentation and simple neural networks, where previous approaches demand numerous representations to handle coordinate change and point permutation."}}

We take advantage of the observations that objects are generally captured from ground-level viewpoints, and that images transform smoothly between some characteristic viewpoints despite the difference among instances. To estimate 3D models of a category, we first embed the images into a manifold to cluster viewpoints into degenerate and intermediate viewpoints. Then, we select adequate triplets of images that capture similarly shaped objects by aligning manifolds of the different viewpoint clusters. To establish correspondence between the images, we prepare finer clusters from the original manifold, and obtain a common set of features that are at locations consistent with the average flow between neighboring clusters. Under the assumption of orthographical projection, camera parameters are estimated using the correspondence among views. Finally, visual hull for each image triplet is calculated using the silhouettes. Our method is capable of automatically reconstructing an approximate categorical model even without supervision."}}

The key insight is to consider the entire shape as a collection of local structures that individually undergo rigid transformations to collectively deform the global structure. We realize this locally rigid but globally non-rigid surface registration with a newly derived dual-grid Free-form Deformation (FFD) framework. We first represent the source and target shapes with their signed distance fields (SDF). We then superimpose a sampling grid onto a conventional FFD grid that is dual to the control points. Each control point is then iteratively translated by a rigid transformation that minimizes the difference between two SDFs within the corresponding sampling region. The translated control points then interpolate the embedding space within the FFD grid and determine the overall deformation. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our method is capable of overcoming the difficulty of preserving and matching local features."}}
