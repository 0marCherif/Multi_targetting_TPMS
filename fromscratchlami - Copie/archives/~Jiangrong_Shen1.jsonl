Although spiking based models are energy efficient by taking advantage of discrete spike signals, their performance is limited by current network structures and their training methods. As discrete signals, typical SNNs cannot apply the gradient descent rules directly into parameters adjustment as artificial neural networks (ANNs). Aiming at this limitation, here we propose a novel method of constructing deep SNN models with knowledge distillation (KD) that uses ANN as teacher model and SNN as student model. Through ANN-SNN joint training algorithm, the student SNN model can learn rich feature information from the teacher ANN model through the KD method, yet it avoids training SNN from scratch when communicating with non-differentiable spikes. Our method can not only build a more efficient deep spiking structure feasibly and reasonably, but use few time steps to train whole model compared to direct training or ANN to SNN methods. More importantly, it has a superb ability of noise immunity for various types of artificial noises and natural signals. The proposed novel method provides efficient ways to improve the performance of SNN through constructing deeper structures in a high-throughput fashion, with potential usage for light and efficient brain-inspired computing of practical scenarios."}}

Existing studies either mimic the learning mechanism of brain neural networks as closely as possible, for example, the temporally local learning rule of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), or apply the gradient descent rule to optimize a multilayer SNN with fixed structure. However, the learning rule used in the former is local and how the real brain might do the global-scale credit assignment is still not clear, which means that those shallow SNNs are robust but deep SNNs are difficult to be trained globally and could not work so well. For the latter, the nondifferentiable problem caused by the discrete spike trains leads to inaccuracy in gradient computing and difficulties in effective deep SNNs. Hence, a hybrid solution is interesting to combine shallow SNNs with an appropriate machine learning (ML) technique not requiring the gradient computing, which is able to provide both energy-saving and high-performance advantages. In this article, we propose a HybridSNN, a deep and strong SNN composed of multiple simple SNNs, in which data-driven greedy optimization is used to build powerful classifiers, avoiding the derivative problem in gradient descent. During the training process, the output features (spikes) of selected weak classifiers are fed back to the pool for the subsequent weak SNN training and selection. This guarantees HybridSNN not only represents the linear combination of simple SNNs, as what regular AdaBoost algorithm generates, but also contains neuron connection information, thus closely resembling the neural networks of a brain. HybridSNN has the benefits of both low power consumption in weak units and overall data-driven optimizing strength. The network structure in HybridSNN is learned from training samples, which is more flexible and effective compared with existing fixed multilayer SNNs. Moreover, the topological tree of HybridSNN resembles the neural system in the brain, where pyramidal neurons receive thousands of synaptic input signals through their dendrites. Experimental results show that the proposed HybridSNN is highly competitive among the state-of-the-art SNNs."}}

To realize the promised brain-like intelligence, it needs to solve the challenges of the neuromorphic hardware architecture design of biological neural substrate and the hardware amicable algorithms with spike-based encoding and learning. Here we introduce a neural spike coding model termed spiketrum, to characterize and transform the time-varying analog signals, typically auditory signals, into computationally efficient spatiotemporal spike patterns. It minimizes the information loss occurring at the analog-to-spike transformation and possesses informational robustness to neural fluctuations and spike losses. The model provides a sparse and efficient coding scheme with precisely controllable spike rate that facilitates training of spiking neural networks in various auditory perception tasks. We further investigate the algorithm-hardware co-designs through a neuromorphic cochlear prototype which demonstrates that our approach can provide a systematic solution for spike-based artificial intelligence by fully exploiting its advantages with spike-based computation."}}

However, the performance of some current spiking-based models is limited by their structures which means either fully connected or too-deep structures bring too much redundancy. This redundancy from both connection and neurons is one of the key factors hindering the practical application of SNNs. Although Some pruning methods were proposed to tackle this problem, they normally ignored the fact the neural topology in the human brain could be adjusted dynamically. Inspired by this, this paper proposed an evolutionary-based structure construction method for constructing more reasonable SNNs. By integrating the knowledge distillation and connection pruning method, the synaptic connections in SNNs can be optimized dynamically to reach an optimal state. As a result, the structure of SNNs could not only absorb knowledge from the teacher model but also search for deep but sparse network topology. Experimental results on CIFAR100 and DVS-Gesture show that the proposed structure learning method can get pretty well performance while reducing the connection redundancy. The proposed method explores a novel dynamical way for structure learning from scratch in SNNs which could build a bridge to close the gap between deep learning and bio-inspired neural dynamics."}}
