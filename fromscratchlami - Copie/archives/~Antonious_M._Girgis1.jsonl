In the shuffle model, each of the \ud835\udc5b clients randomizes its response using a local differentially private (LDP) mechanism and the untrusted server only receives a random permutation (shuffle) of the client responses without association to each client. The principal result in this paper is the first direct RDP bounds for general discrete local randomization in the shuffle privacy model, and we develop new analysis techniques for deriving our results which could be of independent interest. In applications, such an RDP guarantee is most useful when we use it for composing several private interactions. We numerically demonstrate that, for important regimes, with composition our bound yields an improvement in privacy guarantee by a factor of 8\u00d7 over the state-of-the-art approximate Differential Privacy (DP) guarantee (with standard composition) for shuffle models. Moreover, combining with Poisson subsampling, our result leads to at least 10\u00d7 improvement over subsampled approximate DP with standard composition"}}

This heterogeneity has motivated the design of personalized learning, where individual (personalized) models are trained, through collaboration. There have been various personalization methods proposed in literature, with seemingly very different forms and methods ranging from use of a single global model for local regularization and model interpolation, to use of multiple global models for personalized clustering, etc. In this work, we begin with a statistical framework that  unifies several different algorithms as well as suggest new algorithms.  We apply our framework to personalized estimation, and connect it to the classical empirical Bayes' methodology. We develop novel private personalized estimation under this framework. We then use our statistical framework to propose new personalized learning algorithms, including AdaPeD based on information-geometry regularization, which numerically outperforms several known algorithms. We develop privacy for personalized learning methods with guarantees for user-level privacy and composition. We numerically evaluate the performance as well as the privacy for both the estimation and learning problems, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed methods."}}

Motivated by stochastic optimization and the federated learning (FL) paradigm, we focus on the case where a small fraction of data samples are randomly sub-sampled in each round to participate in the learning process, which also enables privacy amplification.  To obtain even stronger local privacy guarantees, we study this in the shuffle privacy model, where each client randomizes its response using a local differentially private (LDP) mechanism and the server only receives a random permutation (shuffle) of the clients' responses without their\nassociation to each client. The principal result of this paper is a privacy-optimization performance trade-off for discrete randomization mechanisms in this sub-sampled shuffle privacy model. This is enabled\nthrough a new theoretical technique to analyze the Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) of the sub-sampled shuffle model.  We numerically demonstrate that, for important regimes, with composition our bound\nyields significant improvement in privacy guarantee over the state-of-the-art approximate Differential Privacy (DP) guarantee (with strong composition) for sub-sampled shuffled models. We also demonstrate numerically significant improvement in privacy-learning performance operating point using real data sets. Despite these advances, an open question is to bridge the gap between lower and upper privacy bounds in our RDP analysis."}}
