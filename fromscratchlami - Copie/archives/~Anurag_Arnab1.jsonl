To answer this question, we study various pretraining architectures and objectives within the masked autoencoding framework, motivated by the success of similar methods in natural language and image understanding. We show that we can achieve significant improvements on audiovisual downstream classification tasks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on VGGSound and AudioSet. Furthermore, we can leverage our audiovisual pretraining scheme for multiple unimodal downstream tasks using a single audiovisual pretrained model. We additionally demonstrate the transferability of our representations, achieving state-of-the-art audiovisual results on Epic Kitchens without pretraining specifically for this dataset."}}

However for videos, such paired data is not as abundant. Thus, video-text models are usually designed by adapting pretrained image-text models to video-domain, instead of training from scratch. All such recipes rely on augmenting visual embeddings with temporal information (i.e., image \u2192 video), often keeping text embeddings unchanged or even being discarded. In this paper, we argue that such adapted video-text models can benefit more by augmenting text rather than visual information. We propose VicTR, which jointly-optimizes text and video tokens, generating \u2018Video-conditioned Text\u2019 embeddings. Our method can further make use of freely-available semantic information, in the form of visually-grounded auxiliary text (e.g., object or scene information). We conduct experiments on multiple benchmarks including supervised (Kinetics-400, Charades), zero-shot and few-shot (HMDB-51, UCF-101) settings, showing competitive performance on activity recognition based on video-text models."}}

For object detection, pre-training and scaling approaches are less well established, especially in the long-tailed and open-vocabulary setting, where training data is relatively scarce. In this paper, we propose a strong recipe for transferring image-text models to open-vocabulary object detection. We use a standard Vision Transformer architecture with minimal modifications, contrastive image-text pre-training, and end-to-end detection fine-tuning. Our analysis of the scaling properties of this setup shows that increasing image-level pre-training and model size yield consistent improvements on the downstream detection task. We provide the adaptation strategies and regularizations needed to attain very strong performance on zero-shot text-conditioned and one-shot image-conditioned object detection.

However, most standard neural networks have the same function type and fixed computation budget on different samples regardless of their nature and difficulty. Adaptivity is a powerful paradigm as it not only imbues practitioners with flexibility pertaining to the downstream usage of these models but can also serve as a powerful inductive bias for solving certain challenging classes of problems. In this work, we propose a new strategy, AdaTape, that enables dynamic computation in neural networks via adaptive tape tokens. AdaTape employs an elastic input sequence by equipping an existing architecture with a dynamic read and write tape. Specifically, we adaptively generate input sequences using tape tokens obtained from a tape bank that can either be trainable or generated from input data. We analyze the challenges and requirements to obtain dynamic sequence content and length, and propose the Adaptive Tape Reader (ATR) algorithm to achieve both objectives. Via extensive experiments on image recognition tasks, we show that AdaTape can achieve better performance while maintaining the computational cost."}}

It is commonly believed that to achieve compositional generalization on visual reasoning, an explicit abstraction of the visual scene must be constructed; for example, object detection can be applied to the visual input to produce representations that are then processed by a neural network or a neuro-symbolic framework. We demonstrate that a simple and general self-supervised approach is able to learn implicit symbolic representations with general-purpose neural networks, enabling the end-to-end learning of visual reasoning directly from raw visual inputs. Our proposed approach ``compresses'' each frame of a video into a small set of tokens with a transformer network. The self-supervised learning objective is to reconstruct each image based on the compressed temporal context. To minimize the reconstruction loss, the network must learn a compact representation for each image, as well as capture temporal dynamics and object permanence from temporal context. We evaluate the proposed approach on two visual reasoning benchmarks, CATER and ACRE. We observe that self-supervised pretraining is essential to achieve compositional generalization for our end-to-end trained neural network, and our proposed method achieves on par or better performance compared to recent neuro-symbolic approaches that often require additional object-level supervision."}}

Models are typically pretrained on large \u201cupstream\u201d datasets for classification, as such labels are easy to collect, and then finetuned on downstream\u201d tasks such as action localisation, which are smaller due to their finer-grained annotations.\n\nIn this paper, we question this approach, and propose co-finetuning -- simultaneously training a single model on multiple \u201cupstream\u201d and \u201cdownstream\u201d tasks. We demonstrate that co-finetuning outperforms traditional transfer learning when using the same total amount of data, and also show how we can easily extend our approach to multiple \u201cupstream\u201d datasets to further improve performance. In particular, co-finetuning significantly improves the performance on rare classes in our downstream task, as it has a regularising effect, and enables the network to learn feature representations that transfer between different datasets. Finally, we observe how co-finetuning with public, video classification datasets, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art results for spatio-temporal action localisation on the challenging AVA and AVA-Kinetics datasets, outperforming recent works which develop intricate models."}}

Our model is inspired by the seminal Neural Turing Machine, and has an external memory consisting of a set of tokens which summarise the previous history. This memory is efficiently addressed, read and written using a Transformer as the processing unit/controller at each step. The model's memory module ensures that a new observation will only be processed with the contents of the memory (and not the entire history), meaning that it can efficiently process long sequences with a bounded computational cost at each step. We show that TTM outperforms other alternatives, such as other Transformer models designed for long sequences and recurrent neural networks, on two real-world sequential decision making tasks: online temporal activity localization from videos and vision-based robot action policy learning."}}

Our model consists of separate encoders to represent different views of the input video with lateral connections to fuse information across views. We present thorough ablation studies of our model and show that MTV consistently performs better than single-view counterparts in terms of accuracy and computational cost across a range of model sizes. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art results on five standard datasets, and improve even further with large-scale pretraining. We will release code and pretrained checkpoints."}}

Unlike recent video-language pretraining frameworks, our framework trains both a multimodal video encoder and a sentence decoder jointly. To overcome the lack of captions in unlabelled videos, we leverage the future utterance as an additional text source and propose a bidirectional generation objective -- we generate future utterances given the present mulitmodal context, and also the present utterance given future observations. With this objective, we train an encoder-decoder model end-to-end to generate a caption from raw pixels and transcribed speech directly.

However, collecting large datasets in a time- and cost-efficient manner often results in label noise. We present a method for learning from noisy labels that leverages similarities between training examples in feature space, encouraging the prediction of each example to be similar to its nearest neighbours. Compared to training algorithms that use multiple models or distinct stages, our approach takes the form of a simple, additional regularization term. It can be interpreted as an inductive version of the classical, transductive label propagation algorithm. We thoroughly evaluate our method on datasets evaluating both synthetic (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and realistic (mini-WebVision, WebVision, Clothing1M, mini-ImageNet-Red) noise, and achieve competitive or state-of-the-art accuracies across all of them."}}
