Existing studies either mimic the learning mechanism of brain neural networks as closely as possible, for example, the temporally local learning rule of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), or apply the gradient descent rule to optimize a multilayer SNN with fixed structure. However, the learning rule used in the former is local and how the real brain might do the global-scale\ncredit assignment is still not clear, which means that those shallow SNNs are robust but deep SNNs are difficult to be trained globally\nand could not work so well. For the latter, the nondifferentiable problem caused by the discrete spike trains leads to inaccuracy in\ngradient computing and difficulties in effective deep SNNs. Hence, a hybrid solution is interesting to combine shallow SNNs with an\nappropriate machine learning (ML) technique not requiring the gradient computing, which is able to provide both energy-saving\nand high-performance advantages. In this article, we propose a HybridSNN, a deep and strong SNN composed of multiple simple SNNs, in which data-driven greedy optimization is used to build powerful classifiers, avoiding the derivative problem in gradient descent. During the training process, the output features (spikes) of selected weak classifiers are fed back to the pool for the subsequent weak SNN training and selection."}}

To take full advantage of low power consumption and improve the efficiency of these models further, the pruning methods have been explored to find sparse SNNs without redundancy connections after training. However, parameter redundancy still hinders the efficiency of SNNs during training. In the human brain, the rewiring process of neural networks is highly dynamic, while synaptic connections maintain relatively sparse during brain development. Inspired by this, here we propose an efficient evolutionary structure learning (ESL) framework for SNNs, named ESL-SNNs, to implement the sparse SNN training from scratch. The pruning and regeneration of synaptic connections in SNNs evolve dynamically during learning, yet keep the structural sparsity at a certain level. As a result, the ESL-SNNs can search for optimal sparse connectivity by exploring all possible parameters across time. Our experiments show that the proposed ESL-SNNs framework is able to learn SNNs with sparse structures effectively while reducing the limited accuracy. The ESL-SNNs achieve merely 0.28% accuracy loss with 10% connection density on the DVS-Cifar10 dataset. Our work presents a brand-new approach for sparse training of SNNs from scratch with biologically plausible evolutionary mechanisms, closing the gap in the expressibility between sparse training and dense training. Hence, it has great potential for SNN lightweight training and inference with low power consumption and small memory usage."}}

Existing studies mostly use a fixed neural decoder, thus suffering from an unstable performance given neural functional changes. We propose a novel evolutionary ensemble framework (EvoEnsemble) to dynamically cope with changes in neural signals by evolving the decoder model accordingly. EvoEnsemble integrates evolutionary computation algorithms in a Bayesian framework where the fitness of models can be sequentially computed with their likelihoods according to the incoming data at each time slot, which enables online tracking of time-varying functions. Two strategies of evolve-at-changes and history-model-archive are designed to further improve efficiency and stability. Experiments with simulations and neural signals demonstrate that EvoEnsemble can track the changes in functions effectively thus improving the accuracy and robustness of neural decoding. The improvement is most significant in neural signals with functional changes."}}

However, unlike the brain mechanisms, most existing SNN algorithms have fixed network topologies and connection relationships. This paper proposes a method to jointly learn network connections and link weights simultaneously. The connection structures are optimized by the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule with timing information, and the link weights are optimized by a supervised algorithm. The connection structures and the weights are learned alternately until a termination condition is satisfied. Experiments are carried out using four benchmark datasets. Our approach outperforms classical learning methods such as STDP, Tempotron, SpikeProp, and a state-of-the-art supervised algorithm. In addition, the learned structures effectively reduce the number of connections by about 24%, thus facilitate the computational efficiency of the network."}}

We first present a fast posture alignment method which is self-dependent and avoids the registration between an input face against every face in the gallery. Then, a Signed Shape Difference Map (SSDM) is computed between two aligned 3D faces as a mediate representation for the shape comparison. Based on the SSDMs, three kinds of features are used to encode both the local similarity and the change characteristics between facial shapes. The most discriminative local features are selected optimally by boosting and trained as weak classifiers for assembling three collective strong classifiers, namely, CSDCs with respect to the three kinds of features. Different schemes are designed for verification and identification to pursue high performance in both recognition and computation. The experiments, carried out on FRGC v2 with the standard protocol, yield three verification rates all better than 97.9 percent with the FAR of 0.1 percent and rank-1 recognition rates above 98 percent. Each recognition against a gallery with 1,000 faces only takes about 3.6 seconds. These experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is not only effective but also time efficient."}}

The PSDM is established between two 3D face models aligned by a posture normalization procedure based on facial features. The model alignment is self-dependent, which avoids registering the probe face against every different gallery face during the recognition, so that a high computational speed is obtained. The experiments, carried out on the FRGC v2 and BU-3DFE databases, yield rank-1 recognition rates better than 98 %. Each recognition against a gallery with 1000 faces only needs about 3.05 seconds. These two experimental results together with the high performance recognition on partial faces demonstrate that our algorithm is not only effective but also efficient."}}

This paper proposes a guidance-based constraint deformation(GCD) model to cope with the shape distortion by expression. The basic idea is that, the face model with non-neutral expression is deformed toward its neutral one under certain constraint so that the distortion is reduced while inter-class discriminative information is preserved. The GCD model exploits the neutral 3D face shape to guide the deformation, meanwhile applies a rigid constraint on it. Both steps are smoothly unified in the Poisson equation framework. The GCD approach only needs one neutral model for each person in the gallery. The experimental results, carried out on the large 3D face databases-FRGC v2.0, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms ICP method for both identification and authentication mode. It shows the GCD model is promising for coping with the shape distortion in 3D face recognition."}}

We firstly extend the 2D image pyramid model to the progressive resolution chain (PRC) model in 3D domain, to describe the detail variation during resolution decreasing. Then a consistent planar representation of 3D faces is presented, which enables the analysis and comparison among the features of the same facial part for the subsequent restoration process. Finally, formulated as solving an iterative quadratic system by maximizing a posteriori, a 3D restoration algorithm using PRC features is given. The experimental results on USF HumanID 3D face database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}

Then we build a reference plane through the nose tip for calculating the relative depth values. Considering the non-rigid property of facial surface, the ROI is triangulated and parameterized into an isomorphic 2D planar circle, attempting to preserve the intrinsic geometric properties. At the same time the relative depth values are also mapped. Finally we perform eigenface on the mapped relative depth image. The entire scheme is insensitive to pose variance. The experiment using FRGC database v1.0 obtains the rank-1 identification score of 95%, which outperforms the result of the PCA base-line method by 4%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm."}}
