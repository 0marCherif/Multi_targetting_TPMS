Recently, multi-agent reinforced feature selection (MARFS) has been introduced to automate feature selection, by creating agents for each feature to select or deselect corresponding features. Although MARFS enjoys the automation of the selection process, MARFS suffers from not just the data complexity in terms of contents and dimensionality, but also the exponentially-increasing computational costs with regard to the number of agents. The raised concern leads to a new research question: Can we simplify the selection process of agents under reinforcement learning context so as to improve the efficiency and costs of feature selection? To address the question, we develop a single-agent reinforced feature selection approach integrated with restructured choice strategy. Specifically, the restructured choice strategy includes: 1) we exploit only one single agent to handle the selection task of multiple features, instead of using multiple agents. 2) we develop a scanning method to empower the single agent to make multiple selection/deselection decisions in each round of scanning. 3) we exploit the relevance to predictive labels of features to prioritize the scanning orders of the agent for multiple features. 4) we propose a convolutional auto-encoder algorithm, integrated with the encoded index information of features, to improve state representation. 5) we design a reward scheme that take into account both prediction accuracy and feature redundancy to facilitate the exploration process. Finally, we present extensive experimental results to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

Feature selection is a fundamental intelligence for machine learning and predictive analysis. After exploring many feature selection methods, we observe a computational dilemma: 1) traditional feature selection methods (e.g., mRMR) are mostly efficient, but difficult to identify the best subset; 2) the emerging reinforced feature selection methods automatically navigate feature space to explore the best subset, but are usually inefficient. Are automation and efficiency always apart from each other? Can we bridge the gap between effectiveness and efficiency under automation? Motivated by such a computational dilemma, this study is to develop a novel feature space navigation method. To that end, we propose an Interactive Reinforced Feature Selection (IRFS) framework that guides agents by not just self-exploration experience, but also diverse external skilled trainers to accelerate learning for feature exploration. Specifically, we formulate the feature selection problem into an interactive reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, we first model two trainers skilled at different searching strategies: (1) KBest based trainer; (2) Decision Tree based trainer. We then develop two strategies: (1) to identify assertive and hesitant agents to diversify agent training, and (2) to enable the two trainers to take the teaching role in different stages to fuse the experiences of the trainers and diversify teaching process. Such a hybrid teaching strategy can help agents to learn broader knowledge, and, thereafter, be more effective. Finally, we present extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the improved performances of our method: more efficient than existing reinforced selection and more effective than classic selection."}}

Effective feature selection could help reduce dimensionality, improve prediction accuracy and increase result comprehensibility. It is very challenging to find the optimal feature subset from the subset space as the space could be very large. While much effort has been made by existing studies, reinforcement learning can provide a new perspective for the searching strategy in a more global way. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for the feature selection problem. Specifically, we first reformulate feature selection with a reinforcement learning framework by regarding each feature as an agent. Then, we obtain the state of environment in three ways, i.e., statistic description, autoencoder and graph convolutional network (GCN), in order to make the algorithm better understand the learning progress. We show how to learn the state representation in a graph-based way, which could tackle the case when not only the edges, but also the nodes are changing step by step. In addition, we study how the coordination between different features would be improved by more reasonable reward scheme. The proposed method could search the feature subset space globally and could be easily adapted to the real-time case (real-time feature selection) due to the nature of reinforcement learning. Also, we provide an efficient strategy to accelerate the convergence of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Finally, extensive experimental results show the significant improvement of the proposed method over conventional approaches."}}
