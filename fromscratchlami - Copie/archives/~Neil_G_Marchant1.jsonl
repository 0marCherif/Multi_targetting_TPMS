In this paper, we propose a Bayesian graphical approach for entity resolution that links records to latent entities, where the prior representation on the linkage structure is exchangeable. First, we adopt a flexible and tractable set of priors for the linkage structure, which corresponds to a special class of random partition models. Second, we propose a more realistic distortion model for categorical/discrete record attributes, which corrects a logical inconsistency with the standard hit-miss model. Third, we incorporate hyperpriors to improve flexibility. Fourth, we employ a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler for inferential speedups. Using a selection of private and nonprivate data sets, we investigate the impact of our modeling contributions and compare our model with two alternative Bayesian models. In addition, we conduct a simulation study for household survey data, where we vary distortion, duplication rates and data set size. We find that our model performs more consistently than the alternatives across a variety of scenarios and typically achieves the highest entity resolution accuracy (F1 score). Open source software is available for our proposed methodology, and we provide a discussion regarding our work and future directions."}}

A large body of work studies certified defenses in computer vision, where $\\ell_p$ norm-bounded evasion attacks are adopted as a tractable threat model. However, this threat model has known limitations in vision, and is not applicable to other domains -- e.g., where inputs may be discrete or subject to complex constraints. Motivated by this gap, we study certified defenses for malware detection, a domain where attacks against ML-based systems are a real and current threat. We consider static malware detection systems that operate on byte-level data. Our certified defense is based on the approach of randomized smoothing which we adapt by: (1) replacing the standard Gaussian randomization scheme with a novel deletion randomization scheme that operates on bytes or chunks of an executable; and (2) deriving a certificate that measures robustness to evasion attacks in terms of generalized edit distance. To assess the size of robustness certificates that are achievable while maintaining high accuracy, we conduct experiments on malware datasets using a popular convolutional malware detection model, MalConv. We are able to accurately classify 91% of the inputs while being certifiably robust to any adversarial perturbations of edit distance 128 bytes or less. By comparison, an existing certification of up to 128 bytes of substitutions (without insertions or deletions) achieves an accuracy of 78%. In addition, given that robustness certificates are conservative, we evaluate practical robustness to several recently published evasion attacks and, in some cases, find robustness beyond certified guarantees."}}
