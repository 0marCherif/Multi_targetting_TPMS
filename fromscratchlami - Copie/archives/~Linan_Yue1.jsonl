Although existing methods have achieved promising results, they still suffer from adopting the spurious correlations in data (aka., shortcuts) to compose rationales and make predictions. Inspired by the causal theory, in this paper, we develop an interventional rationalization (Inter-RAT) to discover the causal rationales. Specifically, we first analyse the causalities among the input, rationales and results with a structural causal model. Then, we discover spurious correlations between input and rationales, and between rationales and results, respectively, by identifying the confounder in the causalities. Next, based on the backdoor adjustment, we propose a causal intervention method to remove the spurious correlations in input and rationales. Further, we discuss reasons why spurious correlations between the selected rationales and results exist by analysing the limitations of the sparsity constraint in the rationalization, and employ the causal intervention method to remove these correlations. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n"}}

Existing studies mainly focus on making judgment predictions only on a certain civil cause (e.g., the divorce dispute) by utilizing the fact descriptions and pleas of the plaintiff, which still suffer from the various causes and complicated legal essential elements in the real court. Thus, in this paper, we formalize CCJP as a multi-task learning problem and propose a CCJP method centering on the trial mode of essential elements, CPEE, which explores the practical judicial process and analyzes comprehensive legal essential elements to make judgment predictions. Specifically, we first construct three tasks (i.e., the predictions on the civil causes, law articles, and the final judgment on each plea) necessary for CCJP, that follow the judgment process and exploit the results of intermediate subtasks to make judgment predictions. Then we design a logic-enhanced network to predict the results of three tasks and conduct a comprehensive study of civil cases. Finally, owing to the interlinked and dependent relationships among each task, we adopt the cause prediction result to help predict law articles and incorporate them into final judgment prediction through a gate mechanism. Furthermore, since the existing dataset fails to provide sufficient case information, we construct a real-world CCJP dataset that contains various causes and comprehensive legal elements. Extensive experimental results on the dataset validate the effectiveness of our method."}}

Most existing studies have analyzed and modeled criminal cases as a whole, while a small part of the research focuses on civil cases which are also significant in the legal system. In these studies, most model on a certain type of civil causes and make the judgment prediction based on the ascertained fact from the perspective of the court. However, in real-world scenarios, there are different civil cases on various causes, and every case is judged from multiple perspectives (i.e., plaintiff, defendant, and the court). It is difficult to make judgment predictions on various civil causes. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Civil Case Judgment (CCJudge) prediction method by simulating the logic of judges. Following this logic, we construct an external knowledge base that contains the explanations and applications of every cause, it helps make the judgment on various causes. Furthermore, a special encoder layer and interaction layer are designed for learning linguistic semantics from multiple perspectives. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}}

However, proficiency assessment for lawyers is very challenging due to many technical and domain challenges, such as the lack of unified evaluation standards, and the complex interactions between lawyers and cases in real legal systems. To this end, we propose a novel proficiency assessment network for trial lawyers (LawyerPAN) to quantify lawyer proficiency through online litigation records. Specifically, we first leverage the theories in psychological measurement for mapping the proficiency of lawyers in each field into a unified real number space. Meanwhile, the characteristics of cases (i.e., case difficulty and discrimination) are well modeled to ensure fairness when assessing lawyers in different cases and fields. Then, we model the interactions between lawyers and cases from two perspectives: the anticipatory perspective aims to measure the personal proficiency of anticipated strategy, and the adversarial perspective seeks to depict the gap of lawyers' proficiency between both sides (i.e., plaintiffs and defendants). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world data, and the results show the effectiveness and interpretability of our approaches on assessing the proficiency of trial lawyers."}}

Existing studies mainly focus on the impact of the entire fact description on all subtasks.

To this end, in this paper, we propose a circumstance-aware legal judgment prediction framework (i.e., NeurJudge) by exploring circumstances of crime. Specifically, NeurJudge utilizes the results of intermediate subtasks to separate the fact description into different circumstances and exploits them to make the predictions of other subtasks. In addition, considering the popularity of confusing verdicts (i.e., charges and law articles), we further extend NeurJudge to a more comprehensive framework which is denoted by NeurJudge+. Particularly, NeurJudge+ utilizes a label embedding method to incorporate the semantics of labels (i.e., charges and law articles) into facts to generate more expressive fact representations for confusing verdicts problems. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks."}}

The court view could be seen as the summary of crime circumstances in a case, including ADjudging Circumstance (ADC) and SEntencing Circumstance (SEC). However, different circumstances vary widely, and adopting them to generate court views directly may limit the generation performance. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the ADC and SEC related sentences in case facts and enhance them into the court view generation, respectively. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Circumstances enhanced Criminal Court View Generation (C3VG) method, consisting of the extraction and generation stage. Specifically, in the extraction stage, we design a Circumstances Selector to select ADC and SEC related sentences. After that, we apply them to two generators to generate the circumstances enhanced court views, respectively. After merging the two types of court views, we could obtain the final court views. We evaluate C3VG by conducting extensive experiments on a real-world dataset and experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed model."}}
