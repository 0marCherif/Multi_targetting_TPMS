Here, a multi-wise comparison takes $m$ items as input and returns a (noisy) result about the best item (the winner feedback) or the order of these items (the full-ranking feedback). We consider two basic ranking problems: top-$k$ items selection and full ranking. Unlike previous works that study ranking from multi-wise comparisons, in this paper, we do not require any parametric model or assumption and work on the fundamental setting where each comparison returns the correct result with probability $1$ or a certain probability larger than $\\frac{1}{2}$. This paper helps understand whether and to what degree utilizing multi-wise comparisons can reduce the sample complexity for the ranking problems compared to ranking from pairwise comparisons. Specifically, under the winner feedback setting, one can reduce the sample complexity for top-$k$ selection up to an $m$ factor and that for full ranking up to a $\\log{m}$ factor. Under the full-ranking feedback setting, one can reduce the sample complexity for top-$k$ selection up to an $m$ factor and that for full ranking up to an $m\\log{m}$ factor. We also conduct numerical simulations to confirm our theoretical results. "}}

In a BwK instance, there are a set of $n$ arms and $d$ types of resources with limited budgets. Each pull of an arm returns a noisy reward and consumes some amount of resources in each type according to some latent distribution of this arm. The decision-maker adaptively pulls arms in order to maximize the accumulated reward gained before some type of resources runs out. We investigate logarithmic distribution-dependent regrets for the BwK problem, specifically for the instances with deterministic costs. We propose a new algorithm with regret in the form of $O(n\\log{T}/\\Delta)$ ($\\Delta$ is the gap of rewards similar to that in standard MAB), which to our knowledge, is of the lowest order till now, and has the same order as the standard MAB problem when $d=1$. Simulation results also suggest the performance improvements using our algorithms. "}}

Here, a multi-wise comparison involves $m$ items and returns a (noisy) result about the best item (the winner feedback) or the order of these $m$ items (full-ranking feedback). We consider two basic ranking problems: total ranking and top-$k$ items selection. Unlike previous works that mainly focus on parametric models, in this paper, we do not require such parametric assumptions and work on the fundamental setting where each comparison returns the correct result with a certain probability larger than $1/2$. Our studies help understand whether and to what degree utilizing multi-wise comparisons can reduce the number of comparisons required for finding the ranking or partial rankings. To be specific, under the winner feedback model, one can reduce the sample complexity for top-$k$ selection up to an $m$ factor and that for full ranking up to an $\\log{m}$ factor. Under the full-ranking feedback model, one can reduce the sample complexity for top-$k$ selection up to an $m$ factor and that for full ranking up to an $m\\log{m}$ factor. For some cases, we prove new lower bounds to show that using multi-wise comparisons cannot reduce the sample complexity compared to that using pairwise comparisons. We also conduct simulations for the proposed algorithms and the numerical results show consistency with our theoretical results. "}}

We prove lower bounds for the four variants (finite or infinite arms, and known or unknown threshold), and propose algorithms for each. Two of these algorithms are shown to be sample complexity optimal (up to constant factors) and the other two are optimal up to a log factor. Results in this paper provide up to \u03c1n/k reductions compared with the \u201ck-exploration\u201d algorithms that focus on finding the (PAC) best k arms out of n arms.

A comparison over a set of $m$ items produces a noisy outcome about the most preferred item, and reveals some information about the ranking. By repeatedly and adaptively choosing items to compare, we want to fully rank the items with a certain confidence, and use as few comparisons as possible. Different from most previous works, in this paper, we have three main novelties: (i) compared to prior works, our upper bounds (algorithms) and lower bounds on the sample complexity (aka number of comparisons) require the minimal assumptions on the instances, and are not restricted to specific models; (ii) we give lower bounds and upper bounds on instances with unequal noise levels; and (iii) this paper aims at the exact ranking without any knowledge on the instances, while most of the previous works either require prior knowledge or focus on approximate rankings. We first derive lower bounds for pairwise ranking (i.e., compare two items each time ), and then propose (nearly) optimal pairwise ranking algorithms. We further make extensions to listwise ranking (i.e., comparing multiple items each time). Numerical results also show our ranking algorithm outperforms the state of the art."}}
