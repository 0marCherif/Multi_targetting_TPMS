In brief, on the one hand, due to the poor recognizability and viewpoint differences between images, it is inevitable to inaccurately annotate some keypoints with offset and confusion, leading to the mismatch between two associated nodes, i.e., NNC. On the other hand, the noisy node-to-node correspondence will further contaminate the edge-to-edge correspondence, thus leading to ENC. For the BNC challenge, we propose a novel method termed Contrastive Matching with Momentum Distillation. Specifically, the proposed method is with a robust quadratic contrastive loss which enjoys the following merits: i) better exploring the node-to-node and edge-to-edge correlations through a GM customized quadratic contrastive learning paradigm; ii) adaptively penalizing the noisy assignments based on the confidence estimated by the momentum teacher. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the robustness of our model compared with 12 competitive baselines."}}

To this end, we propose a novel objective that incorporates representation learning and data recovery into a unified framework from the view of information theory. To be specific, the informative and consistent representation is learned by maximizing the mutual information across different views through contrastive learning, and the missing views are recovered by minimizing the conditional entropy of different views through dual prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this could be the first work to provide a theoretical framework that unifies the consistent representation learning and cross-view data recovery. Extensive experimental results show the proposed method remarkably outperforms 10 competitive multi-view clustering methods on four challenging datasets.
