From ancient times, humans have used stories for several objectives including entertainment, advertisement, and education. Various analyses have been conducted by researchers and creators to determine the way of producing good stories. The deep relationship between stories and emotions is a prime example. With the advancement in deep learning technology, computers are expected to understand and generate stories. This survey paper is intended to summarize and further contribute to the development of research being conducted on the relationship between stories and emotions. We believe creativity research is not to replace humans with computers, but to find a way of collaboration between humans and computers to enhance the creativity. With the intention of creating a new intersection between computational storytelling research and human creative writing, we introduced creative techniques used by professional storytellers."}}

Previous studies on multiclass LLP can be divided into two categories according to the learning task: per-instance label classification and per-bag label proportion estimation. However, these methods often results in high variance estimates of the risk when applied to complex models, or lack statistical learning theory arguments. To address this issue, we propose new learning methods based on statistical learning theory for both per-instance and per-bag policies. We demonstrate that the proposed methods are respectively risk-consistent and classifier-consistent in an instance-wise manner, and analyze the estimation error bounds. Additionally, we present a heuristic approximation method that utilizes an existing method for regressing label proportions to reduce the computational complexity of the proposed methods. Through benchmark experiments, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods."}}

Complementing the omitted information using a computer is helpful in providing writing support. Recently, in the field of story understanding and generation, story completion (SC) was proposed to generate the missing parts of an incomplete story. Although its applicability is limited because it requires that the user have prior knowledge of the missing part of a story, missing position prediction (MPP) can be used to compensate for this problem. MPP aims to predict the position of the missing part, but the prerequisite knowledge that \"one sentence is missing\" is still required. In this study, we propose Variable Number MPP (VN-MPP), a new MPP task that removes this restriction; that is, the task to predict multiple missing sentences or to judge whether there are no missing sentences in the first place. We also propose two methods for this new MPP task. Furthermore, based on the novel task and methods, we developed a creative writing support system, COMPASS. The results of a user experiment involving professional creators who write texts in Japanese confirm the efficacy and utility of the developed system."}}

In this paper, we propose PPD (unsupervised Pose-aware Part Decomposition) to address a novel setting that explicitly targets man-made articulated objects with mechanical joints, considering the part poses in part parsing. As an analysis-by-synthesis approach, We show that category-common prior learning for both part shapes and poses facilitates the unsupervised learning of (1) part parsing with abstracted part shapes, and (2) part poses as joint parameters under single-frame shape supervision. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real datasets, and we show that it outperforms previous works in consistent part parsing of the articulated objects based on comparable part pose estimation performance to the supervised baseline."}}

Therefore, SNNs are expected to have various applications, including as generative models being running on edge devices to create high-quality images. In this study, we build a variational autoencoder (VAE) with SNN to enable image generation. VAE is known for its stability among generative models; recently, its quality advanced. In vanilla VAE, the latent space is represented as a normal distribution, and floating-point calculations are required in sampling. However, this is not possible in SNNs because all features must be binary time series data. Therefore, we constructed the latent space with an autoregressive SNN model, and randomly selected samples from its output to sample the latent variables. This allows the latent variables to follow the Bernoulli process and allows variational learning. Thus, we build the Fully Spiking Variational Autoencoder where all modules are constructed with SNN. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to build a VAE only with SNN layers. We experimented with several datasets, and confirmed that it can generate images with the same or better quality compared to conventional ANNs. The code is available at https://github.com/kamata1729/FullySpikingVAE."}}
