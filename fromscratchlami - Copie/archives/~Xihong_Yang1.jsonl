However, we observe that two drawbacks of the positive and negative sample construction mechanisms limit the performance of existing algorithms from further improvement. 1) The quality of positive samples heavily depends on the carefully designed data augmentations, while inappropriate data augmentations would easily lead to the semantic drift and indiscriminative positive samples. 2) The constructed negative samples are not reliable for ignoring important clustering information. To solve these problems, we propose a Cluster-guided Contrastive deep Graph Clustering network (CCGC) by mining the intrinsic supervision information in the high-confidence clustering results. Specifically, instead of conducting complex node or edge perturbation, we construct two views of the graph by designing special Siamese encoders whose weights are not shared between the sibling sub-networks. Then, guided by the high-confidence clustering information, we carefully select and construct the positive samples from the same high-confidence cluster in two views. Moreover, to construct semantic meaningful negative sample pairs, we regard the centers of different high-confidence clusters as negative samples, thus improving the discriminative capability and reliability of the constructed sample pairs. Lastly, we design an objective function to pull close the samples from the same cluster while pushing away those from other clusters by maximizing and minimizing the cross-view cosine similarity between positive and negative samples. Extensive experimental results on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CCGC compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms."}}

Unlike the static graph, a temporal graph is usually organized in the form of node interaction sequences over continuous time instead of an adjacency matrix. Most temporal graph learning methods model current interactions by combining historical information over time. However, such methods merely consider the first-order temporal information while ignoring the important high-order structural information, leading to sub-optimal performance. To solve this issue, by extracting both temporal and structural information to learn more informative node representations, we propose a self-supervised method termed S2T for temporal graph learning. Note that the first-order temporal information and the high-order structural information are combined in different ways by the initial node representations to calculate two conditional intensities, respectively. Then the alignment loss is introduced to optimize the node representations to be more informative by narrowing the gap between the two intensities. Concretely, besides modeling temporal information using historical neighbor sequences, we further consider the structural information from both local and global levels. At the local level, we generate structural intensity by aggregating features from the high-order neighbor sequences. At the global level, a global representation is generated based on all nodes to adjust the structural intensity according to the active statuses on different nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method S2T achieves at most 10.13% performance improvement compared with the state-of-the-art competitors on several datasets."}}

The pre-training of previous methods needs to manually construct the meta-relation set, leading to numerous labor costs. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is treated as a solution to tackle the issue, but still at an early stage for FS-KGR task. Moreover, most of the existing methods ignore leveraging the beneficial information from aliasing relations (AR), i.e., data-rich relations with similar contextual semantics to the target data-poor relation. Therefore, we proposed a novel Self-Supervised Learning model by leveraging Aliasing Relations to assist FS-KGR, termed SARF. Concretely, four main components are designed in our model, i.e., SSL reasoning module, AR-assisted mechanism, fusion module, and scoring function. We first generate the representation of the co-occurrence patterns in a generative manner. Meanwhile, the representations of aliasing relations are learned to enhance reasoning in the AR-assist mechanism. Besides, multiple strategies, i.e., simple summation and learnable fusion, are offered for representation fusion. Finally, the generated representation is used for scoring. Extensive experiments on three few-shot benchmarks demonstrate that SARF achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other methods in most cases."}}

Recently we witness a strong tendency of combining autoencoder and graph neural networks to exploit structure information for clustering performance enhancement. However, we observe that existing literature 1) lacks a dynamic fusion mechanism to selectively integrate and refine the information of graph structure and node attributes for consensus representation learning; 2) fails to extract information from both sides for robust target distribution (i.e., \u201cgroundtruth\u201d soft labels) generation. To tackle the above issues, we propose a Deep Fusion Clustering Network (DFCN). Specifically, in our network, an interdependency learning-based Structure and Attribute Information Fusion (SAIF) module is proposed to explicitly merge the representations learned by an autoencoder and a graph autoencoder for consensus representation learning. Also, a reliable target distribution generation measure and a triplet self-supervision strategy, which facilitate cross-modality information exploitation, are designed for network training. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets have demonstrated that the proposed DFCN consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art deep clustering methods."}}

The existing methods first generate the graph views with stochastic augmentations and then train the network with a cross-view consistency principle. Although good performance has been achieved, we observe that the existing augmentation methods are usually random and rely on pre-defined augmentations, which is insufficient and lacks negotiation between the final clustering task. To solve the problem, we propose a novel Graph Contrastive Clustering method with the Learnable graph Data Augmentation (GCC-LDA), which is optimized completely by the neural networks. An adversarial learning mechanism is designed to keep cross-view consistency in the latent space while ensuring the diversity of augmented views. In our framework, a structure augmentor and an attribute augmentor are constructed for augmentation learning in both structure level and attribute level. To improve the reliability of the learned affinity matrix, clustering is introduced to the learning procedure and the learned affinity matrix is refined with both the high-confidence pseudo-label matrix and the cross-view sample similarity matrix. During the training procedure, to provide persistent optimization for the learned view, we design a two-stage training strategy to obtain more reliable clustering information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GCC-LDA on six benchmark datasets."}}

Among the recent works, hard sample mining-based algorithms have achieved great attention for their promising performance. However, we find that the existing hard sample mining methods have two problems as follows. 1) In the hardness measurement, the important structural information is overlooked for similarity calculation, degrading the representativeness of the selected hard negative samples. 2) Previous works merely focus on the hard negative sample pairs while neglecting the hard positive sample pairs. Nevertheless, samples within the same cluster but with low similarity should also be carefully learned. To solve the problems, we propose a novel contrastive deep graph clustering method dubbed Hard Sample Aware Network (HSAN) by introducing a comprehensive similarity measure criterion and a general dynamic sample weighing strategy. Concretely, in our algorithm, the similarities between samples are calculated by considering both the attribute embeddings and the structure embeddings, better revealing sample relationships and assisting hardness measurement. Moreover, under the guidance of the carefully collected high-confidence clustering information, our proposed weight modulating function will first recognize the positive and negative samples and then dynamically up-weight the hard sample pairs while down-weighting the easy ones. In this way, our method can mine not only the hard negative samples but also the hard positive sample, thus improving the discriminative capability of the samples further. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed method."}}

However, we observed that the existing methods suffer from the representation collapse problem and easily tend to encode samples with different classes into the same latent embedding. Consequently, the discriminative capability of nodes is limited, resulting in sub-optimal clustering performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel deep graph clustering algorithm termed Improved Dual Correlation Reduction Network (IDCRN) through improving the discriminative capability of samples. Specifically, by approximating the cross-view feature correlation matrix to an identity matrix, we reduce the redundancy between different dimensions of features, thus improving the discriminative capability of the latent space explicitly. Meanwhile, the cross-view sample correlation matrix is forced to approximate the designed clustering-refined adjacency matrix to guide the learned latent representation to recover the affinity matrix even across views, thus enhancing the discriminative capability of features implicitly. Moreover, we avoid the collapsed representation caused by the over-smoothing issue in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) through an introduced propagation regularization term, enabling IDCRN to capture the long-range information with the shallow network structure. Extensive experimental results on six benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness and the efficiency of IDCRN compared to the existing state-of-the-art deep graph clustering algorithms."}}

In recent years, deep graph clustering methods have been increasingly proposed and achieved promising performance. However, the corresponding survey paper is scarce and it is imminent to make a summary in this field. From this motivation, this paper makes the first comprehensive survey of deep graph clustering. Firstly, the detailed definition of deep graph clustering and the important baseline methods are introduced. Besides, the taxonomy of deep graph clustering methods is proposed based on four different criteria including graph type, network architecture, learning paradigm, and clustering method. In addition, through the careful analysis of the existing works, the challenges and opportunities from five perspectives are summarized. At last, the applications of deep graph clustering in four domains are presented. It is worth mentioning that a collection of state-of-the-art deep graph clustering methods including papers, codes, and datasets is available on GitHub.

In the existing literature, consistency regularization-based methods, which force the perturbed samples to have similar predictions with the original ones have attracted much attention for their promising accuracy. However, we observe that, the performance of such methods decreases drastically when the labels get extremely limited, e.g., 2 or 3 labels for each category. Our empirical study finds that the main problem lies with the drifting of semantic information in the procedure of data augmentation. The problem can be alleviated when enough supervision is provided. However, when little guidance is available, the incorrect regularization would mislead the network and undermine the performance of the algorithm. To tackle the problem, we (1) propose an interpolation-based method to construct more reliable positive sample pairs; (2) design a novel contrastive loss to guide the embedding of the learned network to change linearly between samples so as to improve the discriminative capability of the network by enlarging the margin decision boundaries. Since no destructive regularization is introduced, the performance of our proposed algorithm is largely improved. Specifically, the proposed algorithm outperforms the second best algorithm (Comatch) with 5.3% by achieving 88.73% classification accuracy when only two labels are available for each class on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Moreover, we further prove the generality of the proposed method by improving the performance of the existing state-of-the-art algorithms considerably with our proposed strategy."}}
