We present RelRoll, a mechanism allowing non-experts to give reliable ratings, with a case study on speech emotion.\nIt includes two main features: a relative labeling interface highlighting emotion-changing sentences and an approach to estimating absolute labels from relative labels. Highlighting can help non-experts focus on sentences needing their actions. Given new sentences, we utilize a network to predict emotion-changing sentences and highlight them on the interface, which is trained on training set labeled by experts\u2019 absolute annotations. Non-experts will give relative labels to new sentences through our interface. We estimate the absolute labels of new sentences by combining the network output and relative labels. We ran a user study to compare the proposed interface to the commonly used absolute interface. Results showed that \\textit{RelRoll} could improve the annotation agreement and the absolute label annotation accuracy. We discussed the user experience enhancement on helpfulness, intuitiveness, and easiness."}}
