In this paper, we present a novel approach to assessing the economic impact with a large-scale credit card transaction dataset at a fine granularity. For this purpose, we develop a fine-grained economic-epidemiological modeling framework COVID-EENet, which is featured with a two-level deep neural network. In support of the fine-grained EEM, COVID-EENet learns the impact of nearby mass infection cases on the changes of local economies in each district. Through the experiments using the nationwide dataset, given a set of active mass infection cases, COVID-EENet is shown to precisely predict the sales changes in two or four weeks for each district and business category. Therefore, policymakers can be informed of the predictive impact to put in the most effective mitigation measures. Overall, we believe that our work opens a new perspective of using financial data to recover from the economic crisis. For public use in this urgent problem, we release the source code at https://github.com/kaist-dmlab/COVID-EENet."}}

However, little attention was paid to GNN's vulnerability to exposure bias: users are exposed to a limited number of items so that a system only learns a biased view of user preference to result in suboptimal recommendation quality. Although inverse propensity weighting is known to recognize and alleviate exposure bias, it usually works on the final objective with the model outputs, whereas GNN can also be biased during neighbor aggregation. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective approach, neighbor aggregation via inverse propensity (NAVIP) for GNNs. Specifically, given a user-item bipartite graph, we first derive propensity score of each user-item interaction in the graph. Then, inverse of the propensity score with Laplacian normalization is applied to debias neighbor aggregation from exposure bias. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through our extensive experiments on two public and Amazon Alexa datasets where the performance enhances up to 14.2%."}}

Since user interest usually evolves over time, the update strategy should be flexible to quickly catch users' current interest from continuously generated new user-item interactions. Existing update strategies focus either on the importance of each user-item interaction or the learning rate for each recommender parameter, but such one-directional flexibility is insufficient to adapt to varying relationships between interactions and parameters. In this paper, we propose MeLON, a meta-learning based novel online recommender update strategy that supports two-directional flexibility. It is featured with an adaptive learning rate for each parameter-interaction pair for inducing a recommender to quickly learn users' up-to-date interest. The procedure of MeLON is optimized following a meta-learning approach: it learns how a recommender learns to generate the optimal learning rates for future updates. Specifically, MeLON first enriches the meaning of each interaction based on previous interactions and identifies the role of each parameter for the interaction; and then combines these two pieces of information to generate an adaptive learning rate. Theoretical analysis and extensive evaluation on three real-world online recommender datasets validate the effectiveness of MeLON."}}

In this paper, we propose Taufe, a novel regularizer that deactivates many undesirable features using OOD examples in the feature extraction layer and thus removes the dependency on the task-specific softmax layer. To show the task-agnostic nature of Taufe, we rigorously validate its performance on three tasks, classification, regression, and a mix of them, on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, CUB200, and CAR datasets.

The user check-in history used as the input to POI recommendation is very imbalanced and noisy because of sparse and missing check-ins. Although sample reweighting is commonly adopted for addressing this challenge with the input data, its fixed weighting scheme is often inappropriate to deal with different characteristics of users or POIs. Thus, in this paper, we propose PREMERE, an adaptive weighting scheme based on meta-learning. Because meta-data is typically required by meta-learning but is inherently hard to obtain in POI recommendation, we self-generate the meta-data via self-ensembling. Furthermore, the meta-model architecture is extended to deal with the scarcity of check-ins. Thorough experiments show that replacing a weighting scheme with PREMERE boosts the performance of the state-of-the-art recommender algorithms by 2.36\u201326.9% on three benchmark datasets."}}

It is known that the network typically begins to rapidly memorize false-labeled samples after a certain point of training. Thus, to counter the label noise challenge, we propose a novel self-transitional learning method called MORPH, which automatically switches its learning phase at the transition point from seeding to evolution. In the seeding phase, the network is updated using all the samples to collect a seed of clean samples. Then, in the evolution phase, the network is updated using only the set of arguably clean samples, which precisely keeps expanding by the updated network. Thus, MORPH effectively avoids the overfitting to false-labeled samples throughout the entire training period. Extensive experiments using five real-world or synthetic benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and efficiency."}}

Owing to the high contagion rate of the virus, COVID-19 cases continue to increase globally. To further suppress the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic and minimize its damage, it is imperative that each country monitors inbound travelers. Moreover, given that resources for quarantine are often limited, they must be carefully allocated. In this paper, to aid in such allocation by predicting the number of inbound COVID-19 cases, we propose Hi-COVIDNet, which takes advantage of the geographic hierarchy. Hi-COVIDNet is based on a neural network with two-level components, namely, country-level and continent-level encoders, which understand the complex relationships among foreign countries and derive their respective contagion risk to the destination country. An in-depth case study in South Korea with real-world COVID-19 datasets confirmed the effectiveness and practicality of Hi-COVIDNet."}}
