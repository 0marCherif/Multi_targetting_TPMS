At the heart of this revolutionary technology are quantum circuits, which serve as vital tools for implementing, analyzing, and optimizing quantum algorithms. Recent advancements in quantum computing and the increasing capability of quantum devices have led to the development of more complex quantum circuits. However, traditional quantum circuit diagrams suffer from scalability and readability issues, which limit the efficiency of analysis and optimization processes. In this research, we propose a novel visualization approach for large-scale quantum circuits by adopting semantic analysis to facilitate the comprehension of quantum circuits. We first exploit meta-data and semantic information extracted from the underlying code of quantum circuits to create component segmentations and pattern abstractions, allowing for easier wrangling of massive circuit diagrams. We then develop Quantivine, an interactive system for exploring and understanding quantum circuits. A series of novel circuit visualizations are designed to uncover contextual details such as qubit provenance, parallelism, and entanglement. The effectiveness of Quantivine is demonstrated through two usage scenarios of quantum circuits with up to 100 qubits and a formal user evaluation with quantum experts.

However, developing effective prompts for desired images can be challenging due to the complexity and ambiguity of natural language. This research proposes PromptMagician, a visual analysis system that helps users explore the image results and refine the input prompts. The backbone of our system is a prompt recommendation model that takes user prompts as input, retrieves similar prompt-image pairs from DiffusionDB, and identifies special (important and relevant) prompt keywords. To facilitate interactive prompt refinement, PromptMagician introduces a multi-level visualization for the cross-modal embedding of the retrieved images and recommended keywords, and supports users in specifying multiple criteria for personalized exploration. Two usage scenarios, a user study, and expert interviews demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our system, suggesting it facilitates prompt engineering and improves the creativity support of the generative text-to-image model."}}

Although remarkable progress has been made on layout-based image synthesis approaches, existing methods require high-precision inputs such as accurately placed bounding boxes, which might be constantly violated in an interactive setting. When placement of bounding boxes is subject to perturbation, layout-based models suffer from \u201cmissing regions\u201d in the constructed semantic layouts and hence undesirable artifacts in the generated images. In this work, we propose Panoptic Layout Generative Adversarial Network (PLGAN) to address this challenge. The PLGAN employs panoptic theory which distinguishes object categories between \u201cstuff\u201d with amorphous boundaries and \u201cthings\u201d with well-defined shapes, such that stuff and instance layouts are constructed through separate branches and later fused into panoptic layouts. In particular, the stuff layouts can take amorphous shapes and fill up the missing regions left out by the instance layouts. We experimentally compare our PLGAN with state-of-the-art layout-based models on the COCO-Stuff, Visual Genome, and Landscape datasets. The advantages of PLGAN are not only visually demonstrated but quantitatively verified in terms of inception score, Fr\u00e9chet inception distance, classification accuracy score, and coverage. The code is available at https://github.com/wb-finalking/PLGAN."}}

We first precompute a canonical representation for each substructure with node embedding techniques and then use it for on-the-fly substructure retrieval. We design and develop a light-weight interactive system to enable intuitive adjustment, modification transfer, and visual graph exploration. We also report some results of quantitative comparisons, three case studies, and a within-participant user study."}}

(2) A bottleneck value exists, and continuing to optimize ELBO after this value will not improve inference accuracy. On the basis of the experiment results, we propose SHOT-VAE to address these problems without introducing additional prior knowledge. The SHOT-VAE offers two contributions: (1) A new ELBO approximation named smooth-ELBO that integrates the label predictive loss into ELBO. (2) An approximation based on optimal interpolation that breaks the ELBO value bottleneck by reducing the margin between ELBO and the data likelihood. The SHOT-VAE achieves good performance with 25.30% error rate on CIFAR-100 with 10k labels and reduces the error rate to 6.11% on CIFAR-10 with 4k labels."}}

In this paper, we present a new graph layout algorithm, called DRGraph, that enhances the nonlinear dimensionality reduction process with three schemes: approximating graph distances by means of a sparse distance matrix, estimating the gradient by using the negative sampling technique, and accelerating the optimization process through a multi-level layout scheme. DRGraph achieves a linear complexity for the computation and memory consumption, and scales up to large-scale graphs with millions of nodes. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art graph layout methods demonstrate that DRGraph can generate visually comparable layouts with a faster running time and a lower memory requirement."}}

However, the data uncertainty imposes profound challenges to fulfill advanced analytics requirements. On the one hand, many underlying data does not contain accurate geographic coordinates, e.g., positions of a mobile phone only refer to the regions (i.e., mobile cell stations) in which it resides, instead of accurate GPS coordinates. On the other hand, domain experts and general users prefer a natural way, such as using a natural language sentence, to access and analyze massive movement data. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach that can extract spatial-temporal constraints from a textual sentence and support an effective query method over uncertain mobile trajectory data. It is built up on encoding massive, spatially uncertain trajectories by the semantic information of the POIs and regions covered by them, and then storing the trajectory documents in text database with an effective indexing scheme. The visual interface facilitates query condition specification, situation-aware visualization, and semantic exploration of large trajectory data. Usage scenarios on real-world human mobility datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}}

Recently, image enhancement approaches have yielded impressive progress. However, existing methods still suffer from three main problems: (1) low-light images usually are high-contrast. Existing methods may fail to recover images details in extremely dark or bright areas; (2) current methods cannot precisely correct the color of low-light images; (3) when the object edges are unclear, the pixel-wise loss may treat pixels of different objects equally and produce blurry images. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method called Edge-Enhanced Multi-Exposure Fusion Network (EEMEFN) to enhance extremely low-light images. In the first stage, we employ a multi-exposure fusion module to address the high contrast and color bias issues. We synthesize a set of images with different exposure time from a single image and construct an accurate normal-light image by combining well-exposed areas under different illumination conditions. Thus, it can produce realistic initial images with correct color from extremely noisy and low-light images. Secondly, we introduce an edge enhancement module to refine the initial images with the help of the edge information. Therefore, our method can reconstruct high-quality images with sharp edges when minimizing the pixel-wise loss. Experiments on the See-in-the-Dark dataset indicate that our EEMEFN approach achieves state-of-the-art performance."}}

These structures, defined as high-dimensional mobility structures (HMSs), contain spatiotemporal information and are simultaneously influenced by the geographical distributions and daily activities of citywide crowd. However, few work has been dedicated to depict and analyze these structures, mainly due to the lack of effective models. In this paper, we propose to model the crowd mobility as a dynamical system and characterize the irregular mobility data with a novel local coherence of sparse field (LCSF) algorithm. The proposed algorithm makes it possible to measure the separation behavior of trajectories in an irregular and sparse topology network. Detected HMS, referred as local separation measure of LCSF, divides the geographical urban areas into distinct functional regions over time. We design and implement a visual analytics system to facilitate situation-aware analysis of a huge amount of crowd mobility and their socialized behaviors. Case studies based on a real-world data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}
