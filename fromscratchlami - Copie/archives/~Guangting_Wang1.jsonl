However, is the attention mechanism truly an indispensable part of ViT? Can it be replaced by some other alternatives? To demystify the role of attention mechanism, we simplify it into an extremely simple case: ZERO FLOP and ZERO parameter. Concretely, we revisit the shift operation. It does not contain any parameter or arithmetic calculation. The only operation is to exchange a small portion of the channels between neighboring features. Based on this simple operation, we construct a new backbone network, namely ShiftViT, where the attention layers in ViT are substituted by shift operations. Surprisingly, ShiftViT works quite well in several mainstream tasks, e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation. The performance is on par with or even better than the strong baseline Swin Transformer. These results suggest that the attention mechanism might not be the vital factor that makes ViT successful. It can be even replaced by a zero-parameter operation. We should pay more attentions to the remaining parts of ViT in the future work. Code is available at github.com/microsoft/SPACH."}}

In most tracking paradigms, we find that the features extracted by the popular Siamese-like networks cannot fully discriminatively model the tracked targets and distractor objects, hindering them from simultaneously meeting these two requirements. While most methods focus on designing robust correlation operations, we propose a novel target-dependent feature network inspired by the self-/cross-attention scheme. In contrast to the Siamese-like feature extraction, our network deeply embeds cross-image feature correlation in multiple layers of the feature network. By extensively matching the features of the two images through multiple layers, it is able to suppress non-target features, resulting in instance-varying feature extraction. The output features of the search image can be directly used for predicting target locations without extra correlation step. Moreover, our model can be flexibly pre-trained on abundant unpaired images, leading to notably faster convergence than the existing methods. Extensive experiments show our method achieves the state-of-the-art results while running at real-time. Our feature networks also can be applied to existing tracking pipelines seamlessly to raise the tracking performance. Code will be available."}}

Modelled on the Catch game played by the children, we design a Catch-the-Patch (CtP) game for a 3D-CNN model to learn visual representations that would help with video-related tasks. In the proposed pretraining framework, we cut an image patch from a given video and let it scale and move according to a pre-set trajectory. The proxy task is to estimate the position and size of the image patch in a sequence of video frames, given only the target bounding box in the first frame. We discover that using multiple image patches simultaneously brings clear benefits. We further increase the difficulty of the game by randomly making patches invisible. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of CtP against other video pretraining methods. In addition, CtP-pretrained features are less sensitive to domain gaps than those trained by a supervised action recognition task. When both trained on Kinetics-400, we are pleasantly surprised to find that CtP-pretrained representation achieves much higher action classification accuracy than its fully supervised counterpart on Something-Something dataset."}}

We point out that the ID task has an implicit semantic consistency (SC) assumption, which may not hold in unconstrained datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive mask prediction (CMP) task for visual representation learning and design a mask contrast (MaskCo) framework to implement the idea. MaskCo contrasts region-level features instead of view-level features, which makes it possible to identify the positive sample without any assumptions. To solve the domain gap between masked and unmasked features, we design a dedicated mask prediction head in MaskCo. This module is shown to be the key to the success of the CMP. We evaluated MaskCo on training datasets beyond ImageNet and compare its performance with MoCo V2 [4]. Results show that MaskCo achieves comparable performance with MoCo V2 using ImageNet training dataset, but demonstrates a stronger performance across a range of downstream tasks when COCO or Conceptual Captions are used for training. MaskCo provides a promising alternative to the ID-based methods for self-supervised learning in the wild."}}

With proper initialization, a detector can be quickly converted into a tracker by learning the new instance from a single image. We find that model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) offers a strategy to initialize the detector that satisfies our needs. We propose a principled three-step approach to build a high-performance tracker. First, pick any modern object detector trained with gradient descent. Second, conduct offline training (or initialization) with MAML. Third, perform domain adaptation using the initial frame. We follow this procedure to build two trackers, named Retina-MAML and FCOS-MAML, based on two modern detectors RetinaNet and FCOS. Evaluations on four benchmarks show that both trackers are competitive against state-of-the-art trackers. On OTB-100, Retina-MAML achieves the highest ever AUC of 0.712. On TrackingNet, FCOS-MAML ranks the first on the leader board with an AUC of 0.757 and the normalized precision of 0.822. Both trackers run in real-time at 40 FPS."}}

In this paper, we propose a SiamFC-based tracker, named SPM-Tracker, to tackle this challenge. The basic idea is to address the two requirements in two separate matching stages. Robustness is strengthened in the coarse matching (CM) stage through generalized training while discrimination power is enhanced in the fine matching (FM) stage through a distance learning network. The two stages are connected in series as the input proposals of the FM stage are generated by the CM stage. They are also connected in parallel as the matching scores and box location refinements are fused to generate the final results. This innovative series-parallel structure takes advantage of both stages and results in superior performance. The proposed SPM-Tracker, running at 120fps on GPU, achieves an AUC of 0.687 on OTB-100 and an EAO of 0.434 on VOT-16, exceeding other real-time trackers by a notable margin."}}
