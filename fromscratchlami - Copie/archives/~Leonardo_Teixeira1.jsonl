We introduce a neural-network based lifetime clustering model that can find cluster assignments by directly maximizing the divergence between the empirical lifetime distributions of the clusters. Accordingly, we define a novel clustering loss function over the lifetime distributions (of entire clusters) based on a tight upper bound of the two-sample Kuiper test p-value. The resultant model is robust to the modeling issues associated with the unobservability of termination signals, and does not assume proportional hazards. Our results in real and synthetic datasets show significantly better lifetime clusters (as evaluated by C-index, Brier Score, Logrank score and adjusted Rand index) as compared to competing approaches."}}

However, accuracy alone is not enough for high-stakes decision making. Decision makers want to know the likelihood that a specific GNN prediction is correct. For this purpose, obtaining calibrated models is essential. In this work, we perform an empirical evaluation of the calibration of state-of-the-art GNNs on multiple datasets. Our experiments show that GNNs can be calibrated in some datasets but also badly miscalibrated in others, and that state-of-the-art calibration methods are helpful but do not fix the problem."}}
