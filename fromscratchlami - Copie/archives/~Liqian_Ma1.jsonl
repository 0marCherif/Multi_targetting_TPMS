Unlike the existing human mesh recovery problem, Cloth2Body needs to address new and emerging challenges raised by the partial observation of the input and the high diversity of the output. Indeed, there are three specific challenges. First, how to locate and pose human bodies into the clothes. Second, how to effectively estimate body shapes out of various clothing types. Finally, how to generate diverse and plausible results from a 2D clothing image. To this end, we propose an end-to-end framework that can accurately estimate 3D body mesh parameterized by pose and shape from a 2D clothing image. Along this line, we first utilize Kinematics-aware Pose Estimation to estimate body pose parameters. 3D skeleton is employed as a proxy followed by an inverse kinematics module to boost the estimation accuracy. We additionally design an adaptive depth trick to align the re-projected 3D mesh better with 2D clothing image by disentangling the effects of object size and camera extrinsic. Next, we propose Physics-informed Shape Estimation to estimate body shape parameters. 3D shape parameters are predicted based on partial body measurements estimated from RGB image, which not only improves pixel-wise human-cloth alignment, but also enables flexible user editing. Finally, we design Evolution-based pose generation method, a skeleton transplanting method inspired by genetic algorithms to generate diverse reasonable poses during inference. As shown by experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance and can effectively recover natural and diverse 3D body meshes from 2D images that align well with clothing."}}

However, 3D-aware synthesis of face dynamics hasn't received much attention. Here, we study how to explicitly control generative model synthesis of face dynamics exhibiting non-rigid motion (e.g., facial expression change), while simultaneously ensuring 3D-awareness. For this we propose a Controllable Radiance Field (CoRF): 1) Motion control is achieved by embedding motion features within the layered latent motion space of a style-based generator; 2) To ensure consistency of background, motion features and subject-specific attributes such as lighting, texture, shapes, albedo, and identity, a face parsing net, a head regressor and an identity encoder are incorporated. On head image/video data we show that CoRFs are 3D-aware while enabling editing of identity, viewing directions, and motion."}}

To achieve this, we utilize the geometric prior of the SMPLX model in the canonical space to learn the implicit representation for geometry reconstruction. Based on the observation that the topology between the posed mesh and the mesh in the canonical space are consistent, we propose to learn latent codes on the posed mesh by leveraging multiple input images and then assign the latent codes to the mesh in the canonical space. Specifically, we first leverage normal and geometry networks to extract the feature vector for each vertex on the SMPLX mesh. Normal maps are adopted for better generalization to unseen images compared to 2D images. Then, features for each vertex on the posed mesh from multiple images are integrated by MLPs. The integrated features acting as the latent code are anchored to the SMPLX mesh in the canonical space. Finally, latent code for each 3D point is extracted and utilized to calculate the SDF. Our work for reconstructing the human shape on canonical pose achieves 3rd performance on WCPA MVP-Human Body Challenge."}}

Previous part-based methods for human reconstruction rely on ground-truth part labels from SMPL and thus are limited to minimal-clothed humans. In contrast, our method learns to separate parts from body motions instead of part supervision, thus can be extended to clothed humans and other articulated objects. Our Partition-from-Motion is achieved by a bone-centered initialization, a bone limit loss, and a section normal loss that ensure stable part division even when the training poses are limited. We also present a minimal perimeter loss for SDF to suppress extra surfaces and part overlapping. Another core of our method is an adjacent part seaming algorithm that produces non-rigid deformations to maintain the connection between parts which significantly relieves the part-based artifacts. Under this algorithm, we further propose \"Competing Parts\", a method that defines blending weights by the relative position of a point to bones instead of the absolute position, avoiding the generalization problem of neural implicit functions with inverse LBS (linear blend skinning). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by clothed human body reconstruction and animation on the CAPE and the ClothSeq datasets."}}

Prior dense pose estimation methods are all based on Mask R-CNN framework and operate in a top-down manner of first attempting to identify a bounding box for each person and matching dense correspondences in each bounding box. Consequently, these methods lack robustness due to their critical dependence on the Mask R-CNN detection, and the runtime increases drastically as the number of persons in the image increases. We therefore propose a novel alternative method for solving the dense pose estimation problem, called Direct Dense Pose (DDP). DDP first predicts the instance mask and global IUV representation separately and then combines them together. We also propose a simple yet effective 2D temporal-smoothing scheme to alleviate the temporal jitters when dealing with video data. Experiments demonstrate that DDP overcomes the limitations of previous top-down baseline methods and achieves competitive accuracy. In addition, DDP is computationally more efficient than previous dense pose estimation methods, and it reduces jitters when applied to a video sequence, which is a problem plaguing the previous methods."}}

It allows them to plan early and decide accordingly. Motivated by this observation, in this letter we utilize information from a video sequence with a narrow field-of-view to infer the scene at a wider field-of-view. To this end, we propose a temporally consistent field-of-view extrapolation framework, namely FoV-Net, that: (1) leverages 3D information to propagate the observed scene parts from past frames; (2) aggregates the propagated multi-frame information using an attention-based feature aggregation module and a gated self-attention module, simultaneously hallucinating any unobserved scene parts; and (3) assigns an interpretable uncertainty value at each pixel. Extensive experiments show that FoV-Net does not only extrapolate the temporally consistent wide field-of-view scene better than existing alternatives, but also provides the associated uncertainty which may benefit critical decision-making downstream applications.

Experiments on clothing-based datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

However, in selfies, constraints such as human arm length often make the body pose look unnatural. To address this issue, we introduce unselfie, a novel photographic transformation that automatically translates a selfie into a neutral-pose portrait. To achieve this, we first collect an unpaired dataset, and introduce a way to synthesize paired training data for self-supervised learning. Then, to unselfie a photo, we propose a new three-stage pipeline, where we first find a target neutral pose, inpaint the body texture, and finally refine and composite the person on the background. To obtain a suitable target neutral pose, we propose a novel nearest pose search module that makes the reposing task easier and enables the generation of multiple neutral-pose results among which users can choose the best one they like. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the superiority of our pipeline over alternatives."}}

Most works focus on learning either a one-to-one mapping in an unsupervised way or a many-to-many mapping in a supervised way. However, a more practical setting is many-to-many mapping in an unsupervised way, which is harder due to the lack of supervision and the complex inner- and cross-domain variations. To alleviate these issues, we propose the Exemplar Guided & Semantically Consistent Image-to-image Translation (EGSC-IT) network which conditions the translation process on an exemplar image in the target domain. We assume that an image comprises of a content component which is shared across domains, and a style component specific to each domain. Under the guidance of an exemplar from the target domain we apply Adaptive Instance Normalization to the shared content component, which allows us to transfer the style information of the target domain to the source domain. To avoid semantic inconsistencies during translation that naturally appear due to the large inner- and cross-domain variations, we introduce the concept of feature masks that provide coarse semantic guidance without requiring the use of any semantic labels. Experimental results on various datasets show that EGSC-IT does not only translate the source image to diverse instances in the target domain, but also preserves the semantic consistency during the process."}}

In order to tackle these problems, we propose a novel BiLevel (BiL) learning paradigm that alternates the learning of two models, respectively at an instance-specific (IS) and a general-purpose (GP) level. In each scene, the IS model learns to maintain the specific scene attributes. It is initialized by the GP model that learns from all the scenes to obtain the generalizable translation knowledge. This GP initialization gives the IS model an efficient starting point, thus enabling its fast adaptation to the new scene with scarce training data. We conduct extensive I2I translation experiments on human face and street view datasets. Quantitative results validate that our approach can significantly boost the performance of classical I2I translation models, such as PG2 and Pix2Pix. Our visualization results show both higher image quality and more appropriate instance-specific details, e.g., the translated image of a person looks more like that person in terms of identity."}}
