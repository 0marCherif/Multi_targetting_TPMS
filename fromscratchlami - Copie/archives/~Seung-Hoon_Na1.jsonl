We demonstrate that with the right problem formulation, a simple logistic regression algorithm can be highly effective for combining GEC models. Our method successfully increases the F0.5 score from the highest base GEC system by 4.2 points on the CoNLL-2014 test set and 7.2 points on the BEA-2019 test set. Furthermore, our method outperforms the state of the art by 4.0 points on the BEA-2019 test set, 1.2 points on the CoNLL-2014 test set with original annotation, and 3.4 points on the CoNLL-2014 test set with alternative annotation. We also show that our system combination generates better corrections with higher F0.5 scores than the conventional ensemble."}}

A challenge of this approach is to reduce the flexibility of the student's representations inducing inaccurate learning of the teacher's knowledge. To resolve it in transferring, we investigate distillation of structures of representations specified to three types: intra-feature, local inter-feature, global inter-feature structures. To transfer them, we introduce feature structure distillation methods based on the Centered Kernel Alignment, which assigns a consistent value to similar features structures and reveals more informative relations. In particular, a memory-augmented transfer method with clustering is implemented for the global structures. The methods are empirically analyzed on the nine tasks for language understanding of the GLUE dataset with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which is a representative neural language model. In the results, the proposed methods effectively transfer the three types of structures and improve performance compared to state-of-the-art distillation methods. Indeed, the code for the methods is available in https://github.com/maroo-sky/FSD."}}

Deaf people face huge language barriers in their daily lives, including access to digital and spoken information. There are very few digital resources for sign language processing. In this article, we present a transfer-based machine translation system for translating Korean-to-Korean Sign Language (KSL) glosses, mainly composed of (1) dictionary-based lexical transfer and (2) a hybrid syntactic transfer based on a data-driven model. In particular, we formulate complicated word reordering problems in syntactic transfer as multi-class classification tasks and propose \u201csyntactically guided\u201d data-driven syntactic transfer. The core part of our study is a neural classification model for reordering order-important constituent pairs with a reordering task that is newly designed for Korean-to-KSL translation. The experiment results evaluated on news transcript data show that the proposed system achieves a BLEU score of 0.512 and a RIBES score of 0.425, significantly improving upon the baseline system performance."}}
