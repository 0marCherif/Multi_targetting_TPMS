For images and their captions, the multiplicity of the correspondences makes the task particularly challenging. Given an image (respectively a caption), there are multiple captions (respectively images) that equally make sense. In this paper, we argue that deterministic functions are not sufficiently powerful to capture such one-to-many correspondences. Instead, we propose to use Probabilistic Cross-Modal Embedding (PCME), where samples from the different modalities are represented as probabilistic distributions in the common embedding space. Since common benchmarks such as COCO suffer from non-exhaustive annotations for cross-modal matches, we propose to additionally evaluate retrieval on the CUB dataset, a smaller yet clean database where all possible image-caption pairs are annotated. We\nextensively ablate PCME and demonstrate that it not only improves the retrieval performance over its deterministic counterpart but also provides uncertainty estimates that render the embeddings more interpretable.

Despite the remarkable success of existing font generation methods, they have significant drawbacks; they require a large number of reference images to generate a new font set, or they fail to capture detailed styles with only a few samples. In this paper, we focus on compositional scripts, a widely used letter system in the world, where each glyph can be decomposed by several components. By utilizing the compositionality of compositional scripts, we propose a novel font generation framework, named Dual Memory-augmented Font Generation Network (DM-Font), which enables us to generate a high-quality font library with only a few samples. We employ memory components and global-context awareness in the generator to take advantage of the compositionality. In the experiments on Korean-handwriting fonts and Thai-printing fonts, we observe that our method generates a significantly better quality of samples with faithful stylization compared to the state-of-the-art generation methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

Since the transformer-based architecture has been innovative for computer vision modeling, the design convention towards an effective architecture has been less studied yet. From the successful design principles of CNN, we investigate the role of spatial dimension conversion and its effectiveness on transformer-based architecture. We particularly attend to the dimension reduction principle of CNNs; as the depth increases, a conventional CNN increases channel dimension and decreases spatial dimensions. We empirically show that such a spatial dimension reduction is beneficial to a transformer architecture as well, and propose a novel Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT) upon the original ViT model. We show that PiT achieves the improved model capability and generalization performance against ViT. Throughout the extensive experiments, we further show PiT outperforms the baseline on several tasks such as image classification, object detection, and robustness evaluation.

Our theoretical results show that regardless of the choice of the mixing strategy, MSDA behaves as a pixel-level regularization of the underlying training loss and a regularization of the first layer parameters. Similarly, our theoretical results support that the MSDA training strategy can improve adversarial robustness and generalization compared to the vanilla training strategy. Using the theoretical results, we provide a high-level understanding of how different design choices of MSDA work differently. For example, we show that the most popular MSDA methods, Mixup and CutMix, behave differently, e.g., CutMix regularizes the input gradients by pixel distances, while Mixup regularizes the input gradients regardless of pixel distances. Our theoretical results also show that the optimal MSDA strategy depends on tasks, datasets, or model parameters. From these observations, we propose generalized MSDAs, a Hybrid version of Mixup and CutMix (HMix) and Gaussian Mixup (GMix), simple extensions of Mixup and CutMix. Our implementation can leverage the advantages of Mixup and CutMix, while our implementation is very efficient, and the computation cost is almost neglectable as Mixup and CutMix. Our empirical study shows that our HMix and GMix outperform the previous state-of-the-art MSDA methods in CIFAR-100 and ImageNet classification tasks. Source code is available at this https URL\n"}}

Existing methods learn to disentangle style and content elements by developing a universal style representation for each font style. However, this approach limits the model in representing diverse local styles, because it is unsuitable for complicated letter systems, for example, Chinese, whose characters consist of a varying number of components (often called \"radical\") -- with a highly complex structure. In this paper, we propose a novel font generation method that learns localized styles, namely component-wise style representations, instead of universal styles. The proposed style representations enable the synthesis of complex local details in text designs. However, learning component-wise styles solely from a few reference glyphs is infeasible when a target script has a large number of components, for example, over 200 for Chinese. To reduce the number of required reference glyphs, we represent component-wise styles by a product of component and style factors, inspired by low-rank matrix factorization. Owing to the combination of strong representation and a compact factorization strategy, our method shows remarkably better few-shot font generation results (with only eight reference glyphs) than other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, strong locality supervision, for example, location of each component, skeleton, or strokes, was not utilized. The source code is available at this https URL and this https URL.\n"}}

Existing FFG methods aim to disentangle content and style either by extracting a universal representation style or extracting multiple component-wise style representations. However, previous methods either fail to capture diverse local styles or cannot be generalized to a character with unseen components, e.g., unseen language systems. To mitigate the issues, we propose a novel FFG method, named Multiple Localized Experts Few-shot Font Generation Network (MX-Font). MX-Font extracts multiple style features not explicitly conditioned on component labels, but automatically by multiple experts to represent different local concepts, e.g., left-side sub-glyph. Owing to the multiple experts, MX-Font can capture diverse local concepts and show the generalizability to unseen languages. During training, we utilize component labels as weak supervision to guide each expert to be specialized for different local concepts. We formulate the component assign problem to each expert as the graph matching problem, and solve it by the Hungarian algorithm. We also employ the independence loss and the content-style adversarial loss to impose the content-style disentanglement. In our experiments, MX-Font outperforms previous state-of-the-art FFG methods in the Chinese generation and cross-lingual, e.g., Chinese to Korean, generation.

We derive a tractable variational lower bound via approximating the oracle model by a pre-trained model, called Mutual Information Regularization with Oracle (MIRO). Our extensive experiments show that MIRO significantly improves the out-of-distribution performance.

We emphasize that such assumption is unrealistic for real-world applications since group label annotations are expensive and can conflict with privacy issues. In this paper, we consider a more practical scenario, dubbed as Algorithmic Group Fairness with the Partially annotated Group labels (Fair-PG). We observe that the existing methods to achieve group fairness perform even worse than the vanilla training, which simply uses full data only with target labels, under Fair-PG. To address this problem, we propose a simple Confidence-based Group Label assignment (CGL) strategy that is readily applicable to any fairness-aware learning method. CGL utilizes an auxiliary group classifier to assign pseudo group labels, where random labels are assigned to low confident samples. We first theoretically show that our method design is better than the vanilla pseudo-labeling strategy in terms of fairness criteria. Then, we empirically show on several benchmark datasets that by combining CGL and the state-of-the-art fairness-aware in-processing methods, the target accuracies and the fairness metrics can be jointly improved compared to the baselines. Furthermore, we convincingly show that CGL enables to naturally augment the given group-labeled dataset with external target label-only datasets so that both accuracy and fairness can be improved.

However, existing ITM benchmarks have a significant limitation. They have many missing correspondences, originating from the data construction process itself. For example, a caption is only matched with one image although the caption can be matched with other similar images and vice versa. To correct the massive false negatives, we construct the Extended COCO Validation (ECCV) Caption dataset by supplying the missing associations with machine and human annotators. We employ five state-of-the-art ITM models with diverse properties for our annotation process. Our dataset provides x3.6 positive image-to-caption associations and x8.5 caption-to-image associations compared to the original MS-COCO. We also propose to use an informative ranking-based metric mAP@R, rather than the popular Recall@K (R@K). We re-evaluate the existing 25 VL models on existing and proposed benchmarks. Our findings are that the existing benchmarks, such as COCO 1K R@K, COCO 5K R@K, CxC R@1 are highly correlated with each other, while the rankings change when we shift to the ECCV mAP@R.

Specifically, we define a model similarity using input gradient transferability. We generate adversarial samples of two networks and measure the average accuracy of the networks on adversarial samples of each other. If two networks are highly correlated, then the attack transferability will be high, resulting in high similarity. Using the similarity score, we investigate two topics: (1) Which network component contributes to the model diversity? (2) How does model diversity affect practical scenarios? We answer the first question by providing feature importance analysis and clustering analysis. The second question is validated by two different scenarios: model ensemble and knowledge distillation. Our findings show that model diversity takes a key role when interacting with different neural architectures. For example, we found that more diversity leads to better ensemble performance. We also observe that the relationship between teacher and student networks and distillation performance depends on the choice of the base architecture of the teacher and student networks. We expect our analysis tool helps a high-level understanding of differences between various neural architectures as well as practical guidance when using multiple architectures."}}
