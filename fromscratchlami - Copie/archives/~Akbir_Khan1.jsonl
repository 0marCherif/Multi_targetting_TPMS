Reinforcement learning environments are traditionally run on the CPU, limiting their scalability with typical academic compute. However, recent advancements in JAX have enabled the wider use of hardware acceleration to overcome these computational hurdles by producing massively parallel RL training pipelines and environments.\n\nThis is particularly useful for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) research where not only multiple agents must be considered at each environment step, adding additional computational burden, but also the sample complexity is increased due to non-stationarity, decentralised partial observability, or other MARL challenges.\n\nIn this paper, we present JaxMARL, the first open-source code base that combines ease-of-use with GPU enabled efficiency, and supports a large number of commonly used MARL environments as well as popular baseline algorithms. Our experiments show that our JAX-based implementations are up to 1400x faster than existing single-threaded baselines. This enables efficient and thorough evaluations, with the potential to alleviate the evaluation crisis of the field. We also introduce and benchmark SMAX, a vectorised, simplified version of the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, which removes the need to run the StarCraft II game engine. This not only enables GPU acceleration, but also provides a more flexible MARL environment, unlocking the potential for self-play, meta-learning, and other future applications in MARL."}}

Existing methods adapt curricula independently over either environment parameters (in single-agent settings) or co-player policies (in multi-agent settings). However, the strengths and weaknesses of co-players can manifest themselves differently depending on environmental features. It is thus crucial to consider the dependency between the environment and co-player when shaping a curriculum in multi-agent domains. In this work, we use this insight and extend Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) to multi-agent environments. We then introduce Multi-Agent Environment Design Strategist for Open-Ended Learning (MAESTRO), the first multi-agent UED approach for two-player zero-sum settings. MAESTRO efficiently produces adversarial, joint curricula over both environments and co-players and attains minimax-regret guarantees at Nash equilibrium. Our experiments show that MAESTRO outperforms a number of strong baselines on competitive two-player environments, spanning discrete and continuous control."}}

Despite widespread use of LLMs as conversational agents, evaluations of performance fail to capture a crucial aspect of communication: interpreting language in context. Humans interpret language using beliefs, prior knowledge about the world, and more. For example, we intuitively understand the response \"I wore gloves\" to the question \"Did you leave fingerprints?\" as meaning \"No\". To investigate whether LLMs have the ability to make this type of inference, known as an implicature, we design a simple task and evaluate a set of models. We find that despite only evaluating on utterances that require a binary inference (yes or no), most perform close to random. Models adapted to be \"aligned with human intent\" via reinforcement learning perform much better, but still leave a significant gap with human performance. This gap is even more pronounced for context-heavy utterances. We present our findings as the starting gun for further research into evaluating how LLMs interpret language in context, in order to drive the development of more pragmatic and useful models of human discourse."}}

Methods such as Model-Free Opponent Shaping (MFOS) and The Good Shepherd address this issue by shaping their co-player\u2019s learning into mutual cooperation. However, these methods fail to capture important co-player learning dynamics or do not scale to co-players parameterised by deep neural networks. To address these issues, we propose Context and History Aware Other-Shaping (CHAOS). A CHAOS agent is a meta-learner parameterised by a recurrent neural network that learns to shape its co-player over multiple trials. CHAOS considers both the context (inter-episode information), and history (intra-episode information) to shape co-players successfully. CHAOS also successfully scales to shaping co-players parameterised by deep neural networks. In a set of experiments, we show that CHAOS achieves state-of-the-art shaping in matrix games. We provide extensive ablations, motivating the importance of both context and history. CHAOS also successfully shapes on a complex grid-worldbased game, demonstrating CHAOS\u2019s scalability empirically. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that, counterintuitively, the widely-used Coin Game environment does not require history to learn shaping because states are often indicative of past actions. This suggests that the Coin Game is, in contrast to common understanding, unsuitable for investigating shaping in high-dimensional, multi-step environments."}}
