With the goal to unveil the mystery of DNNs, in this work, we propose a general framework called Concept-Monitor to uncover the black-box DNN training processes automatically for the first time. Our proposed Concept-Monitor enables human-interpretable visualization on the DNN training processes and thus facilitates transparency as well as deeper understanding of how DNNs function and operate along the training iterations. Using Concept-Monitor, we are able to observe and compare different training paradigms at ease, including standard training, fine-tuning, adversarial training and network pruning for Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which brings new insights on why and how adversarial training and network pruning work and how they modify the network during training. For example, we find that the lottery ticket hypothesis discovers a mask that makes neurons interpretable at initialization, \\textit{without} any finetuning, and we also found that adversarially robust models have more neurons relying on color as compared to standard models trained on the same dataset."}}

However, existing CBMs and their variants have two crucial limitations:  first, they need to collect labeled data for each of the predefined concepts, which is time consuming and labor intensive; second, the accuracy of a CBM is often significantly lower than that of a standard neural network, especially on more complex datasets. This poor performance creates a barrier for adopting CBMs in practical real world applications. Motivated by these challenges, we propose Label-free CBM which is a novel framework to transform any neural network into an interpretable CBM without labeled concept data, while retaining a high accuracy. Our Label-free CBM has many advantages, it is: scalable - we present the first CBM scaled to ImageNet, efficient - creating a CBM takes only a few hours even for very large datasets, and automated - training it for a new dataset requires minimal human effort. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trustworthy-ML-Lab/Label-free-CBM."}}

CLIP-Dissect leverages recent advances in multimodal vision/language models to label internal neurons with open-ended concepts without the need for any labeled data or human examples. We show that CLIP-Dissect provides more accurate descriptions than existing methods for last layer neurons where the ground-truth is available as well as qualitatively good descriptions for hidden layer neurons. In addition, our method is very flexible: it is model agnostic, can easily handle new concepts and can be extended to take advantage of better multimodal models in the future. Finally CLIP-Dissect is computationally efficient and can label all neurons from five layers of ResNet-50 in just 4 minutes, which is more than 10$\\times$ faster than existing methods.

Recently, several attempts have been made to replace such domain-specific, human-designed transformations with generated views that are learned. However, for imagery data, so far none of these view generation methods has been able to outperform expert transformations. In this work, we tackle a different question: instead of replacing expert transformations with generated views, can we constructively assimilate generated views with expert transformations? We answer this question in the affirmative. To do so, we first propose an information-theoretic framework for designing view generation based on the analysis of Tian et al 2020b on what makes a \"good\" view in contrastive learning. Then, we present two simple yet effective assimilation methods that together with our view generation mechanisms improve the state-of-the-art by up to approximately 3.5% on four different datasets. Importantly, we conduct a detailed empirical study that systematically analyzes a range of view generation and assimilation methods and provides a holistic picture of the efficacy of learned views in contrastive representation learning."}}

These are key requirements for the optimization convergence of classical reinforcement learning reward function with discount factors. Unfortunately, these assumptions do not hold true for many real world problems such as an unstable linear\u2013quadratic regulator (LQR). In this work, we propose new methods to stabilize and speed up the convergence of unstable reinforcement learning problems with the policy gradient methods. We provide theoretical insights on the efficiency of our methods. In practice, our method achieve good experimental results over multiple examples where the vanilla methods mostly fail to converge due to system instability."}}

To impose the learned DNN dynamical models with key physical properties such as conservation laws, this paper proposes a two-step approach to endow the invariant priors into the simulations. We first establish a contrastive learning framework to capture the system invariants along the trajectory observations. During the dynamics modeling, we design a projection layer of DNNs to preserve the system invariance. Through experiments, we show our method consistently outperforms the baseline in both coordinate error and conservation metrics and can be further extended to complex and large dynamics by leveraging autoencoder. Notably, a byproduct of our framework is the automated conservation law discovery for dynamical systems with single conservation property. "}}

PAC-Bayesian learning has been proven to be able to achieve a competitive expected test set error numerically, while providing a tight generalization bound in practice, through gradient descent training. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical analysis of deep PAC-Bayesian learning for neural networks is rarely explored. To this end, this paper proposes a theoretical convergence and generalization analysis for PAC-Bayesian learning. For a deep and wide probabilistic neural network, we show that when PAC-Bayesian learning is applied, the convergence result corresponds to solving a kernel ridge regression when the probabilistic neural tangent kernel (PNTK) is used as its kernel. Based on this finding, we further obtain an analytic and guaranteed PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for the first time, which is an improvement over the Rademacher complexity-based bound for deterministic neural networks. Finally, drawing insight from our theoretical results, we propose a proxy measure for efficient hyperparameter selection, which is proven to be time-saving on various benchmarks."}}
