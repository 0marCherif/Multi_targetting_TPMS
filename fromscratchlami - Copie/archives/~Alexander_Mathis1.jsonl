Similar to recent robustness benchmarks in computer vision, we train algorithms on selected RL environments and test transfer performance on perturbed environments. We specifically test perturbations to popular RL agent\u2019s morphologies by changing the length and mass of limbs, which in biological settings is a major challenge (eg, after injury or during growth). In this setup, called PyBullet-M, we compare the performance of policies obtained by reward-driven learning with self-supervised models of the observed state-action transitions. We find that out-of-distribution performance of self-supervised models is correlated to degradation in reward."}}

A common key step for behavioral analysis is first extracting relevant keypoints on animals, known as pose estimation. However, reliable inference of poses currently requires domain knowledge and manual labeling effort to build supervised models. We present a series of technical innovations that enable a new method, collectively called SuperAnimal, to develop and deploy deep learning models that require zero additional human labels and model training. SuperAnimal allows video inference on over 45 species with only two global classes of animal pose models. If the models need fine-tuning, we show SuperAnimal models are 10\u00d7 more data efficient and outperform prior transfer learning approaches. Moreover, we provide a new video-adaptation method to perform unsupervised refinement of videos, and we illustrate the utility of our model in behavioral classification. Collectively, this presents a data-efficient, plug-and-play solution for behavioral analysis."}}

To take up this challenge, we build on DeepLabCut, an open-source pose estimation toolbox, and provide high-performance animal assembly and tracking\u2014features required for multi-animal scenarios. Furthermore, we integrate the ability to predict an animal\u2019s identity to assist tracking (in case of occlusions). We illustrate the power of this framework with four datasets varying in complexity, which we release to serve as a benchmark for future algorithm development."}}

We study this problem in four classical continuous control environments, augmented with morphological perturbations. Learning to locomote when the length and the thickness of different body parts vary is challenging, as the control policy is required to adapt to the morphology to successfully balance and advance the agent. We show that a control policy based on the proprioceptive state performs poorly with highly variable body configurations, while an (oracle) agent with access to a learned encoding of the perturbation performs significantly better. We introduce DMAP, a biologically-inspired, attention-based policy network architecture. DMAP combines independent proprioceptive processing, a distributed policy with individual controllers for each joint, and an attention mechanism, to dynamically gate sensory information from different body parts to different controllers. Despite not having access to the (hidden) morphology information, DMAP can be trained end-to-end in all the considered environments, overall matching or surpassing the performance of an oracle agent. Thus DMAP, implementing principles from biological motor control, provides a strong inductive bias for learning challenging sensorimotor tasks. Overall, our work corroborates the power of these principles in challenging locomotion tasks. The code is available at the following link: https://github.com/amathislab/dmap"}}

Being able to study this incredible agility will be critical for the development of next-generation autonomous legged robots. In particular, the cheetah (acinonyx jubatus) is supremely fast and maneuverable, yet quantifying its whole-body 3D kinematic data during locomotion in the wild remains a challenge, even with new deep learning-based methods. In this work we present an extensive dataset of free-running cheetahs in the wild, called AcinoSet, that contains 119,490 frames of multi-view synchronized high-speed video footage, camera calibration files and 7,588 human-annotated frames. We utilize markerless animal pose estimation to provide 2D keypoints. Then, we use three methods that serve as strong baselines for 3D pose estimation tool development: traditional sparse bundle adjustment, an Extended Kalman Filter, and a trajectory optimization-based method we call Full Trajectory Estimation. The resulting 3D trajectories, human-checked 3D ground truth, and an interactive tool to inspect the data is also provided. We believe this dataset will be useful for a diverse range of fields such as ecology, neuroscience, robotics, biomechanics as well as computer vision."}}
