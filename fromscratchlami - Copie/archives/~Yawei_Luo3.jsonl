Most of the existing works are based on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and endeavor to enlarge the discriminative area inside the activation map to perceive the whole object, yet ignore the co-occurrence confounder of the object and context (e.g., fish and water), which makes the model inspection hard to distinguish object boundaries. Besides, the use of CAM also brings a dilemma problem that the classification and localization always suffer from a performance gap and can not reach their highest accuracy simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a casual knowledge distillation method, dubbed KD-CI-CAM, to address these two under-explored issues in one go. More specifically, we tackle the co-occurrence context confounder problem via causal intervention (CI), which explores the causalities among image features, contexts, and categories to eliminate the biased object-context entanglement in the class activation maps. Based on the de-biased object feature, we additionally propose a multi-teacher causal distillation framework to balance the absorption of classification knowledge and localization knowledge during model training. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of KD-CI-CAM in learning clear object boundaries from confounding contexts and addressing the dilemma problem between classification and localization performance."}}

In this paper, we take a closer look at the predicates and identify that most visual relations (e.g. sit_above) involve both actional pattern (sit) and spatial pattern (above), while the distribution bias is much less severe at the pattern level. Based on this insight, we propose a decoupled label learning (DLL) paradigm to address the intractable visual relation prediction from the pattern-level perspective. Specifically, DLL decouples the predicate labels and adopts separate classifiers to learn actional and spatial patterns respectively. The patterns are then combined and mapped back to the predicate. Moreover, we propose a knowledge-level label decoupling method to transfer non-target knowledge from head predicates to tail predicates within the same pattern to calibrate the distribution of tail classes. We validate the effectiveness of DLL on the commonly used VidSGG benchmark, i.e. VidVRD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the DLL offers a remarkably simple but highly effective solution to the long-tailed problem, achieving the state-of-the-art VidSGG performance."}}

Previous algorithms mostly adopt 3D CNNs to learn video representation, struggling to capture long-term context and easily suffering from visual-linguistic misalignment. In light of this, we present Locater (local-global context aware Transformer), which augments the Transformer architecture with a finite memory so as to query the entire video with the language expression in an efficient manner. The memory is designed to involve two components -- one for persistently preserving global video content, and one for dynamically gathering local temporal context and segmentation history. Based on the memorized local-global context and the particular content of each frame, Locater holistically and flexibly comprehends the expression as an adaptive query vector for each frame. The vector is used to query the corresponding frame for mask generation. The memory also allows Locater to process videos with linear time complexity and constant size memory, while Transformer-style self-attention computation scales quadratically with sequence length. To thoroughly examine the visual grounding capability of LVS models, we contribute a new LVS dataset, A2D-S+, which is built upon A2D-S dataset but poses increased challenges in disambiguating among similar objects. Experiments on three LVS datasets and our A2D-S+ show that Locater outperforms previous state-of-the-arts. Further, our Locater based solution achieved the 1st place in the Referring Video Object Segmentation Track of the 3rd Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

A key in this campaign consists in reducing the domain shift, so that a classifier based on labeled data from one domain can generalize well to other domains. With the advancement of adversarial learning method, recent works prefer the strategy of aligning the marginal distribution in the feature spaces for minimizing the domain discrepancy. However, based on the observance in experiments, only focusing on aligning global marginal distribution but ignoring the local joint distribution alignment fails to be the optimal choice. Other than that, the noisy factors existing in the feature spaces, which are not relevant to the target task, entangle with the domain invariant factors improperly and make the domain distribution alignment more difficult. To address those problems, we introduce two new modules, Significance-aware Information Bottleneck (SIB) and Category-level alignment (CLA), to construct a purified embedding-based category-level adversarial network. As the name suggests, our designed network, CLAN, can not only disentangle the noisy factors and suppress their influences for target tasks but also utilize those purified features to conduct a more delicate level domain calibration, i.e., global marginal distribution and local joint distribution alignment simultaneously. In three domain adaptation tasks, i.e., GTA5 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\rightarrow$</tex-math></inline-formula> Cityscapes, SYNTHIA <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\rightarrow$</tex-math></inline-formula> Cityscapes and Cross Season, we validate that our proposed method matches the state of the art in segmentation accuracy."}}

In this paper, we aim to explore the temporal correlations among neighboring frames and exploit cross-layer multi-scale features for action recognition. First, we present a Temporal Cross-Layer Correlation (TCLC) framework for temporal correlation learning. The unified framework uncovers both local and global structures from video data, enabling a better exploration of temporal context and assisting cross-layer spatio-temporal feature learning. Second, we propose a novel cross-layer attention and a center-guided attention mechanism to integrate features with contextual knowledge from multiple scales. Our method is a two-stage process for effective cross-layer feature learning. The first stage incorporates the cross-layer attention module to decide the importance weight of the convolutional layers. The second stage leverages the center-guided attention mechanism to aggregate local features from each layer for the generation of a final video representation. We leverage global centers to extract shared semantic knowledge among videos. We evaluate TCLC on three action recognition datasets, i.e., UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed temporal correlation mining method."}}

In this paper, we observe that adjacent geometry shares certain commonality that can help to infer the correct geometry of the challenging or low-confident regions. Yet exploiting such property in a non-supervised MVS approach remains challenging for the lacking of training data and necessity of ensuring consistency between views. To address the issues, we propose a novel geometry inference training scheme by selectively masking regions with rich textures, where geometry can be well recovered and used for supervisory signal, and then lead a deliberately designed cost volume completion network to learn how to recover geometry of the masked regions. During inference, we then mask the low-confident regions instead and use the cost volume completion network for geometry correction. To deal with the different depth hypotheses of the cost volume pyramid, we design a three-branch volume inference structure for the completion network. Further, by considering plane as a special geometry, we first identify planar regions from pseudo labels and then correct the low-confident pixels by high-confident labels through plane normal consistency. Extensive experiments on DTU and Tanks & Temples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the state-of-the-art performance."}}
