Yet, the numerical reasoning over measurements has not been formally studied despite their importance. In this study, we show that PLMs lack the capability required for reasoning over measurements. Furthermore, we find that a language model trained on a measurement-rich corpus shows better performance on understanding measurements. We propose a simple embedding strategy to better distinguish between numbers and units, which leads to a significant improvement in the probing tasks."}}

In this light, QA on Electronic Health Records (EHR), namely EHR QA, can work as a crucial milestone towards developing an intelligent agent in healthcare. EHR data are typically stored in a relational database, which can also be converted to a directed acyclic graph, allowing two approaches for EHR QA: Table-based QA and Knowledge Graph-based QA. We hypothesize that the graph-based approach is more suitable for EHR QA as graphs can represent relations between entities and values more naturally compared to tables, which essentially require JOIN operations. In this paper, we propose a graph-based EHR QA where natural language queries are converted to SPARQL instead of SQL. To validate our hypothesis, we create four EHR QA datasets (graph-based VS table-based, and simplified database schema VS original database schema), based on a table-based dataset MIMICSQL. We test both a simple Seq2Seq model and a state-of-the-art EHR QA model on all datasets where the graph-based datasets facilitated up to 34% higher accuracy than the table-based dataset without any modification to the model architectures. Finally, all datasets are open-sourced to encourage further EHR QA research in both directions."}}

However, while EHR systems are nearly ubiquitous, they lack a unified code system for representing medical concepts. Heterogeneous formats of EHR present a substantial barrier for the training and deployment of state-of-the-art deep learning models at scale. To overcome this problem, we introduce Description-based Embedding, DescEmb, a code-agnostic description-based representation learning framework for predictive modeling on EHR. DescEmb takes advantage of the flexibility of neural language understanding models while maintaining a neutral approach that can be combined with prior frameworks for task-specific representation learning or predictive modeling. We tested our model's capacity on various experiments including prediction tasks, transfer learning and pooled learning. DescEmb shows higher performance in overall experiments compared to code-based approach, opening the door to a text-based approach in predictive healthcare research that is not constrained by EHR structure nor special domain knowledge.\n"}}

In this work we explore a broad set of multi-modal representation learning tasks in the medical domain, specifically using radiology images and the unstructured report. We propose Medical Vision Language Learner (MedViLL), which adopts a BERT-based architecture combined with a novel multi-modal attention masking scheme to maximize generalization performance for both vision-language understanding tasks (diagnosis classification, medical image-report retrieval, medical visual question answering) and vision-language generation task (radiology report generation). By statistically and rigorously evaluating the proposed model on four downstream tasks with three radiographic image-report datasets (MIMIC-CXR, Open-I, and VQA-RAD), we empirically demonstrate the superior downstream task performance of MedViLL against various baselines, including task-specific architectures.

These datasets assume answers reside as a single cell value and do not necessitate exploring over multiple cells such as aggregation, comparison, and sorting. Thus, we release Open-WikiTable, the first ODQA dataset that requires complex reasoning over tables. Open-WikiTable is built upon WikiSQL and WikiTableQuestions to be applicable in the open-domain setting. As each question is coupled with both textual answers and SQL queries, Open-WikiTable opens up a wide range of possibilities for future research, as both reader and parser methods can be applied.

However, for fact verification, KGs have not been adequately utilized as a knowledge source. KGs can be a valuable knowledge source in fact verification due to their reliability and broad applicability. A KG consists of nodes and edges which makes it clear how concepts are linked together, allowing machines to reason over chains of topics. However, there are many challenges in understanding how these machine-readable concepts map to information in text. To enable the community to better use KGs, we introduce a new dataset, FactKG: Fact Verification via Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs. It consists of 108k natural language claims with five types of reasoning: One-hop, Conjunction, Existence, Multi-hop, and Negation. Furthermore, FactKG contains various linguistic patterns, including colloquial style claims as well as written style claims to increase practicality. Lastly, we develop a baseline approach and analyze FactKG over these reasoning types. We believe FactKG can advance both reliability and practicality in KG-based fact verification."}}

Though many studies have proposed automatic prediction methods using Electronic Health Records (EHR), their coarse-grained time resolutions limit their practical usage in urgent environments such as the emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU). Therefore, in this study, we propose an hourly prediction method based on self-supervised predictive coding and multi-modal fusion for two critical tasks: mortality and vasopressor need prediction. Through extensive experiments, we prove significant performance gains from both multi-modal fusion and self-supervised predictive regularization, most notably in far-future prediction, which becomes especially important in practice. Our uni-modal/bi-modal/bi-modal self-supervision scored 0.846/0.877/0.897 (0.824/0.855/0.886) and 0.817/0.820/0.858 (0.807/0.81/0.855) with mortality (far-future mortality) and with vasopressor need (far-future vasopressor need) prediction data in AUROC, respectively."}}

Despite their scarce occurrences in the training set, abrupt changes incur loss (i.e., MSE) that significantly contributes to the total loss. Therefore, they act as noisy training samples and prevent the model from learning generalizable sequence patterns, namely the normal states. Based on such an intuition, we propose a reweighting framework that down-weights the loss incurred by abrupt changes and up-weights those by normal states. For the reweighting framework, we first define a measurement termed Local Discrepancy (LD) which measures the degree of abruptness of a change in a given period of time. Then, we calculate how frequently the temporal changes appear in the training set based on LD (i.e., estimated LD density). Since normal states generally appear frequently compared to abrupt changes, they achieve higher LD density. Using such a property, we reweight the losses proportionally to the estimated LD density. Our reweighting framework is applicable to existing time-series forecasting models regardless of the architectures. Through extensive experiments on 12 time-series forecasting models over eight datasets with various in-output sequence lengths, we demonstrate that applying our reweighting framework reduces MSE by 10.1% on average and by up to 18.6% in the state-of-the-art model."}}

Also, some of them are not trained in real-time seizure detection tasks, making it hard for on-device applications. In this work, for the first time, we extensively compare multiple state-of-the-art models and signal feature extractors in a real-time seizure detection framework suitable for real-world application, using various evaluation metrics including a new one we propose to evaluate more practical aspects of seizure detection models.\n"}}

To construct the QA dataset on structured EHR data, we conducted a poll at a university hospital and templatized the responses to create seed questions. Then, we manually linked them to two open-source EHR databases\u2014MIMIC-III and eICU\u2014and included them with various time expressions and held-out unanswerable questions in the dataset, which were all collected from the poll. Our dataset poses a unique set of challenges: the model needs to 1) generate SQL queries that reflect a wide range of needs in the hospital, including simple retrieval and complex operations such as calculating survival rate, 2) understand various time expressions to answer time-sensitive questions in healthcare, and 3) distinguish whether a given question is answerable or unanswerable based on the prediction confidence. We believe our dataset, EHRSQL, could serve as a practical benchmark to develop and assess QA models on structured EHR data and take one step further towards bridging the gap between text-to-SQL research and its real-life deployment in healthcare.
