This is an extremely challenging problem that requires modeling complex light transport, and disentangling HDR lighting from material and geometry with only a partial LDR observation of the scene. We tackle this problem using two novel components: 1) a holistic scene reconstruction method that estimates reflectance and parametric 3D lighting, and 2) a neural rendering framework that re-renders the scene from our predictions. We use physically-based light representations that allow for intuitive editing, and infer both visible and invisible light sources. Our neural rendering framework combines physically-based direct illumination and shadow rendering with deep networks to approximate global illumination. It can capture challenging lighting effects, such as soft shadows, directional lighting, specular materials, and interreflections. Previous single image inverse rendering methods usually entangle lighting and geometry and only support applications like object insertion. Instead, by combining parametric 3D lighting estimation with neural scene rendering, we demonstrate the first automatic method for full scene relighting from a single image, including light source insertion, removal, and replacement."}}

Critical factors hinder the performance improvement of cross-domain lane detection that conventional methods only focus on pixel-wise loss while ignoring shape and position priors of lanes. To address the issue, we propose the Multi-level Domain Adaptation (MLDA) framework, a new perspective to handle cross-domain lane detection at three complementary semantic levels of pixel, instance and category. Specifically, at pixel level, we propose to apply cross-class confidence constraints in self-training to tackle the imbalanced confidence distribution of lane and background. At instance level, we go beyond pixels to treat segmented lanes as instances and facilitate discriminative features in target domain with triplet learning, which effectively rebuilds the semantic context of lanes and contributes to alleviating the feature confusion. At category level, we propose an adaptive inter-domain embedding module to utilize the position prior of lanes during adaptation. In two challenging datasets, ie TuSimple and CULane, our approach improves lane detection performance by a large margin with gains of 8.8% on accuracy and 7.4% on F1-score respectively, compared with state-of-the-art domain adaptation algorithms."}}

However, existing CL benchmarks, e.g. Permuted-MNIST and Split-CIFAR, make use of artificial temporal variation and do not align with or generalize to the real-world. In this paper, we introduce CLEAR, the first continual image classification benchmark dataset with a natural temporal evolution of visual concepts in the real world that spans a decade (2004-2014). We build CLEAR from existing large-scale image collections (YFCC100M) through a novel and scalable low-cost approach to visio-linguistic dataset curation. Our pipeline makes use of pretrained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) to interactively build labeled datasets, which are further validated with crowd-sourcing to remove errors and even inappropriate images (hidden in original YFCC100M). The major strength of CLEAR over prior CL benchmarks is the smooth temporal evolution of visual concepts with real-world imagery, including both high-quality labeled data along with abundant unlabeled samples per time period for continual semi-supervised learning. We find that a simple unsupervised pre-training step can already boost state-of-the-art CL algorithms that only utilize fully-supervised data. Our analysis also reveals that mainstream CL evaluation protocols that train and test on iid data artificially inflate performance of CL system. To address this, we propose novel \"streaming\" protocols for CL that always test on the (near) future. Interestingly, streaming protocols (a) can simplify dataset curation since today's testset can be repurposed for tomorrow's trainset and (b) can produce more generalizable models with more accurate estimates of performance since all labeled data from each time-period is used for both training and testing (unlike classic iid train-test splits)."}}

Inspired by previous methods, we first analyze the geometry heuristic between the 3D lane and its 2D representation on the ground and propose to impose explicit supervision based on the structure prior, which makes it achievable to build inter-lane and intra-lane relationships to facilitate the reconstruction of 3D lanes from local to global. Second, to reduce the structure loss in 2D lane representation, we directly extract BEV lane information from front view images, which tremendously eases the confusion of distant lane features in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose a novel task-specific data augmentation method by synthesizing new training data for both segmentation and reconstruction tasks in our pipeline, to counter the imbalanced data distribution of camera pose and ground slope to improve generalization on unseen data. Our work marks the first attempt to employ the geometry prior information into DNN-based 3D lane detection and makes it achievable for detecting lanes in an extra-long distance, doubling the original detection range. The proposed method can be smoothly adopted by other frameworks without extra costs. Experimental results show that our work outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 3.8% F-Score on Apollo 3D synthetic dataset at real-time speed of 82 FPS without introducing extra parameters."}}

Our goal is to make the dataset creation process widely accessible, allowing researchers to transform scans into datasets with highquality ground truth. We demonstrate our framework by creating a photorealistic synthetic version of the publicly available ScanNet dataset with consistent layout, semantic labels, high quality spatially-varying BRDF and complex lighting. We render photorealistic images, as well as complex spatially-varying lighting, including direct, indirect and visibility components. Such a dataset enables important applications in inverse rendering, scene understanding and robotics. We show that deep networks trained on the proposed dataset achieve competitive performance for shape, material and lighting estimation on real images, enabling photorealistic augmented reality applications, such as object insertion and material editing. We also show our semantic labels may be used for segmentation and multitask learning. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework may also be integrated with physics engines, to create virtual robotics environments with unique ground truth such as friction coefficients and correspondence to real scenes. The dataset and all the tools to create such datasets will be publicly released, enabling others in the community to easily build large-scale datasets of their own."}}
