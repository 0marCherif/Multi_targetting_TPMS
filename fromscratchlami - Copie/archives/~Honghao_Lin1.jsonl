In the learning-based sketching paradigm proposed by Indyk et al., the sketch matrix is found by choosing a random sparse matrix, e.g., CountSketch, and then the values of its non-zero entries are updated by running gradient descent on a training data set. Despite the growing body of work on this paradigm, a noticeable omission is that the locations of the non-zero entries of previous algorithms were fixed, and only their values were learned.\nIn this work, we propose the first learning-based algorithms that also optimize the locations of the non-zero entries. Our first proposed algorithm is based on a greedy algorithm. However, one drawback of the greedy algorithm is its slower training time. We fix this issue and propose approaches for learning a sketching matrix for both low-rank approximation and Hessian approximation for second-order optimization. The latter is helpful for a range of constrained optimization problems, such as LASSO and matrix estimation with a nuclear norm constraint. Both approaches achieve good accuracy with a fast running time.  Moreover, our experiments suggest that our algorithm can still reduce the error significantly even if we only have a very limited number of training matrices."}}

A line of work has shown how to sketch the Hessian to speed up each iteration in a second order method, but such sketches usually depend only on the matrix at hand, and in a number of cases are even oblivious to the input matrix. One could instead hope to learn a distribution on sketching matrices that is optimized for the specific distribution of input matrices. We show how to design learned sketches for the Hessian in the context of second order methods. We prove that a smaller sketching dimension of the column space of a tall matrix is possible, assuming the knowledge of the indices of the rows of large leverage scores. This would lead to faster convergence of the iterative Hessian sketch procedure. We also design a new objective to learn the sketch, whereby we optimize the subspace embedding property of the sketch. We show empirically that learned sketches, compared with their \"non-learned\" counterparts, do improve the approximation accuracy for important problems, including LASSO and matrix estimation with nuclear norm constraints."}}
