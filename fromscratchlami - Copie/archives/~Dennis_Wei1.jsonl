In these cases, we wish to go beyond differences in overall metrics such as accuracy to identify where in the feature space do the differences occur. We formalize this problem of model differencing as one of predicting a dissimilarity function of two ML models\u2019 outputs, subject to the representation of the differences being human-interpretable. Our solution is to learn a Joint Surrogate Tree (JST), which is composed of two conjoined decision tree surrogates for the\ntwo models. A JST provides an intuitive representation of differences and places the changes in the context of the models\u2019 decision logic. Context is important as it helps users to map differences to an underlying mental model of an AI system. We also propose a refinement procedure to increase the precision of a JST. We demonstrate, through an empirical evaluation, that such contextual differencing is concise and can be achieved with no loss in fidelity over naive approaches."}}

Exact Algorithms For Learning to Defer to Humans", "abstract": "Automated AI classifiers should be able to defer the prediction to a human decision maker to ensure more accurate predictions. In this work, we jointly train a classifier with a rejector, which decides on each data point whether the classifier or the human should predict. We show that prior approaches can fail to find a human-AI system with low misclassification error even when there exists a linear classifier and rejector that have zero error (the realizable setting). We prove that obtaining a linear pair with low error is NP-hard even when the problem is realizable. To complement this negative result, we give a mixed-integer-linear-programming (MILP) formulation that can optimally solve the problem in the linear setting. However, the MILP only scales to moderately-sized problems. Therefore, we provide a novel surrogate loss function that is realizable-consistent and performs well empirically. We test our approaches on a comprehensive set of datasets and compare to a wide range of baselines."}}

Toward assessing safety, we introduce the concept of *maximum deviation* via an optimization problem to find the largest deviation of a supervised learning model from a reference model regarded as safe. We then show how interpretability facilitates this safety assessment. For models including decision trees, generalized linear and additive models, the maximum deviation can be computed exactly and efficiently. For tree ensembles, which are not regarded as interpretable, discrete optimization techniques can still provide informative bounds. For a broader class of piecewise Lipschitz functions, we leverage the multi-armed bandit literature to show that interpretability produces tighter (regret) bounds on the maximum deviation.

However, in such scenarios, it may take time for sufficient training data to accumulate in order to retrain the model to reflect the new decision boundaries. While work has been done to reinforce existing decision boundaries, very little has been done to cover these scenarios where decision boundaries of the ML models should change in order to reflect new rules. In this paper, we focus on user-provided feedback rules as a way to expedite the ML models update process, and we formally introduce the problem of pre-processing training data to edit an ML model in response to feedback rules such that once the model is retrained on the pre-processed data, its decision boundaries align more closely with the rules. To solve this problem, we propose a novel data augmentation method, the Feedback Rule-Based Oversampling Technique. Extensive experiments using different ML models and real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, in particular the benefit of augmentation and the ability to handle many feedback rules."}}

However, explanations for models that output similarity between two inputs have received comparatively lesser attention. In this paper, we provide model agnostic local explanations for similarity learners applicable to tabular and text data. We first propose a method that provides feature attributions to explain the similarity between a pair of inputs as determined by a black box similarity learner. We then propose analogies as a new form of explanation in machine learning. Here the goal is to identify diverse analogous pairs of examples that share the same level of similarity as the input pair and provide insight into (latent) factors underlying the model's prediction. The selection of analogies can optionally leverage feature attributions, thus connecting the two forms of explanation while still maintaining complementarity. We prove that our analogy objective function is submodular, making the search for good-quality analogies efficient. We apply the proposed approaches to explain similarities between sentences as predicted by a state-of-the-art sentence encoder, and between patients in a healthcare utilization application. Efficacy is measured through quantitative evaluations, a careful user study, and examples of explanations."}}

Privacy laws limit access to health data such as Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) to preserve patient privacy. Albeit essential, these laws hinder research reproducibility. Synthetic data is a viable solution that can enable access to data similar to real healthcare data without privacy risks. Healthcare datasets may have biases in which certain protected groups might experience worse outcomes than others. With the real data having biases, the fairness of synthetically generated health data comes into question. In this paper, we evaluate the fairness of models generated on two healthcare datasets for gender and race biases. We generate synthetic versions of the dataset using a Generative Adversarial Network called HealthGAN, and compare the real and synthetic model's balanced accuracy and fairness scores. We find that synthetic data has different fairness properties compared to real data and fairness mitigation techniques perform differently, highlighting that synthetic data is not bias free."}}

However, people's perception and understanding are often distorted by their cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, anchoring bias, availability bias, to name a few. In this work, we use knowledge from the field of cognitive science to account for cognitive biases in the human-AI collaborative decision-making setting, and mitigate their negative effects on collaborative performance. To this end, we mathematically model cognitive biases and provide a general framework through which researchers and practitioners can understand the interplay between cognitive biases and human-AI accuracy. We then focus specifically on anchoring bias, a bias commonly encountered in human-AI collaboration. We implement a time-based de-anchoring strategy and conduct our first user experiment that validates its effectiveness in human-AI collaborative decision-making. With this result, we design a time allocation strategy for a resource-constrained setting that achieves optimal human-AI collaboration under some assumptions. We, then, conduct a second user experiment which shows that our time allocation strategy with explanation can effectively de-anchor the human and improve collaborative performance when the AI model has low confidence and is incorrect."}}
