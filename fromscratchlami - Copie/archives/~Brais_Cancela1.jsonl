However, ensuring transparency and user trust in these systems remains a challenge; personalized explanations have emerged as a solution, offering justifications for recommendations. Among the existing approaches for generating personalized explanations, using visual content created by the users is one particularly promising option, showing a potential to maximize transparency and user trust. Existing models for explaining recommendations in this context face limitations: sustainability has been a critical concern, as they often require substantial computational resources, leading to significant carbon emissions comparable to the Recommender Systems where they would be integrated. Moreover, most models employ surrogate learning goals that do not align with the objective of ranking the most effective personalized explanations for a given recommendation, leading to a suboptimal learning process and larger model sizes. To address these limitations, we present BRIE, a novel model designed to tackle the existing challenges by adopting a more adequate learning goal based on Bayesian Pairwise Ranking, enabling it to achieve consistently superior performance than state-of-the-art models in six real-world datasets, while exhibiting remarkable efficiency, emitting up to 75% less CO${_2}$ during training and inference with a model up to 64 times smaller than previous approaches."}}

The need for this kind of technique has increased dramatically in recent years with the advent of Big Data. This data explosion not only has the problem of a large number of samples, but also of big dimensionality. This chapter will analyze the paramount need for feature selection and briefly review the most popular feature selection methods and some typical applications. Moreover, as the new Big Data scenario offers new opportunities to machine learning researchers, we will discuss the new challenges that need to be faced: from the scalability of the methods to the role of feature selection in the presence of deep learning, as well as exploring its use in embedded devices. Beyond a shadow of doubt, the explosion in the number of features and computing technologies will point to a number of hot spots for feature selection researchers to launch new lines of research."}}

While classic Fast Marching Method (FMM) techniques achieve the solution to the Eikonal equation with a O(M log M) (or O(M) assuming some modifications), solving the more general static Hamilton-Jacobi equation requires a higher complexity. The proposed framework maintains the O(M log M) complexity for both problems, while achieving higher accuracy than available state-of-the-art. The key idea behind the proposed method is the creation of \u2018mini wave-fronts\u2019, where the solution is interpolated to minimize the discretization error. Experimental results show how our algorithm can outperform the state-of-the-art both in precision and computational cost."}}

Abstract Classic feature selection techniques remove irrelevant or redundant features to achieve a subset of relevant features in compact models that are easier to interpret and so improve knowledge extraction. Most such techniques operate on the whole dataset, but are unable to provide the user with useful information when only instance-level information is required; in other words, classic feature selection algorithms do not identify the most relevant information in a sample. We have developed a novel feature selection method, called saliency-based feature selection (SFS), based on deep-learning saliency techniques. Our algorithm works under any architecture that is trained by using gradient descent techniques (Neural Networks, SVMs, \u2026), and can be used for classification or regression problems. Experimental results show our algorithm is robust, as it allows to transfer the feature ranking result between different architectures, achieving remarkable results. The versatility of our algorithm has been also demonstrated, as it can work either in big data environments as well as with small datasets."}}

In this paper we present two different contributions: novel measures of robustness (based on adversarial attacks) and a novel adversarial attack. The key idea behind these metrics is to obtain a measure that could compare different architectures, with independence of how the input is preprocessed (robustness against different input sizes and value ranges). To do so, a novel adversarial attack is presented, performing a delayed elastic-net adversarial attack (constraints are only used whenever a successful adversarial attack is obtained). Experimental results show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art adversarial samples, in terms of minimal perturbation distance. Finally, a benchmark of ImageNet pretrained models is used to conduct experiments aiming to shed some light about which model should be selected whenever security is a role factor."}}

With the increase of the popularity and pervasiveness of smartphones and portable devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) is turning into a permanent part of our daily routines. Positioning technologies that serve these devices such as the cellular antenna (GSM networks), global navigation satellite systems (GPS), and more recently the WiFi positioning system (WPS) provide large amounts of spatio-temporal data in a continuous way (data streams). In order to understand human behavior, the detection of important places and the movements between these places is a fundamental task. That said, the proposal of this work is a method for discovering user habits over mobility data without any a priori or external knowledge. Our approach extends a density-based clustering method for spatio-temporal data to identify meaningful places the individuals\u2019 visit. On top of that, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is employed over movements between the visits to automatically separate the trajectories accordingly to their key identifiers that may help describe a habit. By regrouping trajectories that look alike by day of the week, length, and starting hour, we discover the individual\u2019s habits. The evaluation of the proposed method is made over three real-world datasets. One dataset contains high-density GPS data and the others use GSM mobile phone data with 15-min sampling rate and Google Location History data with a variable sampling rate. The results show that the proposed pipeline is suitable for this task as other habits rather than just going from home to work and vice versa were found. This method can be used for understanding person behavior and creating their profiles revealing a panorama of human mobility patterns from raw mobility data."}}
