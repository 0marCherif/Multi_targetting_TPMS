In this paper, we propose CO3, namely {Co}operative {Co}ntrastive Learning and {Co}ntextual Shape Prediction, to learn 3D representation for outdoor-scene point clouds in an unsupervised manner. CO3 has several merits compared to existing methods. (1) It utilizes LiDAR point clouds from vehicle-side and infrastructure-side to build views that differ enough but meanwhile maintain common semantic information for contrastive learning, which are more appropriate than views built by previous methods. (2) Alongside the contrastive objective, we propose contextual shape prediction to bring more task-relevant information for unsupervised 3D point cloud representation learning and we also provide a theoretical analysis for this pre-training goal. (3) As compared to previous methods, representation learned by CO3 is able to be transferred to different outdoor scene dataset collected by different type of LiDAR sensors.

How to leverage and optimize the cost-quality trade-off for training data and model? These questions are key challenges towards a label-efficient and scalable panoptic segmentation system due to its expensive instance/semantic pixel-level annotation requirements. By closely examining different kinds of cheaper labels, we introduce a novel multi-objective framework to automatically determine the allocation of different annotations, so as to reach a better segmentation quality with a lower annotation cost. Specifically, we design a Cost-Quality Balanced Network (CQB-Net) to generate the panoptic segmentation map, which distills the crucial relations between various supervisions including panoptic labels, image-level classification labels, bounding boxes, and the semantic coherence information between the foreground and background. Instead of ad-hoc allocation during training, we formulate the optimization of cost-quality trade-off as a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOOP). We model the marginal quality improvement of each annotation and approximate the Pareto-front to enable a label-efficient allocation ratio. Extensive experiments on COCO benchmark show the superiority of our method, e.g. achieving a segmentation quality of 43.4% compared to 43.0% of OCFusion while saving 2.4x annotation cost."}}

However, most state-of-the-art unsupervised methods concentrate on learning global representations for image-level classification tasks instead of discriminative local region representations, which limits their transferability to region-level downstream tasks, such as object detection. To improve the transferability of pre-trained features to object detection, we present Deeply Unsupervised Patch Re-ID (DUPR), a simple yet effective method for unsupervised visual representation learning. The patch Re-ID task treats individual patch as a pseudo-identity and contrastively learns its correspondence in two views, enabling us to obtain discriminative local features for object detection. Then the proposed patch Re-ID is performed in a deeply unsupervised manner, appealing to object detection, which usually requires multilevel feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUPR outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised pre-trainings and even the ImageNet supervised pre-training on various downstream tasks related to object detection."}}

Inspired by that a human driver can keep accumulating experiences from self-exploring the roads without any tutor\u2019s guidance, we first step forwards to explore a simple yet effective self-supervised learning framework tailored for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. Although the self-supervised pipeline has achieved great success in 2D domain, the characteristic challenges (e.g., complex geometry structure and various 3D object views) encountered in the 3D domain hinder the direct adoption of existing techniques that often contrast the 2D augmented data or cluster single-view features. Here we present a novel self-supervised 3D Object detection framework that seamlessly integrates the geometry-aware contrast and clustering harmonization to lift the unsupervised 3D representation learning, named GCC-3D. First, GCC-3D introduces a Geometric-Aware Contrastive objective to learn spatial-sensitive local structure representation. This objective enforces the spatially close voxels to have high feature similarity. Second, a Pseudo-Instance Clustering harmonization mechanism is proposed to encourage that different views of pseudo-instances should have consistent similarities to clustering prototype centers. This module endows our model semantic discriminative capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate our GCC-3D achieves significant performance improvement on data-efficient 3D object detection benchmarks (nuScenes and Waymo). Moreover, our GCC-3D framework can achieve state-of-the art performances on all popular 3D object detection benchmarks."}}
