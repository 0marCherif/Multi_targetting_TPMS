It is known that the simplest semidefinite programming relaxation, involving minimization of the nuclear norm, does not in general return the solution for this problem. In this paper, we show that in every instance where the problem has a unique solution, one can provably recover the original matrix through the level 2 Lasserre relaxation with minimization of the trace norm. We further show that the solution of the proposed semidefinite program is Lipschitz stable with respect to perturbations of the observed entries, unlike more basic algorithms such as nonlinear propagation or ridge regression. Our proof is based on recursively building a certificate of optimality corresponding to a dual sum-of-squares (SoS) polynomial. This SoS polynomial is built from the polynomial ideal generated by the completion constraints and the monomials provided by the minimization of the trace. The proposed relaxation fits in the framework of the Lasserre hierarchy, albeit with the key addition of the trace objective function. Finally, we show how to represent and manipulate the moment tensor in favorable complexity by means of a hierarchical low-rank factorization."}}

Unlike previous work, our approach does not rely on the Fejer-Riesz Theorem, which prevents developing intuition on the Gram matrix, but requires instead a lower bound on the singular values of a (truncated) large ($O(1e10)$) matrix. Despite the memory requirements which currently prevent dealing with such a matrix efficiently, we show how such lower bounds can be derived through Power iterations and convolutions with special functions for sizes up to $O(1e7)$. We also provide numerical simulations suggesting that the spectrum remains approximately constant with the truncation size as soon as this size is larger than $100$."}}

This problem, also known as blind deconvolution, has been studied extensively by the signal processing and applied mathematics communities, leading to a diversity of proofs and algorithms based on various assumptions on the filter and its input. Sparsity of this filter, or in contrast, non vanishing of its Fourier transform are instances of such assumptions. The main result of this paper shows that blind deconvolution can be solved through nuclear norm relaxation in the case of a fully unknown channel, as soon as this channel is probed through a few $N \\gtrsim \\mu^2_m K^{1/2}$ input signals $x_n = C_n m_n$, $n=1,\\ldots,N,$ that are living in known $K$-dimensional subspaces $C_n$ of $\\mathbb{R}^L$. This result holds with high probability on the genericity of the subspaces $C_n$ as soon as $L\\gtrsim K^{3/2}$ and $N\\gtrsim K^{1/2}$ up to log factors. Our proof system relies on the construction of a certificate of optimality for the underlying convex program. This certificate expands as a Neumann series and is shown to satisfy the conditions for the recovery of the matrix encoding the unknowns by controlling the terms in this series. An incidental consequence of the result of this paper, following from the lack of assumptions on the filter, is that nuclear norm relaxation can be extended from blind deconvolution to blind super-resolution, as soon as the unknown ideal low pass filter has a sufficiently large support compared to the ambient dimension $L$. Numerical experiments supporting the theory as well as its application to blind super-resolution are provided."}}

This problem can be recast as the recovery of a rank-1 matrix, and is effectively relaxed using a semidefinite program (SDP). We show that exact recovery of both the unknown impulse response, and the unknown inputs, occurs when the following conditions are met: (1) the impulse response function is spread in the Fourier domain, and (2) the N input vectors belong to generic, known subspaces of dimension K in \u211dL. Recent results in the well-understood area of low-rank recovery from underdetermined linear measurements can be adapted to show that exact recovery occurs with high probablility (on the genericity of the subspaces) provided that K,L, and N obey the information-theoretic scalings, namely L \u2273 K and N \u2273 1 up to log factors."}}
