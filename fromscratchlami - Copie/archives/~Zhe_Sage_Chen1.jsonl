These diagrams are stylized mixtures of graphics and text and are the result of complicated data-centric production pipelines. Unfortunately, neither text nor image search engines exploit these diagram-specific properties, making it difficult for users to find relevant diagrams in a large corpus. In response, we propose DiagramFlyer, a search engine for finding data-driven diagrams on the web. By recovering the semantic roles of diagram components (e.g., axes, labels, etc.), we provide faceted indexing and retrieval for various statistical diagrams. A unique feature of DiagramFlyer is that it is able to \"expand\" queries to include not only exactly matching diagrams, but also diagrams that are likely to be related in terms of their production pipelines. We demonstrate the resulting search system by indexing over 300k images pulled from over 150k PDF documents."}}

However, spreadsheets are difficult to integrate with other data sources. Converting spreadsheet data to the relational model would allow data analysts to use relational integration tools. We propose a two-phase semiautomatic system that extracts accurate relational metadata while minimizing user effort. Based on an undirected graphical model, our system enables downstream spreadsheet integration applications. First, the automatic extractor uses hints from spreadsheets' graphical style and recovered metadata to extract the spreadsheet data as accurately as possible. Second, the interactive repair identifies similar regions in distinct spreadsheets scattered across large spreadsheet corpora, allowing a user's single manual repair to be amortized over many possible extraction errors. Our experiments show that a human can obtain the accurate extraction with just 31% of the manual operations required by a standard classification based technique on two real-world datasets."}}
