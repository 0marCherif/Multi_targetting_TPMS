In this paper, we propose an automatic practical methodology using time series to estimate the quantity of methane in a given plume using a multispectral satellite like Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 proposes a low revisit time, a good spatial resolution and a low acquisition cost. Contrary to previous methods, the proposed approach does not require a manual selection of an optimal reference image. We compared its performance on an oil-and-gas site in Kazakhstan. This is the first step toward an automatic global monitoring system for methane plume detection and quantification with these satellites."}}

Multi-date images exhibit significant changes in appearance, mainly due to varying shadows and transient objects (cars, vegetation). Robustness to these challenges is achieved by a shadow-aware irradiance model and uncertainty weighting to deal with transient phenomena that cannot be explained by the position of the sun.

This boosts the network performance and can optionally be used to extract additional cues for depth supervision."}}

Numerous recent works have shown the importance of making NeRF models more robust, by means of regularization, in order to train with possibly inconsistent and/or very sparse data. In this work, we explore how differential geometry can provide elegant regularization tools for robustly training NeRF-like models, which are modified so as to represent continuous and infinitely differentiable functions. In particular, we present a generic framework for regularizing different types of NeRFs observations to improve the performance in challenging conditions. We also show how the same formalism can also be used to natively encourage the regularity of surfaces by means of Gaussian or mean curvatures."}}

The extension is rather straightforward: the similar 2D patches are taken from a spatio-temporal neighborhood which includes neighboring frames. In spite of its simplicity, the algorithm offers a good trade-off between denoising performance and computational complexity. In this work we revisit this method, providing an open-source C++ implementation reproducing the results. A detailed description is given and the choice of parameters is thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, we study and compare several extensions of the original algorithm: (1) a multiscale implementation, (2) the use of 3D patches, (3) the use of optical flow to guide the patch search. These extensions yield results which are competitive with the most recent state of the art."}}

These networks predict each frame from a stack of frames around it. Our self-supervised approach benefits from the temporal consistency in the video by minimizing a loss that penalizes the difference between the predicted frame and a neighboring one, after aligning them using an optical flow. We use the proposed strategy to denoise a video contaminated with an unknown noise type, by fine-tuning a pre-trained denoising network on the noisy video. The proposed fine-tuning reaches and sometimes surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art networks trained with supervision. We demonstrate this by showing extensive results on video blind denoising of different synthetic and real noises. In addition, the proposed fine-tuning can be applied to any parameter that controls the denoising performance of the network. We show how this can be expoited to perform joint denoising and noise level estimation for heteroscedastic noise."}}

This new acquisition mode allows for modern image restoration techniques, including multi-frame super-resolution. As the satellite moves during the acquisition of the burst, elevation changes in the scene translate into noticeable parallax. This parallax hinders the results of the restoration. To cope with this issue, we propose a novel parallax estimation method. The method is composed of a linear Plane+Parallax decomposition of the apparent motion and a multi-frame optical flow algorithm that exploits all frames simultaneously. Using SkySat L1A images, we show that the estimated per-pixel displacements are important for applying multi-frame super-resolution on scenes containing elevation changes and that can also be used to estimate a coarse 3D surface model."}}

Here, we address the problem of detecting large methane leaks by using hyperspectral data from the satellite Sentinel-5P. By sampling Sentinel-5P spectral data at fine scale, we detect methane absorption features in the shortwave infrared wavelength range (SWIR). Our method involves two separate steps: i) background subtraction and ii) detection of local maxima in the negative logarithmic spectrum of each pixel. In the first step, we remove the impact of the albedo using albedo maps and the impact of the atmosphere by using a principal component analysis (PCA) over a time series of past observations. In the second step, we count for each pixel the number of local maxima that correspond to a subset of local maxima in the methane absorption spectrum. This counting method allows us to set up a statistical a contrario test that controls the false alarm rate of our detections."}}

Moreover, this information is very often not available to the public even when a measure station is available. The methods usually used are however often unpractical for small lakes, often require images that are costly or difficult to acquire (for example SAR images of sufficient resolution) or with a bad revisit time. In this paper we propose an automatic method for visible satellite images based on a precise tracking of shoreline. It uses bathymetry information of the lake when available but we also present different alternatives that still produce precise estimations. The method is applied to accurately track the water volume of lake of La Bulti\u00e8re in 2019 using only PlanetScope images."}}
