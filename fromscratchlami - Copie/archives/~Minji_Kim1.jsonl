The former learns coarse primary information with low cost while the latter conveys residual information for high fidelity to original representations. The proposed parallel architecture is effective to maintain complementary information since fixed-point arithmetic can be utilized in the quantized network and the lightweight model provides precise representations given by a compact channel-pruned network. We incorporate the hybrid representation technique into an online visual tracking task, where deep neural networks need to handle temporal variations of target appearances in real-time. Compared to the state-of-the-art real-time trackers based on conventional deep neural networks, our tracking algorithm demonstrates competitive accuracy on the standard benchmarks with a small fraction of computational cost and memory footprint."}}

This work introduces a sequence-level training strategy for visual tracking based on reinforcement learning and discusses how a sequence-level design of data sampling, learning objectives, and data augmentation can improve the accuracy and robustness of tracking algorithms. Our experiments on standard benchmarks including LaSOT, TrackingNet, and GOT-10k demonstrate that four representative tracking models, SiamRPN++, SiamAttn, TransT, and TrDiMP, consistently improve by incorporating the proposed methods in training without modifying architectures."}}

Despite this powerful advantage, the ambiguity due to background clutters and occlusions makes the problem of thermal sensor-based tracking intractable. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multiple object tracking in livestock breeding spaces using a single thermal sensor. The key idea of the proposed method is to define a new rotatable elliptical motion model, which is suitable for describing complicated motions of animals. Moreover, the proposed local constraint guides our tracker to robustly chase targets even with severe occlusions. Experimental results on various thermal video sequences show the significant improvement for tracking animals compared to other approaches proposed in the literature."}}
