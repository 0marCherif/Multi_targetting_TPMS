However, images, especially in marketing and advertising applications, are often created as a means to an end as opposed to just aesthetic concerns. The goal can be increasing sales, getting more clicks, likes, or image sales (in the case of stock businesses). Therefore, the generated images need to perform well on these key performance indicators (KPIs), in addition to being aesthetically good. In this paper, we make the first endeavor to answer the question of \"How can one infuse the knowledge of the end-goal within the image generation process itself to create not just better-looking images but also \"better-performing'' images?''. We propose BoigLLM, an LLM that understands both image content and user behavior. BoigLLM knows how an image should look to get a certain required KPI. We show that BoigLLM outperforms 13x larger models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in this task, demonstrating that while these state-of-the-art models can understand images, they lack information on how these images perform in the real world. To generate actual pixels of behavior-conditioned images, we train a diffusion-based model (BoigSD) to align with a proposed BoigLLM-defined reward. We show the performance of the overall pipeline on two datasets covering two different behaviors: a stock dataset with the number of forward actions as the KPI and a dataset containing tweets with the total likes as the KPI, denoted as BoigBench. To advance research in the direction of utility-driven image generation and understanding, we release BoigBench, a benchmark dataset containing 168 million enterprise tweets with their media, brand account names, time of post, and total likes."}}

Feedback can be either explicit (e.g. ranking used in training language models) or implicit (e.g. using human cognitive signals in the form of eyetracking). Prior eye tracking and NLP research reveal that cognitive processes, such as human scanpaths, gleaned from human gaze patterns aid in the understanding and performance of NLP models. However, the collection of real eyetracking data for NLP tasks is challenging due to the requirement of expensive and precise equipment coupled with privacy invasion issues. To address this challenge, we propose ScanTextGAN, a novel model for generating human scanpaths over text. We show that ScanTextGAN-generated scanpaths can approximate meaningful cognitive signals in human gaze patterns. We include synthetically generated scanpaths in four popular NLP tasks spanning six different datasets as proof of concept and show that the models augmented with generated scanpaths improve the performance of all downstream NLP tasks."}}

In this work, we propose HASTE (HArd Subset TransfErability), a new strategy to estimate the transferability of a source model to a particular target task using only a harder subset of target data. By leveraging the model\u2019s internal and output representations, we introduce two techniques \u2013 one class-agnostic and another class-specific \u2013 to identify harder subsets and show that HASTE can be used with any existing transferability metric to improve their reliability. We further analyze the relation between HASTE and the optimal average log-likelihood as well as negative conditional entropy and empirically validate our theoretical bounds. Our experimental results across multiple source model architectures, target datasets, and transfer learning tasks show that HASTE-modified metrics are consistently better or on par with the state-of-the-art transferability metrics."}}

ODE-based models are the dominant paradigm that enable fast simulations and are tractable to gradient-based optimization, but make simplifying assumptions about population homogeneity. Agent-based models (ABMs) are an increasingly popular alternative paradigm that can represent the heterogeneity of contact interactions with granular detail and agency of individual behavior. However, conventional ABM frameworks are not differentiable and present challenges in scalability; due to which it is non-trivial to connect them to auxiliary data sources easily. In this paper we introduce GradABM which is a new scalable, fast and differentiable design for epidemiological ABMs. GradABM runs simulations with million-size populations in few seconds on commodity hardware and enables fast forward and differentiable inverse simulations. This makes it amenable to be merged with deep neural networks and seamlessly integrate heterogeneous data sources to help with calibration, forecasting and policy evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of GradABM via extensive experiments with real COVID-19 and influenza datasets. We are optimistic that the current work will bring ABM and AI communities closer together.\n"}}

For instance, in social dilemma situations, Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents trained to maximize individual rewards converge to mutual defection that is individually and socially sub-optimal. In contrast, humans evolve individual and socially optimal strategies in such social dilemmas. Inspired by ideas from human psychology that attribute this behavior in humans to the status-quo bias, we present a status-quo loss (SQLoss) and the corresponding policy gradient algorithm that incorporates this bias in an RL agent. We demonstrate that agents trained with SQLoss learn individually as well as socially optimal behavior in several social dilemma matrix games. To apply SQLoss to games where cooperation and defection are determined by a sequence of non-trivial actions, we present GameDistill, an algorithm that reduces a multi-step game with visual input to a matrix game. We empirically show how agents trained with SQLoss on GameDistill reduced version of Coin Game and StagHunt evolve optimal policies. Finally, we show that SQLoss extends to a 4-agent setting by demonstrating the emergence of cooperative behavior in the popular Braess' paradox."}}

Many prior works have attempted to leverage structured commonsense present in the form of entities linked through labeled relations in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to assist PTLMs. Retrieval approaches use KG as a separate static module which limits coverage since KGs contain finite knowledge. Generative methods train PTLMs on KG triples to scale the knowledge. However, training on symbolic KG entities limits their application in tasks involving natural language text where they ignore overall context. To mitigate this, we propose a task agnostic CommonSense Contextualizer (CoSe-Co) conditioned on sentences as input to make it generically usable in NLP tasks for generating contextually relevant knowledge in the form of KG paths. We propose a novel dataset comprising of sentence and commonsense path pairs to train CoSe-Co. The knowledge paths inferred by CoSe-Co are diverse, relevant and contain novel entities not present in the underlying KG. Additionally, we show CoSe-Co can be used for KG completion. We augment the generated knowledge in Multi-Choice QA and Open-ended CommonSense Reasoning tasks leading to improvements over current best methods (upto ~3% and ~7% respectively) on CSQA, ARC, QASC and OBQA datasets. Further, improved performance is seen in low training data regimes which shows CoSe-Co knowledge helps in generalising better."}}

Efficiently Augmenting Language Models With External Knowledge", "abstract": "Large transformer-based pre-trained language models have achieved impressive performance on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks and can capture semantic, syntactic, and factual knowledge in their parameters. However, storing large amounts of factual knowledge in the parameters of the model is sub-optimal given the resource requirements and ever-growing amounts of knowledge. Instead of packing all the knowledge in the model parameters, we argue that a more efficient alternative is to provide contextually relevant structured knowledge to the model and train it to use that knowledge. This allows the training of the language model to be de-coupled from the external knowledge source and the latter can be updated without affecting the parameters of the language model. Empirical evaluation using different subsets of LAMA probe reveals that such an approach allows smaller language models with access to external knowledge to achieve significant and robust outperformance over much larger language models."}}

Since they are trained on symbolic KG phrases, applying them on natural language text during inference leads to input distribution shift. To this end, we propose a task agnostic sentence-conditioned generative CommonSense Contextualizer (CoSe-Co), which is trained to generate contextually relevant commonsense inferences given a natural language input. We devise a method to create semantically related sentence-commonsense pairs to train CoSe-Co. We observe commonsense inferences generated by CoSe-Co contain novel concepts that are relevant to the entire sentence context. We evaluate CoSe-Co on multi-choice QA and open-ended commonsense reasoning tasks on the CSQA, ARC, QASC, and OBQA datasets. CoSe-Co outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both these settings, while being task-agnostic, and performs especially well in low data regimes showing it is more robust and generalises better. "}}
