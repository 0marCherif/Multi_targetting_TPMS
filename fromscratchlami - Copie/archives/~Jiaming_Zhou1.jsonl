A critical challenge of video domain generalization is to defend against the heavy reliance on domain-specific cues extracted from the source domain when recognizing target videos. To this end, we propose to perceive diverse spatial-temporal cues in videos, aiming to discover potential domain-invariant cues in addition to domain-specific cues. We contribute a novel model named Spatial-Temporal Diversification Network (STDN), which improves the diversity from both space and time dimensions of video data. First, our STDN proposes to discover various types of spatial cues within individual frames by spatial grouping. Then, our STDN proposes to explicitly model spatial-temporal dependencies between video contents at multiple space-time scales by spatial-temporal relation modeling. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks of different types demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach."}}

A critical challenge of PDA is the negative transfer problem, which is triggered by learning to match the whole source and target domains. To mitigate negative transfer, we note a fact that, it is impossible for a source sample of outlier classes to find a target sample of the same category due to the absence of outlier classes in the target domain, while it is possible for a source sample of shared classes. Inspired by this fact, we exploit the cycle inconsistency, i.e., category discrepancy between the original features and features after cycle transformations, to distinguish outlier classes apart from shared classes in the source domain. Accordingly, we propose to filter out source samples of outlier classes by weight suppression and align the distributions of shared classes between the source and target domains by adversarial learning. To learn accurate weight assignment for filtering out outlier classes, we design cycle transformations based on domain prototypes and soft nearest neighbor, where center losses are introduced in individual domains to reduce the intra-class variation. Experiment results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."}}

These basic relations will jointly affect each other during the temporal evolution of long-term actions, which forms the high-order relations that are essential for long-term action recognition. In this paper, we propose a Graph-based High-order Relation Modeling (GHRM) module to exploit the high-order relations in the long-term actions for long-term action recognition. In GHRM, each basic relation in the long-term actions will be modeled by a graph, where each node represents a segment in a long video. Moreover, when modeling each basic relation, the information from all the other basic relations will be incorporated by GHRM, and thus the high-order relations in the long-term actions can be well exploited. To better exploit the high-order relations along the time dimension, we design a GHRM-layer consisting of a Temporal-GHRM branch and a Semantic-GHRM branch, which aims to model the local temporal high-order relations and global semantic high-order relations. The experimental results on three long-term action recognition datasets, namely, Breakfast, Charades, and MultiThumos, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model."}}
