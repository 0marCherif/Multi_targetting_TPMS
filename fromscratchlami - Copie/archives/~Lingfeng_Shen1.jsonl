However, current adver- sarial training methods have two principal problems: a drop in  model\u2019s  generalization  and  ineffective  defending  against other  text  attacks.  In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  Keyword- bias-aware Adversarial Text Generation model (KATG) that implicitly generates adversarial sentences using a generator- discriminator structure. Instead of using a benign sentence to generate  an  adversarial  sentence,  the  KATG  model  utilizes extra multiple benign sentences (namely prior sentences) to guide adversarial sentence generation. Furthermore, to cover more perturbations used in existing attacks, a keyword-bias- based sampling is proposed to select sentences containing bi- ased words as prior sentences. Besides, to effectively utilize prior sentences, a generative flow mechanism is proposed to construct  a  latent  semantic  space  for  learning  a  latent  rep- resentation of the prior sentences. Experiments demonstrate that adversarial sentences generated by our KATG model can strengthen the generalization and the robustness of text clas- sification models."}}

(2)  Most  commonly  used  metrics  do not  align  well  with  human  annotation.    Un- derlying  reasons  behind  the  above  findings are  explored  through  additional  experiments and  in-depth  analyses.   Based  on  the  exper- iments  and  analyses,  we  propose  ParaScore, a  new  evaluation  metric  for  paraphrase  gen- eration.   It  possesses  the  merits  of  reference- based and reference-free metrics and explicitly models  lexical  divergence.   Experimental  re- sults demonstrate that ParaScore significantly outperforms existing metrics. "}}

A recent line of work, detection-based defense, aims to distinguish adversarial sentences from benign ones. However, {the core limitation of previous detection methods is being incapable of giving correct predictions on adversarial sentences unlike defense methods from other paradigms.} To solve this issue, this paper proposes TextShield: (1) we discover a link between text attack and saliency information, and then we propose a saliency-based detector, which can effectively detect whether an input sentence is adversarial or not. (2) We design a saliency-based corrector, which converts the detected adversary sentences to benign ones. By combining the saliency-based detector and corrector, TextShield extends the detection-only paradigm to a detection-correction paradigm, thus filling the gap in the existing detection-based defense. Comprehensive experiments show that (a) TextShield consistently achieves higher or comparable performance than state-of-the-art defense methods across various attacks on different benchmarks. (b) our saliency-based detector outperforms existing detectors for detecting adversarial sentences."}}
