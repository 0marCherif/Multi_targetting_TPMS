Given a medical volume, a user first segments a slice (or several slices) via the interaction module and then propagates the segmentation(s) to the remaining slices. The user may repeat this process multiple times until a sufficiently high volume segmentation quality is achieved. However, due to the lack of human correction during propagation, segmentation errors are prone to accumulate in the intermediate slices and may lead to sub-optimal performance. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple yet effective cycle consistency loss that regularizes an intermediate segmentation by referencing the accurate segmentation in the starting slice. To this end, we introduce a backward segmentation path that propagates the intermediate segmentation back to the starting slice using the same propagation network. With cycle consistency training, the propagation network is better regularized than in standard forward-only training approaches. Evaluation results on challenging benchmarks such as AbdomenCT-1k and OAI-ZIB demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore cycle consistency learning in interactive volume segmentation."}}

Access to this trove of information, often covering yet-underrepresented use-cases (e.g., AI in medical settings) could fuel a new generation of deep-learning tools. However, eager data scientists should first provide satisfying guarantees w.r.t. the privacy of individuals present in these untapped datasets. This is especially important for images or videos depicting faces, as their biometric information is the target of most identification methods. While a variety of solutions have been proposed to de-identify such images, they often corrupt other non-identifying facial attributes that would be relevant for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose Disguise, a novel algorithm to seamlessly de-identify facial images while ensuring the usability of the altered data. Unlike prior arts, we ground our solution in both differential privacy and ensemble-learning research domains. Our method extracts and swaps depicted identities with fake ones, synthesized via variational mechanisms to maximize obfuscation and non-invertibility; while leveraging the supervision from a mixture-of-experts to disentangle and preserve other utility attributes. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple datasets, demonstrating higher de-identification rate and superior consistency than prior art w.r.t. various downstream tasks."}}

Existing methods require users to provide all the clicks: by first inspecting the segmentation mask and then providing points on mislabeled regions, iteratively. We ask the question: can our model directly predict where to click, so as to further reduce the user interaction cost? To this end, we propose PseudoClick, a generic framework that enables existing segmentation networks to propose candidate next clicks. These automatically generated clicks, termed pseudo clicks in this work, serve as an imitation of human clicks to refine the segmentation mask. We build PseudoClick on existing segmentation backbones and show how the click prediction mechanism leads to improved performance. We evaluate PseudoClick on 10 public datasets from different domains and modalities, showing that our model not only outperforms existing approaches but also demonstrates strong generalization capability in cross-domain evaluation. We obtain new state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmarks, e.g., on the Pascal dataset, our model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art by reducing 12.4% number of clicks to achieve 85% IoU."}}

Existing CNN-based end-to-end patient modeling solutions typically require a) customized network designs demanding large amount of relevant training data, covering extensive realistic clinical scenarios (e.g., patient covered by sheets), which leads to suboptimal generalizability in practical deployment, b) expensive 3D human model annotations, i.e., requiring huge amount of manual effort, resulting in systems that scale poorly. To address these issues, we propose a generic modularized 3D patient modeling method consists of (a) a multi-modal keypoint detection module with attentive fusion for 2D patient joint localization, to learn complementary cross-modality patient body information, leading to improved keypoint localization robustness and generalizability in a wide variety of imaging (e.g., CT, MRI etc.) and clinical scenarios (e.g., heavy occlusions); and (b) a self-supervised 3D mesh regression module which does not require expensive 3D mesh parameter annotations to train, bringing immediate cost benefits for clinical deployment. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method by extensive patient positioning experiments on both public and clinical data. Our evaluation results achieve superior patient positioning performance across various imaging modalities in real clinical scenarios."}}

Recent progress in self-supervised human mesh recovery has been made using synthetic-data-driven training paradigms where the model is trained from synthetic paired 2D representation (e.g., 2D keypoints and segmentation masks) and 3D mesh. However, on synthetic dense correspondence maps (i.e., IUV) few have been explored since the domain gap between synthetic training data and real testing data is hard to address for 2D dense representation. To alleviate this domain gap on IUV, we propose cross-representation alignment utilizing the complementary information from the robust but sparse representation (2D keypoints). Specifically, the alignment errors between initial mesh estimation and both 2D representations are forwarded into regressor and dynamically corrected in the following mesh regression. This adaptive cross-representation alignment explicitly learns from the deviations and captures complementary information: robustness from sparse representation and richness from dense representation. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets and demonstrate competitive results, helping take a step towards reducing the annotation effort needed to produce state-of-the-art models in human mesh estimation."}}

For example, photorealistic differentiable rendering pipelines for color images have been proven highly valuable to applications aiming to map 2D and 3D domains. However, to the best of our knowledge, no effort has been made so far towards extending these gradient-based methods to the generation of depth (2.5D) images, as simulating structured-light depth sensors implies solving complex light transport and stereo-matching problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline for the generation of realistic 2.5D scans, built on physics-based 3D rendering and custom block-matching algorithms. Each module can be differentiated w.r.t. sensor and scene parameters; e.g., to automatically tune the simulation for new devices over some provided scans or to leverage the pipeline as a 3D-to-2.5D transformer within larger computer-vision applications. Applied to the training of deep-learning methods for various depth-based recognition tasks (classification, pose estimation, semantic segmentation), our simulation greatly improves the performance of the resulting models on real scans, thereby demonstrating the fidelity and value of its synthetic depth data compared to previous static simulations and learning-based domain adaptation schemes."}}
