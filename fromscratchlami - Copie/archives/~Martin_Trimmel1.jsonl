In the last few years, the focus has been shifting towards investigating new types of activations that outperform the classical Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) in modern neural architectures. Most recently, rational activation functions (RAFs) have awakened interest because they were shown to perform on par with state-of-the-art activations on image classification. Despite their apparent potential, prior formulations are either not safe, not smooth, or not \"true\" rational functions, and they only work with careful initialisation. Aiming to mitigate these issues, we propose a novel, enhanced rational function, ERA, and investigate how to better accommodate the specific needs of these activations, to both network components and training regime. In addition to being more stable, the proposed function outperforms other standard ones across a range of lightweight network architectures on two different tasks: image classification and 3d human pose and shape reconstruction."}}

With multiple calibration methods having been proposed so far, there has been noteworthy progress in reducing this overconfidence. However, to the best of our knowledge, prior methods have exclusively focused on the factors that affect calibration, leaving open the reverse question of how (mis)calibration impacts network training. Aiming for a better understanding of this interplay, we propose a temperature-based Cooling method for calibrating classification neural networks during training. Cooling has a substantial effect on the gradients and reduces the need for a learning rate schedule. We investigate different variants of Cooling, with the simplest one, last layer Cooling, being also the best-performant one, improving network performance on a range of datasets, network architectures, and hyperparameter settings."}}

For odd activation functions, the set of transformations mapping between such configurations have been studied extensively, but less is known for neural networks with ReLU activation functions. We give a complete characterization for fully-connected networks with two layers. Apart from two well-known transformations, only degenerated situations allow additional transformations that leave the network function unchanged. Reduction steps can remove only part of the degenerated cases. Finally, we present a non-degenerate situation for deep neural networks leading to new transformations leaving the network function intact."}}
