Although such approaches have shown advances in downstream node classification tasks, they are ineffective in jointly representing larger k-node sets, k{&gt;}2. We propose MHM-GNN, an inductive unsupervised graph representation approach that combines joint k-node representations with energy-based models (hypergraph Markov networks) and GNNs. To address the intractability of the loss that arises from this combination, we endow our optimization with a loss upper bound using a finite-sample unbiased Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimator. Our experiments show that the unsupervised joint k-node representations of MHM-GNN produce better unsupervised representations than existing approaches from the literature."}}

In such direction, current and next generations of cellular and vehicular networks foresees adhoc communication. In such paradigm, as entities are constantly moving, connections between them are intermittent and of little, if none, reliability. Recent studies have explored entities connections and how to design efficient ad-hoc communication algorithms for them. In this paper, using real mobility data, we study how and to what extent the entities mobility affects the network (global) and the entities (local) connectivity. We propose and leverage existing mobility metrics to capture both the depth and the spread of entities trajectories. Furthermore, we show how global connectivity is related to the depth of the trajectories, while local connectivity is related to the spread of the trajectories. Finally, as we use both human and vehicular mobility data, we discuss how their mobility nature can affect their mobility characteristics and connectivity."}}

We argue that state-of-the-art authentication mechanisms are either vulnerable to known attacks or do not meet usability needs. To address this problem we designed NomadiKey, a user-to-device authentication mechanism based on nomadic keyboard keys. NomadiKey increases security level by placing keys at different screen coordinates each time NomadiKey is activated. Besides, NomadiKey preserves usability by maintaining the traditional relative position of keys. We compare NomadiKey with other user authentication mechanisms under different attacks using statistical models and simulation. We also evaluate NomadiKey's usability with 18 users. Our results show that NomadiKey increases security compared to widely-deployed PIN authentication with limited impact on authentication times."}}

As the demand for IoT devices grows, the need for stronger authentication and access control mechanisms is greater than ever. Legacy authentication and access control mechanisms do not meet the growing needs of IoT. In particular, there is a dire need for a holistic authentication mechanism throughout the IoT device life-cycle, namely from the manufacturing to the retirement of the device. As a plausible solution, we present Authentication of Things (AoT), a suite of protocols that incorporate authentication and access control during the entire IoT device life span. Primarily, AoT relies on Identity- and Attribute-Based Cryptography to cryptographically enforce Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Additionally, AoT facilitates secure (in terms of stronger authentication) wireless interoperability of new and guest devices in a seamless manner. To validate our solution, we have developed AoT for Android smartphones like the LG G4 and evaluated all the cryptographic primitives over more constrained devices like the Intel Edison and the Arduino Due. This included the implementation of an Attribute-Based Signature (ABS) scheme. Our results indicate AoT ranges from highly efficient on resource-rich devices to affordable on resource-constrained IoT-like devices. Typically, an ABS generation takes around 27 ms on the LG G4, 282 ms on the Intel Edison, and 1.5 s on the Arduino Due."}}
