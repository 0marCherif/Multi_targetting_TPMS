While numerous attack and defense techniques have been developed, this work investigates the robustness issue from a new angle: can we design a self-healing neural network that can automatically detect and fix the vulnerability issue by itself? A typical self-healing mechanism is the immune system of a human body. This biology-inspired idea has been used in many engineering designs but is rarely investigated in deep learning. This paper considers the post-training self-healing of a neural network, and proposes a closed-loop control formulation to automatically detect and fix the errors caused by various attacks or perturbations. We provide a margin-based analysis to explain how this formulation can improve the robustness of a classifier. To speed up the inference of the proposed self-healing network, we solve the control problem via improving the Pontryagin Maximum Principle-based solver. Lastly, we present an error estimation of the proposed framework for neural networks with nonlinear activation functions. We validate the performance on several network architectures against various perturbations. Since the self-healing method does not need a-priori information about data perturbations/attacks, it can handle a broad class of unforeseen perturbations."}}

We rely on techniques from constraint relaxation of non-convex optimisation problems and modify the standard cross-entropy error model to enforce posterior robustness to worst-case perturbations in $\\epsilon$-balls around input points. We illustrate how the resulting framework can be combined with methods commonly employed for approximate inference of BNNs. In an empirical investigation, we demonstrate that the presented approach enables training of certifiably robust models on MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 and can also be beneficial for uncertainty calibration. Our method is the first to directly train certifiable BNNs, thus facilitating their deployment in safety-critical applications."}}

Recent study has shown that a deep neural network can misclassify the data even if the input data is perturbed by an imperceptible amount. In this paper, we address the robustness issue of neural networks by a novel close-loop control method from the perspective of dynamic systems. Instead of modifying the parameters in a fixed neural network architecture, a close-loop control process is added to generate control signals adaptively for the perturbed or corrupted data. We connect the robustness of neural networks with optimal control using the geometrical information of underlying data to design the control objective. The detailed analysis shows how the embedding manifolds of state trajectory affect error estimation of the proposed method. Our approach can simultaneously maintain the performance on clean data and improve the robustness against many types of data perturbations. It can also further improve the performance of robustly trained neural networks against different perturbations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that improves the robustness of neural networks with close-loop control."}}
