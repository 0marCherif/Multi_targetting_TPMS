One potential solution is to leverage unlabeled data (e.g., unlabeled LiDAR point clouds) collected from the end-users' environments (i.e. target domain) to adapt the system to the difference between training and testing environments. While extensive research has been done on such an unsupervised domain adaptation problem, one fundamental problem lingers: there is no reliable signal in the target domain to supervise the adaptation process. To overcome this issue we observe that it is easy to collect unsupervised data from multiple traversals of repeated routes. While different from conventional unsupervised domain adaptation, this assumption is extremely realistic since many drivers share the same roads. We show that this simple additional assumption is sufficient to obtain a potent signal that allows us to perform iterative self-training of 3D object detectors on the target domain. Concretely, we generate pseudo-labels with the out-of-domain detector but reduce false positives by removing detections of supposedly mobile objects that are persistent across traversals. Further, we reduce false negatives by encouraging predictions in regions that are not persistent. We experiment with our approach on two large-scale driving datasets and show remarkable improvement in 3D object detection of cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, bringing us a step closer to generalizable autonomous driving."}}

In this paper, for the first time, we study the transferability of pre-trained models based on synthetic data generated by graphics simulators to downstream tasks from very different domains. In using such synthetic data for pre-training, we find that downstream performance on different tasks are favored by different configurations of simulation parameters (e.g. lighting, object pose, backgrounds, etc.), and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It is thus better to tailor synthetic pre-training data to a specific downstream task, for best performance. We introduce Task2Sim, a unified model mapping downstream task representations to optimal simulation parameters to generate synthetic pre-training data for them. Task2Sim learns this mapping by training to find the set of best parameters on a set of \"seen\" tasks. Once trained, it can then be used to predict best simulation parameters for novel \"unseen\" tasks in one shot, without requiring additional training. Given a budget in number of images per class, our extensive experiments with 20 diverse downstream tasks show Task2Sim's task-adaptive pre-training data results in significantly better downstream performance than non-adaptively choosing simulation parameters on both seen and unseen tasks. It is even competitive with pre-training on real images from Imagenet. \n\n"}}

Many specialized applications of computer vision (e.g. analyzing X-rays or satellite images) have severe resource constraints both during training and inference. While transfer learning is an effective solution for training on small labeled datasets it still often requires a large base model for fine-tuning. In this paper we present a weighted multi-source distillation method; we distill multiple (diverse) source models trained on different domains, weighted by their relevance for the target task, into a single efficient model using limited labeled data. When the goal is accurate recognition under computational constraints, our approach outperforms both transfer learning from strong ImageNet initializations as well as state-of-the-art semi-supervised techniques such as FixMatch. When averaged over 8 diverse target tasks our method outperform the baselines by 5.6%-points and 4.5%-points, respectively."}}

This is true even when the downstream tasks differ greatly from the actual objective used to (pre)train the feature representation. This observation underlies the success of, e.g., few-shot learning, transfer learning and self-supervised learning, among others. However, very little is understood about why such transfer is successful, and more importantly, how one should choose the pre-training task. As a first step towards this understanding, we ask: what makes a feature representation good for a target task? We present simple, intuitive measurements of the feature space that are good predictors of downstream task performance. We present theoretical results showing how these measurements can be used to bound the error of the downstream classifiers, and show empirically that these bounds correlate well with actual downstream performance. Finally, we show that our bounds are practically useful for choosing the right pre-trained representation for a target task."}}
