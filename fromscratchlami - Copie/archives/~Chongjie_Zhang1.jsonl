Adversarial attack is a promising direction to study and improve the robustness of MARL but is largely under-studied. Previous work focuses on deploy-time attacks which may exaggerate attack performance because the MARL learner even does not anticipate the attacker. In this paper, we propose training-time attacks where the learner is allowed to observe and adapt to poisoned experience. For the stealthiness of attacks, we contaminate action sampling and restrict the attack budget so that non-adversarial agents cannot distinguish attacks from exploration noise. We derive two specific attack methods by modeling the influence of action-sampling on experience replay and further on team performance. Experiments show that our methods significantly undermine MARL algorithms by subtly disturbing the exploration-exploitation balance during the learning process.\n"}}

Recently researchers propose offline MARL algorithms to improve scalability by reducing online exploration cost, while the problem of partial observability is often ignored in the offline MARL setting. Communication is a promising approach to alleviate the miscoordination caused by partially observability, thus in this paper we focus on offline communication learning where agents learn from an fixed dataset. We find out that learning communications in an end-to-end manner from a given offline dateset without communication information is intractable, since the correct communication protocol space is too sparse compared with the exponentially growing joint state-action space when the number of agents increases. Besides, unlike offline policy learning which can be guided by reward signals, offline communication learning is struggling since communication messages implicitly impact the reward. Moreover, in real-world applications, offline MARL datasets are often collected from multi-source, leaving offline MARL communication learning more challenging. Therefore, we present a new benchmark which contains a diverse set of challenging offline MARL communication tasks with single/multi-source datasets, and propose a novel Multi-Head structure for Communication Imitation learning (MHCI) algorithm that automatically adapts to the distribution of the dataset. Empirical result shows the effectiveness of our method on various tasks of the new offline communication learning benchmark."}}

To achieve higher scalability, the paradigm of centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) is broadly adopted with factorized structure in MARL. However, we observe that existing CTDE algorithms in cooperative MARL cannot achieve optimality even in simple matrix games. To understand this phenomenon, we analyze two mainstream classes of CTDE algorithms -- actor-critic algorithms and value-decomposition algorithms. Our theoretical and experimental results characterize the weakness of these two classes of algorithms when the optimization method is taken into consideration, which indicates that the currently used centralized training manner is deficient in compatibility with decentralized policy. To address this issue, we present a transformation framework that reformulates a multi-agent MDP as a special \"single-agent\" MDP with a sequential structure and can allow employing off-the-shelf single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL) algorithms to efficiently learn corresponding multi-agent tasks. After that, a decentralized policy can still be learned by distilling the \"single-agent\" policy. This framework retains the optimality guarantee of SARL algorithms into cooperative MARL. To instantiate this transformation framework, we propose a Transformed PPO, called T-PPO, which can theoretically perform optimal policy learning in the finite multi-agent MDPs and shows significant outperformance on a large set of cooperative multi-agent tasks."}}

However, the question of how to conduct self-supervised offline reinforcement learning (RL) in a principled way remains unclear.\nIn this paper, we address this issue by investigating the theoretical benefits of utilizing reward-free data in linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) within a semi-supervised setting. Further, we propose a novel, Provable Data Sharing algorithm (PDS) to utilize such reward-free data for offline RL. PDS uses additional penalties on the reward function learned from labeled data to prevent overestimation, ensuring a conservative algorithm. Our results on various offline RL tasks demonstrate that PDS significantly improves the performance of offline RL algorithms with reward-free data. Overall, our work provides a promising approach to leveraging the benefits of unlabeled data in offline RL while maintaining theoretical guarantees. We believe our findings will contribute to developing more robust self-supervised RL methods.\n"}}

Recent offline meta-RL methods typically use task-dependent behavior policies (e.g., training RL agents on each individual task) to collect a multi-task dataset and learn an offline meta-policy. However, these methods always require extra information for fast adaptation, such as offline context for testing tasks or oracle reward functions. Offline meta-RL with few-shot online adaptation remains an open problem. In this paper, we first formally characterize a unique challenge under this setting: data distribution mismatch between offline training and online adaptation. This distribution mismatch may lead to unreliable offline policy evaluation and the regular adaptation methods of online meta-RL will suffer. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel mechanism of data distribution correction, which ensures the consistency between offline and online evaluation by filtering out out-of-distribution episodes in online adaptation. As few-shot out-of-distribution episodes usually have lower returns, we propose a Greedy Context-based data distribution Correction approach, called GCC, which greedily infers how to solve new tasks. GCC diversely samples \u201ctask hypotheses\u201d from the current posterior belief and selects a greedy hypothesis with the highest return to update the task belief. Our method is the first to provide an effective online adaptation without additional information, and can be combined with off-the-shelf context-based offline meta-training algorithms. Empirical experiments show that GCC achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Meta-World ML1 benchmark compared to baselines with/without offline adaptation. "}}

We discover that coming with intrinsic rewards is the issue of revisitation -- the relative values of intrinsic rewards fluctuate, causing a sub-space visited before becomes attractive after a period of exploration to other areas. Consequently, agents risk exploring some sub-spaces repeatedly. In this paper, we formally define the concept of revisitation, based on which we propose an observation-distribution matching approach to detect the appearance of revisitation. To avoid it, we add branches to agents' local Q-networks and the mixing network to separate sub-spaces which have already been revisited. Furthermore, to prevent adding branches excessively, we design intrinsic rewards to reduce the probability of and penalize the occurrence of revisitation. By virtue of these advances, our method achieves superior performance on three challenging Google Research Football (GRF) scenarios with sparse rewards. "}}
