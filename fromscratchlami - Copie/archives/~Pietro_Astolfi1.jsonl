It is composed of millions of virtual fibers, encoded as 3D polylines, which approximate the white matter axonal pathways. To date, tractograms are the most accurate white matter representation and thus are used for tasks like presurgical planning and investigations of neuroplasticity, brain disorders, or brain networks. However, it is a well-known issue that a large portion of tractogram fibers is not anatomically plausible and can be considered artifacts of the tracking procedure. With Verifyber, we tackle the problem of filtering out such non-plausible fibers using a novel fully-supervised learning approach. Differently from other approaches based on signal reconstruction and/or brain topology regularization, we guide our method with the existing anatomical knowledge of the white matter. Using tractograms annotated according to anatomical principles, we train our model, Verifyber, to classify fibers as either anatomically plausible or non-plausible. The proposed Verifyber model is an original Geometric Deep Learning method that can deal with variable size fibers, while being invariant to fiber orientation. Our model considers each fiber as a graph of points, and by learning features of the edges between consecutive points via the proposed sequence Edge Convolution, it can capture the underlying anatomical properties. The output filtering results highly accurate and robust across an extensive set of experiments, and fast; with a 12GB GPU, filtering a tractogram of 1M fibers requires less than a minute. Verifyber implementation and trained models are available at https://github.com/FBK-NILab/verifyber."}}

Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) techniques and tractography techniques provide a representation of the anatomical connections in the white matter, as hundreds of thousands of streamlines, forming the tractogram. The literature on methods for aligning tractograms is in active development and provides methods that operate either from voxel information, e.g. fractional anisotropy, orientation distribution function, T1-weighted MRI, or directly from streamline information. In this work, we align streamlines using the linear assignment problem (LAP) and propose a method to reduce the high computational cost of aligning whole brain tractograms. As further contribution, we present a comparison among some of the freely-available linear and nonlinear tractogram alignment methods, where we show that our LAP-based method outperforms all others. In discussing the results, we show that a main limitation of all streamline-based nonlinear registration methods is the computational cost and that addressing such problem may lead to further improvement in the quality of registration."}}

Meanwhile, computer vision and machine learning have experienced a paradigm shift with the renaissance of deep learning, which has set the new state-of-the-art in many related fields. Inspired by successful applications of deep learning for other biometric modalities, we propose a novel approach to 3D hand shape recognition from RGB-D data based on geometric deep learning techniques. We show how to train our model on synthetic data and retain the performance on real samples during test time. To evaluate our method, we provide a new dataset NNHand RGB- D of short video sequences and show encouraging performance compared to diverse baselines on the new data, as well as current benchmark dataset HKPolyU. Moreover, the new dataset opens door to many new research directions in hand shape recognition."}}

First, the very high variability in the morphology of the tissues can be incompatible with the prior knowledge embedded within the algorithms. Second, the availability of MR images of distorted brains is very scarce, so the methods in the literature have not addressed such cases so far. In this work, we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art automatic tissue segmentation pipelines on T1-weighted images of brains with different severity of congenital or acquired brain distortion. We compare traditional pipelines and a deep learning model, i.e. a 3D U-Net trained on normal-appearing brains. Unsurprisingly, traditional pipelines completely fail to segment the tissues with strong anatomical distortion. Surprisingly, the 3D U-Net provides useful segmentations that can be a valuable starting point for manual refinement by experts/neuroradiologists."}}

Current methods of tract dissection are not robust with respect to false positives and are neglecting the neuroanatomical waypoints of a given tract, like the stem. In this work we design a deep learning model to segment the stem of IFOF and we show how the dissection of the tract can be improved. The proposed method is validated on the Human Connectome Project dataset, where expert neuroanatomists segmented the IFOF on multiple subjects. In addition we compare the results to the most recent method in the literature for automatic tract dissection."}}
