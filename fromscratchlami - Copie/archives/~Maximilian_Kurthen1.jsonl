This task isto infer an existing causal relation between two random variables, i.e.X\u2192Y or Y\u2192X, from purely observational data.  As the option to modify a potential cause is not given in many situations only structural properties of the data can be used to solve this ill-posed problem. We briefly review a numberof state-of-the-art methods for this, including very recent ones. A novel inference method is introduced,Bayesian Causal Inference(BCI)1, which assumes a generative Bayesian hierarchical model to pursue thestrategy of Bayesian model selection. In the adopted model the distribution of the cause variable is givenby a Poisson lognormal distribution, which allows to explicitly regard the discrete nature of datasets,correlations in the parameter spaces, as well as the variance of probability densities on logarithmic scales.We assume Fourier diagonal Field covariance operators. The model itself is restricted to use cases wherea direct causal relationX\u2192Yhas to be decided against a relationY\u2192X, therefore we compare itother methods for this exact problem setting. The generative model assumed provides synthetic causaldata for benchmarking our model in comparison to existing State-of-the-art models, namelyLiNGAM,ANM-HSIC,ANM-MML,IGCIandCGNN. We explore how well the above methods perform in caseof high noise settings, strongly discretized data and very sparse data.BCIperforms generally reliablewith synthetic data as well as with the real worldTCEPbenchmark set, with an accuracy comparable tostate-of-the-art algorithms. We discuss directions for the future development of BCI"}}
