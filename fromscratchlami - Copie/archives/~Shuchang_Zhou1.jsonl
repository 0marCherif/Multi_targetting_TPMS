However, most of the current methods suffer from large model sizes and require extra inputs, e.g., semantic/depth maps, for promising performance. For efficiency consideration, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Multi-scale Voxel Flow Network (DMVFN) to achieve better video prediction performance at lower computational costs with only RGB images, than previous methods. The core of our DMVFN is a differentiable routing module that can effectively perceive the motion scales of video frames. Once trained, our DMVFN selects adaptive sub-networks for different inputs at the inference stage. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that our DMVFN is an order of magnitude faster than Deep Voxel Flow and surpasses the state-of-the-art iterative-based OPT on generated image quality.

However, different architectures, including plain Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Tensors, low-rank Tensors, Hashtables, and their compositions, have their trade-offs. For instance, Hashtables-based representations allow for faster rendering but lack clear geometric meaning, making spatial-relation-aware editing challenging. To address this limitation and maximize the potential of each architecture, we propose Progressive Volume Distillation with Active Learning (PVD-AL), a systematic distillation method that enables any-to-any conversions between different architectures. PVD-AL decomposes each structure into two parts and progressively performs distillation from shallower to deeper volume representation, leveraging effective information retrieved from the rendering process. Additionally, a Three-Levels of active learning technique provides continuous feedback during the distillation process, resulting in high-performance results. Empirical evidence is presented to validate our method on multiple benchmark datasets. For example, PVD-AL can distill an MLP-based model from a Hashtables-based model at a 10~20X faster speed and 0.8dB~2dB higher PSNR than training the NeRF model from scratch. Moreover, PVD-AL permits the fusion of diverse features among distinct structures, enabling models with multiple editing properties and providing a more efficient model to meet real-time requirements.

We observe that direct adaptation of self-supervised learning (SSL) to universally slimmable networks misbehaves as the training process frequently collapses. We then discover that temporal consistent guidance is the key to the success of SSL for universally slimmable networks, and we propose three guidelines for the loss design to ensure this temporal consistency from a unified gradient perspective. Moreover, we propose dynamic sampling and group regularization strategies to simultaneously improve training efficiency and accuracy. Our US3L method has been empirically validated on both convolutional neural networks and vision transformers. With only once training and one copy of weights, our method outperforms various state-of-the-art methods (individually trained or not) on benchmarks including recognition, object detection and instance segmentation.

Since the multi-modal methods have system complexity while the accuracy of single-modal ones is relatively low, how to make a tradeoff between them is difficult. In this work, we propose a universal cross-modality knowledge distillation framework (UniDistill) to improve the performance of single-modality detectors. Specifically, during training, UniDistill projects the features of both the teacher and the student detector into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV), which is a friendly representation for different modalities. Then, three distillation losses are calculated to sparsely align the foreground features, helping the student learn from the teacher without introducing additional cost during inference. Taking advantage of the similar detection paradigm of different detectors in BEV, UniDistill easily supports LiDAR-to-camera, camera-to-LiDAR, fusion-to-LiDAR and fusion-to-camera distillation paths. Furthermore, the three distillation losses can filter the effect of misaligned background information and balance between objects of different sizes, improving the distillation effectiveness. Extensive experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that UniDistill effectively improves the mAP and NDS of student detectors by 2.0%~3.2%."}}

It is challenging to estimate the complete geometry and semantics of a scene solely from visual images, and accurate depth information is crucial for restoring 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose the first stereo SSC method named OccDepth, which fully exploits implicit depth information from stereo images (or RGBD images) to help the recovery of 3D geometric structures. The Stereo Soft Feature Assignment (Stereo-SFA) module is proposed to better fuse 3D depth-aware features by implicitly learning the correlation between stereo images. In particular, when the input are RGBD image, a virtual stereo images can be generated through original RGB image and depth map. Besides, the Occupancy Aware Depth (OAD) module is used to obtain geometry-aware 3D features by knowledge distillation using pre-trained depth models. In addition, a reformed TartanAir benchmark, named SemanticTartanAir, is provided in this paper for further testing our OccDepth method on SSC task. Compared with the state-of-the-art RGB-inferred SSC method, extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI show that our OccDepth method achieves superior performance with improving +4.82% mIoU, of which +2.49% mIoU comes from stereo images and +2.33% mIoU comes from our proposed depth-aware method.

However, most existing quantization methods have been developed mainly on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and suffer severe degradation when applied to fully quantized vision transformers. In this work, we demonstrate that many of these difficulties arise because of serious inter-channel variation in LayerNorm inputs, and present, Power-of-Two Factor (PTF), a systematic method to reduce the performance degradation and inference complexity of fully quantized vision transformers. In addition, observing an extreme non-uniform distribution in attention maps, we propose Log-Int-Softmax (LIS) to sustain that and simplify inference by using 4-bit quantization and the BitShift operator. Comprehensive experiments on various transformer-based architectures and benchmarks show that our Fully Quantized Vision Transformer (FQ-ViT) outperforms previous works while even using lower bit-width on attention maps. For instance, we reach 84.89% top-1 accuracy with ViT-L on ImageNet and 50.8 mAP with Cascade Mask R-CNN (Swin-S) on COCO. To our knowledge, we are the first to achieve lossless accuracy degradation (~1%) on fully quantized vision transformers. The code is available at https://github.com/megvii-research/FQ-ViT."}}

In general, the high diversity of body shapes of anime characters defies the employment of universal body models like SMPL, which are developed from real-world humans. To overcome this difficulty, CoNR uses a compact and easy-to-obtain landmark encoding to avoid creating a unified UV mapping in the pipeline. In addition, the performance of CoNR can be significantly improved when referring to multiple reference images, thanks to feature space cross-view warping in a carefully designed neural network. Moreover, we have collected a character sheet dataset containing over 700,000 hand-drawn and synthesized images of diverse poses to facilitate research in this area.
