Specifically, this task is motivated by a cognitive difference phenomenon that humans with different personality traits tend to give different personality-oriented textual descriptions when observing an image. In particular, to tackle the inherent noise challenges in this CMPC task, we propose a tailored reinforcement learning approach, namely, multi-agent SelectNet, aiming to integrate the opinion-word and image-region selection strategies to select informative opinion-word and image-region features for CMPC. To justify the effectiveness of our approach, we construct six kinds of multimodal personality classification datasets and conduct extensive experiments on the datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can significantly outperform other strong competitors, including the state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal approaches."}}

Specifically, this task is motivated by a cognition difference phenomenon that humans with different personality traits tend to focus on different portions of the image and then give different personality-oriented language descriptions when observing an image. On this basis, we propose a new Language-guided Contrastive Visual Attention (L-CVA) approach to capture the above cognition difference information for addressing the C-RPD task. Experimental results on a real-world multimodal personality corpus verify the great advantage of our L-CVA approach to C-RPD over the state-of-the-art baselines. This justifies the importance of the cognition difference information to C-RPD and the effectiveness of our approach in capturing such information."}}

However, previous studies on sentiment classification in dialogues largely ignore topic information, which is important for capturing overall information in some types of dialogues. In this study, we focus on the sentiment classification task in an important type of dialogue, namely customer service dialogue, and propose a novel approach which captures overall information to enhance the classification performance. Specifically, we propose a topic-aware multi-task learning (TML) approach which learns topic-enriched utterance representations in customer service dialogue by capturing various kinds of topic information. In the experiment, we propose a large-scale and high-quality annotated corpus for the sentiment classification task in customer service dialogue and empirical studies on the proposed corpus show that our approach significantly outperforms several strong baselines."}}

To well automatically analyze the opinion information inside multimodal data, it\u2019s crucial to perform aspect term extraction (ATE) on them. However, until now, the researches focus on multimodal ATE are rare. In this study, we take a step further than previous studies by proposing a Region-aware Alignment Network (RAN) that aligns text with object regions that show in an image for the multimodal ATE task. Experiments on the Twitter dataset showcase the effectiveness of our proposed model. Further researches prove that our model has better performance when extracting emotion polarized aspect terms."}}

To well automatically analyze the aspect information inside QA style reviews, it\u2019s worthwhile to perform aspect classification on them. Unfortunately, until now, there are few papers that focus on performing aspect classification on the QA style reviews. For short, we referred to this novel task as QA aspect classification (QA-AC). In this study, we model this task as a multi-label classification problem where each QA style review is explicitly mapped to multiple aspect categories instead of only one aspect category. To solve this issue, we propose a contextualized attention-based neural network approach to capture both the contextual information and the QA matching information inside QA style reviews for the task of QA-AC. Specifically, we first propose two aggregating strategies to integrate multi-layer contextualized word embeddings of the pre-trained language representation model (i.e., BERT) so as to capture contextual information. Second, we propose a bidirectional attention layer to capture the QA matching information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to QA-AC."}}

However, these approaches often offer little transparency w.r.t. their inner working mechanisms and lack interpretability. In this paper, to simulating the steps of analyzing aspect sentiment in a document by human beings, we propose a new Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approach to DASC. This approach incorporates clause selection and word selection strategies to tackle the data noise problem in the task of DASC. First, a high-level policy is proposed to select aspect-relevant clauses and discard noisy clauses. Then, a low-level policy is proposed to select sentiment-relevant words and discard noisy words inside the selected clauses. Finally, a sentiment rating predictor is designed to provide reward signals to guide both clause and word selection. Experimental results demonstrate the impressive effectiveness of the proposed approach to DASC over the state-of-the-art baselines."}}
