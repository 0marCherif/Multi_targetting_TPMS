However, existing VFL methods are facing two challenges: (1) scalability when # participants grows to even modest scale and (2) diminishing return w.r.t. # participants: not all participants are equally important and many will not introduce quality improvement in a large consortium. Inspired by these two challenges, in this paper, we ask: How can we select l out of m participants, where l \u226a m, that are most important?\nWe call this problem Vertically Federated Participant Selection, and model it with a principled mutual information-based view. Our first technical contribution is VF-MINE\u2014a Vertically Federated Mutual INformation Estimator\u2014that uses one of the most celebrated algorithms in database theory\u2014Fagin\u2019s algorithm as a building block. Our second contribution is to further optimize VF-MINE to enable VF-PS, a group testing-based participant selection framework. We empirically show that vertically federated participation selection can be orders of magnitude faster than training a full-fledged VFL model, while being able to identify the most important subset of participants that often lead to a VFL model of similar quality.\n"}}

Vertical federated learning (VFL) describes such a case where ML models are built upon the private data of different participated parties that own disjoint features for the same set of instances, which fits many real-world collaborative tasks.

To this end, this paper aims to investigate both the functionality and security of ML modes in the VFL scenario. To be specific, we introduce BlindFL, a novel framework for VFL training and inference. First, to address the functionality of VFL models, we propose the federated source layers to unite the data from different parties. Various kinds of features can be supported efficiently by the federated source layers, including dense, sparse, numerical, and categorical features. Second, we carefully analyze the security during the federated execution and formalize the privacy requirements. Based on the analysis, we devise secure and accurate algorithm protocols, and further prove the security guarantees under the ideal-real simulation paradigm.

Although network motif has been studied in graph analytics, e.g., social network and biological network, it is yet unclear whether network motif is useful for analyzing online transaction network that is generated in applications such as instant messaging and e-commerce. In this work, we analyze online transaction networks from the perspective of network motif. We define vertex features based on size-2 and size-3 motifs, and introduce motif-based centrality measurements. We further design motif-based vertex embedding that integrates weighted motif counts and centrality measurements. Afterward, we implement a distributed framework for motif detection in large-scale online transaction networks. To understand the effectiveness of motif for analyzing online transaction network, we study the statistical distribution of motifs in various kinds of graphs in Tencent and assess the benefit of motif-based embedding in a range of downstream graph analytical tasks. Empirical results show that our proposed method can efficiently find motifs in large-scale graphs, help interpretability, and benefit downstream tasks."}}

In the training phase, VFL only exchanges the intermediate statistics, i.e., forward activations and backward derivatives, across parties to compute model gradients. Nevertheless, due to its geo-distributed nature, VFL training usually suffers from the low WAN bandwidth. In this paper, we introduce CELU-VFL, a novel and efficient VFL training framework that exploits the local update technique to reduce the cross-party communication rounds. CELU-VFL caches the stale statistics and reuses them to estimate model gradients without exchanging the ad hoc statistics. Significant techniques are proposed to improve the convergence performance. First, to handle the stochastic variance problem, we propose a uniform sampling strategy to fairly choose the stale statistics for local updates. Second, to harness the errors brought by the staleness, we devise an instance weighting mechanism that measures the reliability of the estimated gradients. Theoretical analysis proves that CELU-VFL achieves a similar sub-linear convergence rate as vanilla VFL training but requires much fewer communication rounds. Empirical results on both public and real-world workloads validate that CELU-VFL can be up to six times faster than the existing works."}}

Nevertheless, to achieve privacy preservation, vertical FL algorithms involve complicated training routines and time-consuming cryptography operations, leading to slow training speed. This paper explores the efficiency of the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm under the vertical FL setting. Specifically, we introduce VF^2Boost, a novel and efficient vertical federated GBDT system. Significant solutions are developed to tackle the major bottlenecks. First, to handle the deficiency caused by frequent mutual-waiting in federated training, we propose a concurrent training protocol to reduce the idle periods. Second, to speed up the cryptography operations, we analyze the characteristics of the algorithm and propose customized operations. Empirical results show that our system can be 12.8-18.9 times faster than the existing vertical federated implementations and support much larger datasets."}}
