However, recent studies have shown that even the best VL models struggle to capture aspects of scene understanding, such as object attributes, relationships, and action states. In contrast, obtaining structured annotations, e.g., scene graphs (SGs) that could improve these models is time-consuming, costly, and tedious, and thus cannot be used on a large scale. Here we ask, can small datasets containing SG annotations provide sufficient information for enhancing structured understanding of VL models? We show that it is indeed possible to improve VL models using such data by utilizing a specialized model architecture and a new training paradigm. Our approach captures structure-related information for both the visual and textual encoders by directly supervising both components when learning from SG labels. We use scene graph supervision to generate fine-grained captions based on various graph augmentations highlighting different compositional aspects of the scene, and to predict SG information using an open vocabulary approach by adding special ``Adaptive SG tokens'' to the visual encoder. Moreover, we design a new adaptation technique tailored specifically to the SG tokens that allows better learning of the graph prediction task while still maintaining zero-shot capabilities. Our model shows strong performance improvements on the Winoground and VL-checklist datasets with only a mild degradation in zero-shot performance."}}

However, the aligned image-text spaces learned by all the popular VL models are still suffering from the so-called `object bias' - their representations behave as `bags of nouns', mostly ignoring or downsizing the attributes, relations, and states of objects described/appearing in texts/images. Although some great attempts at fixing these `compositional reasoning' issues were proposed in the recent literature, the problem is still far from being solved. In this paper, we uncover two factors limiting the VL models' compositional reasoning performance. These two factors are properties of the paired VL dataset used for finetuning and pre-training the VL model: (i) the caption quality, or in other words `image-alignment', of the texts; and (ii) the `density' of the captions in the sense of mentioning all the details appearing on the image. We propose a fine-tuning approach for automatically treating these factors leveraging a standard VL dataset (CC3M). Applied to CLIP, we demonstrate its significant compositional reasoning performance increase of up to $\\sim27\\%$ over the base model, up to $\\sim20\\%$ over the strongest baseline, and by $6.7\\%$ on average."}}

A common approach is to fine-tune a model on a set of labeled videos of actions performed in that environment. Such an approach is costly, since we need to record and annotate the videos, and fine-tune the model. At the same time, there has been recent interest in AR models that take an object-centric approach. In many cases these models are more structured, e.g., containing a module dedicated to object localization. Could we perform adaptation to a new environment via objects alone? We propose to re-use a previously trained AR model and \\emph{only adapt its object localization module}. Specifically, we train class-agnostic detectors that can adapt to each new environment. The idea of performing AR model adaptation via objects is novel and promising. While it requires some annotated images with the localized objects in the new environment, such supervision cost is lower than that of a conventional approach above. We conduct experiments on unseen kitchens in within- and across- dataset settings using Epic-Kitchen and EGTEA benchmarks, and show that AR models equipped with our object detectors can efficiently adapt to new environments."}}

In this paper, different from most cross-domain works that utilize some (or full) source domain supervision, we approach a relatively new and very practical Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) setup of having no training supervision in neither source nor target domains. Our approach is based on self-supervised learning of a Bridge Across Domains (BrAD) - an auxiliary bridge domain accompanied by a set of semantics preserving visual (image-to-image) mappings to BrAD from each of the training domains. The BrAD and mappings to it are learned jointly (end-to-end) with a contrastive self-supervised representation model that semantically aligns each of the domains to its BrAD-projection, and hence implicitly drives all the domains (seen or unseen) to semantically align to each other. In this work, we show how using an edge-regularized BrAD our approach achieves significant gains across multiple benchmarks and a range of tasks, including UDG, Few-shot UDA, and unsupervised generalization across multi-domain datasets (including generalization to unseen domains and classes)."}}

In this work, we present Object-Region Video Transformers (ORViT), an object-centric approach that extends video transformer layers with a block that directly incorporates object representations. The key idea is to fuse object-centric representations starting from early layers and propagate them into the transformer-layers, thus affecting the spatio-temporal representations throughout the network. Our ORViT block consists of two object-level streams: appearance and dynamics. In the appearance stream, an \u201cObject-Region Attention\u201d module applies self-attention over the patches and object regions. In this way, visual object regions interact with uniform patch tokens and enrich them with contextualized object information. We further model object dynamics via a separate \u201cObject-Dynamics Module\u201d, which captures trajectory interactions, and show how to integrate the two streams. We evaluate our model on four tasks and five datasets: compositional and few-shot action recognition on SomethingElse, spatio-temporal action detection on AVA, and standard action recognition on Something-Something V2, Diving48 and Epic-Kitchen100. We show strong performance improvement across all tasks and datasets considered, demonstrating the value of a model that incorporates object representations into a transformer architecture.

Instead, we introduce DETReg, a new self-supervised method that pretrains the entire object detection network, including the object localization and embedding components. During pretraining, DETReg predicts object localizations to match the localizations from an unsupervised region proposal generator and simultaneously aligns the corresponding feature embeddings with embeddings from a self-supervised image encoder. We implement DETReg using the DETR family of detectors and show that it improves over competitive baselines when finetuned on COCO, PASCAL VOC, and Airbus Ship benchmarks. In low-data regimes, including semi-supervised and few-shot learning settings, DETReg establishes many state-of-the-art results, e.g., on COCO we see a +6.0 AP improvement for 10-shot detection and over 2 AP improvements when training with only 1 % of the labels. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> Code: https://www.amirbar.net/detreg/."}}
