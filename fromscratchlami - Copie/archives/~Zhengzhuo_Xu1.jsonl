In this paper, we revisit recent LTR methods with promising Vision Transformers (ViT). We figure out that 1) ViT is hard to train with long-tailed data. 2) ViT learns generalized features in an unsupervised manner, like mask generative training, either on long-tailed or balanced datasets. Hence, we propose to adopt unsupervised learning to utilize long-tailed data. Furthermore, we propose the Predictive Distribution Calibration (PDC) as a novel metric for LTR, where the model tends to simply classify inputs into common classes. Our PDC can measure the model calibration of predictive preferences quantitatively. On this basis, we find many LTR approaches alleviate it slightly, despite the accuracy improvement. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that PDC reflects the model's predictive preference precisely, which is consistent with the visualization."}}

Existing LTR methods seldom train Vision Transformers (ViTs) with Long-Tailed (LT) data, while the off-the-shelf pretrain weight of ViTs always leads to unfair comparisons. In this paper, we systematically investigate the ViTs' performance in LTR and propose LiVT to train ViTs from scratch only with LT data. With the observation that ViTs suffer more severe LTR problems, we conduct Masked Generative Pretraining (MGP) to learn generalized features. With ample and solid evidence, we show that MGP is more robust than supervised manners. In addition, Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss, which shows conspicuous performance with ViTs, encounters predicaments in LTR. We further propose the balanced BCE to ameliorate it with strong theoretical groundings. Specially, we derive the unbiased extension of Sigmoid and compensate extra logit margins to deploy it. Our Bal-BCE contributes to the quick convergence of ViTs in just a few epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that with MGP and Bal-BCE, LiVT successfully trains ViTs well without any additional data and outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods significantly, e.g., our ViT-B achieves 81.0% Top-1 accuracy in iNaturalist 2018 without bells and whistles.

The key and difficulty of exemplar-based colorization is to establish an accurate correspondence between these two images. Previous approaches have attempted to construct such a correspondence but are faced with two obstacles. First, using luminance channel for the calculation of correspondence is inaccurate. Second, the dense correspondence they built introduces wrong matching results and increases the computation burden. To address these two problems, we propose Semantic-Sparse Colorization Network (SSCN) to transfer both the global image style and detailed semantic-related colors to the gray-scale image in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our network can perfectly balance the global and local colors while alleviating the ambiguous matching problem. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluation and achieves state-of-the-art performance."}}

However, learning representative spatiotemporal features for prediction is challenging. Moreover, chaotic uncertainty among consecutive frames exacerbates the difficulty in long-term prediction. This paper concentrates on improving prediction quality by enhancing the correspondence between the previous context and the current state. We carefully design Detail Context Block (DCB) to extract fine-grained details and improve the isolated correlation between upper context state and current input state. We integrate DCB with standard ConvLSTM and introduce Motion Details RNN (MoDeRNN) to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal features and improve the expression of latent states of RNNs to achieve significant quality. Experiments on Moving MNIST and Typhoon datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. MoDeRNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques qualitatively and quantitatively with lower computation loads."}}

The na\u00efve models supervised by such datasets would prefer dominant labels, encounter a serious generalization challenge and become poorly calibrated. We propose two novel methods from the prior perspective to alleviate this dilemma. First, we deduce a balance-oriented data augmentation named Uniform Mixup (UniMix) to promote mixup in long-tailed scenarios, which adopts advanced mixing factor and sampler in favor of the minority. Second, motivated by the Bayesian theory, we figure out the Bayes Bias (Bayias), an inherent bias caused by the inconsistency of prior, and compensate it as a modification on standard cross-entropy loss. We further prove that both the proposed methods ensure the classification calibration theoretically and empirically. Extensive experiments verify that our strategies contribute to a better-calibrated model, and their combination achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.\n"}}
