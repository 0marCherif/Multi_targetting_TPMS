A transmitter Alice sends messages to the receiver Bob in the presence of a hidden adversary Calvin. The adversary Calvin can both eavesdrop and jam on (possibly non-identical) subsets of transmission links. The goal is to communicate reliably (intended receiver can understand the messages) and secretly (adversary cannot understand the messages). Two kinds of jamming, additive and overwrite, are considered. Additive jamming corresponds to wireless network model while overwrite jamming corresponds to wired network model and storage systems. The multipath network consists of C parallel links. Calvin can both jam and eavesdrop any z io number of links, can eavesdrop (but not jam) any z i/o number of links, and can jam (but not eavesdrop) any z o/i number of links. We present the first \u201ccomplete\u201d information-theoretic characterization of maximum achievable rate as a function of the number of links that can be jammed and/or eavesdropped for equal and unequal link capacity multipath networks under additive and overwrite jamming in the large alphabet regime. Our achievability and converse proofs require non-trivial combination of information theoretic and coding theoretic ideas and our achievability schemes are computationally efficient. The PHaSE-Saving techniques 1 are used for achievability while a \u201cstochastic\u201d singleton bound is obtained for converse."}}

The limited-view causal adversary is able to, based on the current and past observations, eavesdrop on a subset of links and also jam on a potentially overlapping subset of links. The goal is to ensure that the communication takes place reliably and secretly. We study two adversarial models - additive and overwrite jamming. For both adversarial models, we consider communication models both without and with passive feedback from decoder to encoder, i.e., the encoder sees everything that the decoder sees. The problem assumes transmissions are in the large alphabet regime. For both types of jamming models, we find the capacity under three scenarios - reliability without feedback, reliability and secrecy without feedback, and reliability with feedback. We observe that in comparison to the non-causal setting the capacity with a causal adversary is strictly increased for a wide variety of parameter settings, and present our intuition through several examples."}}

Many methods have been proposed to defend against adversarial poisoning by either identifying the poisoned samples to facilitate removal or developing poison agnostic training algorithms. Although effective, these proposed approaches can have unintended consequences on other aspects of model performance, such as worsening performance on certain data sub-populations, thus inducing a classification bias. In this work, we evaluate several adversarial poisoning defenses. In addition to traditional security metrics, i.e., robustness to poisoned samples, we propose a new metric to measure the potential undesirable discrimination of sub-populations resulting from using these defenses. Our investigation highlights that many of the evaluated defenses trade decision fairness to achieve higher adversarial poisoning robustness. Given these results, we recommend our proposed metric to be part of standard evaluations of machine learning defenses."}}

When the vectors are high-dimensional, the communication cost of sending entire vectors may be prohibitive, and it may be imperative for them to use sparsification techniques. While most existing work on sparsified mean estimation is agnostic to the characteristics of the data vectors, in many practical applications such as federated learning, there may be spatial correlations (similarities in the vectors sent by different nodes) or temporal correlations (similarities in the data sent by a single node over different iterations of the algorithm) in the data vectors. We leverage these correlations by simply modifying the decoding method used by the server to estimate the mean. We provide an analysis of the resulting estimation error as well as experiments for PCA, K-Means and Logistic Regression, which show that our estimators consistently outperform more sophisticated and expensive sparsification methods."}}

We propose and analyze a distributed gradient-descent algorithm that performs a simple thresholding based on gradient norms to mitigate Byzantine failures. We show the (statistical) error-rate of our algorithm matches that of Yin et al., 2018, which uses more complicated schemes (like coordinate-wise median or trimmed mean). Furthermore, for communication efficiency, we consider a generic class of \u03b4-approximate compressors from Karimireddy et al., 2019, that encompasses sign-based compressors and top-k sparsification. Our algorithm uses compressed gradients and gradient norms for aggregation and Byzantine removal respectively. We establish the statistical error rate of the algorithm for arbitrary (convex or non-convex) smooth loss function. We show that, in certain regime of \u03b4, the rate of convergence is not affected by the compression operation. We have experimentally validated our results and shown good performance in convergence for convex (least-square regression) and non-convex (neural network training) problems."}}

Recently, Ye and Abbe [ICML 2018] proposed a coding-theoretic paradigm to characterize a fundamental trade-off between computation load per worker, communication overhead per worker, and straggler tolerance. However, their proposed coding schemes suffer from heavy decoding complexity and poor numerical stability. In this paper, we develop a communication-efficient gradient coding framework to overcome these drawbacks. Our proposed framework enables using any linear code to design the encoding and decoding functions. When a particular code is used in this framework, its block-length determines the computation load, dimension determines the communication overhead, and minimum distance determines the straggler tolerance. The flexibility of choosing a code allows us to gracefully trade-off the straggler threshold and communication overhead for smaller decoding complexity and higher numerical stability. Further, we show that using a maximum distance separable (MDS) code generated by a random Gaussian matrix in our framework yields a gradient code that is optimal with respect to the trade-off and, in addition, satisfies stronger guarantees on numerical stability as compared to the previously proposed schemes. Finally, we evaluate our proposed framework on Amazon EC2 and demonstrate that it reduces the average iteration time by 16% as compared to prior gradient coding schemes."}}

The problem setup includes a database of K independent messages possibly replicated on several servers, and a user that needs to retrieve one of these messages. In addition, the user has some prior side information in the form of a subset of M messages, not containing the desired message and unknown to the servers. This problem is motivated by practical settings in which the user can obtain side information opportunistically from other users or has previously downloaded some messages using classical PIR schemes. The objective of the user is to retrieve the required message with downloading minimum amount of data from the servers while achieving information-theoretic privacy in one of the following two scenarios: (i) the user wants to protect jointly the identities of the demand and the side information; (ii) the user wants to protect only the identity of the demand, but not necessarily the side information. To highlight the role of side information, we focus first on the case of a single server (single database). In the first scenario, we prove that the minimum download cost is K - M messages, and in the second scenario it is [K/(M + 1)] messages, which should be compared to K messages-the minimum download cost in the case of no side information. Then, we extend some of our results to the case of the database replicated on multiple servers. Our proof techniques relate PIR with side information to the index coding problem. We leverage this connection to prove converse results, as well as to design achievability schemes."}}
