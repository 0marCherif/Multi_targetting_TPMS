We aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model that contours left ventricular (LV) endo- and epicardial borders and quantifies CMR LGE images from HCM patients.We retrospectively studied 2557 unprocessed images from 307 HCM patients followed at the University Health Network (Canada) and Tufts Medical Center (USA). LGE images were manually segmented by two experts using two different software packages. Using 6SD LGE intensity cutoff as the gold standard, a 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on 80% and tested on the remaining 20% of the data. Model performance was evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Bland-Altman, and Pearson\u2019s correlation. The 6SD model DSC scores were good to excellent at 0.91 \u00b1 0.04, 0.83 \u00b1 0.03, and 0.64 \u00b1 0.09 for the LV endocardium, epicardium, and scar segmentation, respectively. The bias and limits of agreement for the percentage of LGE to LV mass were low (-0.53 \u00b1 2.71%), and correlation high (r = 0.92). This fully automated interpretable ML algorithm allows rapid and accurate scar quantification from CMR LGE images. This program does not require manual image pre-processing, and was trained with multiple experts and software, increasing its generalizability."}}

While the pinball quantile loss works well in the scalar case, it cannot be readily extended to the vector case. In this work, we propose a multivariate quantile approach for generative modelling using optimal transport with provable guarantees. Specifically, we suggest that by optimizing smooth functions parameterized by neural networks with respect to the dual of the correlation maximization problem, the function uniformly converges to the optimal convex potential. Thus, we construct a Brenier map as our generative quantile network. Furthermore, we introduce conditioning by approximating the convex potential using a first-order approximation with respect to the covariates. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets for conditional generative and probabilistic time-series forecasting tasks, we demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of our theoretically motivated model as a distribution estimator and probabilistic forecaster."}}
