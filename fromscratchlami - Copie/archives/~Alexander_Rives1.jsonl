Since evolution encodes information about function into patterns in protein sequences, unsupervised models of variant effects can be learned from sequence data. The approach to date has been to fit a model to a family of related sequences. The conventional setting is limited, since a new model must be trained for each prediction task. We show that using only zero-shot inference, without any supervision from experimental data or additional training, protein language models capture the functional effects of sequence variation, performing at state-of-the-art."}}

In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction."}}

The objective enables training a single model with shared parameters to explicitly model energy landscapes across multiple protein families. Given a protein sequence as input, the model is trained to predict a pairwise coupling matrix for a Potts model energy function describing the local evolutionary landscape of the sequence. Couplings can be predicted for novel sequences. A controlled ablation experiment assessing unsupervised contact prediction on sets of related protein families finds a gain from amortization for low-depth multiple sequence alignments; the result is then confirmed on a database with broad coverage of protein sequences."}}

For decades, the predominant approach has been to infer evolutionary constraints from a set of related sequences. In the past year, protein language models have emerged as a potential alternative, but performance has fallen short of state-of-the-art approaches in bioinformatics. In this paper we demonstrate that Transformer attention maps learn contacts from the unsupervised language modeling objective. We find the highest capacity models that have been trained to date already outperform a state-of-the-art unsupervised contact prediction pipeline, suggesting these pipelines can be replaced with a single forward pass of an end-to-end model."}}

The model is trained solely on crystallized protein data. By contrast, existing approaches for scoring conformations use energy functions that incorporate knowledge of physical principles and features that are the complex product of several decades of research and tuning. To evaluate the model, we benchmark on the rotamer recovery task, the problem of predicting the conformation of a side chain from its context within a protein structure, which has been used to evaluate energy functions for protein design. The model achieves performance close to that of the Rosetta energy function, a state-of-the-art method widely used in protein structure prediction and design. An investigation of the model\u2019s outputs and hidden representations finds that it captures physicochemical properties relevant to protein energy."}}
