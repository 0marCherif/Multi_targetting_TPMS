However, the threat of adversarial machine learning poses the question: Is it possible to compress adversarially robust networks and achieve similar or better adversarial robustness as the original network? In this paper, we explore this question with respect to $\\textit{certifiable robustness defenses}$, in which the defense establishes a formal robustness guarantee irrespective of the adversarial attack methodology. We present our preliminary findings answering two main questions: 1) Is the traditional knowledge distillation sufficient to compress certifiably robust neural networks? and 2) What aspects of the transfer process can we modify to improve the compression effectiveness? Our work represents the first study of the interaction between machine learning model compression and certifiable robustness."}}

Numerous techniques have been proposed to harden machine learning algorithms and mitigate the effect of adversarial attacks. Of these techniques, adversarial training, which augments the training data with adversarial samples, has proven to be an effective defense with respect to a certain class of attacks. However, adversarial training is computationally expensive and its improvements are limited to a single model. In this work, we take a first step toward creating a model-agnostic adversarial defense. We propose Adversarially-Trained Autoencoder Aug- mentation (AAA), the first model-agnostic adversarial defense that is robust against certain adaptive adversaries. We show that AAA allows us to achieve a partially model-agnostic defense by training a single autoencoder to protect multiple pre-trained classifiers; achieving adversarial performance on par or better than adversarial training without modifying the classifiers. Further- more, we demonstrate that AAA can be used to create a fully model-agnostic defense for MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets by improving the adversarial performance of a never before seen pre-trained classifier by at least 45% with no additional training. Finally, using a natural image corruption dataset, we show that our approach improves robustness to naturally corrupted images, which has been identified as strongly indicative of true adversarial robustness."}}

This domain, however, has found little buy-in from ML practitioners, who are neither overtly concerned about these attacks affecting their systems in the real world nor are willing to trade off the accuracy of their models in pursuit of robustness against these attacks.\nIn this paper, we motivate the design and implementation of Ares, an evaluation framework for adversarial ML that allows researchers to explore attacks and defenses in a realistic wargame-like environment. Ares frames the conflict between the attacker and defender as two agents in a reinforcement learning environment with opposing objectives. This allows the introduction of system-level evaluation metrics such as time to failure and evaluation of complex strategies such as moving target defenses. We provide the results of our initial exploration involving a white-box attacker against an adversarially trained defender."}}

Although numerous state-of-the-art certified training methods have been developed, they are computationally expensive and scale poorly with respect to both dataset and network complexity. Widespread usage of certified training is further hindered by the fact that periodic retraining is necessary to incorporate new data and network improvements. In this paper, we propose Certified Robustness Transfer (CRT), a general-purpose framework for reducing the computational overhead of any certifiably robust training method through knowledge transfer. Given a robust teacher, our framework uses a novel training loss to transfer the teacher\u2019s robustness to the student. We provide theoretical and empirical validation of CRT. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 show that CRT speeds up certified robustness training by 8\u00d7 on average across three different architecture generations while achieving comparable robustness to state-of-the-art methods. We also show that CRT can scale to large-scale datasets like ImageNet."}}

Recent work has shown that these attacks generalize to the physical domain, to create perturbations on physical objects that fool image classifiers under a variety of real-world conditions. Such attacks pose a risk to deep learning models used in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we extend physical attacks to more challenging object detection models, a broader class of deep learning algorithms widely used to detect and label multiple objects within a scene. Improving upon a previous physical attack on image classifiers, we create perturbed physical objects that are either ignored or mislabeled by object detection models. We implement a Disappearance Attack, in which we cause a Stop sign to \"disappear\" according to the detector-either by covering thesign with an adversarial Stop sign poster, or by adding adversarial stickers onto the sign. In a video recorded in a controlled lab environment, the state-of-the-art YOLOv2 detector failed to recognize these adversarial Stop signs in over 85% of the video frames. In an outdoor experiment, YOLO was fooled by the poster and sticker attacks in 72.5% and 63.5% of the video frames respectively. We also use Faster R-CNN, a different object detection model, to demonstrate the transferability of our adversarial perturbations. The created poster perturbation is able to fool Faster R-CNN in 85.9% of the video frames in a controlled lab environment, and 40.2% of the video frames in an outdoor environment. Finally, we present preliminary results with a new Creation Attack, where in innocuous physical stickers fool a model into detecting nonexistent objects."}}

Given that that emerging physical systems are using DNNs in safety-critical situations, adversarial examples could mislead these systems and cause dangerous situations. Therefore, understanding adversarial examples in the physical world is an important step towards developing resilient learning algorithms. We propose a general attack algorithm, Robust Physical Perturbations (RP 2 ), to generate robust visual adversarial perturbations under different physical conditions. Using the real-world case of road sign classification, we show that adversarial examples generated using RP 2 achieve high targeted misclassification rates against standard-architecture road sign classifiers in the physical world under various environmental conditions, including viewpoints. Due to the current lack of a standardized testing method, we propose a two-stage evaluation methodology for robust physical adversarial examples consisting of lab and field tests. Using this methodology, we evaluate the efficacy of physical adversarial manipulations on real objects. With a perturbation in the form of only black and white stickers, we attack a real stop sign, causing targeted misclassification in 100% of the images obtained in lab settings, and in 84.8% of the captured video frames obtained on a moving vehicle (field test) for the target classifier."}}
