While deep-learning-based methods have simplified the optimization by end-to-end training, they fail to generalize well to blurs unseen in the training dataset. Thus, training image-specific models is important for higher generalization. Deep image prior (DIP) provides an approach to optimize the weights of a randomly initialized network with a single degraded image by maximum a posteriori (MAP), which shows that the architecture of a network can serve as the hand-crafted image prior. Unlike conventional hand-crafted image priors, which are obtained through statistical methods, finding a suitable network architecture is challenging due to the unclear relationship between images and their corresponding architectures. As a result, the network architecture cannot provide enough constraint for the latent sharp image. This paper proposes a new variational deep image prior (VDIP) for blind image deconvolution, which exploits additive hand-crafted image priors on latent sharp images and approximates a distribution for each pixel to avoid suboptimal solutions. Our mathematical analysis shows that the proposed method can better constrain the optimization. The experimental results further demonstrate that the generated images have better quality than that of the original DIP on benchmark datasets."}}

It is classified as a brain disease causing dementia that presents with memory loss and cognitive impairment. Experts primarily use brain imaging and other tests to rule out the disease. To automatically detect Alzheimer\u2019s patients from healthy controls, this study adopts the vision transformer architecture, which can effectively capture the global or long-range relationship of image features. To further enhance the network\u2019s performance, frequency and image domain features are fused together since MRI data is acquired in the frequency domain before being transformed to images. We train the model with selected coronal 2D slices to leverage the transfer learning property of pre-training the network using ImageNet. Finally, the majority voting of the coronal slices of an individual subject is used to generate the final classification score. Our proposed method has been evaluated on the publicly available benchmark dataset ADNI. The experimental results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed approach in terms of classification accuracy compared with that of the state-of-the-art methods.

Some methods directly output the latent sharp image in one stage, while others utilize a multi-stage strategy (e.g. multi-scale, multi-patch, or multi-temporal) to gradually restore the sharp image. However, these methods have the following two main issues: 1) The computational cost of multi-stage is high; 2) The same convolution kernel is applied in different regions, which is not an ideal choice for non-uniform blur. Hence, non-uniform motion deblurring is still a challenging and open problem. In this paper, we propose a new architecture which consists of multiple Atrous Spatial Pyramid Deformable Convolution (ASPDC) modules to deblur an image end-to-end with more flexibility. Multiple ASPDC modules implicitly learn the pixel-specific motion with different dilation rates in the same layer to handle movements of different magnitude. To improve the training, we also propose a reblurring network to map the deblurred output back to the blurred input, which constrains the solution space.

These operators, however, have a few critical limitations. In this work, we investigate a simple soft-greedy operator, which we call resmax, that takes actions proportionally to their suboptimality gap: the residual to the estimated maximal value. It is simple to use and ensures coverage of the state-space like $\\varepsilon$-greedy, but focuses exploration more on potentially promising actions like softmax. Further, it does not concentrate probability as quickly as softmax, and so better avoids overemphasizing sub-optimal actions that appear high-valued during learning. Additionally, we prove it is a non-expansion for any fixed exploration hyperparameter, unlike the softmax policy which requires a state-action specific temperature to obtain a non-expansion (called mellowmax). We empirically validate that resmax is comparable to or outperforms $\\varepsilon$-greedy and softmax across a variety of environments in tabular and deep RL."}}

The system is based on network representations of the transport systems and makes use of a span of metrics and algorithms from the established properties in graph theory to complicated domain specific measurements. Due to nature of big data systems and the requirement of scalability, many heuristic optimizations and approximations have been considered in the system. Integration with other sources of data specially population density maps is also executed in the system. Formal evaluations are done on subcomponents of the system to make sure the approximations have reasonable precision.
