Mayo 2022 et al. [1] measured the difficulty of the ImageNet and ObjectNet test sets by measuring the minimum viewing time required for an object to be recognized on average by a human, finding that these test sets are heavily skewed towards containing mostly easy, quickly recognized images. While difficult images that require longer viewing times to be recognized are uncommon in test sets, they are both common and critically important to the real world performance of vision models. In this work, we investigated the relationship between adversarial robustness and viewing time difficulty. Measuring the AUC of accuracy vs attack strength (epsilon), we find that easy, quickly recognized, images are more robust to adversarial attacks than difficult images, which require several seconds of viewing time to recognize. Additionally, adversarial defense methods improve models robustness to adversarial attacks on easy images significantly more than on hard images. We propose that the distribution of image difficulties should be carefully considered and controlled for when measuring both the effectiveness of adversarial attacks and when analyzing the clean accuracy vs robustness tradeoff made by adversarial defense methods."}}

Calibrating dataset difficulty to viewing time", "abstract": "Humans outperform object recognizers despite the fact that models perform well on current datasets. Numerous efforts exist to make more challenging datasets by scaling up on the web, exploring distribution shift, or adding controls for biases. The difficulty of each image in each dataset is not independently evaluated, nor is the concept of dataset difficulty as a whole currently well defined. We develop a new dataset difficulty metric based on how long humans must view an image in order to classify a target object. Images whose objects can be recognized in 17ms are considered to be easier than those which require seconds of viewing time. Using 133,588 judgments on two major datasets, ImageNet and ObjectNet, we determine the distribution of image difficulties in those datasets, which we find varies wildly, but significantly undersamples hard images. Rather than hoping that distribution shift will lead to hard datasets, we should explicitly measure their difficulty. Analyzing model performance guided by image difficulty reveals that models tend to have lower performance and a larger generalization gap on harder images. We release a dataset of difficulty judgments as a complementary metric to raw performance and other behavioral/neural metrics. Such experiments with humans allow us to create a metric for progress in object recognition datasets. This metric can be used to both test the biological validity of models in a novel way, and develop tools to fill out the missing class of hard examples as datasets are being gathered."}}

This property is reflected in biological learning and memory but typically not in machine learning systems. We advance a multiscale learning method in which each weight in a neural network is decomposed as a sum of subweights with different learning and decay rates. Thus knowledge becomes distributed across different timescales, enabling rapid adaptation to task changes while avoiding catastrophic interference. First, we prove previous models that learn at multiple timescales, but with complex coupling between timescales, are equivalent to multiscale learning via a reparameterization that eliminates this coupling. The same analysis yields a new characterization of momentum learning, as a fast weight with a negative learning rate. Second, we derive a model of Bayesian inference over $1/f$ noise, a common temporal pattern in many online learning domains that involves long-range (power law) autocorrelations. The generative side of the model expresses $1/f$ noise as a sum of diffusion processes at different timescales, and the inferential side tracks these latent processes using a Kalman filter. We then derive a variational approximation to the Bayesian model and show how it is an extension of the multiscale learner. The result is an optimizer that can be used as a drop-in replacement in an arbitrary neural network architecture. Third, we evaluate the ability of these methods to handle nonstationarity by testing them in online prediction tasks characterized by $1/f$ noise in the latent parameters. We find that the Bayesian model significantly outperforms online stochastic gradient descent and two batch heuristics that rely preferentially or exclusively on more recent data. Moreover, the variational approximation performs nearly as well as the full Bayesian model, and with memory requirements that are linear in the size of the network.\n"}}

ObjectNet is an attempt to create a more difficult dataset, one that eliminates biases that may artificially inflate machine performance, in a systematic way. ObjectNet images are meant to decorrelate objects from their backgrounds, have randomized object orientations, and randomized viewpoints. ObjectNet appears to be much more difficult for machines. Spoken ObjectNet is a retrieval benchmark constructed from spoken descriptions of ObjectNet images. These descriptions are being used to create a captioning and VQA benchmark. In each case large performance drops were seen. The next variant of ObjectNet will focus on real-world occlusions since it is suspected that models are brittle when shown partially-occluded objects. Using large-scale psychophysics on ObjectNet we have constructed a new objective difficulty benchmark applicable to any dataset: the minimum presentation time for an image before the object contained within it can be reliably recognized by humans. This difficulty metric is well predicted by quantities computable from the activations of models, although not necessarily their ultimate performance. We hope that this suite of benchmarks will enable more robust models, prove better images for neuroscientific and behavioral experiments, and contribute to a systematic understanding of the dataset difficulty and progress in computer vision."}}
