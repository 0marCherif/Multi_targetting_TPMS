This paper presents Renate, a continual learning library designed to build real-world updating pipelines for PyTorch models. We discuss requirements for the use of continual learning algorithms in practice, from which we derive design principles for Renate. We give a high-level description of the library components and interfaces. Finally, we showcase the strengths of the library by presenting experimental results.

However, these models do not provide well-calibrated predictive uncertainties, which prevents their use for decision making in high-risk applications. The Bayesian treatment is known to improve predictive uncertainty calibration, but previously proposed Bayesian GBM methods are either computationally expensive, or resort to crude approximations. Variational inference is often used to implement Bayesian neural networks, but is difficult to apply to GBMs, because the decision trees used as weak learners are non-differentiable. In this paper, we propose to implement Bayesian GBMs using variational inference with soft decision trees, a fully differentiable alternative to standard decision trees introduced by Irsoy et al. Our experiments demonstrate that variational soft trees and variational soft GBMs provide useful uncertainty estimates, while retaining good predictive performance. The proposed models show higher test likelihoods when compared to the state-of-the-art Bayesian GBMs in 7/10 tabular regression datasets and improved out-of-distribution detection in 5/10 datasets."}}

When models are trained on large datasets, tuning them with HPO or NAS rapidly becomes prohibitively expensive for practitioners, even when efficient multi-fidelity methods are employed. We propose an approach to tackle the challenge of tuning machine learning models trained on large datasets with limited computational resources. Our approach, named PASHA, extends ASHA and is able to dynamically allocate maximum resources for the tuning procedure depending on the need. The experimental comparison shows that PASHA identifies well-performing hyperparameter configurations and architectures while consuming significantly fewer computational resources than ASHA."}}

Recently, there has been a stream of methods that tackle the issue of hyperparameter optimization, however, most of the methods do not exploit the scaling law property of learning curves. In this work, we propose Deep Power Law (DPL), a neural network model conditioned to yield predictions that follow a power-law scaling pattern. Our model dynamically decides which configurations to pause and train incrementally by making use of multi-fidelity estimation. We compare our method against 7 state-of-the-art competitors on 3 benchmarks related to tabular, image, and NLP datasets covering 59 diverse search spaces. Our method achieves the best results across all benchmarks by obtaining the best any-time results compared to all competitors."}}

Unfortunately, these models struggle to continually learn new concepts without forgetting what has been learnt in the past. This phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting and it is difficult to prevent due to practical constraints. For instance, the amount of data that can be stored or the computational resources that can be used might be limited. Moreover, applications increasingly rely on large pre-trained neural networks, such as pre-trained Transformers, since compute or data might not be available in sufficiently large quantities to practitioners to train from scratch. In this paper, we devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters. Different than the existing approaches, our method is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks. On both image and text classification tasks, we empirically demonstrate that our method maintains a good predictive performance without retraining the model or increasing the number of model parameters over time. The resulting model is also significantly faster at inference time compared to Adapter-based state-of-the-art methods."}}

As a result, a series of recent related works have focused on the direction of transfer learning for quickly fine-tuning hyperparameters on a dataset. Unfortunately, the community does not have a common large-scale benchmark for comparing HPO algorithms. Instead, the de facto practice consists of empirical protocols on arbitrary small-scale meta-datasets that vary inconsistently across publications, making reproducibility a challenge. To resolve this major bottleneck and enable a fair and fast comparison of black-box HPO methods on a level playing field, we propose HPO-B, a new large-scale benchmark in the form of a collection of meta-datasets. Our benchmark is assembled and preprocessed from the OpenML repository and consists of 176 search spaces (algorithms) evaluated sparsely on 196 datasets with a total of 6.4 million hyperparameter evaluations. For ensuring reproducibility on our benchmark, we detail explicit experimental protocols, splits, and evaluation measures for comparing methods for both non-transfer, as well as, transfer learning HPO."}}
