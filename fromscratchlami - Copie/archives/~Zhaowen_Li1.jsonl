One main obstacle lies in the high-dimensional outputs in object-level visual tasks. In this paper, we propose an object-centric vision framework, Obj2Seq. Obj2Seq takes objects as basic units, and regards most object-level visual tasks as sequence generation problems of objects. Therefore, these visual tasks can be decoupled into two steps. First recognize objects of given categories, and then generate a sequence for each of these objects. The definition of the output sequences varies for different tasks, and the model is supervised by matching these sequences with ground-truth targets. Obj2Seq is able to flexibly determine input categories to satisfy customized requirements, and be easily extended to different visual tasks. When experimenting on MS COCO, Obj2Seq achieves 45.7% AP on object detection, 89.0% AP on multi-label classification and 65.0% AP on human pose estimation. These results demonstrate its potential to be generally applied to different visual tasks. Code has been made available at: https://github.com/CASIA-IVA-Lab/Obj2Seq."}}

However, the success of popular SSL methods has limited on single-centric-object images like those in ImageNet and ignores the correlation among the scene and instances, as well as the semantic difference of instances in the scene. To address the above problems, we propose a Unified Self-supervised Visual Pre-training (UniVIP), a novel self-supervised framework to learn versatile visual representations on either single-centric-object or non-iconic dataset. The framework takes into account the representation learning at three levels: 1) the similarity of scene-scene, 2) the correlation of scene-instance, 3) the discrimination of instance-instance. During the learning, we adopt the optimal transport algorithm to automatically measure the discrimination of instances. Massive experiments show that Uni-VIP pre-trained on non-iconic COCO achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as image classification, semi-supervised learning, object detection and segmentation. Furthermore, our method can also exploit single-centric-object dataset such as ImageNet and outperforms BYOL by 2.5% with the same pre-training epochs in linear probing, and surpass current self-supervised object detection methods on COCO dataset, demonstrating its universality and potential."}}

The images or feature maps of different domains can be decomposed into the low-frequency component and high-frequency component. This paper proposes the assumption that low-frequency information is more domain-invariant while the high-frequency information contains domain-related information. Hence, we introduce an approach, named low-frequency module (LFM), to extract domain-invariant feature representations. The LFM is constructed with the digital Gaussian low-pass filter. Our method is easy to implement and introduces no extra hyperparameter. We design two effective ways to utilize the LFM for domain adaptation, and our method is complementary to other existing methods and formulated as a plug-and-play unit that can be combined with these methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our LFM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for various computer vision tasks, including image classification and object detection."}}

However, it has not been fully explored in visual self-supervised learning. Meanwhile, previous methods only consider the high-level feature and learning representation from a global perspective, which may fail to transfer to the downstream dense prediction tasks focusing on local features. In this paper, we present a novel Masked Self-supervised Transformer approach named MST, which can explicitly capture the local context of an image while preserving the global semantic information. Specifically, inspired by the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) in NLP, we propose a masked token strategy based on the multi-head self-attention map, which dynamically masks some tokens of local patches without damaging the crucial structure for self-supervised learning. More importantly, the masked tokens together with the remaining tokens are further recovered by a global image decoder, which preserves the spatial information of the image and is more friendly to the downstream dense prediction tasks. The experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method. For instance, MST achieves Top-1 accuracy of 76.9% with DeiT-S only using 300-epoch pre-training by linear evaluation, which outperforms supervised methods with the same epoch by 0.4% and its comparable variant DINO by 1.0%. For dense prediction tasks, MST also achieves 42.7% mAP on MS COCO object detection and 74.04% mIoU on Cityscapes segmentation only with 100-epoch pre-training."}}
