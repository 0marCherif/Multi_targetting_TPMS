However, in control theory, the stability of a closed-loop system can be hardly guaranteed using the policy/controller learned solely from samples. In this paper, we will combine Lyapunov's method in control theory and stochastic analysis to analyze the mean square stability of MDP in a model-free manner. Furthermore, the finite sample bounds on the probability of stability are derived as a function of the number M and length T of the sampled trajectories. And we show that there is a lower bound on T and the probability is much more demanding for M than T. Based on the theoretical results, a REINFORCE like algorithm is proposed to learn the controller and the Lyapunov function simultaneously. "}}

However, grasping the decomposable and hierarchical structures within a complex task can be essential for further improving its learning efficiency and performance, which may lead to a multimodal policy or a mixture-of-experts (MOE). To our best knowledge, present DRL algorithms for general utility do not deploy MOE methods as policy function approximators due to the lack of differentiability, or without explicit probabilistic representation. In this work, we propose a differentiable probabilistic mixture-of-experts (PMOE) embedded in the end-to-end training scheme for generic off-policy and on-policy algorithms using stochastic policies, e.g., Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). Experimental results testify the advantageous performance of our method over unimodal polices and three different MOE methods, as well as a method of option frameworks, based on two types of DRL algorithms. We also demonstrate the distinguishable primitives learned with PMOE in different environments."}}

Reinforcement learning is promising not only in dealing with complicated environment but also taking safety constraints into account as a as a constrained Markov Decision Process. However, the safety constraints should be explicitly mathematically formulated while this is challenging for planning at roundabout due to unpredicted dynamic behavior of the obstacles. Therefore, to discriminate the obstacles' states as either safe or unsafe is desired which is known as situation awareness modeling. In this paper, we combine variational learning and constrained reinforcement learning to simultaneously learn a Conditional Representation Model (CRM) to encode the states into safe and unsafe distributions respectively as well as to learn the corresponding safe policy.  Our approach is evaluated in using Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator and it can generalize to various traffic flows."}}

Its integration with deep learning techniques has promoted the field of deep RL with an impressive performance in complicated continuous control tasks. However, from a control-theoretic perspective, the first and most important property of a system to be guaranteed is stability. Unfortunately, stability is rarely assured in RL and remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a stability guaranteed RL framework which simultaneously learns a Lyapunov function along with the controller or policy, both of which are parameterized by deep neural networks, by borrowing the concept of Lyapunov function from control theory. Our framework can not only offer comparable or superior control performance over state-of-the-art RL algorithms, but also construct a Lyapunov function to validate the closed-loop stability. In the simulated experiments, our approach is evaluated on several well-known examples including classic CartPole balancing, 3-dimensional robot control and control of synthetic biology gene regulatory networks. Compared with RL algorithms without stability guarantee, our approach can enable the system to recover to the operating point when interfered by uncertainties such as unseen disturbances and system parametric variations to a certain extent.

The social skill is critical in everyday life to reason about the potential consequences of their behaviors so as to plan ahead. It is known that humans use this reasoning ability recursively, i.e. considering what others believe about their own beliefs.  In this paper, we start  from level-$1$ recursion and introduce a probabilistic recursive reasoning (PR2) framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our hypothesis is that it is beneficial for each agent to account for how the opponents would react to its future behaviors. Under the PR2 framework, we adopt variational Bayes methods to approximate the opponents' conditional policy, to which each agent finds the  best response and then improve their own policy. We develop  decentralized-training-decentralized-execution  algorithms, PR2-Q and PR2-Actor-Critic, that are proved to converge in the self-play scenario when there is one Nash equilibrium. Our methods are tested on both the matrix game and the differential game, which have a non-trivial equilibrium where common gradient-based methods fail to converge. Our experiments show that it is critical to reason about how the opponents believe about what the agent believes. We expect our work to contribute a new idea of modeling the opponents to the multi-agent reinforcement learning community.  \n"}}
