Given any input graph, we create multi-scale graphs using graph pooling. Then, we connect them into a mega graph by bridging inter-graph edges according to the graph pooling results. Instead of universally stacking graph convolutions over the mega graph, we apply general graph convolutions over intra-graph edges, while the convolutions over inter-graph edges follow a bidirectional pathway to deliver the information along the hierarchy for one turn. Graph convolution and graph pooling are two core elementary operations of MeGraph. In our implementation, we adopt the graph full network (GFuN) and propose the stridden edge contraction pooling (S-EdgePool) with adjustable pooling ratio, which are extended from conventional graph convolution and edge contraction pooling. The MeGraph model enables information exchange across multi-scale graphs, repeatedly, for deeper understanding of wide-range correlations in graphs. This distinguishes MeGraph from many recent hierarchical graph neural networks like Graph U-Nets. We conduct comprehensive empirical studies on tens of public datasets, in which we observe consistent performance gains comparing to baselines. Specifically, we establish 5 new graph theory benchmark tasks that require long-term inference and deduction to solve, where MeGraph demonstrates dominated performance compared with popular graph neural networks."}}

Due to the distribution shift issue, current offline RL algorithms are generally designed to be conservative in value estimation and action selection. However, such conservatism can impair the robustness of learned policies when encountering observation deviation under realistic conditions, such as sensor errors and adversarial attacks. To trade off robustness and conservatism, we propose Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning (RORL) with a novel conservative smoothing technique. In RORL, we explicitly introduce regularization on the policy and the value function for states near the dataset, as well as additional conservative value estimation on these states. Theoretically, we show RORL enjoys a tighter suboptimality bound than recent theoretical results in linear MDPs. We demonstrate that RORL can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the general offline RL benchmark and is considerably robust to adversarial observation perturbations."}}

Based on such an equivalence, we bring the key insight that a positive reward shifting leads to conservative exploitation, while a negative reward shifting leads to curiosity-driven exploration. Accordingly, conservative exploitation improves offline RL value estimation, and optimistic value estimation improves exploration for online RL. We validate our insight on a range of RL tasks and show its improvement over baselines: (1) In offline RL, the conservative exploitation leads to improved performance based on off-the-shelf algorithms; (2) In online continuous control, multiple value functions with different shifting constants can be used to tackle the exploration-exploitation dilemma for better sample efficiency; (3) In discrete control tasks, a negative reward shifting yields an improvement over the curiosity-based exploration method."}}

Every single MG induced by varying population sizes may possess distinct optimal joint strategies and game-specific knowledge, which are modeled independently in modern multi-agent algorithms. In this work, we focus on creating agents that generalize across population-varying MGs. Instead of learning a unimodal policy, each agent learns a policy set that is formed by effective strategies across a variety of games. We propose Meta Representations for Agents (MRA) that explicitly models the game-common and game-specific strategic knowledge. By representing the policy sets with multi-modal latent policies, the common strategic knowledge and diverse strategic modes are discovered with an iterative optimization procedure. We prove that as an approximation to a constrained mutual information maximization objective, the learned policies can reach Nash Equilibrium in every evaluation MG under the assumption of Lipschitz game on a sufficiently large latent space. When deploying it at practical latent models with limited size, fast adaptation can be achieved by leveraging the first-order gradient information. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of MRA on both training performance and generalization ability in hard and unseen games."}}

Existing approaches have utilized goal relabeling on collected experiences to alleviate issues raised from sparse rewards. However, these methods are still limited in efficiency and cannot make full use of experiences. In this paper, we propose Model-based Hindsight Experience Replay (MHER), which exploits experiences more efficiently by leveraging environmental dynamics to generate virtual achieved goals. Replacing original goals with virtual goals generated from interaction with a trained dynamics model leads to a novel relabeling method, model-based relabeling (MBR). Based on MBR, MHER performs both reinforcement learning and supervised learning for efficient policy improvement. Theoretically, we also prove the supervised part in MHER, i.e., goal-conditioned supervised learning with MBR data, optimizes a lower bound on the multi-goal RL objective. Experimental results in several point-based tasks and simulated robotics environments show that MHER achieves significantly higher sample efficiency than previous model-free and model-based multi-goal methods."}}

A recent work, called Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (GCSL), provides a new learning framework by iteratively relabeling and imitating self-generated experiences. In this paper, we revisit the theoretical property of GCSL --- optimizing a lower bound of the goal reaching objective, and extend GCSL as a novel offline goal-conditioned RL algorithm. The proposed method is named Weighted GCSL (WGCSL), in which we introduce an advanced compound weight consisting of three parts (1) discounted weight for goal relabeling, (2) goal-conditioned exponential advantage weight, and (3) best-advantage weight. Theoretically, WGCSL is proved to optimize an equivalent lower bound of the goal-conditioned RL objective and generates monotonically improved policies via an iterated scheme. The monotonic property holds for any behavior policies, and therefore WGCSL can be applied to both online and offline settings. To evaluate algorithms in the offline goal-conditioned RL setting, we provide a benchmark including a range of point and simulated robot domains. Experiments in the introduced benchmark demonstrate that WGCSL can consistently outperform GCSL and existing state-of-the-art offline methods in the fully offline goal-conditioned setting."}}

We introduce an agent in ViZDoom that can surpass previous top agents ranked in the open ViZDoom AI Competitions by a large margin. The proposed framework consists of a number of generally applicable techniques, including hindsight experience replay (HER) based navigation, hindsight proximal policy optimization (HPPO), rule-guided policy search (RGPS), prioritized fictitious self-play (PFSP), and diversified strategic control (DSC). The proposed agent outperforms existing agents by taking advantage of diversified and human-like strategies, instead of larger neural networks, more accurate frag skills, or hand-craft tricks, etc. We provide comprehensive analysis and experiments to elaborate the effect of each component in affecting the agent performance, and demonstrate that the proposed and adopted techniques are important to achieve superior performance in general end-to-end FPS games. The proposed methods can contribute to other games and real-world tasks which also require spatial navigation and diversified behaviors."}}

Such an setting results in much difficulty for the agent to explore successful trajectories. Hindsight experience replay (HER) replaces the goal in failed experiences with any practically achieved one, so that the agent has a much higher chance to see successful trajectories even if they are fake. Comprehensive results have demonstrated the effectiveness of HER in the literature. However, the importance of the fake trajectories differs in terms of exploration and exploitation, and it is usually inefficient to learn with a fixed proportion of fake and original data as HER did. In this paper, inspired by Bootstrapped DQN, we use multiple heads in DDPG and take advantage of the diversity and uncertainty among multiple heads to improve the data efficiency with relabeled goals. The method is referred to as Bootstrapped HER (BHER). Specifically, in addition to the benefit from the Bootstrapped version, we explicitly leverage the uncertainty measured by the variance of estimated Q-values from multiple heads. A common knowledge is that higher uncertainty will promote exploration and hence maximizing the uncertainty via a bonus term will induce better performance in Q-learning. However, in this paper, we reveal a counterintuitive conclusion that for hindsight experiences, exploiting lower uncertainty data samples will significantly improve the performance. The explanation behind this fact is that hindsight relabeling largely promotes exploration, and then exploiting lower uncertainty data (whose goals are generated by hindsight relabeling) provides a good trade-off between exploration and exploitation, resulting in further improved data efficiency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art results in many goal-conditioned tasks."}}

Considering two MDPs, tasks such as policy transfer, dynamics modeling, environment design, and simulation to reality (sim2real), etc., are all closely related. The proposed theory deeply investigates the connection between any two cumulative expected returns defined on different policies and environment dynamics, and the theoretical results suggest two new general algorithms referred to as Relative Policy Optimization (RPO) and Relative Transition Optimization (RTO), which can offer fast policy transfer and dynamics modeling. RPO updates the policy using the \\emph{relative policy gradient} to transfer the policy evaluated in one environment to maximize the return in another, while RTO updates the parameterized dynamics model (if there exists) using the \\emph{relative transition gradient} to reduce the gap between the dynamics of the two environments. Then, integrating the two algorithms offers the complete algorithm Relative Policy-Transition Optimization (RPTO), in which the policy interacts with the two environments simultaneously, such that data collections from the two environments, policy and transition updates are all completed in a closed loop to form a principled learning framework for policy transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RPO, RTO and RPTO in the OpenAI gym's classic control tasks by creating policy transfer problems."}}
