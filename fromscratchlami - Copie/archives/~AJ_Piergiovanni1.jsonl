While most models have taken the direction of scaling training to increasingly large models and datasets, in this paper, we propose a dynamic pretraining resampling approach which utilizes a variety of pretraining tasks, and which results in more sample-efficient models. We show that a set of diverse self- and weakly-supervised pretraining tasks dynamically sampled according to task difficulty provides strong performance. We show that a single 330M param pretrained model using only smaller and publicly accessible image-language datasets, achieves competitive or SOTA performance on three diverse groups of tasks: visual question answering, text-based image localization by referring expressions, and video question answering."}}

This allows us to capitalize on their existing capabilities and leverage the substantial cost of training them. We find that joint scaling of the vision and language components is important.

It greatly lowers the FLOPs of the model by effectively combining and reducing the number of tokens used for both text and images. This allows the model to scale without a large increase in FLOPs or memory and leads to a data efficient training. In addition, we propose adaptive pre-training data sampling which further improves the data efficiency. We achieve competitive performance compared to much larger models, and do so with significantly less data and FLOPs. With only 40M training examples and with 39 GFLOPs our model of 350M parameters outperforms all methods that have used less than 1B examples for pre-training. Code will be released.\n"}}

First, vision tokens are used as queries to retrieve compatible text tokens through cross-attention. We then chain the vision tokens and the queried text tokens along the channel dimension. We call the resulting representations compound tokens. A second group of compound tokens are generated using an analogous process where the text tokens serve as queries to the cross-attention layer. We concatenate all the compound tokens for further processing with multimodal encoder.
