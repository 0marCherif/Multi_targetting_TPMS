In addition to improving the hardware design and deploying efficient models, it is possible to aggregate the computing power of many devices to enable the machine learning models. In this paper, we proposed a novel method of exploiting model parallelism to separate a neural network for distributed inferences. To achieve a better balance between communication latency, computation latency, and performance, we adopt neural architecture search (NAS) to search for the best transmission policy and reduce the amount of communication. The best model we found decreases by 86.6% of the amount of data transmission compared to the baseline and does not impact performance much. Under proper specifications of devices and configurations of models, our experiments show that the inference of large neural networks on edge clusters can be distributed and accelerated, which provides a new solution for the deployment of intelligent applications in the internet of things (IoT)."}}

Combinations of multiple abovementioned 1D features are also applicable."}}
