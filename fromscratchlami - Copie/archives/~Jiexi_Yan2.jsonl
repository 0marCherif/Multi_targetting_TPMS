However, most existing deep metric learning methods with binary similarity are sensitive to noisy labels, which are widely present in real-world data. Since these noisy labels often cause a severe performance degradation, it is crucial to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of DML. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Hierarchical Similarity Metric Learning method. It considers two noise-insensitive information, i.e., class-wise divergence and sample-wise consistency. Specifically, class-wise divergence can effectively excavate richer similarity information beyond binary in modeling by taking advantage of Hyperbolic metric learning, while sample-wise consistency can further improve the generalization ability of the model using contrastive augmentation. More importantly, we design an adaptive strategy to integrate this information in a unified view. It is noteworthy that the new method can be extended to any pair-based metric loss. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with current deep metric learning approaches."}}

The current methods try to excavate the multiple correlations in different aspects, but cannot integrate them into a unified framework. In this paper, we provide to consider the multiple correlations from a unified perspective and propose a new method called MetricFormer, which can effectively capture and model the multiple correlations with an elaborate metric transformer. In MetricFormer, the feature decoupling block is adopted to learn an ensemble of distinct and diverse features with different discriminative characteristics. After that, we apply the batch-wise correlation block into the batch dimension of each mini-batch to implicitly explore sample relationships. Finally, the feature-wise correlation block is performed to discover the intrinsic structural pattern of the ensemble of features and obtain the aggregated feature embedding for similarity measuring. With three kinds of transformer blocks, we can learn more representative features through the proposed MetricFormer. Moreover, our proposed method can be flexibly integrated with any metric learning framework.  Extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods."}}

Recent popular methods for training DNNs with noisy labels mainly focus on directly filtering out samples with low confidence or repeatedly mining valuable information from low-confident samples. However, they cannot guarantee the robust generalization of models due to the ignorance of useful information hidden in noisy data. To address this issue, we propose a new effective method named as LaCoL (Latent Contrastive Learning) to leverage the negative correlations from the noisy data. Specifically, in label space, we exploit the weakly-augmented data to filter samples and adopt classification loss on strong augmentations of the selected sample set, which can preserve the training diversity. While in metric space, we utilize weakly-supervised contrastive learning to excavate these negative correlations hidden in noisy data. Moreover, a cross-space similarity consistency regularization is provided to constrain the gap between label space and metric space. Extensive experiments have validated the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art methods."}}

Following the paradigm in supervised manner, most existing unsupervised metric learning approaches mainly focus on binary similarity in Euclidean space. However, these methods cannot achieve promising performance in many practical applications, where the manual information is lacking and data exhibits non-Euclidean latent anatomy. To address this limitation, we propose an Unsupervised Hyperbolic Metric Learning method with Hierarchical Similarity. It considers the natural hierarchies of data by taking advantage of Hyperbolic metric learning and hierarchical clustering, which can effectively excavate richer similarity information beyond binary in modeling. More importantly, we design a new loss function to capture the hierarchical similarity among samples to enhance the stability of the proposed method. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with current unsupervised deep metric learning approaches."}}

Most existing methods regard ZS-SBIR as a traditional classification problem and employ a cross-entropy or triplet-based loss to achieve retrieval, which neglect the problems of the domain gap between sketches and natural images and the large intra-class diversity in sketches. Toward this end, we propose a novel Domain-Smoothing Network (DSN) for ZS-SBIR. Specifically, a cross-modal contrastive method is proposed to learn generalized representations to smooth the domain gap by mining relations with additional augmented samples. Furthermore, a category-specific memory bank with sketch features is explored to reduce intra-class diversity in the sketch domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach notably outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both Sketchy and TU-Berlin datasets."}}
