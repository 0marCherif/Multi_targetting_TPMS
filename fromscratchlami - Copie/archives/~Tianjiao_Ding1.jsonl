When the manifolds are assumed to be linear subspaces, many methods succeed using low-rank and sparse priors, which have been studied extensively over the past two decades. Unfortunately, most  real-world datasets can not be well approximated by linear subspaces. On the other hand, several works have proposed to identify the manifolds by learning a feature map such that the data transformed by the map lie in a union of linear subspaces, even though the original data are from non-linear manifolds. However, most works either assume knowledge of the membership of samples to clusters, or are shown to learn trivial representations. In this paper, we propose to simultaneously perform clustering and learn a union-of-subspace representation via Maximal Coding Rate Reduction. Experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets show that the proposed method achieves clustering accuracy comparable with state-of-the-art alternatives, while being more scalable and learning geometrically meaningful representations."}}

However, despite the advantages that have been shown for MCR$^2$ training, MCR$^2$ suffers from a significant computational cost due to the need to evaluate and differentiate a significant number of log-determinant terms that grows linearly with the number of classes. By taking advantage of variational forms of spectral functions of a matrix, we reformulate the MCR$^2$ objective to a form that can scale significantly without compromising training accuracy. Experiments in image classification demonstrate that our proposed formulation results in a significant speed up over optimizing the original MCR$^2$ objective directly and often results in higher quality learned representations. Further, our approach may be of independent interest in other models that require computation of log-determinant forms, such as in system identification or normalizing flow models."}}

Once a so-far-the-best model has been found, we refine it via Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP), a robust subspace learning method with strong theoretical support and efficient algorithms. The proposed DPCP-RANSAC has far fewer parameters than existing methods and is scalable. Experiments on estimating two-view homographies, fundamental and essential matrices, and three-view homographic tensors using large-scale datasets show that our approach consistently has higher accuracy than state-of-the-art alternatives."}}

The analysis serves as a platform to support a rigorous investigation of Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) as a valid and powerful alternative to RANSAC for robust model fitting in multiple-view geometry. Homography fitting is cast as a robust nullspace estimation problem over either homographic or epipolar/trifocal embeddings. We prove that the nullspace of epipolar or trifocal embeddings in the homographic scenario, of dimension 3 and 6 for two and three views respectively, is defined by unique, computable homographies. Experiments show that DPCP performs on par with USAC with local optimization, while requiring an order of magnitude less computing time, and it also outperforms a recent deep learning implementation for homography estimation."}}

The wireframe contains all salient straight lines and their junctions of the scene that encode efficiently and accurately large-scale geometry and object shapes. To this end, we have built a very large new dataset of over 5,000 images with wireframes thoroughly labelled by humans. We have proposed two convolutional neural networks that are suitable for extracting junctions and lines with large spatial support, respectively. The networks trained on our dataset have achieved significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods for junction detection and line segment detection, respectively. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate quantitatively and qualitatively the wireframes obtained by our method, and have convincingly shown that effectively and efficiently parsing wireframes for images of man-made environments is a feasible goal within reach. Such wireframes could benefit many important visual tasks such as feature correspondence, 3D reconstruction, vision-based mapping, localization, and navigation."}}
