Reducing energy consumption in buildings can make a substantial contribution towards the strategic goal of carbon neutrality. Building energy consumption carbon emission (BECCE) is highly correlated with microclimate. Green space has long been recognized as the natural way to improve the microclimate and reduce BECCE. However, the effective distance and optimized configuration of green space for the reduction in BECCE are hardly known. To this purpose, we developed a green space compactness (GSC) index as an indicator of microclimate around the People\u2019s Bank, located in 59 cities across China, and used statistical, deep learning, and spatial analysis methods to obtain the most effective distance with respect to the effect of GSC on BECCE. We used hot and cold spot spatial analysis methods to detect the spatial heterogeneity of BECCE and analyzed the corresponding GCS to discover the optimal way for BECCE reduction. The results clearly showed that BECCE was highly correlated with the GSC, and the influence of GSC on BECCE was the highest at the distance of 250 m from the building. The hot and cold spots analysis suggested that BECCE has a significant spatial heterogeneity, which was much higher in the north part of China. Improving the configuration of green space for certain cities could lead to considerable emission reductions. If the BEECE is reduced from 4675 tons to 486 tons, the GSC needs to be increased from 0.39 to 0.56. The study suggests that 250 m is the most effective distance to reduce BECCE, and optimal green space configuration can provide a feasible way to mitigate carbon emissions and valuable information for the development of low-carbon cities."}}

However, although there are multiple interaction types between drugs, e.g., synergism and antagonism, which can influence the effect of a drug package significantly, prior arts generally neglect the interaction between drugs or consider only a single type of interaction. Moreover, most existing studies generally formulate the problem of package recommendation as getting a personalized scoring function for users, despite the limits of discriminative models to achieve satisfactory performance in practical applications. To this end, in this article, we propose a novel end-to-end Drug Package Generation (DPG) framework, which develops a new generative model for drug package recommendation that considers the interaction effects between drugs that are affected by patient conditions. Specifically, we propose to formulate the drug package generation as a sequence generation process. Along this line, we first initialize the drug interaction graph based on medical records and domain knowledge. Then, we design a novel message-passing neural network to capture the drug interaction, as well as a drug package generator based on a recurrent neural network. In detail, a mask layer is utilized to capture the impact of patient condition, and the deep reinforcement learning technique is leveraged to reduce the dependence on the drug order. Finally, extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from a first-rate hospital demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPG framework compared with several competitive baseline methods."}}
