However, timely molecular diagnostic testing for patients with brain tumors is limited, complicating surgical and adjuvant treatment and obstructing clinical trial enrollment. In this study, we developed DeepGlioma, a rapid ($< 90$ seconds), artificial-intelligence-based diagnostic screening system to streamline the molecular diagnosis of diffuse gliomas. DeepGlioma is trained using a multimodal dataset that includes stimulated Raman histology (SRH); a rapid, label-free, non-consumptive, optical imaging method; and large-scale, public genomic data. In a prospective, multicenter, international testing cohort of patients with diffuse glioma ($n=153$) who underwent real-time SRH imaging, we demonstrate that DeepGlioma can predict the molecular alterations used by the World Health Organization to define the adult-type diffuse glioma taxonomy (IDH mutation, 1p19q co-deletion and ATRX mutation), achieving a mean molecular classification accuracy of $93.3\\pm 1.6\\%$. Our results represent how artificial intelligence and optical histology can be used to provide a rapid and scalable adjunct to wet lab methods for the molecular screening of patients with diffuse glioma."}}

Previous work has focused on self-supervised representation learning (SSL) methods developed for instance discrimination and applied them directly to image patches, or fields-of-view, sampled from gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) used for cancer diagnosis. However, this strategy is limited because it (1) assumes patches from the same patient are independent, (2) neglects the patient-slide-patch hierarchy of clinical biomedical microscopy, and (3) requires strong data augmentations that can degrade downstream performance. Importantly, sampled patches from WSIs of a patient's tumor are a diverse set of image examples that capture the same underlying cancer diagnosis. This motivated HiDisc, a data-driven method that leverages the inherent patient-slide-patch hierarchy of clinical biomedical microscopy to define a hierarchical discriminative learning task that implicitly learns features of the underlying diagnosis. HiDisc uses a self-supervised contrastive learning framework in which positive patch pairs are defined based on a common ancestry in the data hierarchy, and a unified patch, slide, and patient discriminative learning objective is used for visual SSL. We benchmark HiDisc visual representations on two vision tasks using two biomedical microscopy datasets, and demonstrate that (1) HiDisc pretraining outperforms current state-of-the-art self-supervised pretraining methods for cancer diagnosis and genetic mutation prediction, and (2) HiDisc learns high-quality visual representations using natural patch diversity without strong data augmentations."}}

Intraoperative diagnosis can be challenging due to tumor diversity and lack of intraoperative pathology resources. Objective: To develop an independent and parallel intraoperative pathology workflow that can provide rapid and accurate skull base tumor diagnoses using label-free optical imaging and artificial intelligence. Method: We used a fiber laser-based, label-free, non-consumptive, high-resolution microscopy method ($<$ 60 sec per 1 $\\times$ 1 mm$^\\text{2}$), called stimulated Raman histology (SRH), to image a consecutive, multicenter cohort of skull base tumor patients. SRH images were then used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using three representation learning strategies: cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive learning, and supervised contrastive learning. Our trained CNN models were tested on a held-out, multicenter SRH dataset. Results: SRH was able to image the diagnostic features of both benign and malignant skull base tumors. Of the three representation learning strategies, supervised contrastive learning most effectively learned the distinctive and diagnostic SRH image features for each of the skull base tumor types. In our multicenter testing set, cross-entropy achieved an overall diagnostic accuracy of 91.5%, self-supervised contrastive learning 83.9%, and supervised contrastive learning 96.6%. Our trained model was able to identify tumor-normal margins and detect regions of microscopic tumor infiltration in whole-slide SRH images. Conclusion: SRH with trained artificial intelligence models can provide rapid and accurate intraoperative analysis of skull base tumor specimens to inform surgical decision-making."}}

The existing workflow for intraoperative diagnosis based on hematoxylin and eosin staining of processed tissue is time, resource and labor intensive2,3. Moreover, interpretation of intraoperative histologic images is dependent on a contracting, unevenly distributed, pathology workforce4. In the present study, we report a parallel workflow that combines stimulated Raman histology (SRH)5,6,7, a label-free optical imaging method and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict diagnosis at the bedside in near real-time in an automated fashion. Specifically, our CNNs, trained on over 2.5 million SRH images, predict brain tumor diagnosis in the operating room in under 150\u2009s, an order of magnitude faster than conventional techniques (for example, 20\u201330\u2009min)2. In a multicenter, prospective clinical trial (n\u2009=\u2009278), we demonstrated that CNN-based diagnosis of SRH images was noninferior to pathologist-based interpretation of conventional histologic images (overall accuracy, 94.6% versus 93.9%). Our CNNs learned a hierarchy of recognizable histologic feature representations to classify the major histopathologic classes of brain tumors. In addition, we implemented a semantic segmentation method to identify tumor-infiltrated diagnostic regions within SRH images. These results demonstrate how intraoperative cancer diagnosis can be streamlined, creating a complementary pathway for tissue diagnosis that is independent of a traditional pathology laboratory."}}

Current\nmethods for intraoperative histology are time- and labor-inten-\nsive and often introduce artifact that limit interpretation. Stim-\nulated Raman histology (SRH) is a novel label-free imaging\ntechnique that provides intraoperative histologic images of fresh,\nunprocessed surgical specimens. Here we evaluate the capacity of\nSRH for use in the intraoperative diagnosis of pediatric type brain\ntumors. SRH revealed key diagnostic features in fresh tissue\nspecimens collected from 33 prospectively enrolled pediatric type\nbrain tumor patients, preserving tumor cytology and histoarch-\nitecture in all specimens. We simulated an intraoperative consul-\ntation for 25 patients with specimens imaged using both SRH and\nstandard hematoxylin and eosin histology. SRH-based diagnoses\nachieved near-perfect diagnostic concordance (Cohen's kappa, k > 0.90) and an accuracy of 92% to 96%. We then developed a\nquantitative histologic method using SRH images based on rapid\nimage feature extraction. Nuclear density, tumor-associated mac-\nrophage infiltration, and nuclear morphology parameters from\n3337 SRH fields of view were used to develop and validate a\ndecision-tree machine-learning model. Using SRH image features,\nour model correctly classified 25 fresh pediatric type surgical\nspecimens into normal versus lesional tissue and low-grade versus\nhigh-grade tumors with 100% accuracy. Our results provide\ninsight into how SRH can deliver rapid diagnostic histologic data\nthat could inform the surgical management of pediatric brain\ntumors. Significance: A new imaging method simplifies diagnosis and\ninforms decision making during pediatric brain tumor surgery."}}
