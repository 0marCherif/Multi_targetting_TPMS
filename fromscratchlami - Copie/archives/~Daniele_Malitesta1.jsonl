Multimodality can help tap into richer information sources and construct more refined user/item profiles for recommendations. However, existing literature lacks a shared and universal schema for modeling and solving the recommendation problem through the lens of multimodality. This work aims to formalize a general multimodal schema for multimedia recommendation. It provides a comprehensive literature review of multimodal approaches for multimedia recommendation from the last eight years, outlines the theoretical foundations of a multimodal pipeline, and demonstrates its rationale by applying it to selected state-of-the-art approaches. The work also conducts a benchmarking analysis of recent algorithms for multimedia recommendation within Elliot, a rigorous framework for evaluating recommender systems. The main aim is to provide guidelines for designing and implementing the next generation of multimodal approaches in multimedia recommendation."}}

By representing the user-item matrix as a bipartite and undirected graph, GNNs have demonstrated their potential to capture short- and long-distance user-item interactions, thereby learning more accurate preference patterns than traditional recommendation approaches. In contrast to previous tutorials on the same topic, this tutorial aims to present and examine three key aspects that characterize GNNs for recommendation: (i) the reproducibility of state-of-the-art approaches, (ii) the potential impact of graph topological characteristics on the performance of these models, and (iii) strategies for learning node representations when training features from scratch or utilizing pre-trained embeddings as additional item information (e.g., multimodal features). The goal is to provide three novel theoretical and practical perspectives on the field, currently subject to debate in graph learning but long been overlooked in the context of recommendation systems."}}

While most of such methods rely on factorization models (e.g., MFBPR) as base architecture, it has been shown that MFBPR may be affected by popularity bias, meaning that it inherently tends to boost the recommendation of popular (i.e., short-head) items at the detriment of niche (i.e., long-tail) items from the catalog. Motivated by this assumption, in this work, we provide one of the first analyses on how multimodality in recommendation could further amplify popularity bias. Concretely, we evaluate the performance of four state-of-the-art MRSs algorithms (i.e., VBPR, MMGCN, GRCN, LATTICE) on three datasets from Amazon by assessing, along with recommendation accuracy metrics, performance measures accounting for the diversity of recommended items and the portion of retrieved niche items. To better investigate this aspect, we decide to study the separate influence of each modality (i.e., visual and textual) on popularity bias in different evaluation dimensions. Results, which demonstrate how the single modality may augment the negative effect of popularity bias, shed light on the importance to provide a more rigorous analysis of the performance of such models."}}

Their graph-based structure paves the way for the adoption of graph-aware learning models such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this respect, state-of-the-art models achieve good performance and interpretability via user-level combinations of intents leading users to their choices. Unfortunately, such results often come from and end-to-end learnings that considers a combination of the whole set of features contained in the KG without any analysis of the user decisions. In this paper, we introduce KGTORe, a GNN-based model that exploits KG to learn latent representations for the semantic features, and consequently, interpret the user decisions as a personal distillation of the item feature representations. Differently from previous models, KGTORe does not need to process the whole KG at training time but relies on a selection of the most discriminative features for the users, thus resulting in improved performance and personalization. Experimental results on three well-known datasets show that KGTORe achieves remarkable accuracy performance and several ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of its components.

However, many original graph-based works often adopt results from baseline papers without verifying their validity for the specific configuration under analysis. Our work addresses this issue by focusing on the replicability of results. We present a code that successfully replicates results from six popular and recent graph recommendation models (NGCF, DGCF, LightGCN, SGL, UltraGCN, and GFCF) on three common benchmark datasets (Gowalla, Yelp 2018, and Amazon Book). Additionally, we compare these graph models with traditional collaborative filtering models that historically performed well in offline evaluations. Furthermore, we extend our study to two new datasets (Allrecipes and BookCrossing) that lack established setups in existing literature. As the performance on these datasets differs from the previous benchmarks, we analyze the impact of specific dataset characteristics on recommendation accuracy. By investigating the information flow from users\u2019 neighborhoods, we aim to identify which models are influenced by intrinsic features in the dataset structure.

Generally, each recommendation framework implements its multimodal extraction procedures with specific strategies and tools. This is limiting for two reasons: (i) different extraction strategies do not ease the interdependence among multimodal recommendation frameworks; thus, they cannot be efficiently and fairly compared; (ii) given the large plethora of pre-trained deep learning models made available by different open source tools, model designers do not have access to shared interfaces to extract features. Motivated by the outlined aspects, we propose Ducho, a unified framework for the extraction of multimodal features in recommendation. By integrating three widely-adopted deep learning libraries as backends, namely, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Transformers, we provide a shared interface to extract and process features where each backend's specific methods are abstracted to the end user. Noteworthy, the extraction pipeline is easily configurable with a YAML-based file where the user can specify, for each modality, the list of models (and their specific backends/parameters) to perform the extraction. Finally, to make Ducho accessible to the community, we build a public Docker image equipped with a ready-to-use CUDA environment and propose three demos to test its functionalities for different scenarios and tasks.

By representing user-item data as an undirected, bipartite graph, graph CF utilizes short- and long-range connections to extract collaborative signals that yield more accurate user preferences than traditional CF methods. Although the recent literature highlights the efficacy of various algorithmic strategies in graph CF, the impact of datasets and their topological features on recommendation performance is yet to be studied. To fill this gap, we propose a topology-aware analysis of graph CF. In this study, we (i) take some widely-adopted recommendation datasets and use them to generate a large set of synthetic sub-datasets through two state-of-the-art graph sampling methods, (ii) measure eleven of their classical and topological characteristics, and (iii) estimate the accuracy calculated on the generated sub-datasets considering four popular and recent graph-based RSs (i.e., LightGCN, DGCF, UltraGCN, and SVD-GCN). Finally, the investigation presents an explanatory framework that reveals the linear relationships between characteristics and accuracy measures. The results, statistically validated under different graph sampling settings, confirm the existence of solid dependencies between topological characteristics and accuracy in the graph-based recommendation, offering a new perspective on how to interpret graph CF."}}
