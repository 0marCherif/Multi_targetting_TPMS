Recent work has considered variational methods maximizing a lower bound. In this paper, we prove that serious statistical limitations are inherent to any method of measuring mutual information. More specifically, we show that any distribution-free high-confidence lower bound on mutual information estimated from N samples cannot be larger than O(ln N)."}}

However, standard multi-task trained dense retrievers often fail to meet the accuracy of scenario-specific models. In this paper, we analyze the multi-task learning in universal retrieval and show that the model capacity is not the main bottleneck. It is the optimization failed to fully utilize the network parameters to capture task-specific signals. This motivated our development of TACO-DR, which conducts multi-task learning for universal retrieval with TAsk speCialty Optimization. TACO-DR dynamically adjusts the learning rate for each parameter regrading each task based on its task-specific sensitivity, to encourage parameters to better capture task specific signals. On the KILT benchmark, TACO-DR outperforms various multi-task learning methods and achieves better overall accuracy than single-task models. Our analysis shows that TACO-DR better utilizes the model capacity with more task-specific parameters. Our code and model checkpoints will be open-sourced."}}

A well-known limitation of this approach is that it requires finding mentions without knowing their entities, which is unnatural and difficult. We present a new model that does not suffer from this limitation called $\\textbf{EntQA}$, which stands for $\\mbox{\\textbf{Ent}ity}$ linking as $\\mbox{\\textbf{Q}uestion}$ $\\mbox{\\textbf{A}nswering}$. EntQA first proposes candidate entities with a fast retrieval module, and then scrutinizes the document to find mentions of each candidate with a powerful reader module. Our approach combines progress in entity linking with that in open-domain question answering and capitalizes on pretrained models for dense entity retrieval and reading comprehension. Unlike in previous works, we do not rely on a mention-candidates dictionary or large-scale weak supervision. EntQA achieves strong results on the GERBIL benchmarking platform.\n"}}

To demonstrate its usefulness, we build general purpose text classifiers by training on NatCat and evaluate them on a suite of 11 text classification tasks (CatEval), reporting large improvements compared to prior work. We benchmark different modeling choices and resource combinations and show how tasks benefit from particular NatCat data sources."}}

Unlike recent work that conditions on retrieved neighbors but generates text token-by-token, left-to-right, we learn a policy that directly manipulates segments of neighbor text, by inserting or replacing them in partially constructed generations. Standard techniques for training such a policy require an oracle derivation for each generation, and we prove that finding the shortest such derivation can be reduced to parsing under a particular weighted context-free grammar. We find that policies learned in this way perform on par with strong baselines in terms of automatic and human evaluation, but allow for more interpretable and controllable generation."}}

Recent works find that hard negatives -- highest-scoring incorrect examples under the model -- are effective in practice, but they are used without a formal justification. We develop analytical tools to understand the role of hard negatives. Specifically, we view the contrastive loss as a biased estimator of the gradient of the cross-entropy loss, and show both theoretically and empirically that setting the negative distribution to be the model distribution results in bias reduction. We also derive a general form of the score function that unifies various architectures used in text retrieval. By combining hard negatives with appropriate score functions, we obtain strong results on the challenging task of zero-shot entity linking."}}

Calculating mutual information is intractable in this setting. Our key technical contribution is an adversarial objective that can be used to tractably estimate mutual information assuming only the feasibility of cross entropy calculation. We develop a concrete realization of this general formulation with Markov distributions over binary encodings. We report critical and unexpected findings on practical aspects of the objective such as the choice of variational priors. We apply our model on document hashing and show that it outperforms current best baselines based on discrete and vector quantized variational autoencoders. It also yields highly compressed interpretable representations."}}

While promising, it crucially relies on accurate descriptions of the label set for each downstream task. This reliance causes dataless classifiers to be highly sensitive to the choice of label descriptions and hinders the broader application of dataless classification in practice. In this paper, we ask the following question: how can we improve dataless text classification using the inputs of the downstream task dataset? Our primary solution is a clustering based approach. Given a dataless classifier, our approach refines its set of predictions using k-means clustering. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach by improving the performance of two widely used classifier architectures, one that encodes text-category pairs with two independent encoders and one with a single joint encoder. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves dataless classification across different datasets and makes the classifier more robust to the choice of label descriptions."}}

We consider several approaches to learning discrete latent variable models for text in the case where exact marginalization over these variables is intractable. We compare the performance of the learned representations as features for low-resource document and sentence classification. Our best models outperform the previous best reported results with continuous representations in these low-resource settings, while learning significantly more compressed representations. Interestingly, we find that an amortized variant of Hard EM performs particularly well in the lowest-resource regimes."}}

We show that after correcting a bug in the CBOW gradient update, one can learn CBOW word embeddings that are fully competitive with SG on various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, while being many times faster to train."}}
