Research on GNNs has mainly focused on the family of message passing neural networks (MPNNs). Similar to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) test of isomorphism, these models follow an iterative neighborhood aggregation procedure to update vertex representations, and they next compute graph representations by aggregating the representations of the vertices. Although very successful, MPNNs have been studied intensively in the past few years. Thus, there is a need for novel architectures which will allow research in the field to break away from MPNNs. In this paper, we propose a new graph neural network model, so-called <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pi$</tex-math></inline-formula> -GNN which learns a \u201csoft\u201d permutation (i. e., doubly stochastic) matrix for each graph, and thus projects all graphs into a common vector space. The learned matrices impose a \u201csoft\u201d ordering on the vertices of the input graphs, and based on this ordering, the adjacency matrices are mapped into vectors. These vectors can be fed into fully-connected or convolutional layers to deal with supervised learning tasks. In case of large graphs, to make the model more efficient in terms of running time and memory, we further relax the doubly stochastic matrices to row stochastic matrices. We empirically evaluate the model on graph classification and graph regression datasets and show that it achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art models."}}

GNNs typically employ a message-passing scheme, in which every node aggregates information from its neighbors using a permutation-invariant aggregation function. Standard well-examined choices such as the mean or sum aggregation functions have limited capabilities, as they are not able to capture interactions among neighbors. In this work, we formalize these interactions using an information-theoretic framework that notably includes synergistic information. Driven by this definition, we introduce the Graph Ordering Attention (GOAT) layer, a novel GNN component that captures interactions between nodes in a neighborhood. This is achieved by learning local node orderings via an attention mechanism and processing the ordered representations using a recurrent neural network aggregator. This design allows us to make use of a permutation-sensitive aggregator while maintaining the permutation-equivariance of the proposed GOAT layer. The GOAT model demonstrates its increased performance in modeling graph metrics that capture complex information, such as the betweenness centrality and the effective size of a node. In practical use-cases, its superior modeling capability is confirmed through its success in several real-world node classification benchmarks."}}

(Vers des Graph Neural Networks expressives: th\u00e9orie, algorithmes et applications)", "abstract": "As the technological evolution of machine learning is accelerating nowadays, data plays a vital role in building intelligent models, being able to simulate phenomena, predict values and make decisions. In an increasing number of applications, data take the form of networks. The inherent graph structure of network data motivated the evolution of the graph representation learning field. Its scope includes generating meaningful representations for graphs and their components, i.e., the nodes and the edges. The research on graph representation learning was accelerated with the success of message passing frameworks applied on graphs, namely the Graph Neural Networks. Learning informative and expressive representations on graphs plays a critical role in a wide range of real-world applications, from telecommunication and social networks, urban design, chemistry, and biology. In this thesis, we study various aspects from which Graph Neural Networks can be more expressive, and we propose novel approaches to improve their performance in standard graph learning tasks. The main branches of the present thesis include: the universality of graph representations, the increase of the receptive field of graph neural networks, the design of stable deeper graph learning models, and alternatives to the standard message-passing framework. Performing both theoretical and experimental studies, we show how the proposed approaches can become valuable and efficient tools for designing more powerful graph learning models.In the first part of the thesis, we study the quality of graph representations as a function of their discrimination power, i.e., how easily we can differentiate graphs that are not isomorphic. Firstly, we show that standard message-passing schemes are not universal due to the inability of simple aggregators to separate nodes with ambiguities (similar attribute vectors and neighborhood structures). Based on the found limitations, we propose a simple coloring scheme that can provide universal representations with theoretical guarantees and experimental validations of the performance superiority. Secondly, moving beyond the standard message-passing paradigm, we propose an approach for treating a corpus of graphs as a whole instead of examining graph pairs. To do so, we learn a soft permutation matrix for each graph, and we project all graphs in a common vector space, achieving a solid performance on graph classification tasks.In the second part of the thesis, our primary focus is concentrated around the receptive field of the graph neural networks, i.e., how much information a node has in order to update its representation. To begin with, we study the spectral properties of operators that encode adjacency information. We propose a novel parametric family of operators that can adapt throughout training and provide a flexible framework for data-dependent neighborhood representations. We show that the incorporation of this approach has a substantial impact on both node classification and graph classification tasks. Next, we study how considering the k-hop neighborhood information for a node representation can output more powerful graph neural network models. The resulted models are proven capable of identifying structural properties, such as connectivity and triangle-freeness.In the third part of the thesis, we address the problem of long-range interactions, where nodes that lie in distant parts of the graph can affect each other. In this problem, we either need the design of deeper models or the reformulation of how proximity is defined in the graph. Firstly, we study the design of deeper attention models, focusing on graph attention. We calibrate the gradient flow of the model by introducing a novel normalization that enforces Lipschitz continuity. Next, we propose a data augmentation method for enriching the node attributes with information that encloses structural information based on local entropy measures."}}

However, the increasingly heterogeneous graph datasets call for multimodal methods that can combine different inductive biases: the set of assumptions that algorithms use to make predictions for inputs they have not encountered during training. Learning on multimodal datasets presents fundamental challenges because the inductive biases can vary by data modality and graphs might not be explicitly given in the input. To address these challenges, multimodal graph AI methods combine different modalities while leveraging cross-modal dependencies using graphs. Diverse datasets are combined using graphs and fed into sophisticated multimodal architectures, specified as image-intensive, knowledge-grounded and language-intensive models. Using this categorization, we introduce a blueprint for multimodal graph learning, use it to study existing methods and provide guidelines to design new models."}}
