Determining the robustness of the best possible classifier under a given threat model and comparing it to that achieved by state-of-the-art training methods is thus an important diagnostic tool. In this paper, we find achievable information-theoretic lower bounds on loss in the presence of a test-time attacker for multi-class classifiers on any discrete dataset. We provide a general framework for computing lower bounds on 0-1 loss based on solving a linear program (LP). This LP is constructed based on what we introduce as a conflict hypergraph, and we explore different settings in the construction of this hypergraph and their impact on the computed lower bound. Our work enables, for the first time, an analysis of the gap to optimal robustness for classifiers in the multi-class setting."}}

Research on physical backdoors is limited by access to large datasets containing real images of physical objects co-located with misclassification targets. Building these datasets is time- and labor-intensive.\n\nThis work seeks to address the challenge of accessibility for research on physical backdoor attacks. We hypothesize that there may be naturally occurring physically co-located objects already present in popular datasets such as ImageNet. Once identified, a careful relabeling of these data can transform them into training samples for physical backdoor attacks. We propose a method to scalably identify these subsets of potential triggers in existing datasets, along with the specific classes they can poison. We call these naturally occurring trigger-class subsets natural backdoor datasets. Our techniques successfully identify natural backdoors in widely-available datasets, and produce models behaviorally equivalent to those trained on manually curated datasets. We release our code to allow the research community to create their own datasets for research on physical backdoor attacks."}}

Recently, \\emph{robustness to adversarial examples} has emerged as a desirable property for DNNs, spurring the development of robust training methods that account for adversarial\nexamples. In this paper, we aim to understand how the properties of representations learned by robust training differ from those obtained from standard, non-robust training. This is critical to diagnosing numerous salient pitfalls in robust networks, such as, degradation of performance on benign inputs, poor generalization of robustness, and increase in over-fitting. We utilize a powerful set of tools known as representation similarity metrics, across 3 vision datasets, to obtain layer-wise comparisons between robust and non-robust DNNs with different architectures, training procedures and adversarial constraints. Our experiments highlight hitherto unseen properties of robust representations that we posit underlie the behavioral differences of robust networks. We discover a lack of specialization in robust networks' representations along with a disappearance of `block structure'. We also find overfitting during robust training largely impacts deeper layers. These, along with other findings, suggest ways forward for the design and training of better robust networks."}}

Recent theoretical work has derived lower bounds on how robust \\emph{any model} can be, when a data distribution and attacker constraints are specified. However, these bounds only apply to arbitrary classification functions and do not account for specific architectures and models used in practice, such as neural networks. In this paper, we develop a methodology to analyze the robustness of fixed feature extractors, which in turn provide bounds on the robustness of any classifier trained on top of it. In other words, this indicates how robust the representation obtained from that extractor is with respect to a given adversary. Our bounds hold for arbitrary feature extractors. The tightness of these bounds relies on the effectiveness of the method used to find collisions between pairs of perturbed examples at deeper layers. For linear feature extractors, we provide closed-form expressions for collision finding while for arbitrary feature extractors, we propose a bespoke algorithm based on the iterative solution of a convex program that provably finds collisions. We utilize our bounds to identify the layers of robustly trained models that contribute the most to a lack of robustness, as well as compare the same layer across different training methods to provide a quantitative comparison of their relative robustness. Our experiments establish that each of the following lead to a measurable drop in robustness: i) layers that linearly reduce dimension, ii) sparsity induced by ReLU activations and, iii) mismatches in the attacker constraints at train and test time. These findings point towards future design considerations for robust models that arise from our methodology."}}

Such attacks can be realized in the physical world by attaching the adversarial patch to the object to be misclassified, and defending against such attacks is an unsolved/open problem. In this paper, we propose a general defense framework called PatchGuard that can achieve high provable robustness while maintaining high clean accuracy against localized adversarial patches. The cornerstone of PatchGuard involves the use of CNNs with small receptive fields to impose a bound on the number of features corrupted by an adversarial patch. Given a bounded number of corrupted features, the problem of designing an adversarial patch defense reduces to that of designing a secure feature aggregation mechanism. Towards this end, we present our robust masking defense that robustly detects and masks corrupted features to recover the correct prediction. Notably, we can prove the robustness of our defense against any adversary within our threat model. Our extensive evaluation on ImageNet, ImageNette (a 10-class subset of ImageNet), and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrates that our defense achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both provable robust accuracy and clean accuracy."}}

In particular, it is critical to determine classifier-agnostic bounds on the training loss to establish when learning is possible. In this paper, we determine optimal lower bounds on the cross-entropy loss in the presence of test-time adversaries, along with the corresponding optimal classification outputs. Our formulation of the bound as a solution to an optimization problem is general enough to encompass any loss function depending on soft classifier outputs. We also propose and provide a proof of correctness for a bespoke algorithm to compute this lower bound efficiently, allowing us to determine lower bounds for multiple practical datasets of interest. We use our lower bounds as a diagnostic tool to determine the effectiveness of current robust training methods and find a gap from optimality at larger budgets. Finally, we investigate the possibility of using of optimal classification outputs as soft labels to empirically improve robust training."}}

In this paper, we use optimal transport to characterize the maximum achievable accuracy in an adversarial classification scenario. In this setting, an adversary receives a random labeled example from one of two classes, perturbs the example subject to a neighborhood constraint, and presents the modified example to the classifier. We define an appropriate cost function such that the minimum transportation cost between the distributions of the two classes determines the \\emph{minimum $0-1$ loss for any classifier}. When the classifier comes from a restricted hypothesis class, the optimal transportation cost provides a lower bound. We apply our framework to the case of Gaussian data with norm-bounded adversaries and explicitly show matching bounds for the classification and transport problems and the optimality of linear classifiers. We also characterize the sample complexity of learning in this setting, deriving and extending previously known results as a special case. Finally, we use our framework to study the gap between the optimal classification performance possible and that currently achieved by state-of-the-art robustly trained neural networks for datasets of interest, namely, MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10."}}

Open-world learning frameworks include OOD detectors that aim to discard input examples which are not from the same distribution as the training data of machine learning classifiers. However, our understanding of current OOD detectors is limited to the setting of benign OOD data, and an open question is whether they are robust in the presence of adversaries. In this paper, we present the first analysis of the robustness of open-world learning frameworks in the presence of adversaries by introducing and designing \u00f8odAdvExamples. Our experimental results show that current OOD detectors can be easily evaded by slightly perturbing benign OOD inputs, revealing a severe limitation of current open-world learning frameworks. Furthermore, we find that \u00f8odAdvExamples also pose a strong threat to adversarial training based defense methods in spite of their effectiveness against in-distribution adversarial attacks. To counteract these threats and ensure the trustworthy detection of OOD inputs, we outline a preliminary design for a robust open-world machine learning framework."}}
