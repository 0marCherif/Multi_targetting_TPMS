In this paper we present three backdoor attacks that can be covertly inserted into data augmentation. Our attacks each insert a backdoor using a different type of computer vision augmentation transform, covering simple image transforms, GAN-based augmentation, and composition-based augmentation. By inserting the backdoor using these augmentation transforms, we make our backdoors difficult to detect, while still supporting arbitrary backdoor functionality. We evaluate our attacks on a range of computer vision benchmarks and demonstrate that an attacker is able to introduce backdoors through just a malicious augmentation routine."}}

FL is promoted as a privacy-enhancing technology (PET) that provides data minimization: data never \"leaves\" personal devices and users share only model updates with a server (e.g., a company) coordinating the distributed training. While prior work showed that in vanilla FL a malicious server can extract users' private data from the model updates, in this work we take it further and demonstrate that a malicious server can reconstruct user data even in hardened versions of the protocol. More precisely, we propose an attack against FL protected with distributed differential privacy (DDP) and secure aggregation (SA). Our attack method is based on the introduction of sybil devices that deviate from the protocol to expose individual users' data for reconstruction by the server. The underlying root cause for the vulnerability to our attack is a power imbalance: the server orchestrates the whole protocol and users are given little guarantees about the selection of other users participating in the protocol. Moving forward, we discuss requirements for privacy guarantees in FL. We conclude that users should only participate in the protocol when they trust the server or they apply local primitives such as local DP, shifting power away from the server. Yet, the latter approaches come at significant overhead in terms of performance degradation of the trained model, making them less likely to be deployed in practice."}}

The impact of changing the model aspect ratio on Transformers is then studied systematically. This ratio balances the number of layers and the number of attention heads per layer while keeping the total number of attention heads and all other hyperparameters constant. On average, across 4 NLP tasks and 10 attention types, single layer wide models perform 0.3% better than their deep counterparts. We show an in-depth evaluation and demonstrate how wide models require a far smaller memory footprint and can run faster on commodity hardware, in addition, these wider models are also more interpretable. For example, a single layer Transformer on the IMDb byte level text classification has 3.1x faster inference latency on a CPU than its equally accurate deeper counterpart, and is half the size. We therefore put forward wider and shallower models as a viable and desirable alternative for small models on NLP tasks, and as an important area of research for domains beyond this."}}

In this work, we are also interested in combining different attention types to build heterogeneous Transformers. Focussing on NLP-based tasks, we first propose a DARTS-like Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to find the best attention for a given task. In this setup, all heads use the same attention (homogeneous models). Our results suggest that NAS is highly effective at this, and it identifies the best attention mechanisms for IMDb byte level text classification and Listops. We then extend our framework to search for and build Transformers with multiple different attention types, and call them heterogeneous Transformers. We show that whilst these heterogeneous Transformers are better than the average homogeneous models, they cannot outperform the best. We explore the reasons why heterogeneous attention makes sense, and why it ultimately fails."}}

Previous literature has demonstrated that at the training stage attackers can manipulate data (Gu et al.) and data sampling procedures (Shumailov et al.) to control model behaviour. A common attack goal is to plant backdoors i.e. force the victim model to learn to recognise a trigger known only by the adversary. In this paper, we introduce a new class of backdoor attacks that hide inside  model architectures i.e. in the inductive bias of the functions used to train. These backdoors are simple to implement, for instance by publishing open-source code for a backdoored model architecture that others will reuse unknowingly. We demonstrate that model architectural backdoors represent a real threat and, unlike other approaches, can survive a complete re-training from scratch. We formalise the main construction principles behind architectural backdoors, such as a link between the input and the output, and describe some possible protections against them. We evaluate our attacks on computer vision benchmarks of different scales and demonstrate the underlying vulnerability is pervasive in a variety of common training settings. "}}

Yet, machine learning has proven to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Large number of modern systems protect themselves against such attacks by targeting the artificiality, i.e., they deploy mechanisms to detect the lack of human involvement in generating the adversarial examples. However, these defenses implicitly assume that humans are incapable of producing meaningful and targeted adversarial examples. In this paper, we show that this base assumption is wrong. In particular, we demonstrate that for tasks like speaker identification, a human is capable of producing analog adversarial examples directly with little cost and supervision: by simply speaking through a tube, an adversary reliably impersonates other speakers in eyes of ML models for speaker identification. Our findings extend to a range of other acoustic-biometric tasks such as liveness, bringing into question their use in security-critical settings in real life, such as phone banking."}}

Typically, keyword spotting is two-fold: an on-device model first identifies the keyword, then the resulting voice sample triggers a second on-cloud model which verifies and processes the activation. In this work, we explore the significant privacy and security concerns that this raises under two threat models. First, our experiments demonstrate that accidental activations result in up to a minute of speech recording being uploaded to the cloud. Second, we verify that adversaries can systematically trigger misactivations through adversarial examples, which exposes the integrity and availability of services connected to the voice assistant. We propose EKOS (Ensemble for KeywOrd Spotting) which leverages the semantics of the KWS task to defend against both accidental and adversarial activations. EKOS incorporates spatial redundancy from the acoustic environment at training and inference time to minimize distribution drifts responsible for accidental activations. It also exploits a physical property of speech\u2014its redundancy at different harmonics\u2014to deploy an ensemble of models trained on different harmonics and provably force the adversary to modify more of the frequency spectrum to obtain adversarial examples. Our evaluation shows that EKOS increases the cost of adversarial activations, while preserving the natural accuracy. We validate the performance of EKOS with over-the-air experiments on commodity devices and commercial voice assistants; we find that EKOS improves the precision of the KWS task in non-adversarial settings."}}

They design networks with better performance and use a much shorter search time compared to traditional manual tuning. Despite their efficiency in model deployments, most NAS algorithms target a single task on a fixed hardware system. However, real-life few-shot learning environments often cover a great number of tasks ($T$) and deployments on a wide variety of hardware platforms ($H$). \t\n\nThe combinatorial search complexity $T \\times H$ creates a fundamental search efficiency challenge if one naively applies existing NAS methods to these scenarios. To overcome this issue, we show, for the first time, how to rapidly adapt model architectures to new tasks in a \\emph{many-task many-hardware} few-shot learning setup by integrating Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) into the NAS flow. The proposed NAS method (H-Meta-NAS) is hardware-aware and performs optimisation in the MAML framework. MetaNAS shows a Pareto dominance compared to a variety of NAS and manual baselines in popular few-shot learning benchmarks with various hardware platforms and constraints. In particular, on the 5-way 1-shot Mini-ImageNet classification task,  the proposed method outperforms the best manual baseline by a large margin ($5.21\\%$ in accuracy) using $60\\%$ less computation."}}
