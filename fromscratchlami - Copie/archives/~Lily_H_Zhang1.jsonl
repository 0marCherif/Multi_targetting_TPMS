However, these methods struggle to detect OOD inputs that share nuisance values (e.g. background) with in-distribution inputs. The detection of shared-nuisance out-of-distribution (SN-OOD) inputs is particularly relevant in real-world applications, as anomalies and in-distribution inputs tend to be captured in the same settings during deployment. In this work, we provide a possible explanation for SN-OOD detection failures and propose nuisance-aware OOD detection to address them. Nuisance-aware OOD detection substitutes a classifier trained via empirical risk minimization and cross-entropy loss with one that 1. is trained under a distribution where the nuisance-label relationship is broken and 2. yields representations that are independent of the nuisance under this distribution, both marginally and conditioned on the label. We can train a classifier to achieve these objectives using Nuisance-Randomized Distillation (NuRD), an algorithm developed for OOD generalization under spurious correlations. Output- and feature-based nuisance-aware OOD detection perform substantially better than their original counterparts, succeeding even when detection based on domain generalization algorithms fails to improve performance."}}

In this work, we explain why this behavior should be attributed to model misestimation. We first prove that no method can guarantee performance beyond random chance without assumptions on which out-distributions are relevant. We then interrogate the typical set hypothesis, the claim that relevant out-distributions can lie in high likelihood regions of the data distribution, and that OOD detection should be defined based on the data distribution's typical set. We highlight the consequences implied by assuming support overlap between in- and out-distributions, as well as the arbitrariness of the typical set for OOD detection. Our results suggest that estimation error is a more plausible explanation than the misalignment between likelihood-based OOD detection and out-distributions of interest, and we illustrate how even minimal estimation error can lead to OOD detection failures, yielding implications for future work in deep generative modeling and OOD detection."}}

For example, in classifying animals in natural images, the background, which is a nuisance, can predict the type of animal.

To build predictive models that perform well regardless of the nuisance-label relationship, we develop Nuisance-Randomized Distillation (NURD). We introduce the nuisance-randomized distribution, a distribution where the nuisance and the label are independent. Under this distribution, we define the set of representations such that conditioning on any member, the nuisance and the label remain independent. We prove that the representations in this set always perform better than chance, while representations outside of this set may not. NURD finds a representation from this set that is most informative of the label under the nuisance-randomized distribution, and we prove that this representation achieves the highest performance regardless of the nuisance-label relationship. We evaluate NURD on several tasks including chest X-ray classification where, using non-lung patches as the nuisance, NURD produces models that predict pneumonia under strong spurious correlations."}}

We show, however, that existing architectures struggle to perform well when they are deep. In this work, we address this issue for the two most widely used permutation invariant networks, Deep Sets and its transformer analogue Set Transformer. We take inspiration from previous efforts to scale neural network architectures by incorporating normalization layers and skip connections that work for sets. First, we motivate and develop set norm, a normalization tailored for sets. Then, we employ equivariant residual connections and introduce the ``clean path principle'' for their placement. With these changes, our many-layer Deep Sets++ and Set Transformer++ models reach comparable or better performance than their original counterparts on a diverse suite of tasks, from point cloud classification to regression on sets of images. We additionally introduce Flow-RBC, a new single-cell dataset and real-world application of permutation invariant prediction. On this task, our new models outperform existing methods as well as a clinical baseline. We open-source our data and code here: link-omitted-for-anonymity."}}

To enable efficient comparison, we introduce an amortized variational inference framework that can perform fast and reliable posterior estimation across models of the same architecture. Our Any Parameter Encoder (APE) extends the encoder neural network common in amortized inference to take both a data feature vector and a model parameter vector as input. APE thus reduces posterior inference across unseen data and models to a single forward pass. In experiments comparing candidate topic models for synthetic data and product reviews, our Any Parameter Encoder yields comparable posteriors to more expensive methods in far less time, especially when the encoder architecture is designed in model-aware fashion."}}
