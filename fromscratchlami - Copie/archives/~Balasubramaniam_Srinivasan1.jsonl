Recent works have factored in both the relational (atomic bonds) and the geometric aspects (atomic positions) of the task, notably bringing together graph neural networks (GNNs) with neural networks for point clouds. The equivariances and invariances to geometric transformations (group actions such as rotations and translations) so far treats large molecules as rigid structures.

The conformations of a protein, however, cannot be described as input-independent transformations of the protein: Two proteins may require different sets of transformations in order to describe their set of viable conformations. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of conditional transformations (CT). CT can capture protein structure, while respecting the restrictions posed by constraints on dihedral (torsion) angles and steric repulsions between atoms. We then introduce a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework to learn representations that are invariant to these conditional transformations. Our results show that endowing existing baseline models with these conditional transformations helps improve their performance without sacrificing computational cost."}}

Unfortunately, it was shown that these architectures are limited in their expressive power. This paper proposes a novel framework called Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Networks (ESAN) to address this issue. Our main observation is that while two graphs may not be distinguishable by an MPNN, they often contain distinguishable subgraphs. Thus, we propose to represent each graph as a set of subgraphs derived by some predefined policy, and to process it using a suitable equivariant architecture. We develop novel variants of the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test for graph isomorphism, and prove lower bounds on the expressiveness of ESAN in terms of these new WL variants. We further prove that our approach increases the expressive power of both MPNNs and more expressive architectures. Moreover, we provide theoretical results that describe how design choices such as the subgraph selection policy and equivariant neural architecture affect our architecture's expressive power. To deal with the increased computational cost, we propose a subgraph sampling scheme, which can be viewed as a stochastic version of our framework. A comprehensive set of experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrates that our framework improves the expressive power and overall performance of popular GNN architectures. "}}

Using invariant theory, we show that relationship between structural representations and node embeddings is analogous to that of a distribution and its samples. We prove that all tasks that can be performed by node embeddings can also be performed by structural representations and vice-versa. We also show that the concept of transductive and inductive learning is unrelated to node embeddings and graph representations, clearing another source of confusion in the literature. Finally, we introduce new practical guidelines to generating  and  using  node  embeddings, which further augments standard operating procedures used today."}}
