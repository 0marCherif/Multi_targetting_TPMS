The core of the novel model are  global context self-attention modules, joint with standard local self-attention, to effectively yet efficiently model both long and short-range spatial interactions, as an alternative to complex operations such as an attention masks or local windows shifting. While the local self-attention modules are responsible for modeling short-range information, the global query tokens are shared across all global self-attention modules to interact with local key and values. In addition, we address the lack of inductive bias in ViTs and improve the modeling of inter-channel dependencies by proposing a novel downsampler which leverages a parameter-efficient fused inverted residual block. The proposed GC ViT achieves new state-of-the-art performance across image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. On ImageNet-1K dataset for classification, the tiny, small and base variants of GC ViT with 28M, 51M and 90M parameters achieve 83.4%, 83.9% and 84.4% Top-1 accuracy, respectively, surpassing comparably-sized prior art such as CNN-based ConvNeXt and ViT-based Swin Transformer. Pre-trained GC ViT backbones in downstream tasks of object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation on MS COCO and ADE20K datasets outperform prior work consistently, sometimes by large margins."}}

The inherent privacy-preserving property of FL algorithms makes them especially attractive to the medical field. However, in case of heterogeneous client data distributions, standard FL methods are unstable and require intensive hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance. Conventional hyperparameter optimization algorithms are impractical in real-world FL applications as they involve numerous training trials, which are often not affordable with limited compute budgets. In this work, we propose an efficient reinforcement learning\u00a0(RL)-based federated hyperparameter optimization algorithm, termed Auto-FedRL, in which an online RL agent can dynamically adjust hyperparameters of each client based on the current training progress. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate different search strategies and RL agents. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on a heterogeneous data split of the CIFAR-10 dataset as well as two real-world medical image segmentation datasets for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in chest CT and pancreas segmentation in abdominal CT."}}

We demonstrate successful pre-training of the proposed model on 5,050 publicly available computed tomography (CT) images from various body organs. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by fine-tuning the pre-trained models on the Beyond the Cranial Vault (BTCV) Segmentation Challenge with 13 abdominal organs and segmentation tasks from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset.

Given the recent success of deep learning in medical image segmentation, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been introduced to find high-performance 3D segmentation network architectures. However, because of the massive computational requirements of 3D data and the discrete optimization nature of architecture search, previous NAS methods require a long search time or necessary continuous relaxation, and commonly lead to sub-optimal network architectures. While one-shot NAS can potentially address these disadvantages, its application in the segmentation domain has not been well studied in the expansive multi-scale multi-path search space. To enable one-shot NAS for medical image segmentation, our method, named HyperSegNAS, introduces a HyperNet to assist super-net training by incorporating architecture topology information. Such a HyperNet can be removed once the super-net is trained and introduces no overhead during architecture search. We show that HyperSegNAS yields better performing and more intuitive architectures compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation networks; furthermore, it can quickly and accurately find good architecture candidates under different computing constraints. Our method is evaluated on public datasets from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, and achieves SOTA performances."}}

During this attack, the original data batch is reconstructed given model weights and the corresponding gradients. We introduce a method, named GradViT, that optimizes random noise into naturally looking images via an iterative process. The optimization objective consists of (i) a loss on matching the gradients, (ii) image prior in the form of distance to batch-normalization statistics of a pretrained CNN model, and (iii) a total variation regularization on patches to guide correct recovery locations. We propose a unique loss scheduling function to overcome local minima during optimization. We evaluate GadViT on ImageNet1K and MS-Celeb-1M datasets, and observe unprecedentedly high fidelity and closeness to the original (hidden) data. During the analysis we find that vision transformers are significantly more vulnerable than previously studied CNNs due to the presence of the attention mechanism. Our method demonstrates new state-of-the-art results for gradient inversion in both qualitative and quantitative metrics. Project page at https://gradvit.github.io/."}}

Manual methods are often laborious and current deep-learning-based approaches fail to delineate all building instances and do so with adequate accuracy. As a solution, we present Trainable Deep Active Contours (TDACs), an automatic image segmentation framework that intimately unites Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Active Contour Models (ACMs). The Eulerian energy functional of the ACM component includes per-pixel parameter maps that are predicted by the backbone CNN, which also initializes the ACM. Importantly, both the ACM and CNN components are fully implemented in TensorFlow and the entire TDAC architecture is end-to-end automatically differentiable and backpropagation trainable without user intervention. TDAC yields fast, accurate, and fully automatic simultaneous delineation of arbitrarily many buildings in the image. We validate the model on two publicly available aerial image datasets for building segmentation, and our results demonstrate that TDAC establishes a new state-of-the-art performance."}}
