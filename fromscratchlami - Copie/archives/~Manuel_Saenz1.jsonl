We analyze the particular cases of probabilities appearing in classical and quantum mechanics and the approach to generalized probabilities based on convex sets. We argue for considering quantum probabilities as the natural probabilistic assignments for rational agents dealing with contextual probabilistic models. In this way, the formal structure of quantum probabilities as a non-Boolean probabilistic calculus is endowed with a natural interpretation."}}

Furthermore, we find a probabilistic representation for the running time of these algorithms leading to asymptotic estimates of the mean running times."}}

We also provide upper bounds for the rate of convergence in terms of the one of the energy per variable. Furthermore, we establish a concentration inequality for bounded functions in a subset of the high-temperature phase. These results are exemplified by analysing the asymptotic behaviour of the empirical mean of coordinate-wise functions of samples from the Gibbs measure of the model."}}

Characterizing and designing efficient algorithms to compute (or approximate) this independence number for random graphs are notoriously difficult and still largely open issues. In this paper, we show that a low complexity degree-greedy exploration is actually asymptotically optimal on a large class of sparse random graphs. Encouraged by this result, we present and study two variants of sequential exploration algorithms: static and dynamic degree-aware explorations. We derive hydrodynamic limits for both of them, which in turn allow us to compute the size of the resulting independent set. Whereas the former is simpler to compute, the latter may be used to arbitrarily approximate the degree-greedy algorithm. Both can be implemented in a distributed manner. The corresponding hydrodynamic limits constitute an efficient method to compute or bound the independence number for a large class of sparse random graphs. As an application, we then show how our method may be used to compute (or approximate) the capacity of a large 802.11-based wireless network."}}

We prove the concentration of an infinite family of order parameters called multioverlaps. Because they completely parametrize the quenched Gibbs measure of the system, this implies a simple representation of the asymptotic Gibbs measures, as well as the decoupling of the variables in a strong sense. These results may prove themselves useful in several contexts. In particular in machine learning and high-dimensional inference, log-concave measures appear in convex empirical risk minimization, maximum a-posteriori inference or M-estimation. We believe that they may be applicable in establishing some type of \u2018replica symmetric formulas\u2019 for the free energy, inference or generalization error in such settings."}}

The model is mismatched in the following sense: like the model assumed by the statistician, the labels-generating process is linear in the input data, but both the classifier ground-truth prior and gaussian noise variance are unknown to her. This inference model can be rephrased as a version of the Gardner model in spin glasses and, using the cavity method, we provide fixed point equations for various overlap order parameters, yielding in particular an expression for the mean-square reconstruction error on the classifier (under an assumption of uniqueness of solutions). As a direct corollary we obtain an expression for the free energy. Similar models have already been studied by Shcherbina and Tirozzi and by Talagrand, but our arguments are more straightforward and some assumptions are relaxed. An interesting consequence of our analysis is that in the random design setting of ridge regression, the performance of the posterior mean is independent of the noise variance (or \"temperature\") assumed by the statistician, and matches the one of the usual (zero temperature) ridge estimator."}}
