More specifically, during training, we utilize a pretrained semantic segmentation teacher network and transfer its semantic knowledge to the depth network. In order to enable such knowledge distillation across two different visual tasks, we introduce a small, trainable network that translates the predicted depth map to a semantic segmentation map, which can then be supervised by the teacher network. In this way, this small network enables the backpropagation from the semantic segmentation teacher\u2019s supervision to the depth network during training. In addition, since the commonly used object classes in semantic segmentation are not directly transferable to depth, we study the visual and geometric characteristics of the objects and design a new way of grouping them that can be shared by both tasks. It is noteworthy that our approach only modifies the training process and does not incur additional computation during inference. We extensively evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach on the standard KITTI benchmark and compare it with the latest state of the art. We further test the generalizability of our approach on Make3D. Overall, the results show that our approach significantly improves the depth estimation accuracy and outperforms the state of the art."}}

In this paper, we overcome this barrier by introducing a self-supervised learning approach trained directly on large-scale real-world object videos for category-level 6D pose estimation in the wild. Our framework reconstructs the canonical 3D shape of an object category and learns dense correspondences between input images and the canonical shape via surface embedding. For training, we propose novel geometrical cycle-consistency losses which construct cycles across 2D-3D spaces, across different instances and different time steps. The learned correspondence can be applied for 6D pose estimation and other downstream tasks such as keypoint transfer. Surprisingly, our method, without any human annotations or simulators, can achieve on-par or even better performance than previous supervised or semi-supervised methods on in-the-wild images.

Towards this end, most existing segmentation models apply bilinear up-sampling and convolutions to feature maps of different scales, and then align them at the same resolution. However, bilinear up-sampling blurs the precise information learned in these feature maps and convolutions incur extra computation costs. To address these issues, we propose the Implicit Feature Alignment function (IFA). Our method is inspired by the rapidly expanding topic of implicit neural representations, where coordinate-based neural networks are used to designate fields of signals. In IFA, feature vectors are viewed as representing a 2D field of information. Given a query coordinate, nearby feature vectors with their relative coordinates are taken from the multi-level feature maps and then fed into an MLP to generate the corresponding output. As such, IFA implicitly aligns the feature maps at different levels and is capable of producing segmentation maps in arbitrary resolutions. We demonstrate the efficacy of IFA on multiple datasets, including Cityscapes, PASCAL Context, and ADE20K. Our method can be combined with improvement on various architectures, and it achieves state-of-the-art computation-accuracy trade-off on common benchmarks. Code will be made available at https://github.com/hzhupku/IFA."}}

This paper demonstrates that a simple encoder-decoder architecture with a ResNet-like backbone and a small multi-scale head, performs on-par or better than complex semantic segmentation architectures such as HRNet, FANet and DDRNets.Na\u00efvely applying deep backbones designed for Image Classification to the task of Semantic Segmentation leads to subpar results, owing to a much smaller effective receptive field of these backbones. Implicit among the various design choices put forth in works like HRNet, DDRNet, and FANet are networks with a large effective receptive field. It is natural to ask if a simple encoder-decoder architecture would compare favorably if comprised of backbones that have a larger effective receptive field, though without the use of in-efficient operations like dilated convolutions.We show that with minor and inexpensive modifications to ResNets, enlarging the receptive field, very simple and competitive baselines can be created for Semantic Segmentation. We present a family of such simple architectures for desktop as well as mobile targets, which match or exceed the performance of complex models on the Cityscapes dataset. We hope that our work provides simple yet effective baselines for practitioners to develop efficient semantic segmentation models.

Most existing approaches rely on cameras only to perform segmentation in BEV space, which is fundamentally constrained by the absence of reliable depth information. Latest works leverage both camera and LiDAR modalities, but sub-optimally fuse their features using simple, concatenation-based mechanisms. In this paper, we address these problems by enhancing the alignment of the unimodal features in order to aid feature fusion, as well as enhancing the alignment between the cameras' perspective view (PV) and BEV representations. We propose X-Align, a novel end-to-end cross-modal and cross-view learning framework for BEV segmentation consisting of the following components: (i) a novel Cross-Modal Feature Alignment (X-FA) loss, (ii) an attention-based Cross-Modal Feature Fusion (X-FF) module to align multi-modal BEV features implicitly, and (iii) an auxiliary PV segmentation branch with Cross-View Segmentation Alignment (X-SA) losses to improve the PV-to-BEV transformation. We evaluate our proposed method across two commonly used benchmark datasets, i.e., nuScenes and KITTI-360. Notably, X-Align significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3 absolute mIoU points on nuScenes. We also provide extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the individual components."}}

This paper presents an efficient, intuitive, and unsupervised online adaptation method, AuxAdapt, for improving the temporal consistency of most neural network models. It does not require optical flow and only takes one pass of the video. Since inconsistency mainly arises from the model\u2019s uncertainty in its output, we propose an adaptation scheme where the model learns from its own segmentation decisions as it streams a video, which allows producing more confident and temporally consistent labeling for similarly-looking pixels across frames. For stability and efficiency, we leverage a small auxiliary segmentation network (AuxNet) to assist with this adaptation. More specifically, AuxNet readjusts the decision of the original segmentation network (Main-Net) by adding its own estimations to that of MainNet. At every frame, only AuxNet is updated via back-propagation while keeping MainNet fixed. We extensively evaluate our test-time adaptation approach on standard video benchmarks, including Cityscapes, CamVid, and KITTI. The results demonstrate that our approach provides label-wise accurate, temporally consistent, and computationally efficient adaptation."}}

Given two nearby video frames, perceptual consistency measures how much the segmentation decisions agree with the pixel correspondences obtained via matching general perceptual features. More specifically, for each pixel in one frame, we find the most perceptually correlated pixel in the other frame. Our intuition is that such a pair of pixels are highly likely to belong to the same class. Next, we assess how much the segmentation agrees with such perceptual correspondences, based on which we derive the perceptual consistency of the segmentation maps across these two frames. Utilizing perceptual consistency, we can evaluate the temporal consistency of video segmentation by measuring the perceptual consistency over consecutive pairs of segmentation maps in a video. Furthermore, given a sparsely labeled test video, perceptual consistency can be utilized to aid with predicting the pixel-wise correctness of the segmentation on an unlabeled frame. More specifically, by measuring the perceptual consistency between the predicted segmentation and the available ground truth on a nearby frame and combining it with the segmentation confidence, we can accurately assess the classification correctness on each pixel. Our experiments show that the proposed perceptual consistency can more accurately evaluate the temporal consistency of video segmentation as compared to flow-based measures. Furthermore, it can help more confidently predict segmentation accuracy on unlabeled test frames, as compared to using classification confidence alone. Finally, our proposed measure can be used as a regularizer during the training of segmentation models, which leads to more temporally consistent video segmentation while maintaining accuracy."}}
