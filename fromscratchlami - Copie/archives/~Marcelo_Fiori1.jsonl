RDPGs crucially postulate that edge formation probabilities are given by the dot product of the corresponding latent positions. Accordingly, the embedding task of estimating these vectors from an observed graph is typically posed as a low-rank matrix factorization problem. The workhorse Adjacency Spectral Embedding (ASE) enjoys solid statistical properties, but it is formally solving a surrogate problem and can be computationally intensive. In this paper, we bring to bear recent advances in non-convex optimization and demonstrate their impact to RDPG inference. We advocate first-order gradient descent methods to better solve the embedding problem, and to organically accommodate broader network embedding applications of practical relevance. Notably, we argue that RDPG embeddings of directed graphs loose interpretability unless the factor matrices are constrained to have orthogonal columns. We thus develop a novel feasible optimization method in the resulting manifold. The effectiveness of the graph representation learning framework is demonstrated on reproducible experiments with both synthetic and real network data. Our open-source algorithm implementations are scalable, and unlike the ASE they are robust to missing edge data and can track slowly-varying latent positions from streaming graphs."}}

In any case, the latent vectors may be estimated through a spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix, the so-called Adjacency Spectral Embedding (ASE). Assume we are monitoring a stream of graphs and the objective is to track the latent vectors. Examples include recommender systems or monitoring of a wireless network. It is clear that performing the ASE of each graph separately may result in a prohibitive computation load. Furthermore, the invariance to rotations of the inner product complicates comparing the latent vectors at different time-steps. By considering the minimization problem underlying ASE, we develop an iterative algorithm that updates the latent vectors' estimation as new graphs from the stream arrive. Differently to other proposals, our method does not accumulate errors and thus does not requires periodically re-computing the spectral decomposition. Furthermore, the pragmatic setting where nodes leave or join the graph (e.g. a new product in the recommender system) can be accommodated as well.

The APs are distributed among more than 1,200 educational centers in the context of a nation-wide one-to-one computing program, being most of them primary and secondary schools. The data corresponds to RSSI measurements between APs used to build the conflict graphs for each school Wi-Fi network. We propose a simple embedding for the Wi-Fi network conflict graphs based on classical graph features, which proves to be useful to analyze the behavior of the wireless networks, showing a high discrimination power among the different school networks. Moreover, we discuss some practical applications of the embedding. In particular, it enables to study the Wi-Fi network dynamics at each school, analyzing the conflict graphs temporal variations through clustering techniques. The presented methodology allows us to successfully separate the most stable scenarios from those with more significant variability, which therefore require more technical resources to optimize the network. Besides, we also compared the behaviour of the Wi-Fi networks of the different schools, which enable us to reuse the optimal configuration found for one school in all those sites that have similar conflict graph patterns."}}

To this end, we will consider Random Dot Product Graphs (RDPGs), a simple yet rich family of random graphs that subsume Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi and Stochastic Block Model ensembles as particular cases. In RDPGs each node has an associated latent vector and inner products between these vectors dictate the edge existence probabilities. Previous works have mostly focused on the undirected and unweighted graph case, a gap we aim to close here. We first extend the RDPG model to accommodate directed and weighted graphs, a contribution whose interest transcends change-point detection (CPD). A statistic derived from the nodes' estimated latent vectors (i.e., embeddings) facilitates adoption of scalable geometric CPD techniques. The resulting algorithm yields interpretable results and facilitates pinpointing which (and when) nodes are acting differently. Numerical tests on simulated data as well as on a real dataset of graphs stemming from a Wi-Fi network corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed CPD method."}}

Several countries took various measures to prevent the saturation of the health system, ranging from closure of restaurants and suspension of classes to nighttime traffic restrictions. In this paper, we explore the effect of mobility restriction measures on the infection incidence in countries that are in some way similar to Uruguay: they have between one and twelve million inhabitants, a reasonable testing effort and they had the epidemic under control at some point. For these countries, we study mobility indexes provided by Google, an index on governmental measures compiled by the University of Oxford, and the daily new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. First, we observed that the mobility reported by Google is directly related to government measures: the higher the level of restrictive measures, the lower the mobility index. Then, we analyze the influence of mobility reduction on the growth/decrease speed of the 7-day average of new cases per 100,000 inhabitants (P7) and show that high levels of mobility reduction lead to a decrease in the index. Finally, we related the required duration of mobility restrictions with the P7 maximum and also point out the risk of lifting the measures too early."}}

This problem has applications in several areas, but is NP-hard in general. Usually an alternative convex problem is considered, based on minimizing the (weighted) $$\\ell _{1}$$ norm. For this alternative to be useful, weights should be chosen as to obtain a solution of the original NP-hard problem. A well known algorithm for this is the Re-Weighted $$\\ell _{1}$$, proposed by Cand\u00e8s, Wakin and Boyd. In this article we introduce a new methodology for updating the weights of a Re-Weighted $$\\ell _{1}$$ algorithm, based on identifying these weights as Lagrange multipliers. This is then translated into an algorithm with performance comparable to the usual methodology, but allowing an interpretation of the weights as Lagrange multipliers. The methodology may also be used for a noisy linear system, obtaining in this case a Re-Weighted LASSO algorithm, with a promising performance according to the experimental results."}}
