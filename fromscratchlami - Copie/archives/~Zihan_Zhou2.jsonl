However, the majority of existing methods synthesize floorplans in the format of rasterized images, which are difficult to edit or customize. In this paper, we aim to synthesize floorplans as sequences of 1-D vectors, which eases user interaction and design customization. To generate high fidelity vectorized floorplans, we propose a novel two-stage framework, including a draft stage and a multi-round refining stage. In the first stage, we encode the room connectivity graph input by users with a graph convolutional network\u00a0(GCN), then apply an autoregressive transformer network to generate an initial floorplan sequence. To polish the initial design and generate more visually appealing floorplans, we further propose a novel panoptic refinement network (PRN) composed of a GCN and a transformer network. The PRN takes the initial generated sequence as input and refines the floorplan design while encouraging the correct room connectivity with our proposed geometric loss. We have conducted extensive experiments on a real-world floorplan dataset, and the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under different settings and evaluation metrics."}}

We cast it as a sequence generation problem: starting from an arbitrary edge, we adopt a variant of the popular Transformer model to predict the edges associated with the same face in a natural order. This allows us to avoid searching the space of all possible edge loops with various handcrafted rules and heuristics as most existing methods do, deal with challenging cases such as curved surfaces and nested edge loops, and leverage additional cues such as face types.

Previous optimization-based methods can generate compact and accurate 3D models, but their success rates depend heavily on the ability to (i) identifying a sufficient set of true geometric constraints, and (ii) choosing a good initial value for the numerical optimization. In view of these challenges, we propose to train deep neural networks to detect pairwise relationships among geometric entities (i.e., edges) in the 3D object, and to predict initial depth value of the vertices. Our experiments on a large dataset of CAD models show that, by leveraging deep learning in a geometric constraint solving pipeline, the success rate of optimization-based 3D reconstruction can be significantly improved."}}

However, most existing methods make predictions based on human-labeled trajectories and ignore the errors and noises in detection and tracking. In this paper, we study the problem of human trajectory forecasting in raw videos, and show that the prediction accuracy can be severely affected by various types of tracking errors. Accordingly, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to correct the tracking failures by enforcing prediction consistency over time. The proposed \"re-tracking\" algorithm can be applied to any existing tracking and prediction pipelines. Experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can improve both tracking and prediction performance in challenging real-world scenarios.

However, unlike a full design file, a wireframe model lacks critical information, such as detailed shape, texture, and materials, needed by a conventional renderer to produce 2D renderings of the objects or scenes. In this paper, we bridge the information gap by generating photo-realistic rendering of indoor scenes from wireframe models in an image translation framework. While existing image synthesis methods can generate visually pleasing images for common objects such as faces and birds, these methods do not explicitly model and preserve essential structural constraints in a wireframe model, such as junctions, parallel lines, and planar surfaces. To this end, we propose a novel model based on a structure-appearance joint representation learned from both images and wireframes. In our model, structural constraints are explicitly enforced by learning a joint representation in a shared encoder network that must support the generation of both images and wireframes. Experiments on a wireframe-scene dataset show that our wireframe-to-image translation model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and structural integrity of generated images."}}

But only a few attempts have been made to incorporate them into deep neural networks. One main reason is that the standard convolution operation is defined on regular grids and becomes inefficient when applied to superpixels. Inspired by an initialization strategy commonly adopted by traditional superpixel algorithms, we present a novel method that employs a simple fully convolutional network to predict superpixels on a regular image grid. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art superpixel segmentation performance while running at about 50fps. Based on the predicted superpixels, we further develop a downsampling/upsampling scheme for deep networks with the goal of generating high-resolution outputs for dense prediction tasks. Specifically, we modify a popular network architecture for stereo matching to simultaneously predict superpixels and disparities. We show that improved disparity estimation accuracy can be obtained on public datasets."}}
