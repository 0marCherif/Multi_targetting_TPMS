Recently there have been many works using dependency trees to capture long-range dependencies between event triggers and event arguments. However, not all information in the dependency trees are useful for the EAE task. In this paper, we propose a Distance-Sensitive Graph Convolutional Network (DSGCN) for the EAE task. Our model can not only capture long-range dependencies via the graph convolution over the dependency trees, but also keep the information relevant to EAE via our designed distance-sensitive attention. Furthermore, dependency relation type information is utilized to enrich the representation of each word to further distinguish the roles of event arguments playing in an event. Experiment results on the ACE 2005 English dataset show that the proposed model achieves superior performance than the peer state-of-the-art methods."}}

This article provides an affirmative answer to this question. Existing fingerprinting schemes work in a kind of stand-alone mode, as they localize a user merely based on her own observations about surrounding environments. However, we argue the existence of scenarios where multiple users request for localization services simultaneously. If they are not far apart, their observations are actually distributed versions of the same environment, which can be exploited to calibrate underlying localization systems. In this article, we propose an online collaborative localization (OCLoc) scheme to boost received signal strength (RSS) fingerprinting in scenarios with multiple requesting users. The basic idea of OCLoc is based on the fact of distance attenuated radio propagations. For two users, their received signals from the same access point (AP) can be used to infer who is closer to this AP. We exploit such information for online collaboration and propose a series of operations to calibrate reference points (RPs) from distributed versions of radio attenuation observations. By integrating user calibration and fingerprint distance, we define a new ranking measure for reselecting and weighting candidate RPs to output the final location. Experiments on field measurements validate the effectiveness of such online collaborations in terms of greatly reduced localization errors."}}

The influence diffusion process in social network is modeled as a fluid dynamics system and the attitude of the user is modeled as the fluid temperature. Newton's law of cooling and fluid dynamics theory is utilized to obtain a more accurate value of equilibrium temperature. Important users are then greedily selected in this system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GFAET significantly outperforms other traditional methods in terms of positive influence spread on both artificially generated and real-trace network datasets."}}

To examine our argument, we first mine items\u2019 latent categorical distributions via random walk on an item graph constructed from sessions. We design a new neural model which consists of two prediction modules: One is to learn a session\u2019s latent categorical representation; The other is to learn a session\u2019s sequential representation. Each module independently makes a next item prediction, and their predictions are fused as the final recommendation result. Experiments on three public datasets validate that our model achieves performance improvements over the recent state-of-the-art algorithms."}}

This paper studies the problem of how to obtain many local matrices for improving the global rating approximation via averaging local MF results. In our scheme, we propose to use a feature divergence measure to compute the asymmetric distances in between users and items. To obtain local matrix approximation, we first propose to use a density-based clustering algorithm to automatically select a number of user-item pairs as anchors for self-adapting different datasets. Next for each anchor, we recruit its neighboring users and items with small feature divergences to the anchor, thus forming each local matrix. A kernel-based approach is then applied for local matrix approximation and a weighted averaging is used to obtain the global matrix rating approximations. Our experiments on the three real-world datasets show that the proposed solution can outperform the state-of-the-art schemes in terms of lower approximation errors and higher coverage ratios."}}

Abstract With the fast development of cyber\u2013physical systems, mobile applications and traffic demands have been significantly increasing in this decade. Likewise, the concerns about the electricity consumption impacts on environments and the energy costs of wireless networks have also been growing greatly. In this paper, we study the problem of energy cost minimization in a heterogeneous networks with hybrid energy supplies, where the network architecture consists of radio access part and wireless backhaul links. Owing to the diversities of mobile traffic and renewable energy, the energy cost minimization problem involves both temporal and spatial dimensional optimization. We decompose the whole problem into four sub-problems and correspondingly our proposed solution consists of four parts: At first, we obtain estimated average energy consumption profiles for all base stations based on the temporal traffic statistics; Second, we formulate the green energy allocation optimization in the temporal domain to minimize energy cost for each BS. Third, given the allocated green energy and practical user distribution in each slot, we propose a centralized and a distributed user association algorithm to minimize total energy cost in the spatial dimension. Fourth, based on the actual user association scheme, we readjust the green energy allocation for each BS to further improve green energy utilization. Simulation results show that our proposed solution can significantly reduce the total energy cost, compared with the recent peer algorithms."}}

Abstract Most of top-n personalized recommendation algorithms perform a kind of global learning-to-rank based on the original user\u2013item rating matrix, yet with an implicit presumption of a unified feature space for all users (all items). However, we argue that such a presumption is a limiting factor for better recommendation, because features learned in a global space could be too coarse-grained. As such, ranking a recommendation list against a unified space might be dominated by only a few significant aspects of users\u2019 interests. In this paper, we propose a novel local ranking and global fusion (LRGF) framework for personalized recommendation, which allows using multiple fine-grained feature spaces for learning-to-rank. In LRGF, we first adopt two-stage random walk on the established user graph and item graph for selecting those mostly related users and items, so as to form multiple local user\u2013item groups. Next, we propose a pairwise gap-aware Bayesian personalized ranking to obtain local ranking lists for each local user\u2013item group. Finally, a global decision fusion is proposed to obtain the final top-n recommendation list for each user only from her local ranking lists. Experiments on the three real-world datasets show that the proposed LRGF outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes in terms of higher mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain."}}

Recent studies have focused on designing recurrent neural networks to capture representation of users sequential behaviors from a large number of anonymous sessions. Although these neural models have greatly improved recommendation performance compared with traditional approaches, they have overemphasized the sequential information of sessions, that is, the order of items in each browsing session. We argue that besides the order of items, the set of items in each session can also reflect the general interests of current session and can also be exploited to augment recommendations. To this end, this paper proposes a joint neural model, called SGINM, for jointly learning sequential and general interests of each session for session-based recommendation. In SGINM, we design an attentive recurrent neural network which not only captures self-adaptive weighed representation of each subsequence in a session but also learns a global representation for the whole session. Furthermore, the SGINM adopts a multi-layer neural network with residual connections to learn the general interests of each session. The SGINM uses a softmax layer to jointly decode the two types of interests and output a ranking vector of recommended items for each new session. The proposed model has been extensively experimented with the benchmark datasets from the RecSys Challenge 2015 and CIKM Cup 2016. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, the proposed SGINM achieves better recommendation performance in terms of higher predicative accuracy and mean reciprocal rank in almost all experiment cases."}}

Prior studies have shown that document semantic and topical features can help improve classification performance. However, how to effectively extract and jointly exploit such features have not been well researched. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end topic-enhanced self-attention network (TESAN) that jointly encodes document semantics and extracts document topics. In particular, TESAN first constructs a neural topic model to learn topical information and generates a topic embedding for a document. We then propose a topic-enhanced self-attention mechanism to encode semantic and topical information into a document vector. Finally, a fusion gate is used to compose the document representation for emotion classification by integrating the document vector and the topic embedding. The entire TESAN is trained in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on three public datasets reveal that TESAN outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes in terms of higher classification accuracy and higher average Pearson correlation coefficient. Furthermore, the TESAN is computation efficient and can generate more coherent topics."}}
