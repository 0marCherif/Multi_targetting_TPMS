Eliminating reflective flare is highly desirable but challenging. Many existing methods rely on manually designed features to detect these bright spots, but they often fail to identify reflective flares created by various types of light and may even mistakenly remove the light sources in scenarios with multiple light sources. To address these challenges, we propose an optical center symmetry prior, which suggests that the reflective flare and light source are always symmetrical around the lens's optical center. This prior helps to locate the reflective flare's proposal region more accurately and can be applied to most smartphone cameras. Building on this prior, we create the first reflective flare removal dataset called BracketFlare, which contains diverse and realistic reflective flare patterns. We use continuous bracketing to capture the reflective flare pattern in the underexposed image and combine it with a normally exposed image to synthesize a pair of flare-corrupted and flare-free images. With the dataset, neural networks can be trained to remove the reflective flares effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets."}}

A unique departure from prior methods that leverage global attention, simply concatenate features, or implicitly manipulate features in latent space, we propose a component-specific correspondence to directly transfer the makeup style of a reference image to the corresponding components (e.g., skin, lips, eyes) of a source image, making elaborate and accurate local makeup transfer. As an auxiliary, the long-range visual dependencies of Transformer are introduced for effective global makeup transfer. Instead of the commonly used cycle structure that is complex and unstable, we employ a content consistency loss coupled with a content encoder to implement efficient single-path makeup transfer. The key insights of this study are modeling component-specific correspondence for local makeup transfer, capturing long-range dependencies for global makeup transfer, and enabling efficient makeup transfer via a single-path structure.We also contribute BeautyFace, a makeup transfer dataset to supplement existing datasets. This dataset contains 3,000 faces, covering more diverse makeup styles, face poses, and races. Each face has annotated parsing map. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against state-of-the-art methods. Besides, our method is appealing as it is with only 1M parameters, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods (BeautyGAN: 8.43M, PSGAN: 12.62M, SCGAN: 15.30M, CPM: 9.24M, SSAT: 10.48M)."}}

While traditional methods for depth completion have relied on stereo vision or structured light techniques, recent advances in deep learning have enabled more accurate and efficient completion of depth maps from RGB images and sparse ToF measurements. To evaluate the performance of different depth completion methods, we organized an RGB+sparse ToF depth completion competition. The competition aimed to encourage research in this area by providing a standardized dataset and evaluation metrics to compare the accuracy of different approaches. In this report, we present the results of the competition and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the top-performing methods. We also discuss the implications of our findings for future research in RGB+sparse ToF depth completion. We hope that this competition and report will help to advance the state-of-the-art in this important area of research.

Existing flare removal approaches mainly focus on removing daytime flares and fail in nighttime cases. Nighttime flare removal is challenging due to the unique luminance and spectrum of artificial lights, as well as the diverse patterns and image degradation of the flares. The scarcity of the nighttime flare removal dataset constraints the research on this crucial task. In this paper, we introduce Flare7K++, the first comprehensive nighttime flare removal dataset, consisting of 962 real-captured flare images (Flare-R) and 7,000 synthetic flares (Flare7K). Compared to Flare7K, Flare7K++ is particularly effective in eliminating complicated degradation around the light source, which is intractable by using synthetic flares alone. Besides, the previous flare removal pipeline relies on the manual threshold and blur kernel settings to extract light sources, which may fail when the light sources are tiny or not overexposed. To address this issue, we additionally provide the annotations of light sources in Flare7K++ and propose a new end-to-end pipeline to preserve the light source while removing lens flares. Our dataset and pipeline offer a valuable foundation and benchmark for future investigations into nighttime flare removal studies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Flare7K++ supplements the diversity of existing flare datasets and pushes the frontier of nighttime flare removal towards real-world scenarios."}}
