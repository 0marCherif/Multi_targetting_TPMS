A key in this campaign relies upon aligning the distributions of source and target domain. One common attempt is to enforce the global alignment between two domains, which, however, ignores the fatal local-imbalance domain gap problem, i.e., some local features with larger domain gap are harder to transfer. Recently, some methods conduct alignment focusing on local regions to improve the efficiency of model learning. While this operation may cause a deficiency of critical information from contexts. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel strategy to alleviate the domain gap imbalance considering the characteristics of medical images, namely <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Global-Local Union Alignment</i> . Specifically, a feature-disentanglement style-transfer module first synthesizes the target-like source images to reduce the global domain gap. Then, a local feature mask is integrated to reduce the \u2018inter-gap\u2019 for local features by prioritizing those discriminative features with larger domain gap. This combination of global and local alignment can precisely localize the crucial regions in segmentation target while preserving the overall semantic consistency. We conduct a series of experiments with two cross-modality adaptation tasks, i,e. cardiac substructure and abdominal multi-organ segmentation. Experimental results indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks."}}

Unlike existing approaches which mainly handle univariate time series for multi-step prediction, or multivariate time series for single-step predictions, ETN-ODE is capable of handling multivariate time series with arbitrary-step predictions. An additional benefit is its tandem attention mechanism, with respect to temporal and variable attention, which enable it to greatly facilitate data interpretability. Specifically, the proposed model combines an explainable tensorized gated recurrent unit with ordinary differential equations, with the derivatives of the latent states parameterized through a neural network. We quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of ETN-ODE on one arbitrary-step prediction task and five standard multi-step prediction tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves very accurate predictions at arbitrary time points while attaining very competitive performance against the baseline methods in standard multi-step time series prediction."}}

To alleviate the potential error, most previous works mainly consider aleatoric uncertainty arising from the inherit data noise. This may however lead to overconfidence in incorrect predictions and thus limit the performance. In this paper, we take advantage of Deterministic Uncertainty Methods (DUM) to explore the epistemic uncertainty, which reflects accurately the domain gap depending on the model choice and parameter fitting trained on source domain. The epistemic uncertainty on target domain is evaluated on-the-fly to facilitate online reweighting and correction in the self-training process. Meanwhile, to tackle the class-wise quantity and learning difficulty imbalance problem, we introduce a novel data resampling strategy to promote simultaneous convergence across different categories. This strategy prevents the class-level over-fitting in source domain and further boosts the adaptation performance by better quantifying the uncertainty in target domain. We illustrate the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods."}}

As a cheap yet effective approach, data augmentation has been widely used to create pseudo anomalies for better training of such models. Recent wisdom of augmentation methods focuses on generating random pseudo instances that may lead to a mixture of augmented instances with seen anomalies, or out of the typical range of anomalies. To address this issue, we propose a novel saliency-guided data augmentation method, SaliencyCut, to produce pseudo but more common anomalies which tend to stay in the plausible range of anomalies. Furthermore, we deploy a two-head learning strategy consisting of normal and anomaly learning heads, to learn the anomaly score of each sample. Theoretical analyses show that this mechanism offers a more tractable and tighter lower bound of the data log-likelihood. We then design a novel patch-wise residual module in the anomaly learning head to extract and assess the fine-grained anomaly features from each sample, facilitating the learning of discriminative representations of anomaly instances. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-world anomaly detection datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method to competing methods under various settings."}}

Previous attempts most conduct global-only/random augmentation. Their augmented samples are usually insufficient in diversity and informativeness, thus failing to cover the possible target domain distribution. In this paper, we rethink the data augmentation strategy for SDG in medical image segmentation. Motivated by the class-level representation invariance and style mutability of medical images, we hypothesize that unseen target data can be sampled from a linear combination of C (the class number) random variables, where each variable follows a location-scale distribution at the class level. Accordingly, data augmented can be readily made by sampling the random variables through a general form. On the empirical front, we implement such strategy with constrained Bezier transformation on both global and local (i.e. class-level) regions, which can largely increase the augmentation diversity. A Saliency-balancing Fusion mechanism is further proposed to enrich the informativeness by engaging the gradient information, guiding augmentation with proper orientation and magnitude. As an important contribution, we prove theoretically that our proposed augmentation can lead to an upper bound of the generalization risk on the unseen target domain, thus confirming our hypothesis. Combining the two strategies, our Saliency-balancing Location-scale Augmentation (SLAug) exceeds the state-of-the-art works by a large margin in two challenging SDG tasks.
