The majority of the state-of-the-art ML approaches for PdM use different condition monitoring data (e.g. vibrations, currents, temperature, etc.) and run to failure data for predicting the Remaining Useful Lifetime of components. However, the annotation of the component wear is not always easily identifiable, thus leading to the open issue of obtaining quality labeled data and interpreting it. This paper aims to introduce and test a Decision Support System (DSS) for solving a PdM task by overcoming the above-mentioned challenge while focusing on a real industrial use case, which includes advanced processing and measuring machines. In particular, the proposed DSS is comprised of the following cornerstones: data collection, feature extraction, predictive model, cloud storage, and data analysis. Differently from the related literature, our novel approach is based on a feature extraction strategy and ML prediction model powered by specific topics collected on the lower and upper levels of the production system. Compared with respect to other state-of-the-art ML models, the experimental results demonstrated how our approach is the best trade-off between predictive performance (MAE: 0.089, MSE: 0.018, $$R^{2}: 0.868$$ R 2 : 0.868 ), computation effort (average latency of 2.353 s for learning from 400 new samples), and interpretability for the prediction of processing quality. These peculiarities, together with the integration of our ML approach into the proposed cloud-based architecture, allow the optimization of the machining quality processes by directly supporting the maintainer/operator. These advantages may impact to the optimization of maintenance schedules and to get real-time warnings about operational risks by enabling manufacturers to reduce service costs by maximizing uptime and improving productivity."}}

Concerning the industrial scenario, we propose a DSS oriented to the aesthetic quality control (AQC) task, which has quickly established itself as one of the most crucial challenges of Industry 4.0. Taking into account the increasing amount of data in this domain, the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques offers great opportunities to automatize the overall AQC process. State-of-the-art is mainly oriented to approach this problem with a nominal DL classification method which does not exploit the ordinal structure of the AQC task, thus not penalizing the error among distant AQC classes (which is a relevant aspect for the real use case). The paper introduces a DL ordinal methodology for the AQC classification. Differently from other deep ordinal methods, we combined the standard categorical cross-entropy with the cumulative link model and we imposed the ordinal constraint via the thresholds and slope parameters. Experimental results were performed for solving an AQC task on a novel image dataset originated from a specific company\u2019s demand (i.e., aesthetic assessment of wooden stocks). We demonstrated how the proposed methodology is able to reduce misclassification errors (up to 0.937 quadratic weight kappa loss) among distant classes while overcoming other state-of-the-art deep ordinal models and reducing the bias factor related to the item geometry. The proposed DL approach was integrated as the main core of a DSS supported by Internet of Things (IoT) architecture that can support the human operator by reducing up to 90% the time needed for the qualitative analysis carried out manually in this specific domain."}}

The proposed affective computing approaches employ sequential machine learning algorithms for improving the classification stage, accounting for the time ambiguity of emotional responses. Modeling and predicting the affective state over time is not a trivial problem because continuous data labeling is costly and not always feasible. This is a crucial issue in real-life applications, where data labeling is sparse and possibly captures only the most important events rather than the typical continuous subtle affective changes that occur. In this work, we introduce a framework from the machine learning literature called Multiple Instance Learning, which is able to model time intervals by capturing the presence or absence of relevant states, without the need to label the affective responses continuously (as required by standard sequential learning approaches). This choice offers a viable and natural solution for learning in a weakly supervised setting, taking into account the ambiguity of affective responses. We demonstrate the reliability of the proposed approach in a gold-standard scenario and towards real-world usage by employing an existing dataset (DEAP) and a purposely built one (Consumer). We also outline the advantages of this method with respect to standard supervised machine learning algorithms."}}

Recently, the Wasserstein distance has been proposed as a new research direction to find better distribution mapping when compared with other popular statistical distances and divergences. In this work, first, frequency- and time-based features are extracted by vibration signals, and second, the Wasserstein distance is considered for the learning phase to discriminate the different machine operating conditions. Specifically, the 1-D Wasserstein distance is considered due to its low computational burden because it can be evaluated directly by the order statistics of the extracted features. Furthermore, a distance weighting stage based on neighborhood component features selection (NCFS) is exploited to achieve robust fault diagnosis at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions and with high-dimensional features. In detail, the NCFS framework is here adapted to weight 1-D Wasserstein distances evaluated from time/frequency features. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark data sets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis method at different SNR conditions. The comparison with state-of-the-art fault diagnosis algorithms shows promising results. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Note to Practitioners</i> \u2014This article was motivated by the problem of fault diagnosis of rotating machinery under low SNR and different machine operating conditions. The algorithm employs a statistical distance-based fault diagnosis technique, which permits to obtain an estimation of the fault signature without the need for training a classifier. The algorithm is computationally efficient during the training and testing stages, and thus, it can be used in embedded hardware. Finally, the proposed methodology can be applied to other application domains such as system monitoring and prognostics, which can help to schedule the maintenance of rotating machinery."}}

Despite this procedure presents many clinical advantages, relatively poor information is available about the loss of functionality of triceps surae of the treated leg. In this study, a group of patients who underwent a soleus muscle flap surgical procedure has been analyzed through the heel rise test (HRT), in order to explore the triceps surae residual functionalities. A frequency band analysis was performed in order to assess whether the residual heads of triceps surae exhibit different characteristics with respect to both the non-treated lower limb and an age-matched control group. Then, an in-depth analysis based on a machine learning approach was proposed for discriminating between groups by generalizing across new unseen subjects. Experimental results showed the reliability of the proposed analyses for discriminating between-group at a specific time epoch and the high interpretability of the proposed machine learning algorithm allowed the temporal localization of the most discriminative frequency bands. Findings of this study highlighted that significant differences can be recognized in the myoelectric spectral characteristics between the treated and contralateral leg in patients who underwent soleus flap surgery. These experimental results may support the clinical decision-making for assessing triceps surae performance and for supporting the choice of treatment in plastic and reconstructive surgery."}}

Timely identification and management from the first level of medical care represent the most effective strategy to address the growing global burden sustainably. Clinical practice guidelines suggest utilizing estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) for routine evaluation within a screening purpose. Accordingly, the analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using Machine Learning techniques offers great opportunities to monitor and predict the eGFR trend over time. This paper aims to propose a novel Semi-Supervised Multi-Task Learning (SS-MTL) approach for predicting short-term KD evolution on multiple General Practitioners\u2019 EHR data. We demonstrated that the SS-MTL approach can (i) capture the eGFR temporal evolution by imposing a temporal relatedness between consecutive time windows and (ii) exploit useful information from unlabeled patients when labeled patients are less numerous with a gain of up to 4.1% in terms of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Recall</i> . This situation reflects the real-case scenario, where available labeled samples are limited, but those unlabeled much more abundant. The SS-MTL approach, also given the high level of interpretability, might be the ideal candidate in general practice to get integrated within a decision support system for KD screening purposes."}}

The multiple aim of this study was to predict the risk of developing DR as diabetic complication (task 1) and, subsequently, temporally stratify the DR risk (task 2) using electronic health records data. To perform these objectives, a novel preprocessing procedure was designed to select both control and pathological patients, and moreover, a novel fully annotated/standardized 120K dataset from multiple diabetologic centers was provided. Globally, although the Extreme Gradient Boosting model offers satisfying predictive performance, the Random Forest model obtained the best predictive performance to solve task 1 and task 2, reaching the best Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve of 72.43 % and 84.38 %, respectively. Also the features importance extracted from the best Machine Learning (ML) models is provided.
