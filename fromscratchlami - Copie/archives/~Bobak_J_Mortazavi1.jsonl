An automatic noise detection method would offer significant utility for various domains. As data labeling is onerous, having a minimally supervised abnormality detection method for input data, as well as an estimation of the severity of the signal corruptness, is essential. We propose a model-free, time-series biomedical waveform noise detection framework using a Variational Autoencoder coupled with Gaussian Mixture Models, which can detect a range of waveform abnormalities without annotation, providing a confidence metric for each segment. Our technique operates on biomedical signals that exhibit periodicity of heart activities. This framework can be applied to any machine learning or deep learning model as an initial signal validator component. Moreover, the confidence score generated by the proposed framework can be incorporated into different models' optimization to construct confidence-aware modeling. The result confirms that our approach removes noisy cardiac cycles and the remaining signals, classified as clean, exhibit a 59.92% reduction in the standard deviation of DTW distances. Using a dataset of bio-impedance data of 97885 cardiac cycles, we further demonstrate a significant improvement in the downstream task of cuffless blood pressure estimation, with an average reduction of 2.67 mmHg root mean square error (RMSE) of Diastolic Blood pressure and 2.13 mmHg RMSE of systolic blood pressure, with increases of average Pearson correlation of 0.28 and 0.08, with a statistically significant improvement of signal-to-noise ratio respectively in the presence of different synthetic noise sources."}}

However, because these datasets do not contain the strict pairing of randomized control trials, matching techniques are to draw comparisons among patients. A key limitation to such techniques is verification that the variables used to model treatment decision making are also relevant in identifying the risk of major adverse events. This article explores a deep mixture of experts approach to jointly learn how to match patients and model the risk of major adverse events in patients. Although trained with information regarding treatment and outcomes, after training, the proposed model is decomposable into a network that clusters patients into phenotypes from information available before treatment. This model is validated on a dataset of patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock. The mixture of experts approach can predict the outcome of mortality with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 \u00b1 0.01 while jointly discovering five potential phenotypes of interest. The technique and interpretation allow for identifying clinically relevant phenotypes that may be used both for outcomes modeling as well as potentially evaluating individualized treatment effects."}}

Particularly, our novel confidence-awareness mechanism assigns likelihood scores to each hypothesis in an effort to discard potentially erroneous measurements \u2013 based on the agreement amongst a series of estimated changes and the physiological plausibility when considering DBP/SBP pairs. The particle filter formulation (or sequential Monte Carlo method) can jointly consider the hypotheses and their probabilities over time to provide a stable trend of estimated BP measurements. In this study, we evaluate BP trend estimation from an emerging bio-impedance (Bio-Z) prototype wearable modality although it is applicable to all types of physiological modalities. Each subject in the evaluation cohort underwent a hand-gripper exercise, a cold pressor test, and a recovery state to increase the variation to the captured BP ranges. Experiments show that CAPF yields superior continuous pulse pressure (PP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) estimation performance compared to ten baseline approaches. Furthermore, CAPF performs on track to comply with AAMI and BHS standards for achieving a performance classification of Grade A, with mean error accuracies of \u22120.16 \u00b1 3.75 mmHg for PP (r = 0.81), 0.42 \u00b1 4.39 mmHg for DBP (r = 0.92), and \u22120.09 \u00b1 6.51 mmHg for SBP (r = 0.92) from more than test 3500 data points."}}

Telemonitoring can be used to provide a communication pipeline between patients and clinicians for diagnosing hypertension and staging early intervention. However, it takes healthcare resources to monitor patients and identify patients at risk of experiencing a hypertensive event. To reduce the burden on the health care system, we present an automated early warning system to predict patients at risk of a hypertensive event. We first construct a fusion model that utilizes a dual stage attention mechanism to determine whether a hypertensive event occurs in the next seven days and compare its performance to XGBoost and logistic regression. Then, we measure its performance in an early warning system to determine whether it can detect the onset of the first hypertensive event for each patient. With the best threshold, the early warning system using this model has an F1 score of 0.61."}}

This data is a valuable resource for comprehending patient health and informing medical decisions, but it also contains many challenges in analysis. Deep learning models show promise in extracting meaningful patterns, but they require extensive labeled data, a challenge in critical care. To address this, we propose a novel approach employing self-supervised pretraining, focusing on the alignment of clinical measurements and notes. Our approach combines contrastive and masked token prediction tasks during pretraining. Semi-supervised experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our self-supervised pretraining. In downstream tasks, including in-hospital mortality prediction and phenotyping, our pretrained model outperforms baselines in settings where only a fraction of the data is labeled, emphasizing its ability to enhance ICU data analysis. Notably, our method excels in situations where very few labels are available, as evidenced by an increase in the AUC-ROC for in-hospital mortality by 0.17 and in AUC-PR for phenotyping by 0.1 when only 1% of labels are accessible. This work advances self-supervised learning in the healthcare domain, optimizing clinical insights from abundant yet challenging ICU data."}}

However, current methods are either invasive, requiring insertion of catheters, or provide limited information, lacking comprehensive ABP waveforms. Cuffless wearable solutions, combined with deep learning, offer potential but face challenges in accurately reconstructing ABP waveforms and estimating systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) due to individual variability. We propose a custom pre-trained backbone and a tailored optimization function to address these challenges. Our method demonstrates superior performance in ABP waveform reconstruction and accurate SBP/DBP estimations, while significantly reducing subject variance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted comprehensive evaluations using both in-clinic data and a pioneering study involving remote health monitoring with cuffless data. Our results surpass previous efforts, demonstrating a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.41 \u00b1 1.35 mmHg and a minimum of 58% lower standard deviation (SD) across all measurements. These outcomes highlight the robustness and precision of our method in accurately estimating SBP/DBP and reconstructing ABP waveforms. Furthermore, we assessed the performance of our solution in non-clinical settings using the CTRAL BioZ dataset. The evaluation yielded an RMSE of 8.66 \u00b1 1.13 mmHg for ABP, proving the potential of ABP reconstruction under remote health settings."}}

When exercise is of moderate intensity, performed between 25 and 55 minutes after a meal, it results in greater attenuation of glucose. However, the potential glucose reduction for shorter-duration, non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) (such as activities of daily living) may also be beneficial, particularly in cases where exercise is neither feasible nor prudent. Therefore, we designed a system to capture blood glucose and activity intensity through internet of medical things devices and modeled the impact of the timing and duration of NEAT on peak glucose. This work designed a linear mixed effects model to evaluate the impact of NEAT on peak, postprandial glucose in a study of data captured on varied participants with or without diabetes. We found at least 25 minutes of NEAT starting 30 minutes after the meal most effectively reduced peak post-prandial glucose.Clinical Relevance\u2014 This work establishes the impact of NEAT on reducing post-prandial peak glucose in free-living environments as another method of controlling glucose surges"}}

Wearable devices could allow for broad AI-based screening but frequently obtain noisy ECGs. We report a novel strategy that automates the detection of hidden cardiovascular diseases, such as LVSD, adapted for noisy single-lead ECGs obtained on wearable and portable devices. We use 385,601 ECGs for development of a standard and noise-adapted model. For the noise-adapted model, ECGs are augmented during training with random gaussian noise within four distinct frequency ranges, each emulating real-world noise sources. Both models perform comparably on standard ECGs with an AUROC of 0.90. The noise-adapted model performs significantly better on the same test set augmented with four distinct real-world noise recordings at multiple signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), including noise isolated from a portable device ECG. The standard and noise-adapted models have an AUROC of 0.72 and 0.87, respectively, when evaluated on ECGs augmented with portable ECG device noise at an SNR of 0.5. This approach represents a novel strategy for the development of wearable-adapted tools from clinical ECG repositories."}}

EHR data are rich and tracked at high frequency over time, and can be integrated into a real-time, continuous warning system. One problem that can benefit from real-time monitoring of EHR is the occurrence of invasive-ventilation (iV) for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. The prognostication of a future event falls in the domain of survival analysis. However, iV can occur multiple times during an ICU stay, while most survival analysis tools work only with non-recurring events. Moreover, most survival analysis models are restricted to time-static data, while EHR data changes over time, e.g. heart rate. Therefore, to model the iV problem we turn to BoXHED2.0 [2], a fully nonparametric survival machine learning method that is grounded in theory [3]. Importantly, BoXHED2.0 can handle recurring events data with time-dependent covariates, and we apply it to the MIMIC IV data set [4] to develop a real-time ICU iV warning indicator. Our ICU iV model achieves an AUCPR of 0.34 (versus 0.13 for the benchmarks) and an AUROC of 0.85 (versus 0.73 for the benchmarks) out of sample, speaking to its effectiveness in real-time risk monitoring."}}
