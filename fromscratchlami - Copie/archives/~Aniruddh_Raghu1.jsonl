We leverage that radio frequency (RF) signals in the WiFi range traverse clothes and occlusions and bounce off the human body. Our model parses such radio signals and recovers 3D body meshes. Our meshes are dynamic and smoothly track the movements of the corresponding people. Further, our model works both in single and multi-person scenarios. Inferring body meshes from radio signals is a highly under-constrained problem. Our model deals with this challenge using: 1) a combination of strong and weak supervision, 2) a multi-headed self-attention mechanism that attends differently to temporal information in the radio signal, and 3) an adversarially trained temporal discriminator that imposes a prior on the dynamics of human motion. Our results show that RF-Avatar accurately recovers dynamic 3D meshes in the presence of occlusions, baggy clothes, bad lighting conditions, and even through walls."}}

However, these time series can be complex to model, particularly when they consist of multimodal data measured at different resolutions. Most existing methods to learn representations of these data consider only tabular time series (e.g., lab measurements and vitals signs), and do not naturally extend to modelling a full, multimodal time series. In this work, we propose a contrastive pre-training strategy to learn representations of multimodal time series. We consider a setting where the time series contains sequences of (1) high-frequency electrocardiograms and (2)  structured data from labs and vitals. We outline a strategy to generate augmentations of these data for contrastive learning, building on recent work in representation learning for medical data. We evaluate our method on a real-world dataset, finding it obtains improved or competitive performance when compared to baselines on two downstream tasks."}}

Of these data, 242,216 records were used to pre-train a model that generates useful ECG representations. The remaining 6,739 records contain encounters with direct measurements of the mPCWP. Eighty percent of these data were used for model development and testing (5,390), and the remaining records comprise a holdout set (1,349) that was used to evaluate the model. We developed an associated unreliability score that identifies when model predictions are likely to be untrustworthy.\nResults\nThe model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.80 \u00b1 0.02 (test set) and 0.79 \u00b1 0.01 (holdout set). Model performance varies as a function of the unreliability, where patients with high unreliability scores correspond to a subgroup where model performance is poor: for example, patients in the holdout set with unreliability scores in the highest decile have a reduced AUC of 0.70 \u00b1 0.06.\nConclusions\nThe mPCWP can be inferred from the ECG, and the reliability of this inference can be measured. When invasive monitoring cannot be expeditiously performed, deep learning models may provide information that can inform clinical care."}}

PT can incorporate various design choices such as task and data reweighting strategies, augmentation policies, and noise models, all of which can significantly impact the quality of representations learned. The hyperparameters introduced by these strategies therefore must be tuned appropriately. However, setting the values of these hyperparameters is challenging. Most existing methods either struggle to scale to high dimensions, are too slow and memory-intensive, or cannot be directly applied to the two-stage PT and FT learning process. In this work, we propose an efficient, gradient-based algorithm to meta-learn PT hyperparameters. We formalize the PT hyperparameter optimization problem and propose a novel method to obtain PT hyperparameter gradients by combining implicit differentiation and backpropagation through unrolled optimization. We demonstrate that our method improves predictive performance on two real-world domains. First, we optimize high-dimensional task weighting hyperparameters for multitask pre-training on protein-protein interaction graphs and improve AUROC by up to 3.9%. Second, we optimize a data augmentation neural network for self-supervised PT with SimCLR on electrocardiography data and improve AUROC by up to 1.9%."}}

Recently developed methods to improve neural network training examine teaching: providing learned information during the training process to improve downstream model performance. In this paper, we take steps towards extending the scope of teaching. We propose a flexible teaching framework using commentaries,  learned meta-information helpful for training on a particular task. We present gradient-based methods to learn commentaries, leveraging recent work on implicit differentiation for scalability. We explore diverse applications of commentaries, from weighting training examples, to parameterising label-dependent data augmentation policies, to representing attention masks that highlight salient image regions. We find that commentaries can improve training speed and/or performance, and provide insights about the dataset and training process. We also observe that commentaries generalise: they can be reused when training new models to obtain performance benefits, suggesting a use-case where commentaries are stored with a dataset and leveraged in future for improved model training.

Towards Understanding the Effectiveness of MAML", "abstract": "An important research direction in machine learning has centered around developing meta-learning algorithms to tackle few-shot learning. An especially successful algorithm has been Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), a method that consists of two optimization loops, with the outer loop finding a meta-initialization, from which the inner loop can efficiently learn new tasks. Despite MAML's popularity, a fundamental open question remains -- is the effectiveness of MAML due to the meta-initialization being primed for rapid learning (large, efficient changes in the representations) or due to feature reuse,  with the meta initialization already containing high quality features? We investigate this question, via ablation studies and analysis of the latent representations, finding that feature reuse is the dominant factor. This leads to the ANIL (Almost No Inner Loop) algorithm, a simplification of MAML where we remove the inner loop for all but the (task-specific) head of the underlying neural network. ANIL matches MAML's performance on benchmark few-shot image classification and RL and offers computational improvements over MAML. We further study the precise contributions of the head and body of the network, showing that performance on the test tasks is entirely determined by the quality of the learned features, and we can remove even the head of the network (the NIL algorithm). We conclude with a discussion of the rapid learning vs feature reuse question for meta-learning algorithms more broadly."}}

We develop careful baselines for the performance of these methods when using different state representations, standardising the reward function formulation and evaluation methdology. Our results illustrate that simple, tabular Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning both lead to the most effective medical treatment strategies, and that temporal encoding in the state representation aids in discovering improved policies."}}

We show how powerful parametric models such as neural networks can result in highly uncalibrated behaviour policy models on a real-world medical dataset, and illustrate how a simple, non-parametric, k-nearest neighbours model produces better calibrated behaviour policy estimates and can be used to obtain superior importance sampling-based OPE estimates."}}

Our quantitative evaluation reveals that by blending the treatment strategy discovered with RL with what clinicians follow, we can obtain improved policies, potentially allowing for better medical treatment for sepsis."}}
