In this proposal, we extend this formulation to situations where one can obtain observations from multiple sources each with a given cost, such as when both computer simulations and a laboratory experiments can be used to calculate (or estimate) properties of a material of interest. We present a novel cost-efficient policy that balances the cost of obtaining observations with the benefit of evaluating a more expensive-to-compute source. Initial results on a synthetic problem show that our proposed methodology is more selective when searching for the most expensive source."}}

Molecular string representations, such as SMILES and SELFIES, serve as the basis for molecular generation and optimization in chemical language models, deep generative models, and evolutionary methods. While SMILES and SELFIES leverage atomic representations, Group SELFIES builds on top of the chemical robustness guarantees of SELFIES by enabling group tokens, thereby creating additional flexibility to the representation. Moreover, the group tokens in Group SELFIES can take advantage of inductive biases of molecular fragments that capture meaningful chemical motifs. The advantages of capturing chemical motifs and flexibility are demonstrated in our experiments, which show that Group SELFIES improves distribution learning of common molecular datasets. Further experiments also show that random sampling of Group SELFIES strings improves the quality of generated molecules compared to regular SELFIES strings. Our open-source implementation of Group SELFIES is available at \\url{https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/group-selfies}, which we hope will aid future research in molecular generation and optimization."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel solution for rapid screening for a change in the psychometric function estimation of a given patient. We use Bayesian active model selection to perform an automated pure-tone audiogram test with the goal of quickly finding if the current audiogram will be different from a previous audiogram. We validate our approach using audiometric data from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH. Initial results show that with a few tones we can detect if the patient's audiometric function has changed between the two test sessions with high confidence."}}

Active learning is an alternative approach where partial experimental data is used to iteratively design subsequent data collection. Here, we study experimental application of Bayesian Active Model Selection (BAMS), which designs trials to discriminate between a set of candidate models. We consider a model set defined by a generative grammar of Gaussian Process kernels that can model both simple functions and complex compositions of them. To validate the method experimentally, we use BAMS to discover how factors such as contrast and number affect numerosity judgements. We compare the rate of convergence of the active-learning method to a baseline passive-learning strategy that selects trials at random. Active learning over a structured model space may increase the efficiency and robustness of behavioral data acquisition and modeling."}}

One of its key components is the underlying probabilistic model used for the objective function f. In practice, however, it is often unclear how one should appropriately choose a model, especially when gathering data is expensive. In this work, we introduce a novel automated Bayesian optimization approach that dynamically selects promising models for explaining the observed data using Bayesian Optimization in the model space. Crucially, we account for the uncertainty in the choice of model; our method is capable of using multiple models to represent its current belief about f and subsequently using this information for decision making. We argue, and demonstrate empirically, that our approach automatically finds suitable models for the objective function, which ultimately results in more-efficient optimization."}}

We bridge this gap, addressing batch active search from both the theoretical and practical perspective. We first derive the Bayesian optimal policy for this problem, then prove a lower bound on the performance gap between sequential and batch optimal policies: the ``cost of parallelization.'' We also propose novel, efficient batch policies inspired by state-of-the-art sequential policies, and develop an aggressive pruning technique that can dramatically speed up computation. We conduct thorough experiments on data from three application domains: a citation network, material science, and drug discovery, testing all proposed policies (14 total) with a wide range of batch sizes. Our results demonstrate that the empirical performance gap matches our theoretical bound, that nonmyopic policies usually significantly outperform myopic alternatives, and that diversity is an important consideration for batch policy design."}}
