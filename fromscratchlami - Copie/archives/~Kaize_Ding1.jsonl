In real-world scenarios, few labeled anomalies are also easy to be accessed on similar networks from the same domain as of the target network, while most of the existing works omit to leverage them and merely focus on a single network. Taking advantage of this potential, in this work, we tackle the problem of few-shot network anomaly detection by (1) proposing a new family of graph neural networks -- Graph Deviation Networks (GDN) that can leverage a small number of labeled anomalies for enforcing statistically significant deviations between abnormal and normal nodes on a network; and (2) equipping the proposed GDN with a new cross-network meta-learning algorithm to realize few-shot network anomaly detection by transferring meta-knowledge from multiple auxiliary networks.

The current modus operandi, i.e., meta-learning, has succeeded in transferring the structural knowledge learned from \\textit{base classes} with abundant labeled nodes to few-shot \\textit{novel classes}. However, for real-world scenarios, it is often the case that all the classes on the graph have limited labeled nodes, thus meta-learning cannot be directly deployed. In this work, we generalize the few-shot node classification by removing the assumption that there exist abundant labeled nodes for the base classes. In the meantime, we propose a novel \\textit{Few-shot Node Prompt Tuning} method to effectively elicit substantial prior knowledge in the input graph for solving few-shot node classification tasks without labeled base classes. Specifically, we fix a pretrained graph transformer as the encoder and inject virtual nodes as soft prompts in the embedding space to bridge the gap of training objectives between the pretexts and downstream few-shot node classification tasks. Such prompts are small tensors and can be efficiently optimized with a simple classifier corresponding to the few labeled nodes. Since a single pretrained encoder is shared across different tasks, the proposed method retains the efficiency and potential for the model ensemble. Extensive experiments on four prevalent node classification datasets show that the proposed method, FS-NPT, is an efficient and effective way to tackle the general few-shot node classification problem. Our implementation is released\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/Anonymous-submit-23/FS-NPT.git}}."}}

This problem has drawn tremendous attention for its projection to prevailing real-world applications, such as product categorization for newly added commodity categories on an E-commerce platform with scarce records or diagnoses for rare diseases on a patient similarity graph. To tackle such challenging label scarcity issues in the non-Euclidean graph domain, meta-learning has become a successful and predominant paradigm.\nMore recently, inspired by the development of graph self-supervised learning, transferring pretrained node embeddings for few-shot node classification could be a promising alternative to meta-learning but remains unexposed. In this work, we empirically demonstrate the potential of an alternative framework, \\textit{Transductive Linear Probing}, that transfers pretrained node embeddings, which are learned from graph contrastive learning methods. We further extend the setting of few-shot node classification from standard fully supervised to a more realistic self-supervised setting, where meta-learning methods cannot be easily deployed due to the shortage of supervision from training classes. Surprisingly, even without any ground-truth labels, transductive linear probing with self-supervised graph contrastive pretraining can outperform the state-of-the-art fully supervised meta-learning based methods under the same protocol. We hope this work can shed new light on few-shot node classification problems and foster future research on learning from scarcely labeled instances on graphs."}}

Despite the proliferation of algorithms developed in recent years for this task, there has been no standard comprehensive setting for performance evaluation. Consequently, it has been difficult to understand which methods work well and when under a broad range of settings. To bridge this gap, we present\u2014to the best of our knowledge\u2014the first comprehensive benchmark for unsupervised outlier node detection on static attributed graphs called BOND, with the following highlights. (1) We benchmark the outlier detection performance of 14 methods ranging from classical matrix factorization to the latest graph neural networks. (2) Using nine real datasets, our benchmark assesses how the different detection methods respond to two major types of synthetic outliers and separately to \u201corganic\u201d (real non-synthetic) outliers. (3) Using an existing random graph generation technique, we produce a family of synthetically generated datasets of different graph sizes that enable us to compare the running time and memory usage of the different outlier detection algorithms. Based on our experimental results, we discuss the pros and cons of existing graph outlier detection algorithms, and we highlight opportunities for future research. Importantly, our code is freely available and meant to be easily extendable: https://github.com/pygod-team/pygod/tree/main/benchmark"}}

However, these techniques can be abused to generate disinformation and fake news. To better understand the potential threats of synthetic news, we develop a novel generation method FACTGEN to generate high-quality news content. The majority of existing text generation methods either afford limited supplementary information or lose consistency between the input and output which makes the synthetic news less trustworthy. To address these issues, FACTGEN retrieves external facts to enrich the output and reconstructs the input claim from the generated content to improve the consistency among the input and the output. Experiment results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the generated news contents of FACTGEN are consistent and contain rich facts. We also discuss an effective defending technique to identify these synthetic news pieces if FACTGEN was used to generate fake news."}}

As a central analytical task on attributed networks, node classification has received much attention in the research community. In real-world attributed networks, a large portion of node classes only contains limited labeled instances, rendering a long-tail node class distribution. Existing node classification algorithms are unequipped to handle the few-shot node classes. As a remedy, few-shot learning has attracted a surge of attention in the research community. Yet, few-shot node classification remains a challenging problem as we need to address the following questions: (i) How to extract meta-knowledge from an attributed network for few-shot node classification? (ii) How to identify the informativeness of each labeled instance for building a robust and effective model? To answer these questions, in this paper, we propose a graph meta-learning framework -- Graph Prototypical Networks (GPN). By constructing a pool of semi-supervised node classification tasks to mimic the real test environment, GPN is able to perform meta-learning on an attributed network and derive a highly generalizable model for handling the target classification task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior capability of GPN in few-shot node classification."}}
