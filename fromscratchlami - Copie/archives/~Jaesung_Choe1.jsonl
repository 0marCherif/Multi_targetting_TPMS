Both cameras have the same structure except for the presence of a Bayer filter, but have a fundamental trade-off. The Bayer filter allows capturing chrominance information of scenes, but limits a quantum efficiency of cameras, which causes severe image noise. It seems ideal if we can take advantage of both the cameras so that we obtain noise-free images with their corresponding disparity maps. However, image luminance recorded from a color camera is not consistent with that from a monochrome camera due to spatially-varying illumination and different spectral sensitivities of the cameras. This degrades the performance of stereo matching. To solve this problem, we design CMSNet for disparity estimation from noisy color and relatively clean monochrome images. CMSNet also infers a noise-free image with the estimated disparity map. We leverage a data augmentation to simulate realistic signal-dependent noise and various radiometric distortions between input stereo pairs to train CMSNet effectively. CMSNet is evaluated using various datasets and the performance of our disparity estimation and image enhancement consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}}

Despite its simplicity compared to Transformer, the concept of channel-mixing MLPs and token-mixing MLPs achieves noticeable performance in image recognition tasks. Unlike images, point clouds are inherently sparse, unordered and irregular, which limits the direct use of MLP-Mixer for point cloud understanding. To overcome these limitations, we propose PointMixer, a universal point set operator that facilitates information sharing among unstructured 3D point cloud. By simply replacing token-mixing MLPs with Softmax function, PointMixer can \u201cmix\u201d features within/between point sets. By doing so, PointMixer can be broadly used for intra-set, inter-set, and hierarchical-set mixing. We demonstrate that various channel-wise feature aggregation in numerous point sets is better than self-attention layers or dense token-wise interaction in a view of parameter efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments show the competitive or superior performance of PointMixer in semantic segmentation, classification, and reconstruction against Transformer-based methods."}}

To tackle this problem, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for category-level object pose estimation, called UDA-COPE. Inspired by recent multi-modal UDA techniques, the proposed method exploits a teacher-student self-supervised learning scheme to train a pose estimation network without using target domain pose labels. We also introduce a bidirectional filtering method between the predicted normalized object coordinate space (NOCS) map and observed point cloud, to not only make our teacher network more robust to the target domain but also to provide more reliable pseudo labels for the student network training. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, without leveraging target-domain GT labels, our proposed method achieved comparable or sometimes superior performance to existing methods that depend on the GT labels."}}

Unlike existing stereo matching methods that exclusively focus on the pixel-level correspondence between stereo images within a volumetric space (i.e., cost volume), we exploit this volumetric structure in a different manner. The cost volume explicitly encompasses 3D information along its disparity axis, therefore it is a privileged structure that can encapsulate the 3D contextual information from objects. However, it is not straightforward since the disparity values map the 3D metric space in a non-linear fashion. Thus, we present two novel strategies to handle 3D objectness in the cost volume space: selective sampling (RoISelect) and 2D-3D fusion (fusion-by-occupancy), which allow us to seamlessly incorporate 3D object-level information and achieve accurate depth performance near the object boundary regions. Our depth estimation achieves competitive performance in the KITTI dataset and the Virtual-KITTI 2.0 dataset."}}

However, due to their different modalities and structures, the method of aligning sensor data is the key for successful sensor fusion. To this end, we propose a geometry-aware stereo-LiDAR fusion network for long-range depth estimation, called volumetric propagation network. The key idea of our network is to exploit sparse and accurate point clouds as a cue for guiding correspondences of stereo images in a unified 3D volume space. Unlike existing fusion strategies, we directly embed point clouds into the volume, which enables us to propagate valid information into nearby voxels in the volume, and to reduce the uncertainty of correspondences. Thus, it allows us to fuse two different input modalities seamlessly and regress a long-range depth map. Our fusion is further enhanced by a newly proposed feature extraction layer for point clouds guided by images: FusionConv. FusionConv extracts point cloud features that consider both semantic (2D image domain) and geometric (3D domain) relations and aid fusion at the volume. Our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and Virtual-KITTI datasets among recent stereo-LiDAR fusion methods."}}

Recent studies concentrate on deep neural architectures for depth estimation by using conventional depth fusion method or direct 3D reconstruction network by regressing Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF). In this paper, we advocate that replicating the traditional two stages framework with deep neural networks improves both the interpretability and the accuracy of the results. As mentioned, our network operates in two steps: 1) the local computation of the local depth maps with a deep MVS technique, and, 2) the depth maps and images\u2019 features fusion to build a single TSDF volume. In order to improve the matching performance between images acquired from very different viewpoints (e.g., large-baseline and rotations), we introduce a rotation-invariant 3D convolution kernel called PosedConv. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is underlined via a large series of experiments conducted on the ScanNet dataset where our approach compares favorably against both traditional and deep learning techniques."}}
