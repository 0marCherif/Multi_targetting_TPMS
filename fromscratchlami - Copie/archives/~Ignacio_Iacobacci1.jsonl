Current approaches for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks use CL to improve in-distribution data performance often via heuristic-oriented or task-agnostic difficulties. In this work, instead, we employ CL for NLU by taking advantage of training dynamics as difficulty metrics, i.e., statistics that measure the behavior of the model at hand on specific task-data instances during training and propose modifications of existing CL schedulers based on these statistics. Differently from existing works, we focus on evaluating models on in-distribution (ID), out-of-distribution (OOD) as well as zero-shot (ZS) cross-lingual transfer datasets. We show across several NLU tasks that CL with training dynamics can result in better performance mostly on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer and OOD settings with improvements up by 8.5% in certain cases. Overall, experiments indicate that training dynamics can lead to better performing models with smoother training compared to other difficulty metrics while being 20% faster on average. In addition, through analysis we shed light on the correlations of task-specific versus task-agnostic metrics."}}

Motivated by the natural phenomenon of code-switching (CS) in multilingual speakers, CS has been used as an effective data augmentation method that offers language alignment at word- or phrase-level, in contrast to sentence-level via parallel instances. Existing approaches either use dictionaries or parallel sentences with word-alignment to generate CS data by randomly switching words in a sentence. However, such methods can be suboptimal as dictionaries disregard semantics, and syntax might become invalid after random word switching. In this work, we propose EntityCS, a method that focuses on Entity-level Code-Switching to capture fine-grained cross-lingual semantics without corrupting syntax. We use Wikidata and the English Wikipedia to construct an entity-centric CS corpus by switching entities to their counterparts in other languages. We further propose entity-oriented masking strategies during intermediate model training on the EntityCS corpus for improving entity prediction. Evaluation of the trained models on four entity-centric downstream tasks shows consistent improvements over the baseline with a notable increase of 10% in Fact Retrieval. We release the corpus and models to assist research on code-switching and enriching XLMs with external knowledge."}}

However, previous end-to-end approaches do not account for the fact that some generation sub-tasks, specifically aggregation and lexicalisation, can benefit from transfer learning in different extents. To exploit these varying potentials for transfer learning, we propose a new hierarchical approach for few-shot and zero-shot generation. Our approach consists of a three-moduled jointly trained architecture: the first module independently lexicalises the distinct units of information in the input as sentence sub-units (e.g. phrases), the second module recurrently aggregates these sub-units to generate a unified intermediate output, while the third module subsequently post-edits it to generate a coherent and fluent final text. We perform extensive empirical analysis and ablation studies on few-shot and zero-shot settings across 4 datasets. Automatic and human evaluation shows that the proposed hierarchical approach is consistently capable of achieving state-of-the-art results when compared to previous work."}}

One of the challenges of making neural dialogue systems available to more users is the lack of training data for all but a few languages. Zero-shot methods try to solve this issue by acquiring task knowledge in a high-resource language such as English with the aim of transferring it to the low-resource language(s). To this end, we introduce CrossAligner, the principal method of a variety of effective approaches for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer based on learning alignment from unlabelled parallel data. We present a quantitative analysis of individual methods as well as their weighted combinations, several of which exceed state-of-the-art (SOTA) scores as evaluated across nine languages, fifteen test sets and three benchmark multilingual datasets. A detailed qualitative error analysis of the best methods shows that our fine-tuned language models can zero-shot transfer the task knowledge better than anticipated."}}

Finally, we discuss PANGU-CODER-FT, which is fine-tuned on a combination of competitive programming problems and code with continuous integration tests. We evaluate PANGU-CODER with a focus on whether it generates functionally correct programs and demonstrate that it achieves equivalent or better performance than similarly sized models, such as CodeX [16], while attending a smaller context window and training on less data."}}

In addition to models being pretrained on large datasets, they can be further trained on intermediate (supervised) tasks that are similar to the target task. For small Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets, language modelling is typically followed by pretraining on a large (labelled) NLI dataset before fine-tuning with each NLI subtask. In this work, we explore Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) as an alternative to the commonly used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classification head. GBDTs have desirable properties such as good performance on dense, numerical features and are effective where the ratio of the number of samples w.r.t the number of features is low. We then introduce FreeGBDT, a method of fitting a GBDT head on the features computed during fine-tuning to increase performance without additional computation by the neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several NLI datasets using a strong baseline model (RoBERTa-large with MNLI pretraining). The FreeGBDT shows a consistent improvement over the MLP classification head."}}

We introduce XeroAlign, a simple method for task-specific alignment of cross-lingual pretrained transformers such as XLM-R. XeroAlign uses translated task data to encourage the model to generate similar sentence embeddings for different languages. The XeroAligned XLM-R, called XLM-RA, shows strong improvements over the baseline models to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot results on three multilingual natural language understanding tasks. XLM-RA's text classification accuracy exceeds that of XLM-R trained with labelled data and performs on par with state-of-the-art models on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrasing task."}}
