However, unsupervised representation learning on outdoor-scene point clouds remains challenging because previous methods need to reconstruct the whole scene and capture partial views for the contrastive objective.

In this paper, we propose CO3, namely {Co}operative {Co}ntrastive Learning and {Co}ntextual Shape Prediction, to learn 3D representation for outdoor-scene point clouds in an unsupervised manner. CO3 has several merits compared to existing methods. (1) It utilizes LiDAR point clouds from vehicle-side and infrastructure-side to build views that differ enough but meanwhile maintain common semantic information for contrastive learning, which are more appropriate than views built by previous methods. (2) Alongside the contrastive objective, we propose contextual shape prediction to bring more task-relevant information for unsupervised 3D point cloud representation learning and we also provide a theoretical analysis for this pre-training goal. (3) As compared to previous methods, representation learned by CO3 is able to be transferred to different outdoor scene dataset collected by different type of LiDAR sensors. (4) CO3 improves current state-of-the-art methods on Once, KITTI and NuScenes datasets by up to 2.58 mAP in 3D object detection task and 3.54 mIoU in LiDAR semantic segmentation task.

In visual control, learning transferable state representation that can transfer between different control tasks is important to reduce the training sample size. However, porting Transformer to sample-efficient visual control remains a challenging and unsolved problem. To this end, we propose a novel Control Transformer (CtrlFormer), possessing many appealing benefits that prior arts do not have. Firstly, CtrlFormer jointly learns self-attention mechanisms between visual tokens and policy tokens among different control tasks, where multitask representation can be learned and transferred without catastrophic forgetting. Secondly, we carefully design a contrastive reinforcement learning paradigm to train CtrlFormer, enabling it to achieve high sample efficiency, which is important in control problems. For example, in the DMControl benchmark, unlike recent advanced methods that failed by producing a zero score in the \"Cartpole\" task after transfer learning with 100k samples, CtrlFormer can achieve a state-of-the-art score with only 100k samples while maintaining the performance of previous tasks. The code and models are released in our project homepage."}}

However, radar data is sparse and noisy, resulting in challenges for radar mapping. On the other hand, the most popular available map currently is built by lidar. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for Radar Localization on Lidar Map (RaLL) to bridge the gap, which not only achieves the robust radar localization but also exploits the mature lidar mapping technique, thus reducing the cost of radar mapping. We first embed both sensor modals into a common feature space by a neural network. Then multiple offsets are added to the map modal for exhaustive similarity evaluation against the current radar modal, yielding the regression of the current pose. Finally, we apply this differentiable measurement model to a Kalman Filter (KF) to learn the whole sequential localization process in an end-to-end manner. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">The whole learning system is differentiable with the network based measurement model at the front-end</i> and KF at the back-end.

As compared to modern MLP architectures, e.g. , MLP-Mixer, ResMLP, and gMLP, whose architectures are correlated to image size and thus are infeasible in object detection and segmentation, CycleMLP has two advantages compared to modern approaches. (1) It can cope with various image sizes. (2) It achieves linear computational complexity to image size by using local windows. In contrast, previous MLPs have $O(N^2)$ computations due to fully spatial connections. We build a family of models which surpass existing MLPs and even state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, e.g. Swin Transformer, while using fewer parameters and FLOPs. We expand the MLP-like models\u2019 applicability, making them a versatile backbone for dense prediction tasks. CycleMLP achieves competitive results on object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. In particular, CycleMLP-Tiny outperforms Swin-Tiny by 1.3% mIoU on ADE20K dataset with fewer FLOPs. Moreover, CycleMLP also shows excellent zero-shot robustness on ImageNet-C dataset."}}

As face image contains abundant contextual information, we propose a method, RestoreFormer, which explores fully-spatial attentions to model contextual information and surpasses existing works that use local operators. RestoreFormer has several benefits compared to prior arts. First, unlike the conventional multi-head self-attention in previous Vision Transformers (ViTs), RestoreFormer incorporates a multi-head cross-attention layer to learn fully-spatial interactions between corrupted queries and high-quality key-value pairs. Second, the key-value pairs in ResotreFormer are sampled from a reconstruction-oriented high-quality dictionary, whose elements are rich in high-quality facial features specifically aimed for face reconstruction, leading to superior restoration results. Third, RestoreFormer outperforms advanced state-of-the-art methods on one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets, as well as produces images with better visual quality."}}
