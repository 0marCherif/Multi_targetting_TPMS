Current autoregressive model suffers from two major drawbacks. First, it is hard to  capture local geometric patterns as only one atom is generated at each step. Second, most of the autoregressive models generate atoms and chemical bonds in two separate processes, which causes a number of problems such as incorrect counts of rings, a bias distribution of bond lengths, and inaccurate 3D molecular structures. To tackle this problem, we designed a model, named FragDiff, to generate 3D molecules fragment-by-fragment for pockets. In each generation step, FragDiff places a molecular fragment around the pocket by using E(3)-equivariant diffusion generative models to simultaneously predict the atom types, atom coordinates and the chemical bonds of the fragment. Extensive experimental results confirm our assumption that unifying the atoms and bonds generations could significantly improve the quality of the sampled 3D molecules in terms of more accurate distributions of 2D subgraphs and 3D substructures."}}

Recently, the inclusion of 3D structures during targeted drug design shows superior performance to other target-free models as the atomic interaction in the 3D space is explicitly modeled. However, current 3D target-aware models either rely on the voxelized atom densities or the autoregressive sampling process, which are not equivariant to rotation or easily violate geometric constraints resulting in unrealistic structures. In this work, we develop a 3D equivariant diffusion model to solve the above challenges. To achieve target-aware molecule design, our method learns a joint generative process of both continuous atom coordinates and categorical atom types with a SE(3)-equivariant network. Moreover, we show that our model can serve as an unsupervised feature extractor to estimate the binding affinity under proper parameterization, which provides an effective way for drug screening. To evaluate our model, we propose a comprehensive framework to evaluate the quality of sampled molecules from different dimensions. Empirical studies show our model could generate molecules with more realistic 3D structures and better affinities towards the protein targets, and improve binding affinity ranking and prediction without retraining."}}

To learn meaningful representation from a protein structure for downstream tasks, not only the global backbone topology but the local fine-grained orientational relations between amino acids should also be considered. In this work, we propose the Orientation-Aware Graph Neural Networks (OAGNNs) to better sense the geometric characteristics in protein structure (e.g. inner-residue torsion angles, inter-residue orientations). Extending a single weight from a scalar to a 3D vector, we construct a rich set of geometric-meaningful operations to process both the classical and SO(3) representations of a given structure. To plug our designed perceptron unit into existing Graph Neural Networks, we further introduce an equivariant message passing paradigm, showing superior versatility in maintaining SO(3)-equivariance at the global scale. Experiments have shown that our OAGNNs have a remarkable ability to sense geometric orientational features compared to classical networks. OAGNNs have also achieved state-of-the-art performance on various computational biology applications related to protein 3D structures.\n\n"}}

We propose a neural energy minimization formulation that casts the prediction problem into an unrolled optimization process, where a neural network is parametrized to learn the gradient fields of an implicit conformational energy landscape. Assuming different forms of the underlying potential energy function, we can not only reinterpret and unify many of the existing models but also derive new variants of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in a principled manner. In our experiments, these new variants show superior performance in molecular conformation optimization comparing to existing SE(3)-equivariant neural networks. Moreover, our energy-inspired formulation is also suitable for molecular conformation generation, where we can generate more diverse and accurate conformers comparing to existing baselines."}}

Most previous methods struggle with generality, simplicity, and expressiveness \u2014 some are designed ad hoc for specific data types, some are too complex to be accessible, and some sacrifice flexible transformations. In this work, we propose a novel and simple framework to achieve equivariance for point cloud analysis based on the message passing (graph neural network) scheme. We find the equivariant property could be obtained by introducing an orientation for each point to decouple the relative position for each point from the global pose of the entire point cloud. Therefore, we extend current message passing networks with a module that learns orientations for each point. Before aggregating information from the neighbors of a point, the networks transforms the neighbors' coordinates based on the point's learned orientations. We provide formal proofs to show the equivariance of the proposed framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed method is competitive on both point cloud analysis and physical modeling tasks.
