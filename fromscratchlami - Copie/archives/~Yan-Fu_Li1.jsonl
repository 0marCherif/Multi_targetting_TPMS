The oversampling methods can tackle the class-imbalanced problem by generating the minority samples to balance the training set. However, one of the main challenges of the existing oversampling methods is how to generate high-quality minority samples. Traditional oversampling methods regard all synthetic samples as minority ones to be added to the training set without filtering. The low-quality synthetic samples would distort the distribution of the dataset and worsen the classification performance. In this article, we propose a weakly supervised oversampling method that treats all synthetic samples as unlabeled samples and develops a graph semisupervised learning algorithm to select high-quality synthetic samples, adding into the final training set as minority samples. To improve the quality of synthetic samples, we propose a cost-sensitive neighborhood component analysis dimensionality reduction method to enhance domain information validity in high-dimensional datasets. Finally, combining a boosting-based ensemble framework, we propose a new imbalanced learning framework suitable for high dimensionality and highly imbalanced fault diagnosis in industrial systems. The experimental validation is performed on five real-world wind turbine blade cracking failure datasets and compared to 15 benchmark methods. The experimental results show that average performances and robustness of the proposed framework are significantly better than those of the benchmark methods."}}

With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology and the rapid rise in demand for terminal logistics and distribution, ADVs have gradually entered commercial operation in many cities, thus it brings higher requirements to the reliability of ADVs. Because of bill of material (BOM) cost pressure, most autopilot sensors and domain controllers of ADVs are not strictly follow passenger vehicle standards and regulations, the ADVs' reliability is very critical. The traditional methods of process hazard analysis (PHA) e.g. HAZOPs, FMEAs, FT A, etc., use a system divide approach. The to be analyzed system is breaking down into component level, and the risks or hazard of each component are analyzed separately. The two important assumptions of the traditional methods are: 1. the system's properties are not changed when it is broken down into component level; 2. the accidents are caused by component failures. However, in an ADV, the system becomes complex since the system effects may be missed, and this assumption is questionable; further, an ADV accidents can happen even there is no component failure. The system level hazard analysis cannot be fully determined only at the component level, but out of interactions of systems. Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STP A) is a structured system level approach to analyze hazard. Based on the premise that accidents happen when the control is inadequate or lost, STPA approach decodes hazards related not only to component failures, but also to design errors, flawed controller requirements, interaction failures, human errors, and other errors. In this paper, the STPA method is used to analyze various risks and hazards of ADVs, and finally construct an abnormality monitoring system for autonomous driving sensors. Engineering practice shows that this method can effectively monitor the abnormality of sensor data links."}}
