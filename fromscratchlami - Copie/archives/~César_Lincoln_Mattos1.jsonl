Nonetheless, the standard GPLVM variational inference approach is tractable only for a narrow family of kernel functions. The most popular implementations of GPLVM circumvent this limitation using quadrature methods, which may become a computational bottleneck even for relatively low dimensions. For instance, the widely employed Gauss-Hermite quadrature has exponential complexity on the number of dimensions. In this work, we propose using the unscented transformation instead. Overall, this method presents comparable, if not better, performance than off-the-shelf solutions to GPLVM, and its computational complexity scales only linearly on dimension. In contrast to Monte Carlo methods, our approach is deterministic and works well with quasi-Newton methods, such as the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm. We illustrate the applicability of our method with experiments on dimensionality reduction and multistep-ahead prediction with uncertainty propagation."}}

Although previous articles have pointed out similar expressions between those learning approaches, we explicitly and formally state the existing correspondences. We empirically demonstrate our result by performing computational experiments with standard regression benchmarks. Our findings open a range of possibilities to improve LS-SVR by borrowing strength from well-established developments in Bayesian methodology."}}

A popular strategy adopted by practitioners to circumvent this consists of taking a preprocessing step to fill the missing components. These preprocessing algorithms are designed independently of the machine learning method that will be applied subsequently, which may lead to sub-optimal results. An alternative solution is to redesign classical machine learning methods to handle missing data directly. In this paper, we propose a variant of the forward stagewise regression (FSR) algorithm for incomplete data. The original FSR is an iterative procedure to estimate parameters of sparse linear models. The proposed method, named forward stagewise regression for incomplete datasets with GMM (FSIG), models the missing components as random variables following a Gaussian mixture distribution. In FSIG, the main steps of FSR are adapted to dea\u00e7 with the intrinsic uncertainty of incomplete samples. The performance of FSIG was evaluated in an extensive set of experiments, and our model was able to outperform classical methods in most of the tested cases."}}
