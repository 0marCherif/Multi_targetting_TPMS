This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to extract defining characteristics of earthquake ground-motion spectra, also called latent features, to aid in ground-motion selection (GMS). In this context, a latent feature is a low-dimensional machine-discovered spectral characteristic learned through nonlinear relationships of a neural network autoencoder. Machine discovered latent features can be combined with traditionally defined intensity measures and clustering can be performed to select a representative subgroup from a large ground-motion suite. The objective of efficient GMS is to choose characteristic records representative of what the structure will probabilistically experience in its lifetime. Three examples are presented to validate this approach, including the use of synthetic and field recorded ground-motion datasets. The presented deep embedding clustering of ground-motion spectra has three main advantages: 1. defining characteristics the represent the sparse spectral content of ground-motions are discovered efficiently through training of the autoencoder, 2. domain knowledge is incorporated into the machine learning framework with conditional variables in the deep embedding scheme, and 3. method exhibits excellent performance when compared to a benchmark seismic hazard analysis."}}

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in leveraging deep learning to augment scientific data based on the coarse-grained simulations, which is of cheap computational expense and retains satisfactory solution accuracy. However, the major existing work focuses on data-driven approaches which rely on rich training datasets and lack sufficient physical constraints. To this end, we propose a novel and efficient spatiotemporal super-resolution framework via physics-informed learning, inspired by the independence between temporal and spatial derivatives in partial differential equations (PDEs). The general principle is to leverage the temporal interpolation for flow estimation, and then introduce convolutional-recurrent neural networks for learning temporal refinement. Furthermore, we employ the stacked residual blocks with wide activation and sub-pixel layers with pixelshuffle for spatial reconstruction, where feature extraction is conducted in a low-resolution latent space. Moreover, we consider hard imposition of boundary conditions in the network to improve reconstruction accuracy. Results demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method compared with baseline algorithms through extensive numerical experiments."}}

However, very limited studies have been conducted on seismic wave modeling tasks. A critical challenge is that these geophysical problems are typically defined in large domains (i.e., semi-infinite), which leads to high computational cost. In this paper, we present a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) model for seismic wave modeling in semi-infinite domain without the nedd of labeled data. In specific, the absorbing boundary condition is introduced into the network as a soft regularizer for handling truncated boundaries. In terms of computational efficiency, we consider a sequential training strategy via temporal domain decomposition to improve the scalability of the network and solution accuracy. Moreover, we design a novel surrogate modeling strategy for parametric loading, which estimates the wave propagation in semin-infinite domain given the seismic loading at different locations. Various numerical experiments have been implemented to evaluate the performance of the proposed PINN model in the context of forward modeling of seismic wave propagation. In particular, we define diverse material distributions to test the versatility of this approach. The results demonstrate excellent solution accuracy under distinctive scenarios."}}

Recent advances in deep learning have shown the great potential of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve PDEs as a basis for data-driven modeling and inverse analysis. However, the majority of existing PINN methods, based on fully-connected NNs, pose intrinsic limitations to low-dimensional spatiotemporal parameterizations. Moreover, since the initial/boundary conditions (I/BCs) are softly imposed via penalty, the solution quality heavily relies on hyperparameter tuning. To this end, we propose the novel physics-informed convolutional-recurrent learning architectures (PhyCRNet and PhyCRNet-s) for solving PDEs without any labeled data. Specifically, an encoder-decoder convolutional long short-term memory network is proposed for low-dimensional spatial feature extraction and temporal evolution learning. The loss function is defined as the aggregated discretized PDE residuals, while the I/BCs are hard-encoded in the network to ensure forcible satisfaction (e.g., periodic boundary padding). The networks are further enhanced by autoregressive and residual connections that explicitly simulate time marching. The performance of our proposed methods has been assessed by solving three nonlinear PDEs (e.g., 2D Burgers' equations, the $\\lambda$-$\\omega$ and FitzHugh Nagumo reaction-diffusion equations), and compared against the start-of-the-art baseline algorithms. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodology in the context of solution accuracy, extrapolability and generalizability."}}

To address this fundamental issue, this paper presents an incremental Bayesian tensor learning method for reconstruction of spatiotemporal missing data in SHM and forecasting of structural response. In particular, a spatiotemporal tensor is first constructed followed by Bayesian tensor factorization that extracts latent features for missing data imputation. To enable structural response forecasting based on incomplete sensing data, the tensor decomposition is further integrated with vector autoregression in an incremental learning scheme. The performance of the proposed approach is validated on continuous field-sensing data (including strain and temperature records) of a concrete bridge, based on the assumption that strain time histories are highly correlated to temperature recordings. The results indicate that the proposed probabilistic tensor learning approach is accurate and robust even in the presence of large rates of random missing, structured missing and their combination. The effect of rank selection on the imputation and prediction performance is also investigated. The results show that a better estimation accuracy can be achieved with a higher rank for random missing whereas a lower rank for structured missing."}}
