While recent improvements to SGD mainly focus on the descent algorithm itself, few works pay attention to utilizing the historical solutions---as an iterative method, SGD has gone through substantial explorations before convergence. Recently, an interesting attempt is stochastic weight averaging (SWA), which significantly improves the generalization by simply averaging the solutions at the tail stage of training. In this paper, we realize that the averaging coefficients could be determined in a trainable manner and propose Trainable Weight Averaging (TWA), a novel optimization method in the reduced subspace spanned by historical solutions. TWA has much greater flexibility and can be applied to the head stage of training to achieve training efficiency while preserving good generalization capability. Further, we propose a distributed training scheme to resolve the memory burden of large-scale training with efficient parallel computation. In the extensive numerical experiments, (i) TWA achieves consistent improvements over SWA with less sensitivity to learning rate; (ii) applying TWA in the head stage of training largely speeds up the convergence, resulting in over $40\\%$ time saving on CIFAR and $30\\%$ on ImageNet with improved generalization compared with regular training."}}

Nonetheless, we note that if the loss trend of the outputs is slightly perturbed, SQAs could be easily misled and thereby become much less effective. Following this idea, we propose a novel defense, namely Adversarial Attack on Attackers (AAA), to confound SQAs towards incorrect attack directions by slightly modifying the output logits. In this way, (1) SQAs are prevented regardless of the model's worst-case robustness; (2) the original model predictions are hardly changed, i.e., no degradation on clean accuracy; (3) the calibration of confidence scores can be improved simultaneously. Extensive experiments are provided to verify the above advantages. For example, by setting $\\ell_\\infty=8/255$ on CIFAR-10, our proposed AAA helps WideResNet-28 secure 80.59% accuracy under Square attack (2500 queries), while the best prior defense (i.e., adversarial training) only attains 67.44%. Since AAA attacks SQA's general greedy strategy, such advantages of AAA over 8 defenses can be consistently observed on 8 CIFAR-10/ImageNet models under 6 SQAs, using different attack targets, bounds, norms, losses, and strategies. Moreover, AAA calibrates better without hurting the accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/AAA."}}
