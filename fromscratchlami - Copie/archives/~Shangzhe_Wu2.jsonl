Existing methods rely on explicit supervision to establish multi-view correspondences, such as template shape models and keypoint annotations, which restricts their applicability on objects \u201cin the wild\u201d. A more natural way of establishing correspondences is by watching videos of objects moving around. In this paper, we present DOVE, a method that learns textured 3D models of deformable object categories from monocular videos available online, without keypoint, viewpoint or template shape supervision. By resolving symmetry-induced pose ambiguities and leveraging temporal correspondences in videos, the model automatically learns to factor out 3D shape, articulated pose and texture from each individual RGB frame, and is ready for single-image inference at test time. In the experiments, we show that existing methods fail to learn sensible 3D shapes without additional keypoint or template supervision, whereas our method produces temporally consistent 3D models, which can be animated and rendered from arbitrary viewpoints.

The method is based on an autoencoder that factors each input image into depth, albedo, viewpoint and illumination. In order to disentangle these components without supervision, we use the fact that many object categories have, at least approximately, a symmetric structure. We show that reasoning about illumination allows us to exploit the underlying object symmetry even if the appearance is not symmetric due to shading. Furthermore, we model objects that are probably, but not certainly, symmetric by predicting a symmetry probability map, learned end-to-end with the other components of the model. Our experiments show that this method can recover very accurately the 3D shape of human faces, cat faces and cars from single-view images, without any supervision or a prior shape model. On benchmarks, we demonstrate superior accuracy compared to another method that uses supervision at the level of 2D image correspondences."}}

Recent advances in inverse rendering have enabled a wide range of real-world applications in 3D content generation, moving rapidly from research and commercial use cases to consumer devices. While the results continue to improve, there is no real-world benchmark that can quantitatively assess and compare the performance of various inverse rendering methods. Existing real-world datasets typically only consist of the shape and multi-view images of objects, which are not sufficient for evaluating the quality of material recovery and object relighting. Methods capable of recovering material and lighting often resort to synthetic data for quantitative evaluation, which on the other hand does not guarantee generalization to complex real-world environments. We introduce a new dataset of real-world objects captured under a variety of natural scenes with ground-truth 3D scans, multi-view images, and environment lighting. Using this dataset, we establish the first comprehensive real-world evaluation benchmark for object inverse rendering tasks from in-the-wild scenes, and compare the performance of various existing methods."}}

While different concept axes can be easily specified by language, e.g. color, the exact visual nuances along each axis often exceed the limitations of linguistic articulations, e.g. a particular style of painting. In this work, our goal is to learn a language-informed visual concept representation, by simply distilling large pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, we train a set of concept encoders to encode the information pertinent to a set of language-informed concept axes, with an objective of reproducing the input image through a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model. To encourage better disentanglement of different concept encoders, we anchor the concept embeddings to a set of text embeddings obtained from a pre-trained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. At inference time, the model extracts concept embeddings along various axes from new test images, which can be remixed to generate images with novel compositions of visual concepts. With a lightweight test-time finetuning procedure, it can also generalize to novel concepts unseen at training."}}

Recent approaches can learn, given a collection of single-view images of an object category, a monocular network to predict the 3D shape, albedo, illumination and viewpoint of any object occurrence. We propose a framework using an image generator like Stable Diffusion to generate virtual training data for learning such a reconstruction network from scratch. Furthermore, we include the diffusion model as a score to further improve learning. The idea is to randomise some aspects of the reconstruction, such as viewpoint and illumination, generating synthetic views of the reconstructed 3D object, and have the 2D network assess the quality of the resulting image, providing feedback to the reconstructor. Different from work based on distillation which produces a single 3D asset for each textual prompt in hours, our approach produces a monocular reconstruction network that can output a controllable 3D asset from a given image, real or generated, in only seconds. Our network can be used for analysis, including monocular reconstruction, or for synthesis, generating articulated assets for real-time applications such as video games."}}

At its core is an implicit-explicit representation of articulated shape and appearance, combining the strengths of neural fields and meshes. In order to help the model understand an object's shape and pose, we distil the knowledge captured by an off-the-shelf self-supervised vision transformer and fuse it into the 3D model. To overcome local optima in viewpoint estimation, we further introduce a new viewpoint sampling scheme that comes at no additional training cost. MagicPony outperforms prior work on this challenging task and demonstrates excellent generalisation in reconstructing art, despite the fact that it is only trained on real images."}}

Large-scale deployment of XR devices and applications means that we cannot solely rely on supervised learning, as collecting and annotating data for the unlimited variety of objects in the real world is infeasible. We present a weakly supervised method that is able to decompose a single image of an object into shape (depth and normals), material (albedo, reflectivity and shininess) and global lighting parameters. For training, the method only relies on a rough initial shape estimate of the training objects to bootstrap the learning process. This shape supervision can come for example from a pretrained depth network or-more generically-from a traditional structure-from-motion pipeline. In our experiments, we show that the method can successfully de-render 2D images into a decomposed 3D representation and generalizes to unseen object categories. Since in-the-wild evaluation is difficult due to the lack of ground truth data, we also introduce a photo-realistic synthetic test set that allows for quantitative evaluation.
