In this paper, we utilize simple strategies to annotate entity spans in generations and compare established and novel methods of paraphrasing in NLP such as back translation, specialized encoder decoder models such as Pegasus, and GPT-3 variants for their effectiveness in improving downstream performance for NER across different levels of gold annotations and paraphrasing strength on 5 datasets. We also analyze the quality of generated paraphrases based on their entity preservation and paraphrasing language quality. We find that the choice of the paraphraser greatly impacts NER performance, with one of the larger GPT-3 variants exceedingly capable at generating high quality paraphrases, improving performance in most cases, and not hurting others, while other paraphrasers show more mixed results. We also find inline auto annotations generated by larger GPT-3 to be strictly better than heuristic based annotations. We find diminishing benefits of paraphrasing as gold annotations increase for most datasets. While larger GPT-3 variants perform well by both entity preservation and human evaluation of language quality, those two metrics do not necessarily correlate with downstream performance for other paraphrasers."}}

Many researchers, especially those working in core NLP/Speech domains, rely on a combination of individual expertise, experiences or ad hoc surveys for prioritizing between language technologies that provide social good to the end-users. This has been criticized by several scholars who argue that it is critical to include the target community during the LT\u2019s design and development process. However, prioritization of communities, languages, technologies and design approaches presents a very large set of complex challenges to the technologists, for which there are no simple or off-the-shelf solutions. In this position paper, we distill our experiential insights into six fundamental conundrums that technologists face and must resolve while deciding which LT technology to build for which community, and by using what approach. We discuss that at the root of these conundrums lie certain fundamental ethical problems of a digital-divide that can be overcome only by resolving deeper ethical dilemmas of distributive justice. We urge the community to reflect on these conundrums and leverage shared experiential insights to reconcile the intent of broadly, any Technology for Social Good, with the ground realities of its deployment."}}

Researchers have mostly relied on their individual expertise, experiences or ad hoc surveys for prioritization of language technologies that provide social good to the end-users. This has been criticized by several scholars who argue that work on LT4SG must include the target linguistic communities during the design and development process. However, none of the LT4SG work and their critiques suggest principled techniques for prioritization of the technologies and methods for inclusion of the end-user during the development cycle. Drawing inspiration from the fields of Economics, Ethics, Psychology, and Participatory Design, here we chart out a set of methodologies for prioritizing LT4SG that are aligned with the end-user preferences. We then analyze several LT4SG efforts in light of the proposed methodologies and bring out their hidden assumptions and potential pitfalls. While the current study is limited to language technologies, we believe that the principles and prioritization techniques highlighted here are applicable more broadly to AI for Social Good."}}
