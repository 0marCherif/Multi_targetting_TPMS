Existing works build parametric models for diffuse and specular albedo using Light Stage data. However, only diffuse and specular albedo cannot determine the full BRDF. In addition, the requirement of Light Stage data is hard to fulfill for the research communities. This paper proposes the first 3D morphable face reflectance model with spatially varying BRDF using only low-cost publicly-available data. We apply linear shiness weighting into parametric modeling to represent spatially varying specular intensity and shiness. Then an inverse rendering algorithm is developed to reconstruct the reflectance parameters from non-Light Stage data, which are used to train an initial morphable reflectance model. To enhance the model's generalization capability and expressive power, we further propose an update-by-reconstruction strategy to finetune it on an in-the-wild dataset. Experimental results show that our method obtains decent rendering results with plausible facial specularities. Our code is released here."}}

Existing methods have shown promising results leveraging monocular depth estimation and color inpainting with layered depth representations. However, these methods still have limited capability to handle scenes with complex 3D geometry. We propose a new method based on the multiplane image (MPI) representation. To accommodate diverse scene layouts in the wild and tackle the difficulty in producing high-dimensional MPI contents, we design a network structure that consists of two novel modules, one for plane depth adjustment and another for depth-aware color prediction. The former adjusts the initial plane positions using the RGBD context feature and an attention mechanism. Given adjusted depth values, the latter predicts the color and density for each plane separately with proper inter-plane interactions achieved via a feature masking strategy. To train our method, we construct large-scale stereo training data using only unconstrained single-view image collections by a simple yet effective warp-back strategy. The experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our trained model works remarkably well and achieves state-of-the-art results."}}

However, existing methods may suffer poor attribute variation disentanglement, leading to unwanted change of other attributes when altering the desired one. The semantic directions used by existing methods are at attribute level, which are difficult to model complex attribute correlations, especially in the presence of attribute distribution bias in GAN's training set. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (IALS) that performs Instance-Aware Latent-Space Search to find semantic directions for disentangled attribute editing. The instance information is injected by leveraging the supervision from a set of attribute classifiers evaluated on the input images. We further propose a Disentanglement-Transformation (DT) metric to quantify the attribute transformation and disentanglement efficacy and find the optimal control factor between attribute-level and instance-specific directions based on it. Experimental results on both GAN-generated and real-world images collectively show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods proposed recently by a wide margin.
