Most efforts are devoted to advancing optimization objectives that regularize models to capture the underlying invariance; however, there often are compromises in the optimization process of these OOD objectives: i) Many OOD objectives have to be relaxed as penalty terms of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for the ease of optimization, while the relaxed forms can weaken the robustness of the original objective; ii) The penalty terms also require careful tuning of the penalty weights due to the intrinsic conflicts between ERM and OOD objectives. Consequently, these compromises could easily lead to suboptimal performance of either the ERM or OOD objective. To address these issues, we introduce a multi-objective optimization (MOO) perspective to understand the OOD optimization process, and propose a new optimization scheme called PAreto Invariant Risk Minimization (PAIR). PAIR improves the robustness of OOD objectives by cooperatively optimizing with other OOD objectives, thereby bridging the gaps caused by the relaxations. Then PAIR approaches a Pareto optimal solution that trades off the ERM and OOD objectives properly. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, WILDS, show that PAIR alleviates the compromises and yields top OOD performances."}}

Advanced works have already shown great potential for sharing client information to mitigate data heterogeneity. Yet, some literature shows a dilemma in preserving strong privacy and promoting model performance simultaneously. Revisiting the purpose of sharing information motivates us to raise the fundamental questions: Which part of the data is more critical for model generalization? Which part of the data is more privacy-sensitive? Can we solve this dilemma by sharing useful (for generalization) features and maintaining more sensitive data locally? Our work sheds light on data-dominated sharing and training, in a way that we decouple original training data into sensitive features and generalizable features. To be specific, we propose a \\textbf{Fed}erated \\textbf{P}rivacy \\textbf{D}istillation framework named FedPD to alleviate the privacy-performance dilemma. Namely, FedPD keeps the distilled sensitive features locally and constructs a global dataset using shared generalizable features in a differentially private manner. Accordingly, clients can perform local training on both the local and securely shared data for acquiring high model performance and avoiding the leakage of not distilled privacy. Theoretically, we demonstrate the superiority of the sharing-only useful feature strategy over sharing raw data. Empirically, we show the efficacy of FedPD in promoting performance with comprehensive experiments."}}

Recent studies show that the gradient dissimilarity between clients induced by the data distribution discrepancy causes the client drift. Thus, existing methods mainly focus on correcting the gradients. However, it is challenging to identify which client should (or not) be corrected. This challenge raises a series of questions: will the local training, without gradient correction, contribute to the server model's generalization of other clients' distributions? when the generalization contribution holds? how to address the challenge when it fails? To answer these questions, we analyze the generalization contribution of local training and conclude that the generalization contribution of local training is bounded by the conditional Wasserstein distance between clients' distributions. Thus, the key to promote generalization contribution is to leverage similar conditional distributions for local training. As collecting data distribution can cause privacy leakage, we propose decoupling the deep models, i.e., splitting into high-level models and low-level models, for harnessing client drift. Namely, high-level models are trained on shared feature distributions, causing promoted generalization contribution and alleviated gradient dissimilarity. Experimental results demonstrate that FL with decoupled gradient dissimilarity is robust to data heterogeneity."}}

To bridge this gap, we propose a new framework to capture the invariance of graphs for guaranteed OOD generalization under various distribution shifts. Specifically, we characterize potential distribution shifts on graphs with causal models, concluding that OOD generalization on graphs is achievable when models focus only on subgraphs containing the most information about the causes of labels. Accordingly, we propose an information-theoretic objective to extract the desired subgraphs that maximally preserve the invariant intra-class information. Learning with these subgraphs is immune to distribution shifts.

However, previous works state that black-box attacks fail to mislead target models when their training data and outputs are inaccessible. In this work, we argue that black-box attacks can pose practical attacks in this extremely restrictive scenario where only several test samples are available.  Specifically, we find that attacking the shallow layers of DNNs trained on a few test samples can generate powerful adversarial examples. As only a few samples are required, we refer to these attacks as lightweight black-box attacks. The main challenge to promoting lightweight attacks is to mitigate the adverse impact caused by the approximation error of shallow layers. As it is hard to mitigate the approximation error with few available samples, we propose Error TransFormer (ETF) for lightweight attacks. Namely, ETF transforms the approximation error in the parameter space into a perturbation in the feature space and alleviates the error by disturbing features. In experiments, lightweight black-box attacks with the proposed ETF achieve surprising results. For example, even if only 1 sample per category available, the attack success rate in lightweight black-box attacks is only about 3% lower than that of the black-box attacks with complete training data.

As causal reasoning has an instinct for modeling distribution change, it is essential to incorporate causality into analyzing this specific type of distribution change induced by adversarial attacks. However, causal formulations of the intuition of adversarial attacks and the development of robust DNNs are still lacking in the literature. To bridge this gap, we construct a causal graph to model the generation process of adversarial examples and define the adversarial distribution to formalize the intuition of adversarial attacks. From the causal perspective, we study the distinction between the natural and adversarial distribution and conclude that the origin of adversarial vulnerability is the focus of models on spurious correlations. Inspired by the causal understanding, we propose the \\emph{Causal}-inspired \\emph{Adv}ersarial distribution alignment method, CausalAdv, to eliminate the difference between natural and adversarial distributions by considering spurious correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. Our work is the first attempt towards using causality to understand and mitigate the adversarial vulnerability."}}

Our method not only learns low-bias prompts from a few samples but also captures the distribution of diverse prompts to handle the varying visual representations. In this way, we provide high-quality task-related content for facilitating recognition. This prompt distribution learning is realized by an efficient approach that learns the output embeddings of prompts instead of the input embeddings. Thus, we can employ a Gaussian distribution to model them effectively and derive a surrogate loss for efficient training. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that our method consistently and significantly outperforms existing methods. For example, with 1 sample per category, it relatively improves the average result by 9.1% compared to human-crafted prompts."}}
