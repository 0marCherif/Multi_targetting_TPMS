We observe that the global temporal features are less generalizable, due to the temporal domain shift that videos from other unseen domains may have an unexpected absence or misalignment of the temporal relations. This finding has motivated us to solve video domain generalization by effectively learning the local-relation features of different timescales that are more generalizable, and exploiting them along with the global-relation features to maintain the discriminability. This paper presents the VideoDG framework with two technical contributions. The first is a new deep architecture named the Adversarial Pyramid Network, which improves the generalizability of video features by capturing the local-relation, global-relation, and cross-relation features progressively. On the basis of pyramid features, the second contribution is a new and robust approach of adversarial data augmentation that can bridge different video domains by improving the diversity and quality of augmented data. We construct three video domain generalization benchmarks in which domains are divided according to different datasets, different consequences of actions, or different camera views, respectively. VideoDG consistently outperforms the combinations of previous video classification models and existing domain generalization methods on all benchmarks."}}

We name this phenomenon \\textit{spatiotemporal mode collapse} and explore it for the first time in predictive learning. The key is to provide the model with a strong inductive bias to discover the compositional structures of latent modes. To this end, we propose ModeRNN, which introduces a novel method to learn structured hidden representations between recurrent states. The core idea of this framework is to first extract various components of visual dynamics using a set of \\textit{spatiotemporal slots} with independent parameters. Considering that multiple space-time patterns may co-exist in a sequence, we leverage learnable importance weights to adaptively aggregate slot features into a unified hidden representation, which is then used to update the recurrent states. Across the entire dataset, different modes result in different responses on the mixtures of slots, which enhances the ability of ModeRNN to build structured representations and thus prevents the so-called mode collapse. Unlike existing models, ModeRNN is shown to prevent spatiotemporal mode collapse and further benefit from learning mixed visual dynamics. "}}

We evaluate these models under a cross-dataset experiment setting, as the above label bias problem in video analysis is even more prominent across different data sources. We find that using the optical flows as model inputs harms the generalization ability of most video recognition models.\nBased on these findings, we present a multi-task learning paradigm for video classification. Our key idea is to avoid label bias and improve the generalization ability by taking data as its own supervision or supervising constraints on the data. First, we take the optical flows and the RGB frames by taking them as auxiliary supervisions, and thus naming our model as Reversed Two-Stream Networks (Rev2Net). Further, we collaborate the auxiliary flow prediction task and the frame reconstruction task by introducing a new training objective to Rev2Net, named Decoding Discrepancy Penalty (DDP), which constraints the discrepancy of the multi-task features in a self-supervised manner. Rev2Net is shown to be effective on the classic action recognition task. It specifically shows a strong generalization ability in the cross-dataset experiments."}}

Prior methods mainly capture the temporal state transitions but overlook the complex spatiotemporal variations of the motion itself, making them difficult to adapt to ever-changing motions. We observe that physical world motions can be decomposed into transient variation and motion trend, while the latter can be regarded as the accumulation of previous motions. Thus, simultaneously capturing the transient variation and the motion trend is the key to make spacetime-varying motions more predictable. Based on these observations, we propose the MotionRNN framework, which can capture the complex variations within motions and adapt to spacetime-varying scenarios. MotionRNN has two main contributions. The first is that we design the MotionGRU unit, which can model the transient variation and motion trend in a unified way.

Unlike most existing transfer learning methods that focus on fixing the discrepancy between supervised tasks, we study how to transfer knowledge from a zoo of unsupervisedly learned models towards another predictive network. Our motivation is that models from different sources are expected to understand the complex spatiotemporal dynamics from different perspectives, thereby effectively supplementing the new task, even if the task has sufficient training samples. Technically, we propose a differentiable framework named transferable memory. It adaptively distills knowledge from a bank of memory states of multiple pretrained RNNs, and applies it to the target network via a novel recurrent structure called the Transferable Memory Unit (TMU). Compared with finetuning, our approach yields significant improvements on three benchmarks for spatiotemporal prediction, and benefits the target task even from less relevant pretext ones."}}
