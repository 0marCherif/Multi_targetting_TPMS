To this end, we propose an All-in-one Image Restoration Network (AirNet) consisting of two neural modules, named Contrastive-Based Degraded Encoder (CBDE) and Degradation-Guided Restoration Network (DGRN). The major advantages of AirNet are two-fold. First, it is an all-in-one solution which could recover various degraded images in one network. Second, AirNet is free from the prior of the corruption types and levels, which just uses the observed corrupted image to perform inference. These two advantages enable AirNet to enjoy better flexibility and higher economy in real world scenarios wherein the priors on the corruptions are hard to know and the degradation will change with space and time. Extensive experimental results show the proposed method outperforms 17 image restoration baselines on four challenging datasets.

An unsupervised model will avoid the intensive labor of collecting hazy-clean image pairs, and an untrained model is a \u201creal\u201d single image dehazing approach which could remove haze based on the observed hazy image only and no extra images are used. Motivated by the layer disentanglement, we propose a novel method, called you only look yourself (YOLY) which could be one of the first unsupervised and untrained neural networks for image dehazing. In brief, YOLY employs three joint subnetworks to separate the observed hazy image into several latent layers, i.e., scene radiance layer, transmission map layer, and atmospheric light layer. After that, three layers are further composed to the hazy image in a self-supervised manner. Thanks to the unsupervised and untrained characteristics of YOLY, our method bypasses the conventional training paradigm of deep models on hazy-clean pairs or a large scale dataset, thus avoids the labor-intensive data collection and the domain shift issue. Besides, our method also provides an effective learning-based haze transfer solution thanks to its layer disentanglement mechanism. Extensive experiments show the promising performance of our method in image dehazing compared with 14 methods on six databases. The code could be accessed at www.pengxi.me ."}}

To this end, we propose a novel objective that incorporates representation learning and data recovery into a unified framework from the view of information theory. To be specific, the informative and consistent representation is learned by maximizing the mutual information across different views through contrastive learning, and the missing views are recovered by minimizing the conditional entropy of different views through dual prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this could be the first work to provide a theoretical framework that unifies the consistent representation learning and cross-view data recovery. Extensive experimental results show the proposed method remarkably outperforms 10 competitive multi-view clustering methods on four challenging datasets.

Different from the existing labor-intensive handcrafted architecture design paradigms, we present a novel method, termed as multi-sCaLe nEural ARchitecture sEarch for image Restoration (CLEARER), which is a speci\ufb01cally designed neural architecture search (NAS) for image restoration. Our contributions are twofold. On one hand, we design a multi-scale search space that consists of three task-\ufb02exible modules. Namely, 1) Parallel module that connects multi-resolution neural blocks in parallel, while preserving the channels and spatial-resolution in each neural block, 2) Transition module remains the existing multi-resolution features while extending them to a lower resolution, 3) Fusion module integrates multi-resolution features by passing the features of the parallel neural blocks to the current neural blocks. On the other hand, we present novel losses which could 1) balance the tradeoff between the model complexity and performance, which is highly expected to image restoration; and 2) relax the discrete architecture parameters into a continuous distribution which approximates to either 0 or 1. As a result, a differentiable strategy could be employed to search when to fuse or extract multi-resolution features, while the discretization issue faced by the gradient-based NAS could be alleviated. The proposed CLEARER could search a promising architecture in two GPU hours. Extensive experiments show the promising performance of our method comparing with nine image denoising methods and eight image deraining approaches in quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

To the ends, we propose a novel method based on the idea of layer disentanglement by viewing a hazy image as the entanglement of several \u201csimpler\u201d layers, i.e., a hazy-free image layer, transmission map layer, and atmospheric light layer. The major advantages of the proposed ZID are two-fold. First, it is an unsupervised method that does not use any clean images including hazy-clean pairs as the ground-truth. Second, ZID is a \u201czero-shot\u201d method, which just uses the observed single hazy image to perform learning and inference. In other words, it does not follow the conventional paradigm of training deep model on a large scale dataset. These two advantages enable our method to avoid the labor-intensive data collection and the domain shift issue of using the synthetic hazy images to address the real-world images. Extensive comparisons show the promising performance of our method compared with 15 approaches in the qualitative and quantitive evaluations.
