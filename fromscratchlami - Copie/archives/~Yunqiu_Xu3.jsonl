However, little effort has been expended to design agents that pursue objectives while behaving morally, which is a critical issue in the field of autonomous agents. In this paper, we propose a general framework named Moral Awareness Adaptive Learning (MorAL) that enhances the morality capacity of an agent using a plugin moral-aware learning model. The framework allows the agent to execute task learning and morality learning adaptively. The agent selects trajectories from past experiences during task learning. Meanwhile, the trajectories are used to conduct self-imitation learning with a moral-enhanced objective. In order to achieve the trade-off between morality and task progress, the agent uses the combination of task policy and moral policy for action selection. We evaluate on the Jiminy Cricket benchmark, a set of text-based games with various scenes and dense morality annotations. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared with strong contemporary value alignment approaches,  the proposed framework improves task performance while reducing immoral behaviours in various games."}}

The objective of a reinforcement learning agent is to behave so as to maximise the sum of a suitable scalar reward function. In contrast to current RL methods, humans are able to learn new skills with little or no reward by using various forms of intrinsic motivation. We propose a goal randomization method that uses random basic goals to train a policy in the absence of the reward of environments. Specifically, through simple but effective goal generation, our method learns to continuously propose challenging -- yet temporal and achievable -- goals that allow the agent to learn general skills for acting in a new environment, independent of the task to be solved. In a variety of text-based games, we show that this simple method results in competitive performance for agents. We also show that our method can learn policies that generalize across different text-based games. In further, we demonstrate an interesting result that our method works better than one of state-of-the-art agents GATA, which uses environment rewards for some text-based games."}}
