Existing LA methods mostly focus on the design of pos weighting function, while the neg weight is directly derived from the pos weight. Such a mechanism limits the learning capacity of detectors. In this paper, we explore a new weighting paradigm, termed dual weighting (DW), to specify pos and neg weights separately. We first identify the key influential factors of pos/neg weights by analyzing the evaluation metrics in object detection, and then design the pos and neg weighting functions based on them. Specifically, the pos weight of a sample is determined by the consistency degree between its classification and localization scores, while the neg weight is decomposed into two terms: the probability that it is a neg sample and its importance conditioned on being a neg sample. Such a weighting strategy offers greater flexibility to distinguish between important and less important samples, resulting in a more effective object detector. Equipped with the proposed DW method, a single FCOS-ResNet-50 detector can reach 41.5% mAP on COCO under 1\u00d7 schedule, outperforming other existing LA methods. It consistently improves the baselines on COCO by a large margin under various backbones without bells and whistles. Code is available at https://github.com/strongwolf/DW."}}

One popular solution to this challenging task is self-training, which selects high-scoring predictions on target samples as pseudo labels for training. However, the produced pseudo labels often contain much noise because the model is biased to source domain as well as majority categories. To address the above issues, we propose to di-rectly explore the intrinsic pixel distributions of target do-main data, instead of heavily relying on the source domain. Specifically, we simultaneously cluster pixels and rectify pseudo labels with the obtained cluster assignments. This process is done in an online fashion so that pseudo labels could co-evolve with the segmentation model without extra training rounds. To overcome the class imbalance problem on long-tailed categories, we employ a distribution align-ment technique to enforce the marginal class distribution of cluster assignments to be close to that of pseudo labels. The proposed method, namely Class-balanced Pixel-level Self-Labeling (CPSL), improves the segmentation performance on target domain over state-of-the-arts by a large margin, especially on long-tailed categories.

However, it is cumbersome to compute the self-attention on large-scale point cloud data because point cloud is a long sequence and unevenly distributed in 3D space. To solve this issue, existing methods usually compute self-attention locally by grouping the points into clusters of the same size, or perform convolutional self-attention on a discretized representation. However, the former results in stochastic point dropout, while the latter typically has narrow attention fields. In this paper, we propose a novel voxel-based architecture, namely Voxel Set Transformer (VoxSeT), to detect 3D objects from point clouds by means of set-to-set translation. VoxSeT is built upon a voxel-based set attention (VSA) module, which reduces the self-attention in each voxel by two cross-attentions and models features in a hidden space induced by a group of latent codes. With the VSA module, VoxSeT can manage voxelized point clusters with arbitrary size in a wide range, and process them in parallel with linear complexity. The proposed VoxSeT integrates the high performance of transformer with the efficiency of voxel-based model, which can be used as a good alternative to the convolutional and point-based backbones. VoxSeT reports competitive results on the KITTI and Waymo detection benchmarks. The source codes can be found at https://github.com/skyhehe123/VoxSeT."}}

Though this issue can be alleviated in a depth-based model where a depth estimation module is plugged to predict depth information before 3D box reasoning, the introduction of such module dramatically reduces the detection speed. Instead of training a costly depth estimator, we propose a rendering module to augment the training data by synthesizing images with virtual-depths. The rendering module takes as input the RGB image and its corresponding sparse depth image, outputs a variety of photo-realistic synthetic images, from which the detection model can learn more discriminative features to adapt to the depth changes of the objects. Besides, we introduce an auxiliary module to improve the detection model by jointly optimizing it through a depth estimation task. Both modules are working in the training time and no extra computation will be introduced to the detection model. Experiments show that by working with our proposed modules, a geometry-based model can represent the leading accuracy on the KITTI 3D detection benchmark."}}

Current single-stage detectors are efficient by progressively downscaling the 3D point clouds in a fully convolutional manner. However, the downscaled features inevitably lose spatial information and cannot make full use of the structure information of 3D point cloud, degrading their localization precision. In this work, we propose to improve the localization precision of single-stage detectors by explicitly leveraging the structure information of 3D point cloud. Specifically, we design an auxiliary network which converts the convolutional features in the backbone network back to point-level representations. The auxiliary network is jointly optimized, by two point-level supervisions, to guide the convolutional features in the backbone network to be aware of the object structure. The auxiliary network can be detached after training and therefore introduces no extra computation in the inference stage. Besides, considering that single-stage detectors suffer from the discordance between the predicted bounding boxes and corresponding classification confidences, we develop an efficient part-sensitive warping operation to align the confidences to the predicted bounding boxes. Our proposed detector ranks at the top of KITTI 3D/BEV detection leaderboards and runs at 25 FPS for inference."}}
