In this work we study the limitations  of $edge\\ independent\\ random\\ graph\\ models$, in which  each edge is added to the graph independently with some probability. Such models include both the classic Erdos-Renyi and stochastic block models, as well as  modern generative models such as NetGAN, variational graph autoencoders, and CELL. \n We prove that subject to a $bounded\\  overlap$ condition, which ensures that the model does not simply memorize a single graph, edge independent models are inherently limited in their ability to generate graphs with high triangle and other subgraph densities. Notably, such high densities are known to appear in real-world social networks and other graphs. We complement our negative results with a simple generative model that balances overlap and accuracy, performing comparably to more complex models in reconstructing many graph statistics. "}}

Also, how important is time locality, and which features of interaction patterns are most important to enable accurate prediction of specific Twitter interactions? Our empirical study of Twitter interactions contributes initial answers to these questions. We have crawled an extensive dataset of Greek-speaking Twitter accounts and their follow, quote, retweet, reply interactions over a period of a month. We find we can accurately predict many interactions of Twitter users. Interestingly, the most predictive features vary with the user profiles, and are not the same across all users. For example, for a pair of users that interact with a large number of other Twitter users, we find that certain \"higher-dimensional\" triads, i.e., triads that involve multiple types of interactions, are very informative, whereas for less active Twitter users, certain in-degrees and out-degrees play a major role.

We propose a novel computational approach for enhancing the traditional Girvan-Newman (GN) community detection algorithm via hyperbolic network embedding. The data dependency graph is embedded in the hyperbolic space via Rigel embedding, making it possible to compute more efficiently the hyperbolic edge-betweenness centrality (HEBC) needed in the modified GN algorithm. This allows for more efficient clustering of the nodes of the data graph without significantly sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with artificial network and data topologies, and real benchmark datasets. The proposed methodology can be used for efficient clustering of datasets obtained from massive pervasive smart city/building sensor networks, such as the FIESTA-IoT platform, and exploited in various applications such as lower-cost sensing."}}

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for the analysis and efficient computation of routing path-based centrality measures, focusing on betweenness and traffic load centrality. The proposed framework enables efficient approximation and in special cases accurate computation of the aforementioned measures in large-scale complex networks, as well as improving/adapting commodity (traffic) routing by identifying and alleviating key congestion points. It capitalizes on network embedding in hyperbolic space and exploits properties of greedy routing over hyperbolic coordinates. We show the computational benefits and approximation precision of our approach by comparing it with state-of-the-art path centrality computation techniques. We demonstrate its applicability on real topologies, characteristic of actual large-scale commodity networks, e.g., data, utility networks. Focusing on two graph embedding types, Rigel and greedy, we compare their impact on the performance of our framework. Then, we exemplify and statistically analyze the dynamic routing adaptation, via the variation of the minimum-depth spanning tree employed for greedy embedding in hyperbolic space. Notably, this allows for efficient routing adaptation according to a simple, distributed computation that can be applied during network operation to alleviate arising bottlenecks."}}

Towards this goal, in this paper we propose Hyperbolic Traffic Load Centrality (HTLC), as a novel alternative to the Traffic Load Centrality (TLC) metric, used for ranking nodes with respect to their importance in the routing operation. HTLC is based on network embedding in hyperbolic space, while assuming paths paved by greedy routing over hyperbolic coordinates, which requires less computational effort than shortest path routing (in terms of hop distances) used for TLC. Greedy routing in hyperbolic space also yields paths with lengths very close to the shortest ones for the social networks of interest bearing the scale-free property. Through analysis and simulation, we demonstrate that HTLC requires significantly lower computational time than TLC, and despite being more suitable for greedy routing constraints over hyperbolic space, it nevertheless achieves a close approximation of TLC for networks with scale-free properties when assuming shortest path routing. Thus, it can substitute TLC when analyzing very large network topologies."}}
