In this paper, we introduce a tool to visualize and understand such failures. We draw inspiration from concepts from neural electrophysiology, which are based on inspecting the internal functioning of a neural networks by analyzing the feature tuning and invariances of individual units. Deep Electrophysiology, in short Deephys, provides insights of the DNN's failures in out-of-distribution scenarios by comparative visualization of the neural activity in in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Deephys provides seamless analyses of individual neurons, individual images, and a set of set of images from a category, and it is capable of revealing failures due to the presence of spurious features and novel features. We substantiate the validity of the qualitative visualizations of Deephys thorough quantitative analyses using convolutional and transformers architectures, in several datasets and distribution shifts (namely, colored MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet)."}}

In this work, we propose one such model that appends an explanation generation module on top of any basic network and jointly trains the whole module that shows high predictive performance and generates meaningful explanations in terms of concepts. Our training strategy is suitable for unsupervised concept learning with much lesser parameter space requirements compared to baseline methods. Our proposed model also has provision for leveraging self-supervision on concepts to extract better explanations. However, with full concept supervision, we achieve the best predictive performance compared to recently proposed concept-based explainable models. We report both qualitative and quantitative results with our method, which shows better performance than recently proposed concept-based explainability methods. We reported exhaustive results with two datasets without ground truth concepts, i.e., CIFAR10, ImageNet, and two datasets with ground truth concepts, i.e., AwA2, CUB-200, to show the effectiveness of our method for both cases. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ante-hoc explanation generation method to show results with a large-scale dataset such as ImageNet."}}

We also propose to enhance the model training by considering other aspects of the issue i.e. noise in data and better representation learning which shows even better generalization performance with the consensus based prediction strategy. We report results of each noisy corruption on the standard CIFAR10-C and ImageNet-C benchmark which shows significant boost in performance over previous methods. We also introduce results for MNIST-C and TinyImagenet-C to show usefulness of our method across datasets of different complexities to provide robustness against unseen noise. We show results with different architectures to validate our method against other baseline methods, and also conduct experiments to show the usefulness of each part of our method."}}

Attribution maps are more aligned to the actual object in the image for adversarially robust models compared to naturally trained models. Also, the allowed set of pixels to perturb an image (that changes model decision) should be restricted to the object pixels only, which reduces the attack strength by limiting the attack space.

Extensive work has been carried out in recent years on explaining deep models for vision tasks such as classification. However, recent work has shown that it is possible for these models to produce substantially different attribution maps even when two very similar images are given to the network, raising serious questions about trustworthiness. To address this issue, we propose a robust attribution training strategy to improve attributional robustness of deep neural networks. Our method carefully analyzes the requirements for attributional robustness and introduces two new regularizers that preserve a model's attribution map during attacks. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art attributional robustness methods by a margin of approximately 3% to 9% in terms of attribution robustness measures on several datasets including MNIST, FMNIST, Flower and GTSRB."}}

However, deep models are perceived as \"black box\" methods considering the lack of understanding of their internal functioning. There has been a significant recent interest to develop explainable deep learning models, and this paper is an effort in this direction. Building on a recently proposed method called Grad-CAM, we propose Grad-CAM++ to provide better visual explanations of CNN model predictions (when compared to Grad-CAM), in terms of better localization of objects as well as explaining occurrences of multiple objects of a class in a single image. We provide a mathematical explanation for the proposed method, Grad-CAM++, which uses a weighted combination of the positive partial derivatives of the last convolutional layer feature maps with respect to a specific class score as weights to generate a visual explanation for the class label under consideration. Our extensive experiments and evaluations, both subjective and objective, on standard datasets showed that Grad-CAM++ indeed provides better visual explanations for a given CNN architecture when compared to Grad-CAM."}}
