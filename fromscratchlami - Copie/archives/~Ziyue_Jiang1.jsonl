In addition, the majority of voice synthesis models currently rely on annotated audio data, but it is crucial to scale them to self-supervised datasets in order to effectively capture the wide range of acoustic variations present in human voice, including speaker identity, emotion, and prosody. In this work, we propose Make-A-Voice, a unified framework for synthesizing and manipulating voice signals from discrete representations. Make-A-Voice leverages a \"coarse-to-fine\" approach to model the human voice, which involves three stages: 1) semantic stage: model high-level transformation between linguistic content and self-supervised semantic tokens, 2) acoustic stage: introduce varying control signals as acoustic conditions for semantic-to-acoustic modeling, and 3) generation stage: synthesize high-fidelity waveforms from acoustic tokens. Make-A-Voice offers notable benefits as a unified voice synthesis framework: 1) Data scalability: the major backbone (i.e., acoustic and generation stage) does not require any annotations, and thus the training data could be scaled up. 2) Controllability and conditioning flexibility: we investigate different conditioning mechanisms and effectively handle three voice synthesis applications, including text-to-speech (TTS), voice conversion (VC), and singing voice synthesis (SVS) by re-synthesizing the discrete voice representations with prompt guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that Make-A-Voice exhibits superior audio quality and style similarity compared with competitive baseline models.

However, previous works usually encode speech into latent using audio codec and use autoregressive language models or diffusion models to generate it, which ignores the intrinsic nature of speech and may lead to inferior or uncontrollable results. We argue that speech can be decomposed into several attributes (e.g., content, timbre, prosody, and phase) and each of them should be modeled using a module with appropriate inductive biases. From this perspective, we carefully design a novel and large zero-shot TTS system called Mega-TTS, which is trained with large-scale wild data and models different attributes in different ways: 1) Instead of using latent encoded by audio codec as the intermediate feature, we still choose spectrogram as it separates the phase and other attributes very well. Phase can be appropriately constructed by the GAN-based vocoder and does not need to be modeled by the language model. 2) We model the timbre using global vectors since timbre is a global attribute that changes slowly over time. 3) We further use a VQGAN-based acoustic model to generate the spectrogram and a latent code language model to fit the distribution of prosody, since prosody changes quickly over time in a sentence, and language models can capture both local and long-range dependencies. We scale Mega-TTS to multi-domain datasets with 20K hours of speech and evaluate its performance on unseen speakers. Experimental results demonstrate that Mega-TTS surpasses state-of-the-art TTS systems on zero-shot TTS, speech editing, and cross-lingual TTS tasks, with superior naturalness, robustness, and speaker similarity due to the proper inductive bias of each module.

Given only a few-minute-long talking person video with the audio track as the training data and arbitrary texts as the driving input, we aim to synthesize high-quality talking portrait videos corresponding to the input text. This task has broad application prospects in the digital human industry but has not been technically achieved yet due to two challenges: (1) It is challenging to mimic the timbre from out-of-domain audio for a traditional multi-speaker Text-to-Speech system. (2) It is hard to render high-fidelity and lip-synchronized talking avatars with limited training data. In this paper, we introduce Adaptive Text-to-Talking Avatar (Ada-TTA), which (1) designs a generic zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model that well disentangles the text content, timbre, and prosody; and (2) embraces recent advances in neural rendering to achieve realistic audio-driven talking face video generation. With these designs, our method overcomes the aforementioned two challenges and achieves to generate identity-preserving speech and realistic talking person video. Experiments demonstrate that our method could synthesize realistic, identity-preserving, and audio-visual synchronized talking avatar videos."}}

Recently, several works explore the usage of neural radiance field in this task to improve 3D realness and image fidelity. However, the generalizability of previous NeRF-based methods to out-of-domain audio is limited by the small scale of training data. In this work, we propose GeneFace, a generalized and high-fidelity NeRF-based talking face generation method, which can generate natural results corresponding to various out-of-domain audio. Specifically, we learn a variaitional motion generator on a large lip-reading corpus, and introduce a domain adaptative post-net to calibrate the result. Moreover, we learn a NeRF-based renderer conditioned on the predicted facial motion. A head-aware torso-NeRF is proposed to eliminate the head-torso separation problem. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves more generalized and high-fidelity talking face generation compared to previous methods."}}

A modern talking face generation method is expected to achieve the goals of generalized audio-lip synchronization, good video quality, and high system efficiency. Recently, neural radiance field (NeRF) has become a popular rendering technique in this field since it could achieve high-fidelity and 3D-consistent talking face generation with a few-minute-long training video. However, there still exist several challenges for NeRF-based methods: 1) as for the lip synchronization, it is hard to generate a long facial motion sequence of high temporal consistency and audio-lip accuracy; 2) as for the video quality, due to the limited data used to train the renderer, it is vulnerable to out-of-domain input condition and produce bad rendering results occasionally; 3) as for the system efficiency, the slow training and inference speed of the vanilla NeRF severely obstruct its usage in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose GeneFace++ to handle these challenges by 1) utilizing the pitch contour as an auxiliary feature and introducing a temporal loss in the facial motion prediction process; 2) proposing a landmark locally linear embedding method to regulate the outliers in the predicted motion sequence to avoid robustness issues; 3) designing a computationally efficient NeRF-based motion-to-video renderer to achieves fast training and real-time inference. With these settings, GeneFace++ becomes the first NeRF-based method that achieves stable and real-time talking face generation with generalized audio-lip synchronization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of subjective and objective evaluation.

While previous studies have relied on users providing specific style factor values based on acoustic knowledge or selecting reference speeches that meet certain requirements, generating speech solely from natural text prompts has emerged as a new challenge for researchers. This challenge arises due to the scarcity of high-quality speech datasets with natural text style prompt and the absence of advanced text-controllable TTS models. In light of this, 1) we propose TextrolSpeech, which is the first large-scale speech emotion dataset annotated with rich text attributes. The dataset comprises 236,220 pairs of style prompt in natural text descriptions with five style factors and corresponding speech samples. Through iterative experimentation, we introduce a multi-stage prompt programming approach that effectively utilizes the GPT model for generating natural style descriptions in large volumes. 2) Furthermore, to address the need for generating audio with greater style diversity, we propose an efficient architecture called Salle. This architecture treats text controllable TTS as a language model task, utilizing audio codec codes as an intermediate representation to replace the conventional mel-spectrogram. Finally, we successfully demonstrate the ability of the proposed model by showing a comparable performance in the controllable TTS task. Audio samples are available at https://sall-e.github.io/"}}

However, existing works only implicitly learn the prosody with masked token reconstruction tasks, which leads to low training efficiency and difficulty in prosody modeling. We propose CLAPSpeech, a cross-modal contrastive pre-training framework that explicitly learns the prosody variance of the same text token under different contexts. Specifically, 1) We encourage the model to connect the text context with its corresponding prosody pattern in the joint multi-modal space with the elaborate design of the encoder inputs and contrastive loss; 2) We introduce a multi-scale pre-training pipeline to capture prosody patterns in multiple levels. We show how to incorporate CLAPSpeech into existing TTS models for better prosody. Experiments on three datasets not only show that CLAPSpeech could improve the prosody prediction for existing TTS methods, but also demonstrate its generalization ability to adapt to multiple languages and multi-speaker TTS. We also deeply analyze the principle behind the performance of CLAPSpeech. Ablation studies demonstrate the necessity of each component in our method.
