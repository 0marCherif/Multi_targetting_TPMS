Mimicking Human Cognitive Behavior in Image Generation Evaluation", "abstract": "Research in Image Generation has recently made significant progress, particularly boosted by the introduction of VisionLanguage models which are able to produce high-quality visual content based on textual inputs. Despite ongoing advancements in terms of generation quality and realism, no methodical frameworks have been defined yet to quantitatively measure the quality of the generated content and the adherence with the prompted requests: so far, only humanbased evaluations have been adopted for quality satisfaction and for comparing different generative methods. We introduce a novel automated method for Visual Concept Evaluation (ViCE), i.e. to assess consistency between a generated/edited image and the corresponding prompt/instructions, with a process inspired by the human cognitive behaviour. ViCE combines the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Question Answering (VQA) into a unified pipeline, aiming to replicate the human cognitive process in quality assessment. This method outlines visual concepts, formulates image-specific verification questions, utilizes the Q&A system to investigate the image, and scores the combined outcome. Although this brave new hypothesis of mimicking humans in the image evaluation process is in its preliminary assessment stage, results are promising and open the door to a new form of automatic evaluation which could have significant impact as the image generation or the image target editing tasks become more and more sophisticated."}}

In fact, deepfake detection might be the only measure to counter the potential proliferation of generated media in support of fake news and its consequences. While many of the available works limit the detection to a pure and direct classification of fake versus real, this does not translate well to a real-world scenario. Indeed, malevolent users can easily apply post-processing techniques to generated content, changing the underlying distribution of fake data. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of the robustness of a deepfake detection pipeline, considering different image augmentations, transformations, and other pre-processing steps. These transformations are only applied in the evaluation phase, thus simulating a practical situation in which the detector is not trained on all the possible augmentations that can be used by the attacker. In particular, we analyze the performance of a \n-NN and a linear probe detector on the COCOFake dataset, using image features extracted from pre-trained models, like CLIP and DINO. Our results demonstrate that while the CLIP visual backbone outperforms DINO in deepfake detection with no augmentation, its performance varies significantly in presence of any transformation, favoring the robustness of DINO."}}

Following this trend, this article tackles the task of generating fine-grained and accurate natural language descriptions of fashion items, a recently-proposed and under-explored challenge that is still far from being solved. To overcome the limitations of previous approaches, a transformer-based captioning model was designed with the integration of external textual memory that could be accessed through k-nearest neighbor (kNN) searches. From an architectural point of view, the proposed transformer model can read and retrieve items from the external memory through cross-attention operations, and tune the flow of information coming from the external memory thanks to a novel fully attentive gate. Experimental analyses were carried out on the fashion captioning dataset (FACAD) for fashion image captioning, which contains more than 130k fine-grained descriptions, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the proposed architectural strategies in comparison with carefully designed baselines and state-of-the-art approaches. The presented method constantly outperforms all compared approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness for fashion image captioning."}}

While these models have numerous benefits across various sectors, they have also raised concerns about the potential misuse of fake images and cast new pressures on fake image detection. In this work, we pioneer a systematic study of the authenticity of fake images generated by state-of-the-art diffusion models. Firstly, we conduct a comprehensive study on the performance of contrastive and classification-based visual features. Our analysis demonstrates that fake images share common low-level cues, which render them easily recognizable. Further, we devise a multimodal setting wherein fake images are synthesized by different textual captions, which are used as seeds for a generator. Under this setting, we quantify the performance of fake detection strategies and introduce a contrastive-based disentangling strategy which let us analyze the role of the semantics of textual descriptions and low-level perceptual cues. Finally, we release a new dataset, called COCOFake, containing about 600k images generated from original COCO images."}}

In this context, recent approaches have employed the Masked Image Modeling paradigm, which pre-trains a backbone by reconstructing visual tokens associated with randomly masked image patches. This masking approach, however, introduces noise into the input data during pre-training, leading to discrepancies that can impair performance during the fine-tuning phase. Furthermore, input masking neglects the dependencies between corrupted patches, increasing the inconsistencies observed in downstream fine-tuning tasks. To overcome these issues, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training approach, named Masked and Permuted Vision Transformer (MaPeT), that employs autoregressive and permuted predictions to capture intra-patch dependencies. In addition, MaPeT employs auxiliary positional information to reduce the disparity between the pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In our experiments, we employ a fair setting to ensure reliable and meaningful comparisons and conduct investigations on multiple visual tokenizers, including our proposed $k$-CLIP which directly employs discretized CLIP features. Our results demonstrate that MaPeT achieves competitive performance on ImageNet, compared to baselines and competitors under the same model setting.

For this reason, large research efforts have been devoted to image captioning, i.e. describing images with syntactically and semantically meaningful sentences. Starting from 2015 the task has generally been addressed with pipelines composed of a visual encoder and a language model for text generation. During these years, both components have evolved considerably through the exploitation of object regions, attributes, the introduction of multi-modal connections, fully-attentive approaches, and BERT-like early-fusion strategies. However, regardless of the impressive results, research in image captioning has not reached a conclusive answer yet. This work aims at providing a comprehensive overview of image captioning approaches, from visual encoding and text generation to training strategies, datasets, and evaluation metrics. In this respect, we quantitatively compare many relevant state-of-the-art approaches to identify the most impactful technical innovations in architectures and training strategies. Moreover, many variants of the problem and its open challenges are discussed. The final goal of this work is to serve as a tool for understanding the existing literature and highlighting the future directions for a research area where Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing can find an optimal synergy."}}

Although successful, the attention operator only considers a weighted summation of projections of the current input sample, therefore ignoring the relevant semantic information which can come from the joint observation of other samples. In this paper, we devise a network which can perform attention over activations obtained while processing other training samples, through a prototypical memory model. Our memory models the distribution of past keys and values through the definition of prototype vectors which are both discriminative and compact. Experimentally, we assess the performance of the proposed model on the COCO dataset, in comparison with carefully designed baselines and state-of-the-art approaches, and by investigating the role of each of the proposed components. We demonstrate that our proposal can increase the performance of an encoder-decoder Transformer by 3.7 CIDEr points both when training in cross-entropy only and when fine-tuning with self-critical sequence training.

Experiments spanning several datasets demonstrate that our new metric achieves the highest correlation with human judgments on both images and videos, outperforming existing reference-based metrics like CIDEr and SPICE and reference-free metrics like CLIP-Score.
