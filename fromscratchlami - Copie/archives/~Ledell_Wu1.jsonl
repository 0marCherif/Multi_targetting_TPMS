In this paper, we propose EVA-CLIP, a series of models that significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of CLIP training. Our approach incorporates new techniques for representation learning, optimization, and augmentation, enabling EVA-CLIP to achieve superior performance compared to previous CLIP models with the same number of parameters but significantly smaller training costs. Notably, our largest 5.0B-parameter EVA-02-CLIP-E/14+ with only 9 billion seen samples achieves 82.0 zero-shot top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K val. A smaller EVA-02-CLIP-L/14+ with only 430 million parameters and 6 billion seen samples achieves 80.4 zero-shot top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K val. To facilitate open access and open research, we release the complete suite of EVA-CLIP to the community at https://github.com/baaivision/EVA/tree/master/EVA-CLIP."}}

Unfortunately, such a pipelined framework limits the optimization of the final retrieval quality, because indexing and retrieving are separated stages that can not be jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner. In order to unify these two stages, we explore a model-based indexer for document retrieval. Concretely, we propose Ultron, which encodes the knowledge of all documents into the model and aims to directly retrieve relevant documents end-to-end. For the model-based indexer, how to represent docids and how to train the model are two main issues to be explored. Existing solutions suffer from semantically deficient docids and limited supervised data. To tackle these two problems, first, we devise two types of docids that are richer in semantics and easier for model inference. In addition, we propose a three-stage training workflow to capture more knowledge contained in the corpus and associations between queries and docids. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of Ultron over advanced baselines for document retrieval."}}

EVA is a vanilla ViT pre-trained to reconstruct the masked out image-text aligned vision features conditioned on visible image patches. Via this pretext task, we can efficiently scale up EVA to one billion parameters, and sets new records on a broad range of representative vision downstream tasks, such as image recognition, video action recognition, object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation without heavy supervised training. Moreover, we observe quantitative changes in scaling EVA result in qualitative changes in transfer learning performance that are not present in other models. For instance, EVA takes a great leap in the challenging large vocabulary instance segmentation task: our model achieves almost the same state-of-the-art performance on LVISv1.0 dataset with over a thousand categories and COCO dataset with only eighty categories. Beyond a pure vision encoder, EVA can also serve as a vision-centric, multi-modal pivot to connect images and text. We find initializing the vision tower of a giant CLIP from EVA can greatly stabilize the training and outperform the training from scratch counterpart with much fewer samples and less compute, providing a new direction for scaling up and accelerating the costly training of multi-modal foundation models.

Starting from the pre-trained multimodal representation model CLIP released by OpenAI, we altered its text encoder with a pre-trained multilingual text encoder XLM-R, and aligned both languages and image representations by a two-stage training schema consisting of teacher learning and contrastive learning. We validate our method through evaluations of a wide range of tasks. We set new state-of-the-art performances on a bunch of tasks including ImageNet-CN, Flicker30k-CN, COCO-CN and XTD. Further, we obtain very close performances with CLIP on almost all tasks, suggesting that one can simply alter the text encoder in CLIP for extended capabilities such as multilingual understanding.

Recent studies show that neural-based models are effective in learning contextual representation for tabular data. The learning of an effective contextual representation requires meaningful features and a large amount of data. However, current methods often fail to properly learn a contextual representation from the features without semantic information. In addition, it's intractable to enlarge the training set through mixed tabular datasets due to the difference between datasets. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework PTab, using the Pre-trained language model to model Tabular data. PTab learns a contextual representation of tabular data through a three-stage processing: Modality Transformation(MT), Masked-Language Fine-tuning(MF), and Classification Fine-tuning(CF). We initialize our model with a pre-trained Model (PTM) which contains semantic information learned from the large-scale language data. Consequently, contextual representation can be learned effectively during the fine-tuning stages. In addition, we can naturally mix the textualized tabular data to enlarge the training set to further improve representation learning. We evaluate PTab on eight popular tabular classification datasets. Experimental results show that our method has achieved a better average AUC score in supervised settings compared to the state-of-the-art baselines(e.g. XGBoost), and outperforms counterpart methods under semi-supervised settings. We present visualization results that show PTab has well instance-based interpretability."}}

With the surgence of deep learning and large-scale pre-training techniques, various neural information retrieval models are proposed and they have demonstrated the power for improving search (especially, the ranking) quality. All these existing search methods follow a common paradigm, i.e. index-retrieve-rerank, where they first build an index of all documents based on document terms (i.e., sparse inverted index) or representation vectors (i.e., dense vector index), then retrieve and rerank retrieved documents based on similarity between the query and documents via ranking models. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm of information retrieval with neither sparse nor dense index but only a model. Specifically, we propose a pre-training model-based IR system called DynamicRetriever. As for this system, the training stage embeds the token-level and document-level information (especially, document identifiers) of the corpus into the model parameters, then the inference stage directly generates document identifiers for a given query. Compared with existing search methods, the model-based IR system has two advantages: i) it parameterizes the traditional static index with a pre-training model, which converts the document semantic mapping into a dynamic and updatable process; ii) with separate document identifiers, it captures both the term-level and document-level information for each document. Extensive experiments conducted on the public search benchmark MS MARCO verify the effectiveness and potential of our proposed new paradigm for information retrieval."}}
