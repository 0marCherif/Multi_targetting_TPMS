However, their central component, softmax attention, prohibits vision transformers from scaling up to high-resolution images, due to both the computational complexity and memory footprint being quadratic. Linear attention was introduced in natural language processing (NLP) which reorders the self-attention mechanism to mitigate a similar issue, but directly applying existing linear attention to vision may not lead to satisfactory results. We investigate this problem and point out that existing linear attention methods ignore an inductive bias in vision tasks, i.e., 2D locality. In this article, we propose Vicinity Attention, which is a type of linear attention that integrates 2D locality. Specifically, for each image patch, we adjust its attention weight based on its 2D Manhattan distance from its neighbouring patches. In this case, we achieve 2D locality in a linear complexity where the neighbouring image patches receive stronger attention than far away patches. In addition, we propose a novel Vicinity Attention Block that is comprised of Feature Reduction Attention (FRA) and Feature Preserving Connection (FPC) in order to address the computational bottleneck of linear attention approaches, including our Vicinity Attention, whose complexity grows quadratically with respect to the feature dimension. The Vicinity Attention Block computes attention in a compressed feature space with an extra skip connection to retrieve the original feature distribution. We experimentally validate that the block further reduces computation without degenerating the accuracy. Finally, to validate the proposed methods, we build a linear vision transformer backbone named Vicinity Vision Transformer (VVT). Targeting general vision tasks, we build VVT in a pyramid structure with progressively reduced sequence length. We perform extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1 k, and ADE20 K datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method. Our method has a slower growth rate in terms of computational overhead than previous transformer-based and convolution-based networks when the input resolution increases. In particular, our approach achieves state-of-the-art image classification accuracy with 50% fewer parameters than previous approaches."}}

However, most of them simply swap Softmax with an efficient attention mechanism without considering the customized architectures specially for the efficient attention. In this paper, we argue that the handcrafted vanilla Transformer architectures for Softmax attention may not be suitable for efficient Transformers. To address this issue, we propose a new framework to find optimal architectures for efficient Transformers with the neural architecture search (NAS) technique. The proposed method is validated on popular machine translation and image classification tasks. We observe that the optimal architecture of the efficient Transformer has the reduced computation compared with that of the standard Transformer, but the general accuracy is less comparable. It indicates that the Softmax attention and efficient attention have their own distinctions but neither of them can simultaneously balance the accuracy and efficiency well. This motivates us to mix the two types of attention to reduce the performance imbalance. Besides the search spaces that commonly used in existing NAS Transformer approaches, we propose a new search space that allows the NAS algorithm to automatically search the attention variants along with architectures. Extensive experiments on WMT' 14 En-De and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our searched architecture maintains comparable accuracy to the standard Transformer with notably improved computational efficiency."}}

However, they usually suffer from degraded performances on various tasks and corpus. In this paper, we examine existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify two key issues that lead to such performance gaps: 1) unbounded gradients in the attention computation adversely impact the convergence of linear transformer models; 2) attention dilution which trivially distributes attention scores over long sequences while neglecting neighbouring structures. To address these issues, we first identify that the scaling of attention matrices is the devil in unbounded gradients, which turns out unnecessary in linear attention as we show theoretically and empirically. To this end, we propose a new linear attention that replaces the scaling operation with a normalization to stabilize gradients. For the issue of attention dilution, we leverage a diagonal attention to confine attention to only neighbouring tokens in early layers. Benefiting from the stable gradients and improved attention, our new linear transformer model, transNormer, demonstrates superior performance on text classification and language modeling tasks, as well as on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark, surpassing vanilla transformer and existing linear variants by a clear margin while being significantly more space-time efficient.

In image-level WSSS, Class Activation Map (CAM) is adopted to generate object localization as pseudo segmentation labels. To address the partial activation issue of the CAMs, consistency regularization is employed to maintain activation intensity invariance across various image augmentations. However, such methods ignore pair-wise relations among regions within each CAM, which capture context and should also be invariant across image views. To this end, we propose a new all-pairs consistency regularization (ACR). Given a pair of augmented views, our approach regularizes the activation intensities between a pair of augmented views, while also ensuring that the affinity across regions within each view remains consistent. We adopt vision transformers as the self-attention mechanism naturally embeds pair-wise affinity. This enables us to simply regularize the distance between the attention matrices of augmented image pairs. Additionally, we introduce a novel class-wise localization method that leverages the gradients of the class token. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing WSSS methods using transformers without modifying the architectures. We evaluate our method on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. Our method produces noticeably better class localization maps (67.3% mIoU on PASCAL VOC train), resulting in superior WSSS performances."}}

Recently, the transformer-based models have shown strong performance on various sequence modeling tasks, which rely on attention to capture pairwise token relations, and position embedding to inject positional information. While showing good performance, the transformer models are inefficient to scale to long input sequences, mainly due to the quadratic space-time complexity of attention. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose to model sequences with a relative position encoded Toeplitz matrix and use a Toeplitz matrix-vector production trick to reduce the space-time complexity of the sequence modeling to log linear. A lightweight sub-network called relative position encoder is proposed to generate relative position coefficients with a fixed budget of parameters, enabling the proposed Toeplitz neural network to deal with varying sequence lengths. In addition, despite being trained on 512-token sequences, our model can extrapolate input sequence length up to 14K tokens in inference with consistent performance. Extensive experiments on autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling, image modeling, and the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark show that our method achieves better performance than its competitors in most downstream tasks while being significantly faster.

Traditional approaches often tackle this challenge by combining information from various modalities, where the contribution of each modality is implicitly or explicitly modeled. Nevertheless, the interconnections between different modalities tend to be overlooked in audio-visual modeling. In this paper, inspired by the human ability to mentally simulate the sound of an object and its visual appearance, we introduce a bidirectional generation framework. This framework establishes robust correlations between an object's visual characteristics and its associated sound, thereby enhancing the performance of AVS. To achieve this, we employ a visual-to-audio projection component that reconstructs audio features from object segmentation masks and minimizes reconstruction errors. Moreover, recognizing that many sounds are linked to object movements, we introduce an implicit volumetric motion estimation module to handle temporal dynamics that may be challenging to capture using conventional optical flow methods. To showcase the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments and analyses on the widely recognized AVSBench benchmark. As a result, we establish a new state-of-the-art performance level in the AVS benchmark, particularly excelling in the challenging MS3 subset which involves segmenting multiple sound sources. To facilitate reproducibility, we plan to release both the source code and the pre-trained model."}}
