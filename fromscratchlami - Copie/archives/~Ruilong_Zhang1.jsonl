Several models have been proposed to capture the behaviors of such agents in the literature. In the paper, we consider the model where agents are subject to budget and return-on-spend constraints. The budget constraint of an agent limits the maximum payment she can afford, while the return-on-spend constraint means that the ratio of the total obtained value (return) to the total payment (spend) cannot be lower than the targeted bar set by the agent. The problem was first coined by [Balseiro et al., EC 2022]. In their work, only Bayesian mechanisms were considered. We initiate the study of the problem in the worst-case model and compare the revenue of our mechanisms to an offline optimal solution, the most ambitious benchmark. The paper distinguishes two main auction settings based on the accessibility of agents' information: fully private and partially private. In the fully private setting, an agent's valuation, budget, and target bar are all private. We show that if agents are unit-demand, constant approximation mechanisms can be obtained; while for additive agents, there exists a mechanism that achieves a constant approximation ratio under a large market assumption. The partially private setting is the setting considered in the previous work [Balseiro et al., EC 2022] where only the agents' target bars are private. We show that in this setting, the approximation ratio of the single-item auction can be further improved, and a $\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{n})$-approximation mechanism can be derived for additive agents."}}

The goal is to order elements for all the functions to have value above a certain threshold as soon on average as possible, assuming we choose one element per time. The problem is flexible enough to capture various applications in machine learning, including decision trees. This paper considers the min-max version of SR where multiple instances share the ground set. With the view of each instance being associated with an agent, the min-max problem is to order the common elements to minimize the maximum objective of all agents---thus, finding a fair solution for all agents. We give approximation algorithms for this problem and demonstrate their effectiveness in the application of finding a decision tree for multiple agents."}}

Recently, [Christoph D\u00fcrr et al., 2020] has studied a setting where testing a job takes a unit time, and the goal is to minimize total completion time or makespan on a single machine. In this paper, we extend their problem to the budget setting in which each test consumes a job-specific cost, and we require that the total testing cost cannot exceed a given budget. We consider the offline variant (the lower processing time is known) and the oblivious variant (the lower processing time is unknown) and aim to minimize the total completion time or makespan on a single machine. For the total completion time objective, we show NP-hardness and derive a PTAS for the offline variant based on a novel LP rounding scheme. We give a (4+\u03b5)-competitive algorithm for the oblivious variant based on a framework inspired by the worst-case lower-bound instance.

In the problem, we are given a directed graph with $n$ vertices and $k$ distinct cost functions (scenarios) defined over edges, and aim to choose an $s$-$t$ path such that the total cost of the path is always provable no matter which scenario is realized. With the view of each cost function being associated with an agent, our goal is to find a common $s$-$t$ path minimizing the maximum objective among all agents, and thus create a fair solution for them. The problem is hard to approximate within $o(\\log k)$ by any quasi-polynomial time algorithm unless $\\mathrm{NP} \\subseteq \\mathrm{DTIME}(n^{\\mathrm{poly}\\log n})$, and the best approximation ratio known to date is $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ which is based on the natural flow linear program. A longstanding open question is whether we can achieve a polylogarithmic approximation even when a quasi-polynomial running time is allowed. We give the first polylogarithmic approximation for robust $s$-$t$ path since the problem was proposed more than two decades ago. In particular, we introduce a $O(\\log n \\log k)$-approximate algorithm running in quasi-polynomial time. The algorithm is built on a novel linear program formulation for a decision-tree-type structure which enables us to get rid of the $\\Omega(\\max\\{k,\\sqrt{n}\\})$ integrality gap of the natural flow LP. Further, we also consider some well-known graph classes, e.g., graphs with bounded treewidth, and show that the polylogarithmic approximation can be achieved polynomially on these graphs. We hope the new proposed techniques in the paper can offer new insights into the robust $s$-$t$ path problem and related problems in robust optimization."}}
