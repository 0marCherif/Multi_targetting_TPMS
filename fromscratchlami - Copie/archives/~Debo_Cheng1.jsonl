Causal mediation analysis is a method that is often used to reveal direct and indirect effects. Deep learning shows promise in mediation analysis, but the current methods only assume latent confounders that affect treatment, mediator and outcome simultaneously, and fail to identify different types of latent confounders (e.g., confounders that only affect the mediator or outcome). Furthermore, current methods are based on the sequential ignorability assumption, which is not feasible for dealing with multiple types of latent confounders. This work aims to circumvent the sequential ignorability assumption and applies the piecemeal deconfounding assumption as an alternative. We propose the Disentangled Mediation Analysis Variational AutoEncoder (DMAVAE), which disentangles the representations of latent confounders into three types to accurately estimate the natural direct effect, natural indirect effect and total effect. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods and has strong generalisation ability. We further apply the method to a real-world dataset to show its potential application."}}

Instrumental variables (IVs) are widely used for causal effect estimation when there exist latent confounders. With the standard IV method, when a given IV is valid, unbiased estimation can be obtained, but the validity requirement on a standard IV is strict and untestable. Conditional IVs have been proposed to relax the requirement of standard IVs by conditioning on a set of observed variables (known as a conditioning set for a conditional IV). However, the criterion for finding a conditioning set for a conditional IV needs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the causal relationships of both observed and unobserved variables. This makes it challenging to discover a conditioning set directly from data. In this paper, by leveraging maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) for causal inference with latent variables, we study the graphical properties of ancestral IVs, a type of conditional IVs using MAGs, and develop the theory to support data-driven discovery of the conditioning set for a given ancestral IV in data under the pretreatment variable assumption. Based on the theory, we develop an algorithm for unbiased causal effect estimation with a given ancestral IV and observational data. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in comparison with existing IV methods."}}

Building semantic models is a prerequisite for automatically publishing data to a knowledge graph. However, constructing these semantic models is a complex process requiring consid-erable manual effort and a high potential for errors. Several approaches have been proposed for automatically identifying semantic models of data sources. However, as the schemata of data sources change, the corresponding semantic models may require amendments. We propose a dynamic semantic modeling approach whereby the semantic model of a data source can be adapted automatically as data sources change. We show that our incremental approach outperforms state-of-the-art systems by an average of 7.4% in the F1 score and that it is orders of magnitude faster than constructing a semantic model from scratch."}}

It is challenging to estimate the average causal effect and individual causal effects from observational data with high-dimensional covariates due to the curse of dimension and the problem of data sufficiency. The existing matching methods can not effectively estimate individual causal effect or solve the problem of dimension curse in causal inference. To address this challenge, in this work, we prove that the reduced set by sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) is a balance score for confounding adjustment. Under the theorem, we propose to use an SDR method to obtain a reduced representation set of the original covariates and then the reduced set is used for the matching method. In detail, a non-parametric model is used to learn such a reduced set and to avoid model specification errors. The experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the compared matching methods. Moreover, we conduct an experiment analysis and the results demonstrate that the reduced representation is enough to balance the imbalance between the treatment group and control group individuals."}}

However, existing algorithms mainly rely on the associations between features and response variables such that they lack stability and may result in wrong conclusions. To improve the interpretability and stability of feature selection algorithms, we propose a stable causal feature selection algorithm based on the direct causal effect estimation, which achieves interpretable feature selection by considering the causal relationship between features and response variables. Specifically, we develop a theorem based on the graphical causal model to estimate the direct causal effects for supporting the proposed stable causal feature selection algorithm. Moreover, the causal feature selection algorithm is applied for a real-world application, i.e. earthquake prediction by utilising a neural network model, BiLSTM. Abundant experiments carried out on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed stable causal feature selection algorithm has better performance than the baselines."}}

Such an \u201cexperiment on data\u201d to estimate the causal effect of the manipulated variable is useful for validating an experiment design using historical data or for exploring confounders when studying a new relationship. However, existing data-driven methods for causal effect estimation face some major challenges, including poor scalability with high dimensional data, low estimation accuracy due to heuristics used by the global causal structure learning algorithms, and the assumption of causal sufficiency when hidden variables are inevitable in data. In this paper, we develop theorems for using local search to find a superset of the adjustment (or confounding) variables for causal effect estimation from observational data under a realistic pretreatment assumption. The theorems ensure that the unbiased estimate of causal effect is included in the set of causal effects estimated by the superset of adjustment variables. Based on the developed theorems, we propose a data-driven algorithm for causal query. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is faster and produces better causal effect estimation than an existing data-driven causal effect estimation method with hidden variables. The causal effects estimated by the proposed algorithm are as accurate as those by the state-of-the-art methods using domain knowledge."}}
