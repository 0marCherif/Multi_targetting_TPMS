A core issue is that robustness to one type of attack often fails to transfer to other attacks. While prior work establishes a theoretical trade-off in robustness against different $L_p$ norms, we show that there is potential for improvement against many commonly used attacks by adopting a domain generalisation approach.\nConcretely, we treat each type of attack as a domain, and apply the Risk Extrapolation method (REx), which promotes similar levels of robustness against all training attacks. Compared to existing methods, we obtain similar or superior worst-case adversarial robustness on attacks seen during training. Moreover, we achieve superior performance on families or tunings of attacks only encountered at test time. On ensembles of attacks, our approach improves the accuracy from 3.4\\% the best existing baseline to 25.9\\% on MNIST, and from 16.9\\% to 23.5\\% on CIFAR10."}}

Pseudo-ensemble methods like dropout have also been commonly used in deep learning models to improve generalization. However, the application of these techniques to improve neural networks' robustness against input perturbations remains underexplored. We introduce \\emph{Kernel Average Pool (KAP)}, a new neural network building block that applies the mean filter along the kernel dimension of the layer activation tensor. We show that ensembles of kernels with similar functionality naturally emerge in convolutional neural networks equipped with KAP and trained with backpropagation. Moreover, we show that when combined with activation noise, KAP models are remarkably robust against various forms of adversarial attacks. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, TinyImagenet, and Imagenet datasets show substantial improvements in robustness against strong adversarial attacks such as AutoAttack that are on par with adversarially trained networks but are importantly obtained without training on any adversarial examples."}}

While reaching impressive performance under standard settings, such networks are known to be  susceptible to  adversarial attacks -- slight but carefully constructed perturbations of the inputs which drastically decrease the network performance. Here we propose a new way to improve the network robustness against adversarial attacks by   focusing on robust representation learning based on  adversarial training procedure, called here Adversarial Feature Desensitization (AFD). AFD desensitizes the representation via an adversarial game between the embedding network and an adversarial discriminator introduced on top of  the standard predictive model, which is trained to distinguish between the clean and perturbed inputs from their high-level representations. Our method substantially improves the state-of-the-art in robust classification on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that AFD has better generalization ability than previous methods, as the learned features maintain their robustness across a wide range of perturbations, including perturbations not seen during training. These results indicate that reducing feature sensitivity is a promising approach for ameliorating the problem of adversarial attacks in deep neural networks. "}}

Herein, we propose a novel approach for learning such representations from multi-channel EEG time-series, and demonstrate its advantages in the context of mental load classification task. First, we transform EEG activities into a sequence of topology-preserving multi-spectral images, as opposed to standard EEG analysis techniques that ignore such spatial information. Next, we train a deep recurrent-convolutional network inspired by state-of-the-art video classification to learn robust representations from the sequence of images. The proposed approach is designed to preserve the spatial, spectral, and temporal structure of EEG which leads to finding features that are less sensitive to variations and distortions within each dimension. Empirical evaluation on the cognitive load classification task demonstrated significant improvements in classification accuracy over current state-of-the-art approaches in this field."}}

Artificial neural networks also have internal activation behavior in response to stimuli. We hypothesize that networks exhibiting brain-like activation behavior will demonstrate brain-like characteristics, e.g., stronger generalization capabilities. In this paper we introduce a human-model similarity (HMS) metric, which quantifies the similarity of human fMRI and network activation behavior. To calculate HMS, representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) are created as abstractions of activation behavior, measured by the correlations of activations to stimulus pairs. HMS is then the correlation between the fMRI RDM and the neural network RDM across all stimulus pairs. We test the metric on unsupervised predictive coding networks, which specifically model visual perception, and assess the metric for statistical significance over a large range of hyperparameters. Our experiments show that networks with increased human-model similarity are correlated with better performance on two computer vision tasks: next frame prediction and object matching accuracy. Further, HMS identifies networks with high performance on both tasks. An unexpected secondary finding is that the metric can be employed during training as an early-stopping mechanism."}}
{"id": "ryEkcsActX", "cdate": 1538087815310, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Teacher Guided Architecture Search", "abstract": "Strong improvements in neural network performance in vision tasks have resulted from the search of alternative network architectures, and prior work has shown that this search process can be automated and guided by evaluating candidate network performance following limited training (\u201cPerformance Guided Architecture Search\u201d or PGAS).  However, because of the large architecture search spaces and the high computational cost associated with evaluating each candidate model, further gains in computational efficiency are needed.  Here we present a method termed Teacher Guided Search for Architectures by Generation and Evaluation (TG-SAGE) that produces up to an order of magnitude in search efficiency over PGAS methods. Specifically, TG-SAGE guides each step of the architecture search by evaluating the similarity of internal representations of the candidate networks with those of the (fixed) teacher network. We show that this procedure leads to significant reduction in required per-sample training and that, this advantage holds for two different search spaces of architectures, and two different search algorithms. We further show that in the space of convolutional cells for visual categorization, TG-SAGE finds a cell structure with similar performance as was previously found using other methods but at a total computational cost that is two orders of magnitude lower than Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and more than four times lower than progressive neural architecture search (PNAS). These results suggest that TG-SAGE can be used to accelerate network architecture search in cases where one has access to some or all of the internal representations of a teacher network of interest, such as the brain.
