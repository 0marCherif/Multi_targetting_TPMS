Conventional curriculum learning schemes introduce samples in their order of difficulty. This forces models to begin learning from a subset of the available data while adding the external overhead of evaluating the difficulty of samples. In this work, we propose Learning with Incremental Labels and Adaptive Compensation (LILAC), a two-phase method that incrementally increases the number of unique output labels rather than the difficulty of samples while consistently using the entire dataset throughout training. In the first phase, Incremental Label Introduction, we partition data into mutually exclusive subsets, one that contains a subset of the ground-truth labels and another that contains the remaining data attached to a pseudo-label. Throughout the training process, we recursively reveal unseen ground-truth labels in fixed increments until all the labels are known to the model. In the second phase, Adaptive Compensation, we optimize the loss function using altered target vectors of previously misclassified samples. The target vectors of such samples are modified to a smoother distribution to help models learn better. On evaluating across three standard image benchmarks, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10, we show that LILAC outperforms all comparable baselines. Further, we detail the importance of pacing the introduction of new labels to a model as well as the impact of using a smooth target vector.\n"}}

While these methods offer a useful way to approximate contributions from similar filters, they often either ignore the dependency between layers or solve a more difficult optimization objective than standard cross-entropy. Our method, Mutual Information-based Neuron Trimming (MINT), approaches deep compression via pruning by enforcing sparsity based on the strength of the relationship between filters of adjacent layers, across every pair of layers. The relationship is calculated using conditional geometric mutual information which evaluates the amount of similar information exchanged between the filters using a graph-based criterion. When pruning a network, we ensure that retained filters contribute the majority of the information towards succeeding layers which ensures high performance. Our novel approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art compression-via-pruning methods on the standard benchmarks for this task: MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ILSVRC2012, across a variety of network architectures. In addition, we discuss our observations of a common denominator between our pruning methodology's response to adversarial attacks and calibration statistics when compared to the original network.\n"}}

While each approach has its merits and limitations there are a set of common practical issues such as, trial-and-error to analyze sensitivity and hyper-parameters to prune DNNs, which plague them both. In this work, we propose a new single-shot, fully automated pruning algorithm called Slimming Neural networks using Adaptive Connectivity Scores (SNACS). Our proposed approach combines a probabilistic pruning framework with constraints on the underlying weight matrices, via a novel connectivity measure, at multiple levels to capitalize on the strengths of both approaches while solving their deficiencies. In \\alg{}, we propose a fast hash-based estimator of Adaptive Conditional Mutual Information (ACMI), that uses a weight-based scaling criterion, to evaluate the connectivity between filters and prune unimportant ones. To automatically determine the limit up to which a layer can be pruned, we propose a set of operating constraints that jointly define the upper pruning percentage limits across all the layers in a deep network. Finally, we define a novel sensitivity criterion for filters that measures the strength of their contributions to the succeeding layer and highlights critical filters that need to be completely protected from pruning. Through our experimental validation we show that SNACS is faster by over 17x the nearest comparable method and is the state of the art single-shot pruning method across three standard Dataset-DNN pruning benchmarks: CIFAR10-VGG16, CIFAR10-ResNet56 and ILSVRC2012-ResNet50."}}

We propose to simultaneously tackle Performance, Efficiency, and Robustness, using our proposed algorithm Q-TART, Quickly Train for Adversarial Robustness and in-Transferability. Q-TART follows the intuition that samples highly susceptible to noise strongly affect the decision boundaries learned by DNNs, which in turn degrades their performance and adversarial susceptibility. By identifying and removing such samples, we demonstrate improved performance and adversarial robustness while using only a subset of the training data. Through our experiments we highlight Q-TART's high performance across multiple Dataset-DNN combinations, including ImageNet, and provide insights into the complementary behavior of Q-TART alongside existing adversarial training approaches to increase robustness by over 1.3% while using up to 17.9% less training time."}}

M-PACT is the first to offer four SOTA activity classification models, I3D, C3D, ResNet50+LSTM, and TSN, under a single platform with reproducible competitive results. This platform allows for the generation of models and results over activity recognition datasets through the use of modular code, various preprocessing and neural network layers, and seamless data flow.

In this work, firstly, we assert that OSFS\u2019s main assumption of having data from all the samples available at runtime is unrealistic and introduce a new setting where features and samples are streamed concurrently called OSFS with Streaming Samples (OSFS-SS). Secondly, the primary OSFS method, SAOLA utilizes an unbounded mutual information measure and requires multiple comparison steps between the stored and incoming feature sets to evaluate a feature\u2019s importance. We introduce Geometric Online Adaption, an algorithm that requires relatively less feature comparison steps and uses a bounded conditional geometric dependency measure. Our algorithm outperforms several OSFS baselines including SAOLA on a variety of datasets. We also extend SAOLA to work in the OSFS-SS setting and show that GOA continues to achieve the best results. Thirdly, the current paradigm of the OSFS algorithm comparison is flawed. Algorithms are measured by comparing the number of features used and the accuracy obtained by the learner, two properties that are fundamentally at odds with one another. Without fixing a limit on either of these properties, the qualities of features obtained by different algorithms are incomparable. We try to rectify this inconsistency by fixing the maximum number of features available to the learner and comparing algorithms in terms of their accuracy. Additionally, we characterize the behaviour of SAOLA and GOA on feature sets derived from popular deep convolutional featurizers"}}

Here, we expect the novice chef to have a relatively measured and slow approach to chopping when compared to the expert. In general, the speed at which actions are performed, whether slower or faster than average, should not dictate how they are recognized. We explore the erratic behavior caused by this phenomena on state-of-the-art deep network-based methods for action recognition in terms of maximum performance and stability in recognition accuracy across a range of input video speeds. By observing the trends in these metrics and summarizing them based on expected temporal behaviour w.r.t. variations in input video speeds, we find two distinct types of network architectures. In this paper, we propose a preprocessing method named T-RECS, as a way to extend deep-network-based methods for action recognition to explicitly account for speed variability in the data. We do so by adaptively resampling the inputs to a given model. T-RECS is agnostic to the specific deep-network model; we apply it to four state-of-the-art action recognition architectures, C3D, I3D, TSN, and ConvNet+LSTM. On HMDB51 and UCF101, T-RECS-based I3D models show a peak improvement of at least 2.9% in performance over the baseline while T-RECS-based C3D models achieve a maximum improvement in stability by 59% over the baseline, on the HMDB51 dataset."}}
