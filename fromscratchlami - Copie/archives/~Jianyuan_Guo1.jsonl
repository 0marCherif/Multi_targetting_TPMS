Unfortunately, MIM models typically have huge computational burden and slow learning process, which is an inevitable obstacle for their industrial applications. Although the lower layers play the key role in MIM, existing MIM models conduct reconstruction task only at the top layer of encoder. The lower layers are not explicitly guided and the interaction among their patches is only used for calculating new activations. Considering the reconstruction task requires non-trivial inter-patch interactions to reason target signals, we apply it to multiple local layers including lower and upper layers. Further, since the multiple layers expect to learn the information of different scales, we design local multi-scale reconstruction, where the lower and upper layers reconstruct fine-scale and coarse-scale supervision signals respectively. This design not only accelerates the representation learning process by explicitly guiding multiple layers, but also facilitates multi-scale semantical understanding to the input. Extensive experiments show that with significantly less pre-training burden, our model achieves comparable or better performance on classification, detection and segmentation tasks than existing MIM models."}}

However, there are still gaps in both performance and computational cost between transformers and existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we aim to address this issue and develop a network that can outperform not only the canonical transformers, but also the high-performance convolutional models. We propose a new transformer based hybrid network by taking advantage of transformers to capture long-range dependencies, and of CNNs to extract local information. Furthermore, we scale it to obtain a family of models, called CMTs, obtaining much better trade-off for accuracy and efficiency than previous CNN-based and transformer-based models. In particular, our CMT-S achieves 83.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 14x and 2x smaller on FLOPs than the existing DeiT and EfficientNet, respectively. The proposed CMT-S also generalizes well on CIFAR10 (99.2%), CIFAR100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.7%), and other challenging vision datasets such as COCO (44.3% mAP), with considerably less computational cost.

Unfortunately, the immense inference overhead of most existing vision transformers withholds them from being deployed on edge devices such as cell phones and smart watches. Knowledge distillation is a widely used paradigm for compressing cumbersome architectures into compact students via transferring information. However, most of them are designed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which do not fully investigate the character of vision transformers. In this paper, we fully utilize the patch-level information and propose a fine-grained manifold distillation method for transformer-based networks. Specifically, we train a tiny student model to match a pre-trained teacher model in the patch-level manifold space. Then, we decouple the manifold matching loss into three terms with careful design to further reduce the computational costs for the patch relationship. Equipped with the proposed method, a DeiT-Tiny model containing 5M parameters achieves 76.5\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k, which is +2.0\\% higher than previous distillation approaches. Transfer learning results on other classification benchmarks and downstream vision tasks also demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art algorithms."}}

Compared with convolutional neural networks limited by the relatively small receptive fields, the advantage of transformer for visual tasks is the capacity to perceive long-range dependencies among all image patches, while the deficiency is that the local fine-grained information is not fully excavated. In this paper, we introduce the Coarse-grained and Fine-grained crossing representations to build an efficient Detection Transformer (CFDT). Specifically, we propose a local-global cross fusion module to establish the connection between local fine-grained features and global coarse-grained features. Besides, we propose a coarse-fine aware neck which enables detection tokens to interact with both coarse-grained and fine-grained features. Furthermore, an efficient feature integration module is presented for fusing multi-scale representations from different stages. Experimental results on the COCO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For instance, our CFDT achieves 48.1 AP with 173G FLOPs, which possesses higher accuracy and less computation compared with the state-of-the-art transformer-based detector ViDT.

The convolutional operation can only capture local information in a window region, which prevents  performance from being further improved. Introducing self-attention into convolution can capture global information well, but it will largely encumber the actual speed. In this paper, we propose a hardware-friendly attention mechanism (dubbed DFC attention) and then present a new GhostNetV2 architecture for mobile applications. The proposed DFC attention is constructed based on fully-connected layers, which can not only execute fast on common hardware but also capture the dependence between long-range pixels. We further revisit the expressiveness bottleneck in previous GhostNet and propose to enhance expanded features produced by cheap operations with DFC attention, so that a GhostNetV2 block can aggregate local and long-range information simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GhostNetV2 over existing architectures. For example, it achieves 75.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 167M FLOPs, significantly suppressing GhostNetV1 (74.5%) with a similar computational cost.

The widely-used convolutional neural network and transformer treat the image as a grid or sequence structure, which is not flexible to capture irregular and complex objects. In this paper, we propose to represent the image as a graph structure and introduce a new \\emph{Vision GNN} (ViG) architecture to extract graph-level feature for visual tasks. We first split the image to a number of patches which are viewed as nodes, and construct a graph by connecting the nearest neighbors. Based on the graph representation of images, we build our ViG model to transform and exchange information among all the nodes. ViG consists of two basic modules: Grapher module with graph convolution for aggregating and updating graph information, and FFN module with two linear layers for node feature transformation. Both isotropic and pyramid architectures of ViG are built with different model sizes. Extensive experiments on image recognition and object detection tasks demonstrate the superiority of our ViG architecture.

Basically, the visual transformers first divide the input images into several local patches and then calculate both representations and their relationship. Since natural images are of high complexity with abundant detail and color information, the granularity of the patch dividing is not fine enough for excavating features of objects in different scales and locations. In this paper, we point out that the attention inside these local patches are also essential for building visual transformers with high performance and we explore a new architecture, namely, Transformer iN Transformer (TNT). Specifically, we regard the local patches (\\eg, 16$\\times$16) as \u201cvisual sentences\u201d and present to further divide them into smaller patches (\\eg, 4$\\times$4) as \u201cvisual words\u201d.

Features of both words and sentences will be aggregated to enhance the representation ability.

The redundancy in feature maps is an important characteristic of those successful CNNs, but has rarely been investigated in neural architecture design. This paper proposes a novel Ghost module to generate more feature maps from cheap operations. Based on a set of intrinsic feature maps, we apply a series of linear transformations with cheap cost to generate many ghost feature maps that could fully reveal information underlying intrinsic features. The proposed Ghost module can be taken as a plug-and-play component to upgrade existing convolutional neural networks. Ghost bottlenecks are designed to stack Ghost modules, and then the lightweight GhostNet can be easily established. Experiments conducted on benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Ghost module is an impressive alternative of convolution layers in baseline models, and our GhostNet can achieve higher recognition performance (e.g. 75.7% top-1 accuracy) than MobileNetV3 with similar computational cost on the ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 classification dataset."}}
