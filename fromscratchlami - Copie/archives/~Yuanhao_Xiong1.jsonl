However, the XMC setup faces two challenges: (1) it is not generalizable to predict unseen labels in dynamic environments, and (2) it requires a large amount of supervised (instance, label) pairs, which can be difficult to obtain for emerging domains. In this paper, we consider a more practical scenario called Extreme Zero-Shot XMC (EZ-XMC), in which no supervision is needed and merely raw text of instances and labels are accessible. Few-Shot XMC (FS-XMC), an extension to EZ-XMC with limited supervision is also investigated. To learn the semantic embeddings of instances and labels with raw text, we propose to pre-train Transformer-based en- coders with self-supervised contrastive losses. Specifically, we develop a pre-training method MACLR, which thoroughly leverages the raw text with techniques including Multi-scale Adaptive Clustering, Label Regularization, and self-training with pseudo positive pairs. Experimental results on four public EZ-XMC datasets demonstrate that MACLR achieves superior performance compared to all other leading baseline methods, in particular with approximately 5-10% improvement in precision and recall on average. Moreover, we show that our pre-trained encoder can be further improved on FS-XMC when there are a limited number of ground-truth positive pairs in training.

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective video-language pre-training framework, namely G-ViLM, to learn discriminative spatiotemporal features. Two novel designs involving spatiotemporal grounding and temporal grouping promote learning local region-noun alignment and temporal-aware features simultaneously. Specifically, spatiotemporal grounding aggregates semantically similar video tokens and aligns them with noun phrases extracted from the caption to promote local region-noun correspondences. Moreover, temporal grouping leverages cut-and-paste to manually create temporal scene changes and then learns distinguishable features from different scenes. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that G-ViLM performs favorably against existing approaches on four representative downstream tasks, covering text-video retrieval, video question answering, video action recognition and temporal action localization. G-ViLM performs competitively on all evaluated tasks and in particular achieves R@10 of 65.1 on zero-shot MSR-VTT retrieval, over 9% higher than the state-of-the-art method."}}

In this setting, one simple yet effective method is to transfer the obtained adversarial examples from attacking surrogate models to fool the target model. Previous works have studied what kind of attacks to the surrogate model can generate more transferable adversarial examples, but their performances are still limited due to the mismatches between surrogate models and the target model. In this paper, we tackle this problem from a novel angle---instead of using the original surrogate models, can we obtain a Meta-Surrogate Model (MSM) such that attacks to this model can be easily transferred to other models? We show that this goal can be mathematically formulated as a bi-level optimization problem and design a differentiable attacker to make training feasible. Given one or a set of surrogate models, our method can thus obtain an MSM such that adversarial examples generated on MSM enjoy eximious transferability. Comprehensive experiments on Cifar-10 and ImageNet demonstrate that by attacking the MSM, we can obtain stronger transferable adversarial examples to deceive black-box models including adversarially trained ones, with much higher success rates than existing methods."}}

Existing iterative model averaging based FL algorithms require a large number of communication rounds to obtain a well-performed model due to extremely unbalanced and non-i.i.d data partitioning among different clients. Thus, we propose FedDM to build the global training objective from multiple local surrogate functions, which enables the server to gain a more global view of the loss landscape. In detail, we construct synthetic sets of data on each client to locally match the loss landscape from original data through distribution matching. FedDM reduces communication rounds and improves model quality by transmitting more informative and smaller synthesized data compared with unwieldy model weights. We conduct extensive experiments on three image classification datasets, and results show that our method can outperform other FL counterparts in terms of efficiency and model performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that FedDM can be adapted to preserve differential privacy with Gaussian mechanism and train a better model under the same privacy budget."}}

Learning rate scheduling is one of the most important factors that influence the performance of stochastic optimizers like Adam. Traditional methods seek to find a relatively proper scheduling among a limited number of pre-defined rules and might not accommodate a particular target problem. Instead, we propose a novel Graph-Network-based Scheduler (GNS), aiming at learning a specific scheduling mechanism without restrictions to existing principles. By constructing a directed graph for the underlying neural network of the target problem, GNS encodes current dynamics with a graph message passing network and trains an agent to control the learning rate accordingly via reinforcement learning. The proposed scheduler can capture the intermediate layer information while being able to generalize to problems of varying scales. Besides, an efficient reward collection procedure is leveraged to speed up training. We evaluate our framework on benchmarking datasets, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10 for image classification, and GLUE for language understanding. GNS shows consistent improvement over popular baselines when training CNN and Transformer models. Moreover, GNS demonstrates great generalization to different datasets and network structures."}}

Motivated by the stability property that should be satisfied by an ideal optimizer, we propose a regularization term that can enforce the smoothness and stability of the learned optimizers. Comprehensive experiments on the neural network training tasks demonstrate that the proposed regularization consistently improve the learned neural optimizers even when transferring to tasks with different architectures and datasets. Furthermore, we show that our smoothness-inducing regularizer can improve the performance of neural optimizers on few-shot learning tasks.
