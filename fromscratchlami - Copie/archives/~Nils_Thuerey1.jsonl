However, achieving stability when generalizing to longer rollout horizons remains a persistent challenge for learned PDE solvers. We address this challenge by introducing a fully data-driven fluid solver that utilizes an autoregressive rollout based on conditional diffusion models. We show that this approach offers clear advantages in terms of rollout stability compared to other learned baselines. Remarkably, these improvements in stability are achieved without compromising the quality of generated samples, and our model successfully generalizes to flow parameters beyond the training regime. Additionally, the probabilistic nature of the diffusion approach allows for inferring predictions that align with the statistics of the underlying physics. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the performance of our method on a range of challenging scenarios, including incompressible and transonic flows, as well as isotropic turbulence."}}

Despite the complexity of this task, we show that it is possible to train the corresponding networks without requiring any 3D ground truth for training. In the absence of ground truth data we can train our model with observations from real-world capture setups instead of relying on synthetic reconstructions. We make this unsupervised training approach possible by first generating an initial prototype volume which is then moved and transported over time without the need for volumetric supervision. Our approach relies purely on image-based losses, an adversarial discriminator network, and regularization. Our method can estimate long-term sequences in a stable manner, while achieving closely matching targets for inputs such as rising smoke plumes."}}

We propose a similarity model based on entropy, which allows for the creation of physically meaningful ground truth distances for the similarity assessment of scalar and vectorial data, produced from transport and motion-based simulations. Utilizing two data acquisition methods derived from this model, we create collections of fields from numerical PDE solvers and existing simulation data repositories. Furthermore, a multiscale CNN architecture that computes a volumetric similarity metric (VolSiM) is proposed. To the best of our knowledge this is the first learning method inherently designed to address the challenges arising for the similarity assessment of high-dimensional simulation data. Additionally, the tradeoff between a large batch size and an accurate correlation computation for correlation-based loss functions is investigated, and the metric's invariance with respect to rotation and scale operations is analyzed. Finally, the robustness and generalization of VolSiM is evaluated on a large range of test data, as well as a particularly challenging turbulence case study, that is close to potential real-world applications."}}

Authoring even two body collisions in real world can be difficult as one has to get timing and the object trajectories to be correctly synchronized. After trial-and-error iterations, when objects can actually be made to collide, then they are difficult to acquire in 3D. In contrast, synthetically generating plausible collisions is difficult as it requires adjusting different collision parameters (e.g., object mass ratio, coefficient of restitution, etc.) and appropriate initial parameters. We present SMASH to directly `read off' appropriate collision parameters simply based on input video recordings. Specifically, we describe how to use laws of rigid body collision to regularize the problem of lifting 2D annotated poses to 3D reconstruction of collision sequences. The reconstructed sequences can then be modified and combined to easily author novel and plausible collision sequences. We demonstrate the system on various complex collision sequences."}}

Purely data-driven approaches, which only make use of an artificial neural network and data, often fail to accurately simulate the evolution of the system dynamics over a sufficiently long time and in a physically consistent manner. Therefore, we propose a hybrid approach that uses a neural network model in combination with an incomplete PDE solver that provides known but incomplete physical information. In this study, we demonstrate that the results obtained from the incomplete PDEs can be efficiently corrected at every time step by the proposed hybrid neural network \u2013 PDE solver model, so that the effect of the unknown physics present in the system is correctly accounted for. For validation purposes, the obtained simulations of the hybrid model are successfully compared against results coming from the complete set of PDEs describing the full physics of the considered system. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach on a reactive flow, an archetypal multi-physics system that combines fluid mechanics and chemistry, the latter being the physics considered unknown. Experiments are made on planar and Bunsen-type flames at various operating conditions. The hybrid neural network - PDE approach correctly models the flame evolution of the cases under study for significantly long time windows, yields improved generalization, and allows for larger simulation time steps.
