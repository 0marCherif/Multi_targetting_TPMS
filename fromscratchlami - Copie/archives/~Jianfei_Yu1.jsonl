Entity-Level Sentiment Analysis (ELSA) is an important fine-grained SA task, aiming to identify the sentiment over each entity mentioned in a sentence. Most previous methods to this task primarily rely on the text, but ignoring the other useful multimodal data sources (e.g., images). Therefore, in this paper, we aim to explore the usefulness of associated images for ELSA in multimodal tweets (especially political tweets). Specifically, we propose an Entity-Aware Multimodal Network (EAMN), and apply it to political tweets for understanding public opinions towards some politicians. Experiment results show that the associated images are generally useful for ELSA, and our EAMN model achieves the state-of-the-art results on two public Twitter datasets and our political Twitter datasets."}}

Most existing approaches to this task primarily rely on the textual content, but fail to consider the other important data sources (e.g., images, videos, and user profiles), which can potentially enhance these text-based approaches. Motivated by the observation, we study entity-level multimodal sentiment classification in this article, and aim to explore the usefulness of images for entity-level sentiment detection in social media posts. Specifically, we propose an Entity-Sensitive Attention and Fusion Network (ESAFN) for this task. First, to capture the intra-modality dynamics, ESAFN leverages an effective attention mechanism to generate entity-sensitive textual representations, followed by aggregating them with a textual fusion layer. Next, ESAFN learns the entity-sensitive visual representation with an entity-oriented visual attention mechanism, followed by a gated mechanism to eliminate the noisy visual context. Moreover, to capture the inter-modality dynamics, ESAFN further fuses the textual and visual representations with a bilinear interaction layer. To evaluate the effectiveness of ESAFN, we manually annotate the sentiment orientation over each given entity based on two recently released multimodal NER datasets, and show that ESAFN can significantly outperform several highly competitive unimodal and multimodal methods."}}

Existing approaches for the ERC task mainly suffer from two drawbacks: (1) failing to pay enough attention to the emotional impact of the local context; (2) ignoring the effect of the emotional inertia of speakers. To tackle these limitations, we first propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Transformer as our base model, followed by carefully designing a localness-aware attention mechanism and a speaker-aware attention mechanism to respectively capture the impact of the local context and the emotional inertia. Extensive evaluations on a benchmark dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over existing multimodal methods for ERC."}}
