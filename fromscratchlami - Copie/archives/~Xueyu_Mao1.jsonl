Traditionally FM models are trained in batch mode, which entails training the model with large datasets every few hours or days. Such training procedure cannot capture the trends evolving in real time with large volume of streaming data. In this paper, we propose an online training scheme for FM with the alternating least squares (ALS) technique, which has comparable performance with existing batch training algorithms. We incorporate an online update mechanism to the model parameters at the cost of storing a small cache. The mechanism also stabilizes the training error more than a traditional online training technique like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as data points come in, which is crucial for real-time applications. Experiments on large scale datasets validate the efficiency and robustness of our method."}}

Many existing overlapping clustering methods model each person (or word, or book) as a non-negative weighted combination of \"exemplars\" who belong solely to one community, with some small noise. Geometrically, each person is a point on a cone whose corners are these exemplars. This basic form encompasses the widely used Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodel of networks and its degree-corrected variants, as well as topic models such as LDA. We show that a simple one-class SVM yields provably consistent parameter inference for all such models, and scales to large datasets. Experimental results on several simulated and real datasets show our algorithm (called SVM-cone) is both accurate and scalable."}}

Existing provably consistent algorithms often require strong assumptions about the population, are computationally expensive, and only provide an overall error bound for the whole community membership matrix. This paper provides uniform rates of convergence for the inferred community membership vector of each node in a network generated from the Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodel (MMSB); to our knowledge, this is the first work to establish per-node rates for overlapping community detection in networks. We achieve this by establishing sharp row-wise eigenvector deviation bounds for MMSB. Based on the simplex structure inherent in the eigen-decomposition of the population matrix, we build on established corner-finding algorithms from the optimization community to infer the community membership vectors. Our results hold over a broad parameter regime where the average degree only grows poly-logarithmically with the number of nodes. Using experiments with simulated and real datasets, we show that our method achieves better error with lower variability over competing methods, and processes real world networks of up to 100,000 nodes within tens of seconds."}}
