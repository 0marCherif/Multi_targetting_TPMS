Nonetheless, Convolutional Neural Networks are often biased towards either texture or shape, depending on the training dataset. Our ablation shows that such bias degenerates model performance. Motivated by this observation, we develop a simple algorithm for shape-texture debiased learning. To prevent models from exclusively attending on a single cue in representation learning, we augment training data with images with conflicting shape and texture information (eg, an image of chimpanzee shape but with lemon texture) and, most importantly, provide the corresponding supervisions from shape and texture simultaneously. \n\nExperiments show that our method successfully improves model performance on several image recognition benchmarks and adversarial robustness. For example, by training on ImageNet, it helps ResNet-152 achieve substantial improvements on ImageNet (+1.2%), ImageNet-A  (+5.2%), ImageNet-C (+8.3%) and Stylized-ImageNet (+11.1%), and on defending against FGSM adversarial attacker on ImageNet (+14.4%). Our method also claims to be compatible with other advanced data augmentation strategies, eg, Mixup, and CutMix.

However, it is non-trivial to train object detectors on unlabeled data due to the unavailability of ground truth labels. To address this problem, we present a proposal learning approach to learn proposal features and predictions from both labeled and unlabeled data. The approach consists of a self-supervised proposal learning module and a consistency-based proposal learning module. In the self-supervised proposal learning module, we present a proposal location loss and a contrastive loss to learn context-aware and noise-robust proposal features respectively. In the consistency-based proposal learning module, we apply consistency losses to both bounding box classification and regression predictions of proposals to learn noise-robust proposal features and predictions. Experiments are conducted on the COCO dataset with all available labeled and unlabeled data. Results show that our approach consistently improves the accuracies of fully-supervised baselines. In particular, after combining with data distillation, our approach improves AP by about 2.0% and 0.9% on average compared with fully-supervised baselines and data distillation baselines respectively."}}

However, it remains unknown whether object recognition models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can handle real-world occlusion. It is also a question whether efforts to make these models robust to constant mask occlusion are effective for real-world occlusion. We test both humans and the above-mentioned computational models in a challenging task of object recognition under extreme occlusion, where target objects are heavily occluded by irrelevant real objects in real backgrounds. Our results show that human vision is very robust to extreme occlusion while CNNs are not, even with modifications to handle constant mask occlusion. This implies that the ability to handle constant mask occlusion does not entail robustness to real-world occlusion. As a comparison, we propose another computational model that utilizes object parts/subparts in a compositional manner to build robustness to occlusion. This performs significantly better than CNN-based models on our task with error patterns similar to humans. These findings suggest that testing under extreme occlusion can better reveal the robustness of visual recognition, and that the principle of composition can encourage such robustness."}}

Many existing methods usually require fine-grained supervisions (e.g., bounding-box annotations) to learn patch features, which requires a great effort to label images may limit their potential applications. In this paper, we propose to learn patch features via weak supervisions, i.e., only image-level supervisions. To achieve this goal, we treat images as bags and patches as instances to integrate the weakly supervised multiple instance learning constraints into deep neural networks. Also, our method integrates the traditional multiple stages of weakly supervised object classification and discovery into a unified deep convolutional neural network and optimizes the network in an end-to-end way. The network processes the two tasks object classification and discovery jointly, and shares hierarchical deep features. Through this jointly learning strategy, weakly supervised object classification and discovery are beneficial to each other. We test the proposed method on the challenging PASCAL VOC datasets. The results show that our method can obtain state-of-the-art performance on object classification, and very competitive results on object discovery, with faster testing speed than competitors."}}

An effective way to address this problem is to exploit temporal contexts by linking the same object across video to form tubelets and aggregating classification scores in the tubelets. In this paper, we focus on obtaining high quality object linking results for better classification. Unlike previous methods that link objects by checking boxes between neighboring frames, we propose to link in the same frame. To achieve this goal, we extend prior methods in following aspects: (1) a cuboid proposal network that extracts spatio-temporal candidate cuboids which bound the movement of objects; (2) a short tubelet detection network that detects short tubelets in short video segments; (3) a short tubelet linking algorithm that links temporally-overlapping short tubelets to form long tubelets. Experiments on the ImageNet VID dataset show that our method outperforms both the static image detector and the previous state of the art. In particular, our method improves results by 8.8% over the static image detector for fast moving objects."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel deep network for WSOD. Unlike previous networks that transfer the object detection problem to an image classification problem using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), our strategy generates proposal clusters to learn refined instance classifiers by an iterative process. The proposals in the same cluster are spatially adjacent and associated with the same object. This prevents the network from concentrating too much on parts of objects instead of whole objects. We first show that instances can be assigned object or background labels directly based on proposal clusters for instance classifier refinement, and then show that treating each cluster as a small new bag yields fewer ambiguities than the directly assigning label method. The iterative instance classifier refinement is implemented online using multiple streams in convolutional neural networks, where the first is an MIL network and the others are for instance classifier refinement supervised by the preceding one. Experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC, ImageNet detection, and MS-COCO benchmarks for WSOD. Results show that our method outperforms the previous state of the art significantly."}}

In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised region proposal network which is trained using only image-level annotations. The weakly supervised region proposal network consists of two stages. The first stage evaluates the objectness scores of sliding window boxes by exploiting the low-level information in CNN and the second stage refines the proposals from the first stage using a region-based CNN classifier. Our proposed region proposal network is suitable for WSOD, can be plugged into a WSOD network easily, and can share its convolutional computations with the WSOD network. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC and ImageNet detection datasets show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance for WSOD with performance gain of about $$3\\%$$ on average."}}

Based on deep learning, weakly supervised detectors have achieved many promising results. However, compared with fully supervised detection, it is more challenging to train deep network based detectors in a weakly supervised manner. Here we formulate weakly supervised detection as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where instance classifiers (object detectors) are put into the network as hidden nodes. We propose a novel online instance classifier refinement algorithm to integrate MIL and the instance classifier refinement procedure into a single deep network, and train the network end-to-end with only image-level supervision, i.e., without object location information. More precisely, instance labels inferred from weak supervision are propagated to their spatially overlapped instances to refine instance classifier online. The iterative instance classifier refinement procedure is implemented using multiple streams in deep network, where each stream supervises its latter stream. Weakly supervised object detection experiments are carried out on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 benchmarks. We obtain 47% mAP on VOC 2007 that significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art."}}
