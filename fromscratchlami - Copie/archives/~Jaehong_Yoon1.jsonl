However, deploying LVLMs is often problematic due to their massive computational/energy costs and carbon consumption. Such issues make it infeasible to adopt conventional iterative global pruning, which is costly due to computing the Hessian matrix of the entire large model for sparsification. Alternatively, several studies have recently proposed layer-wise pruning approaches to avoid the expensive computation of global pruning and efficiently compress model weights according to their importance within a layer. However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal model compression due to their lack of a global perspective. To address this limitation in recent efficient pruning methods for large models, we propose Efficient Coarse-to-Fine Layer-Wise Pruning (ECoFLaP), a two-stage coarse-to-fine weight pruning approach for LVLMs. We first determine the sparsity ratios of different layers or blocks by leveraging the global importance score, which is efficiently computed based on the zeroth-order approximation of the global model gradients. Then, the multimodal model performs local layer-wise unstructured weight pruning based on globally-informed sparsity ratios. We validate our proposed method across various multimodal and unimodal models and datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over prevalent pruning techniques in the high-sparsity regime."}}

While recent token-based approaches achieve competitive performance to diffusion-based models, their generation performance is still suboptimal as they sample multiple tokens simultaneously without considering the dependence among them. We empirically investigate this problem and propose a learnable sampling model, Text-Conditioned Token Selection (TCTS), to select optimal tokens via localized supervision with text information. TCTS improves not only the image quality but also the semantic alignment of the generated images with the given texts. To further improve the image quality, we introduce a cohesive sampling strategy, Frequency Adaptive Sampling (FAS), to each group of tokens divided according to the self-attention maps. We validate the efficacy of TCTS combined with FAS with various generative tasks, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms the baselines in image-text alignment and image quality. Our text-conditioned sampling framework further reduces the original inference time by more than 50% without modifying the original generative model."}}

WSN and SoftNet jointly learn the regularized model weights and task-adaptive non-binary masks of subnetworks associated with each task whilst attempting to select a small set of weights to be activated (winning ticket) by reusing weights of the prior subnetworks. Our proposed WSN and SoftNet are inherently immune to catastrophic forgetting as each selected subnetwork model does not infringe upon other subnetworks in Task Incremental Learning (TIL). In TIL, binary masks spawned per winning ticket are encoded into one N-bit binary digit mask, then compressed using Huffman coding for a sub-linear increase in network capacity to the number of tasks. Surprisingly, in the inference step, SoftNet generated by injecting small noises to the backgrounds of acquired WSN (holding the foregrounds of WSN) provides excellent forward transfer power for future tasks in TIL. SoftNet shows its effectiveness over WSN in regularizing parameters to tackle the overfitting, to a few examples in Few-shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL)."}}

Our objective is to learn a sequence of sessions incrementally, where each session only includes a few training instances per class while preserving the knowledge of the previously learned ones. SoftNet jointly learns the model weights and adaptive non-binary soft masks at a base training session in which each mask consists of the major and minor subnetwork; the former aims to minimize catastrophic forgetting during training, and the latter aims to avoid overfitting to a few samples in each new training session. We provide comprehensive empirical validations demonstrating that our SoftNet effectively tackles the few-shot incremental learning problem by surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art baselines over benchmark datasets."}}

This paper proposes a novel Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) method that can effectively alleviate performance degeneration even with extreme quantization by focusing on the inter-weight dependencies, between the weights within each layer and across consecutive layers. To minimize the quantization impact of each weight on others, we perform an orthonormal transformation of the weights at each layer by training an input-dependent correlation matrix and importance vector, such that each weight is disentangled from the others. Then, we quantize the weights based on their importance to minimize the loss of the information from the original weights/activations. We further perform progressive layer-wise quantization from the bottom layer to the top, so that quantization at each layer reflects the quantized distributions of weights and activations at previous layers. We validate the effectiveness of our method on various benchmark datasets against strong neural quantization baselines, demonstrating that it alleviates the performance degeneration on ImageNet and successfully preserves the full-precision model performance on CIFAR-100 with compact backbone networks."}}

However, most recent works on continual learning focuses on alleviating catastrophic forgetting of a model trained over a sequence of vision tasks, considering only the performance on the tasks themselves rather than the representation transferability.\nIn this paper, we tackle a novel problem of Continual Pre-training, which aims to increment the generalization of model representations, encouraging positive transfer for future problems. An initial empirical study shows a rather surprising finding that the transfer quality of the pre-trained model representation with both supervised and unsupervised task sequences does not show noticeable performance degradation even with full-finetuning.\nFurthermore, we propose a simple yet efficient Continual Pre-training method with GLobal Attention Discretization (GLAD) which introduces a new constraint to increment the global transferability of the backbone while projecting model weights to adapt to target problems via additional weight vectors. Our continual pretraining method breaks the barriers between pre-training and fine-tuning steps and leads to an integrated design that combines continual representation learning with continual learning of the task-specific learners."}}
