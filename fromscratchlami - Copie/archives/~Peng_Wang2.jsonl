Yet, it has received little attention compared to its daytime counterpart. In this paper, we propose NightLab, a novel nighttime segmentation framework that leverages multiple deep learning models imbued with night-aware features to yield State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on multiple night segmentation benchmarks. Notably, NightLab contains models at two levels of granularity, i.e. image and regional, and each level is composed of light adaptation and segmentation modules. Given a nighttime image, the image level model provides an initial segmentation estimate while, in parallel, a hardness detection module identifies regions and their surrounding context that need further analysis. A regional level model focuses on these difficult regions to provide a significantly improved segmentation. All the models in NightLab are trained end-to-end using a set of proposed night-aware losses without handcrafted heuristics. Extensive experiments on the NightCity and BDD100K datasets show NightLab achieves SoTA performance compared to concurrent methods.

Yet, in KD, automatically searching an optimal distillation scheme has not yet been well explored. In this paper, we propose DistPro, a novel framework which searches for an optimal KD process via differentiable meta-learning. Specifically, given a pair of student and teacher networks, DistPro first sets up a rich set of KD connection from the transmitting layers of the teacher to the receiving layers of the student, and in the meanwhile, various transforms are also proposed for comparing feature maps along its pathway for the distillation. Then, each combination of a connection and a transform choice (pathway) is associated with a stochastic weighting process which indicates its importance at every step during the distillation. In the searching stage, the process can be effectively learned through our proposed bi-level meta-optimization strategy. In the distillation stage, DistPro adopts the learned processes for knowledge distillation, which significantly improves the student accuracy especially when faster training is required. Lastly, we find the learned processes can be generalized between similar tasks and networks. In our experiments, DistPro produces state-of-the-art (SoTA) accuracy under varying number of learning epochs on popular datasets, i.e. CIFAR100 and ImageNet, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework."}}

An important task is to estimate 3D properties(e.g.translation, rotation and shape) of a moving or parked vehicle on the road. This task, while critical, is still under-researched in the computer vision community - partially owing to the lack of large scale and fully-annotated 3D car database suitable for autonomous driving research. In this paper, we contribute the first large-scale database suitable for 3D car instance understanding - ApolloCar3D. The dataset contains 5,277 driving images and over 60K car instances, where each car is fitted with an industry-grade 3D CAD model with absolute model size and semantically labelled keypoints. This dataset is above 20 times larger than PASCAL3D+ and KITTI, the current state-of-the-art. To enable efficient labelling in 3D, we build a pipeline by considering 2D-3D keypoint correspondences for a single instance and 3D relationship among multiple instances. Equipped with such dataset, we build various baseline algorithms with the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we first segment each car with a pre-trained Mask R-CNN, and then regress towards its 3D pose and shape based on a deformable 3D car model with or without using semantic keypoints. We show that using keypoints significantly improves fitting performance. Finally, we develop a new 3D metric jointly considering 3D pose and 3D shape, allowing for comprehensive evaluation and ablation study. By comparing with human performance we suggest several future directions for further improvements."}}

Current state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods treat the two tasks independently. One typical assumption of the existing depth estimation methods is that the scenes contain no independent moving objects. while object moving could be easily modeled using optical flow. In this paper, we propose to address the two tasks as a whole, i.e., to jointly understand per-pixel 3D geometry and motion. This eliminates the need of static scene assumption and enforces the inherent geometrical consistency during the learning process, yielding significantly improved results for both tasks. We call our method as \u201cEvery Pixel Counts++\u201d or \u201cEPC++\u201d. Specifically, during training, given two consecutive frames from a video, we adopt three parallel networks to predict the camera motion (MotionNet), dense depth map (DepthNet), and per-pixel optical flow between two frames (OptFlowNet) respectively. The three types of information, are fed into a holistic 3D motion parser (HMP), and per-pixel 3D motion of both rigid background and moving objects are disentangled and recovered. Various loss terms are formulated to jointly supervise the three networks. An effective adaptive training strategy is proposed to achieve better performance and more efficient convergence. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on datasets with different scenes, including driving scenario (KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 datasets), mixed outdoor/indoor scenes (Make3D) and synthetic animation (MPI Sintel dataset). Performance on the five tasks of depth estimation, optical flow estimation, odometry, moving object segmentation and scene flow estimation shows that our approach outperforms other SoTA methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of each module of our proposed method.

However, corresponding 360{\\deg} depth sensors, which are also critical for the perception system, are still difficult or expensive to have. In this paper, we propose a low-cost 3D sensing system that combines an omnidirectional camera with a calibrated projective depth camera, where the depth from the limited FoV can be automatically extended to the rest of the recorded omnidirectional image. To accurately recover the missing depths, we design an omnidirectional depth extension convolutional neural network(ODE-CNN), in which a spherical feature transform layer(SFTL) is embedded at the end of feature encoding layers, and a deformable convolutional spatial propagation network(D-CSPN) is appended at the end of feature decoding layers. The former resamples the neighborhood of each pixel in the omnidirectional coordination to the projective coordination, which reduces the difficulty of feature learning, and the later automatically finds a proper context to well align the structures in the estimated depths via CNN w.r.t. the reference image, which significantly improves the visual quality. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed ODE-CNN over the popular 360D dataset and show that ODE-CNN significantly outperforms (relatively 33% reduction in-depth error) other state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods."}}

For example, only by understanding many possible part dynamics of other vehicles (e.g., door or trunk opening, taillight blinking for changing lane), a self-driving vehicle can be success in dealing with emergency cases. However, existing visual models tackle rarely on these situations, but focus on bounding box detection. In this paper, we fill this important missing piece in autonomous driving by solving two critical issues. First, for dealing with data scarcity, we propose an effective training data generation process by fitting a 3D car model with dynamic parts to cars in real images. This allows us to directly edit the real images using the aligned 3D parts, yielding effective training data for learning robust deep neural networks (DNNs). Secondly, to benchmark the quality of 3D part understanding, we collected a large dataset in real driving scenario with cars in uncommon states (CUS), i.e. with door or trunk opened etc., which demonstrates that our trained network with edited images largely outperforms other baselines in terms of 2D detection and instance segmentation accuracy."}}

To deal with shadows, we build up an autonomous driving shadow dataset and design a deep neural network to detect shadows automatically. To deal with large ego-motion, we take advantage of the multi-source data, in particular the 3D data, in autonomous driving. More specifically, the geometric relationship between frames is incorporated into an inpainting deep neural network to produce high-quality structurally consistent video output.
