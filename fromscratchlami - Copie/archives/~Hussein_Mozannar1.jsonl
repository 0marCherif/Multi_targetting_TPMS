Yet fairness considerations (e.g. affirmative action) have often\nthe implicit goal of achieving balance among groups within the population. The most basic\nnotion of balance is eventual equality between the qualifications of the groups. How can we\nincorporate influence dynamics in decision making? How well do dynamics-oblivious fairness\npolicies fare in terms of reaching equality? In this paper, we propose a simple yet revealing model\nthat encompasses (1) a selection process where an institution chooses from multiple groups\naccording to their qualifications so as to maximize an institutional utility and (2) dynamics that\ngovern the evolution of the groups\u2019 qualifications according to the imposed policies. We focus\non demographic parity as the formalism of affirmative action.\nWe then give conditions under which an unconstrained policy reaches equality on its own. In\nthis case, surprisingly, imposing demographic parity may break equality. When it doesn\u2019t, one\nwould expect the additional constraint to reduce utility, however, we show that utility may in\nfact increase. In more realistic scenarios, unconstrained policies do not lead to equality. In such\ncases, we show that although imposing demographic parity may remedy it, there is a danger\nthat groups settle at a worse set of qualifications. As a silver lining, we also identify when\nthe constraint not only leads to equality, but also improves all groups. This gives quantifiable\ninsight into both sides of the mismatch hypothesis. These cases and trade-offs are instrumental in\ndetermining when and how imposing demographic parity can be beneficial in selection processes,\nboth for the institution and for society on the long run."}}

This constrains the answer of any question to be a span of text in Wikipedia. Open domain QA for Arabic entails three challenges: annotated QA datasets in Arabic, large scale efficient information retrieval and machine reading comprehension. To deal with the lack of Arabic QA datasets we present the Arabic Reading Comprehension Dataset (ARCD) composed of 1,395 questions posed by crowdworkers on Wikipedia articles, and a machine translation of the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (Arabic-SQuAD). Our system for open domain question answering in Arabic (SOQAL) is based on two components: (1) a document retriever using a hierarchical TF-IDF approach and (2) a neural reading comprehension model using the pre-trained bi-directional transformer BERT. Our experiments on ARCD indicate the effectiveness of our approach with our BERT-based reader achieving a 61.3 F1 score, and our open domain system SOQAL achieving a 27.6 F1 score."}}
