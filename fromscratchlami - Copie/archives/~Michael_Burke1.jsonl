The proposed model uses recursive latent state estimation with learned transformer-based functions to effectively update and evolve the state. This enables highly efficient real-time inference on embedded systems, as profiled on an Nvidia Xavier AGX. Our model, MotionPerceiver, achieves this by encoding a scene into a latent state that evolves in time through self-attention mechanisms. Additionally, it incorporates relevant scene observations, such as traffic signals, road topology and agent detections, through cross-attention mechanisms. This forms an efficient data-streaming architecture, that contrasts with the expensive, fixed-sequence input common in existing models. The architecture also offers the distinct advantage of generating occupancy predictions through localized querying based on a point-of-interest, as opposed to generating fixed-size occupancy images that render potentially irrelevant regions."}}

While many studies are focused on measuring in situ forces, little attention has been devoted to relating these observed forces to surgical techniques. Answering questions like \"Can certain changes to a surgical technique result in lower forces and increased safety margins?\" could lead to improved surgical practice, and importantly, patient outcomes. However, such studies would require a large number of trials and professional surgeons, which is generally impractical to arrange. Instead, we show how robots can learn several variations of a surgical technique from a smaller number of surgical demonstrations and interpolate learnt behaviour via a parameterised skill model. This enables a large number of trials to be performed by a robotic system and the analysis of surgical techniques and their downstream effects on tissue. Here, we introduce a parameterised model of the elliptical excision skill and apply a Bayesian optimisation scheme to optimise the excision behaviour with respect to expert ratings, as well as individual characteristics of excision forces. Results show that the proposed framework can successfully align the generated robot behaviour with subjects across varying levels of proficiency in terms of excision forces."}}

However, due to high inter-operator variability, resulting images highly depend on operators' experience. In this work, an intelligent robotic sonographer is proposed to autonomously \"explore\" target anatomies and navigate a US probe to a relevant 2D plane by learning from expert. The underlying high-level physiological knowledge from experts is inferred by a neural reward function, using a ranked pairwise image comparisons approach in a self-supervised fashion. This process can be referred to as understanding the \"language of sonography\". Considering the generalization capability to overcome inter-patient variations, mutual information is estimated by a network to explicitly extract the task-related and domain features in latent space. Besides, a Gaussian distribution-based filter is developed to automatically evaluate and take the quality of the expert's demonstrations into account. The robotic localization is carried out in coarse-to-fine mode based on the predicted reward associated to B-mode images. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, representative experiments for the \"line\" target and \"point\" target are performed on vascular phantom and two ex-vivo animal organ phantoms (chicken heart and lamb kidney), respectively. The results demonstrated that the proposed advanced framework can robustly work on different kinds of known and unseen phantoms."}}

Social cues are a form of communication (i.e., information flow) between people. In this paper, a framework is introduced to detect and analyse a class of perceptible social cues that are nonverbal and episodic, and the related information transfer using an information-theoretic measure, namely, transfer entropy. We use a group-joining setting to demonstrate the practicality of transfer entropy for analysing communications between humans. Then we demonstrate the framework in two settings involving social interactions between humans: object-handover and person-following. Our results show that transfer entropy can identify information flows between agents and when and where they occur. Potential applications of the framework include information flow or social cue analysis for interactive robot design and socially-aware robot planning."}}

This work considers the inverse problem, where the goal of the task is unknown, and a reward function needs to be inferred from exploratory example demonstrations provided by a demonstrator, for use in a downstream informative path-planning policy. Unfortunately, many existing reward inference strategies are unsuited to this class of problems, due to the exploratory nature of the demonstrations. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to cope with the class of problems where these sub-optimal, exploratory demonstrations occur. We hypothesise that, in tasks which require discovery, successive states of any demonstration are progressively more likely to be associated with a higher reward, and use this hypothesis to generate time-based binary comparison outcomes and infer reward functions that support these ranks, under a probabilistic generative model. We formalise this probabilistic temporal ranking approach and show that it improves upon existing approaches to perform reward inference for autonomous ultrasound scanning, a novel application of learning from demonstration in medical imaging while also being of value across a broad range of goal-oriented learning from demonstration tasks."}}

From a robotics perspective, there has been growing interest in object and scene-based localisation using NeRFs, with a number of recent works relying on sampling-based or Monte-Carlo localisation schemes. Unfortunately, these can be extremely computationally expensive, requiring multiple network forward passes to infer camera or object pose. To alleviate this, a variety of sampling strategies have been applied, many relying on keypoint recognition techniques from classical computer vision. This work conducts a systematic empirical comparison of these approaches and shows that in contrast to conventional feature matching approaches for geometry-based localisation, sampling-based localisation using NeRFs benefits significantly from stable features. Results show that rendering stable features can result in a tenfold reduction in the number of forward passes required, a significant speed improvement."}}

This work introduces an extremely simple and effective approach to adapting neural models in response to changing settings, without requiring any specialised meta-learning strategies. We first train a standard network using dropout, which is analogous to learning an ensemble of predictive models or distribution over predictions. At run-time, we use a particle filter to maintain a distribution over dropout masks to adapt the neural model to changing settings in an online manner. Experimental results show improved performance in control problems requiring both online and look-ahead prediction, and showcase the interpretability of the inferred masks in a human behaviour modelling task for drone tele-operation.

Using the class of motor primitives for peg-in-hole like insertions, we study how robots can learn such skills. Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) are a popular way of extracting such policies through behaviour cloning (BC) but can struggle in the context of insertion. Policy adaptation strategies such as residual learning can help improve the overall performance of policies in the context of contact-rich manipulation. However, it is not clear how to best do this with DMPs. As a result, we consider several possible ways for adapting a DMP formulation and propose \u201cresidual Learning from Demonstration\u201c (rLfD), a framework that combines DMPs with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a residual correction policy. Our evaluations suggest that applying residual learning directly in task space and operating on the full pose of the robot can significantly improve the overall performance of DMPs. We show that rLfD offers a gentle to the joints solution that improves the task success and generalisation of DMPs and enables transfer to different geometries and frictions through few-shot task adaptation. The proposed framework is evaluated on a set of tasks. A simulated robot and a physical robot have to successfully insert pegs, gears and plugs into their respective sockets."}}
