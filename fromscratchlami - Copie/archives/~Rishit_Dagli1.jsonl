Galaxy morphologies are crucial to understanding the processes by which galaxies form and evolve. Efficient methods to classify galaxy morphologies are required to extract physical information from modern-day astronomy surveys. In this paper, we introduce Astroformer, a method to learn from less amount of data. We propose using a hybrid transformer-convolutional architecture drawing much inspiration from the success of CoAtNet and MaxViT. Concretely, we use the transformer-convolutional hybrid with a new stack design for the network, a different way of creating a relative self-attention layer, and pair it with a careful selection of data augmentation and regularization techniques. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on predicting galaxy morphologies from images on the Galaxy10 DECals dataset, a science objective, which consists of 17736 labeled images achieving $94.86\\%$ top-$1$ accuracy, beating the current state-of-the-art for this task by $4.62\\%$. Furthermore, this approach also sets a new state-of-the-art on CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet. We also find that models and training methods used for larger datasets would often not work very well in the low-data regime."}}
