The most widely-known anytime search algorithms are based on best-first search.  In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, triangle search, that is based on beam search. Experimental results on a suite of popular search benchmarks suggest that it is competitive with fixed-width beam search and often performs better than the previous best anytime search algorithms."}}

A recent variant of beam search, monobead, guarantees nonincreasing solution cost with increasing beam width.  However, the monotonicity of monobead sometimes comes at the price of increased cost and time for small beam widths.  In this paper, we explore two algorithmic variants that lie between beam search and monobead.  We find that, as hoped, our hybrids of beam and monobead can often find solutions with better cost than monobead and typically have more monotonic behavior than bead.  This work improves our understanding of the price of monotonicity in beam search."}}

(2005) proved that A*, given an admissible heuristic, is guaranteed to return an optimal solution in any cost algebra, not just in the traditional shortest path setting. In this paper, we investigate cost-algebraic A*\u2019s optimal efficiency: in the cost-algebraic setting, under what conditions is A* guaranteed to expand the fewest possible states? In the traditional setting, this question was examined in detail by Dechter & Pearl (1985). They identified five different situations in which A* was optimally efficient. We show that three of them continue to hold in the cost-algebraic setting, but that one does not. We also show that one of them is false, it does not hold even in the traditional setting. We introduce an alternative that does hold in the cost-algebraic setting. Finally, we show that a well-known result due to Nilsson does not hold in the general cost-algebraic setting but does hold in a slightly less general setting."}}

Recent studies focus on the effects of diverse action costs on search algorithms, but not on their effects on domain-independent heuristics. In this paper, we demonstrate there are negative impacts of action cost diversity on merge-and-shrink (M&S), a successful abstraction method for producing high-quality heuristics for planning problems. We propose a new cost partitioning method for M&S to address the negative effects of diverse action costs. We investigate non-unit cost IPC domains, especially those for which diverse action costs have severe negative effects on the quality of the M&S heuristic. Our experiments demonstrate that in these domains, an additive set of M&S heuristics using the new cost partitioning method produces much more informative and effective heuristics than creating a single M&S heuristic which directly encodes diverse costs."}}

Such states are called \u201csurely expanded\u201d (s.e.). A recent study characterized s.e. pairs of states for bidirectional search with consistent heuristics: if a pair of states is s.e. then at least one of the two states must be expanded. This paper derives a lower bound, VC, on the minimum number of expansions required to cover all s.e. pairs, and present a new admissible front-to-end bidirectional heuristic search algorithm, Near-Optimal Bidirectional Search (NBS), that is guaranteed to do no more than 2VC expansions. We further prove that no admissible front-to-end algorithm has a worst case better than 2VC. Experimental results show that NBS competes with or outperforms existing bidirectional search algorithms, and often outperforms A* as well."}}

We show empirically that our methods can outperform state-of-the-art planners for deterministic optimal planning."}}

This paper focuses on one aspect of the full game, namely, finding the optimal \"hammer shot\", which is the last action taken before a score is tallied. We survey existing methods for finding an optimal action in a continuous, low-dimensional space with stochastic outcomes, and adapt a method based on Delaunay triangulation to our application. Experiments using our curling physics simulator show that the adapted Delaunay triangulation's shot selection outperforms other algorithms, and with some caveats, exceeds Olympic-level human performance."}}

The previously best heuristic for Sokoban (I) used the idea of an intermediate goal state to enable the effective use of pattern database heuristics in transportation domains, where the mapping of movable objects to goal locations is not fixed beforehand. We extend this idea to allow the use of multiple intermediate goal states and show that heuristic I is no longer effective. We solve this problem and show that our heuristic D is effective in this situation. Sokoban is a well-known single-agent search domain characterized by a large branching factor, long solution lengths, and the presence of unsolvable states. Given the exponential growth in the complexity of standard Sokoban instances, the increase in the number of optimally solved instances represents a major advance in our understanding of how to search in extremely large search spaces."}}

One such technique is sleep sets, which were originally introduced as a pruning technique for model checking, and which have recently been investigated on a theoretical level for planning. In this paper, we propose a generalization of sleep sets and prove its correctness. While the original sleep sets were based on the commutativity of operators, generalized sleep sets are based on a more general notion of operator sequence redundancy. As a result, our approach dominates the original sleep sets variant in terms of pruning power. On a practical level, our experimental evaluation shows the potential of sleep sets and their generalizations on a large and common set of planning benchmarks."}}
