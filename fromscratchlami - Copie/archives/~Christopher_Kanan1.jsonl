However, current methods for detecting, segmenting, and sub-typing breast neoplasms and other proliferative lesions often rely on costly and time-consuming manual annotation efforts, which can be impractical for large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose an annotation-free learning framework to jointly detect, segment, and subtype breast neoplasms. Our approach leverages top-k multiple instance learning to train an initial neoplasm detection backbone network from weakly-labeled whole slide images, which is then used to automatically generate pixel-level pseudo-labels for whole slides with only one subtype. A second network is trained using these pseudo-labels, and slide-level classification is performed by training an aggregator network that fuses the embeddings from both backbone networks. We trained and validated our framework on large-scale datasets with more than 100k whole slide images and demonstrate its effectiveness on tasks including breast neoplasms detection, segmentation, and subtyping."}}

It has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. However, a major challenge to this objective is that for many specific computational pathology tasks the amount of data is inadequate for development. To address this challenge, we created Virchow, a 632 million parameter deep neural network foundation model for computational pathology. Using self-supervised learning, Virchow is trained on 1.5 million hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide images from diverse tissue groups, which is orders of magnitude more data than previous works. When evaluated on downstream tasks including tile-level pan-cancer detection and subtyping and slide-level biomarker prediction, Virchow outperforms state-of-the-art systems both on internal datasets drawn from the same population as the pretraining data as well as external public datasets. Virchow achieves 93% balanced accuracy for pancancer tile classification, and AUCs of 0.983 for colon microsatellite instability status prediction and 0.967 for breast CDH1 status prediction. The gains in performance highlight the importance of pretraining on massive pathology image datasets, suggesting pretraining on even larger datasets could continue improving performance for many high-impact applications where limited amounts of training data are available, such as drug outcome prediction."}}

Given the computational expense for retraining networks, it has been argued that continual learning could make updating networks more efficient. An obstacle to achieving this goal is the stability gap, which refers to an observation that when updating on new data, performance on previously learned data degrades before recovering. Addressing this problem would enable continual learning to learn new data with fewer network updates, resulting in increased computational efficiency. We study how to mitigate the stability gap in rehearsal (or experience replay), a widely employed continual learning method. We test a variety of hypotheses to understand why the stability gap occurs. This leads us to discover a method that vastly reduces this gap. In experiments on a large-scale incremental class learning setting, we are able to significantly reduce the number of network updates to recover performance. Our work has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in continual learning for real-world applications along with reducing the carbon footprint required to maintain updated neural networks."}}

However, the explainability of their benefits largely remains a mystery. We study which layers of residual neural networks (ResNets) are most affected by augmentations using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). We do so by analyzing models of varying widths and depths, as well as whether their weights are initialized randomly or through transfer learning. We find that the pattern of how the layers are affected depends on the model's depth, and that networks trained with augmentation that use information from two images affect the learned weights significantly more than augmentations that operate on a single image. Deeper layers of ResNets initialized with ImageNet-1K weights and fine-tuned receive more impact from the augmentations than early layers. Understanding the effects of image augmentations on CNNs will have a variety of applications, such as determining how far back one needs to fine-tune a network and which layers should be frozen when implementing layer freezing algorithms."}}

Unlike the offline setting where data is shuffled, we cannot make any distributional assumptions about the data stream. Ideally, only one pass through the dataset is needed for computational efficiency. However, existing methods are inadequate and make many assumptions that cannot be made for real-world applications, while simultaneously failing to improve computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel online continual learning method, SIESTA based on wake/sleep framework for training, which is well aligned to the needs of on-device learning. The major goal of SIESTA is to advance compute efficient continual learning so that DNNs can be updated efficiently using far less time and energy. The principal innovations of SIESTA are: 1) rapid online updates using a rehearsal-free, backpropagation-free, and data-driven network update rule during its wake phase, and 2) expedited memory consolidation using a compute-restricted rehearsal policy during its sleep phase. For memory efficiency, SIESTA adapts latent rehearsal using memory indexing from REMIND. Compared to REMIND and prior arts, SIESTA is far more computationally efficient, enabling continual learning on ImageNet-1K in under 2.4 hours on a single GPU; moreover, in the augmentation-free setting it matches the performance of the offline learner, a milestone critical to driving adoption of continual learning in real-world applications."}}

Therefore, it would be ideal to minimize the number of human annotations needed when creating a new dataset. Here, we address this problem by proposing a novel algorithm that combines active learning and semi-supervised learning. Active learning is an approach for identifying the best unlabeled samples to annotate. While there has been work on active learning for segmentation, most methods require annotating all pixel objects in each image, rather than only the most informative regions. We argue that this is inefficient. Instead, our active learning approach aims to minimize the number of annotations per-image. Our method is enriched with semi-supervised learning, where we use pseudo labels generated with a teacher-student framework to identify image regions that help disambiguate confused classes. We also integrate mechanisms that enable better performance on imbalanced label distributions, which have not been studied previously for active learning in semantic segmentation. In experiments on the CamVid and CityScapes datasets, our method obtains over 95% of the network\u2019s performance on the full-training set using less than 17% of the training data, whereas the previous state of the art required 40% of the training data."}}

A major challenge in CL is that non-stationary data streams cause catastrophic forgetting of previously learned abilities. Rehearsal is a popular and effective way to mitigate this problem, which is storing past observations in a buffer and mixing them with new observations during learning. This leads to a question: Which stored samples should be selected for rehearsal? Choosing samples that are best for learning, rather than simply selecting them at random, could lead to significantly faster learning. For class incremental learning, prior work has shown that a simple class balanced random selection policy outperforms more sophisticated methods. Here, we revisit this question by exploring a new sample selection policy called GRASP. GRASP selects the most prototypical (class representative) samples first and then gradually selects less prototypical (harder) examples to update the DNN. GRASP has little additional compute or memory overhead compared to uniform selection, enabling it to scale to large datasets. We evaluate GRASP and other policies by conducting CL experiments on the large-scale ImageNet-1K and Places-LT image classification datasets. GRASP outperforms all other rehearsal policies. Beyond vision, we also demonstrate that GRASP is effective for CL on five text classification datasets."}}

Many prior efforts have addressed this problem using either alternative loss functions or sampling strategies that focus on rare patterns. We propose a new direction: modifying the network architecture to impose inductive biases that make the network robust to dataset bias. Specifically, we propose OccamNets, which are biased to favor simpler solutions by design. OccamNets have two inductive biases. First, they are biased to use as little network depth as needed for an individual example. Second, they are biased toward using fewer image locations for prediction. While OccamNets are biased toward simpler hypotheses, they can learn more complex hypotheses if necessary. In experiments, OccamNets outperform or rival state-of-the-art methods run on architectures that do not incorporate these inductive biases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the state-of-the-art debiasing methods are combined with OccamNets results further improve.\n"}}
