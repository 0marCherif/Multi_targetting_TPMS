This work proposes a general framework for an abstract class of hypergraph p-Laplacians from a differential-geometric view. This class includes previously proposed hypergraph p-Laplacians and also includes previously unstudied novel generalizations. For this abstract class, we extend current spectral theory by providing an extension of nodal domain theory for the eigenvectors of our hypergraph p-Laplacian. We use this nodal domain theory to provide bounds on the eigenvalues via a higher-order Cheeger inequality. Following our extension of spectral theory, we propose a novel hypergraph partitioning algorithm for our generalized p-Laplacian. Our empirical study shows that our algorithm outperforms spectral methods based on existing p-Laplacians."}}

For graph cut based spectral clustering, it is common to model real-valued data into graph by modeling pairwise similarities using kernel function. This is because the kernel function has a theoretical connection to the graph cut. For problems where using multi-way similarities are more suitable than pairwise ones, it is natural to model as a hypergraph, which is generalization of a graph. However, although the hypergraph cut is well-studied, there is not yet established a hypergraph cut based framework to model multi-way similarity. In this paper, we formulate multi-way similarities by exploiting the theoretical foundation of kernel function. We show a theoretical connection between our formulation and hypergraph cut in two ways, generalizing both weighted kernel $k$-means and the heat kernel, by which we justify our formulation. We also provide a fast algorithm for spectral clustering. Our algorithm empirically shows better performance than existing graph and other heuristic modeling methods."}}

In this paper, we generalize the analogy between graph Laplacian and differential geometry to the hypergraph setting, and propose a novel hypergraph $p$-Laplacian. Unlike the existing two-node graph Laplacians, this generalization makes it possible to analyze hypergraphs, where the edges are allowed to connect any number of nodes. Moreover, we propose a semi-supervised learning method based on the proposed hypergraph $p$-Laplacian, and formalize them as the analogue to the Dirichlet problem, which often appears in physics. We further explore theoretical connections to normalized hypergraph cut on a hypergraph, and propose normalized cut corresponding to hypergraph $p$-Laplacian. The proposed $p$-Laplacian is shown to outperform standard hypergraph Laplacians in the experiment on a hypergraph semi-supervised learning and normalized cut setting."}}

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the detection of persistent topics in SNSs based on Topic Graph. A topic graph is a subgraph of the ordinary social network graph that consists of the users who shared a certain topic up to some time point. Based on the assumption that the time-evolutions of the topic graphs associated with a persistent and non-persistent topics are different, we propose to detect persistent topics by performing anomaly detection on the feature values extracted from the time-evolution of the topic graph. For anomaly detection, we use principal component analysis to capture the subspace spanned by normal (non-persistent) topics. We demonstrate our technique on a real data set we gathered from Twitter and show that it performs significantly better than a base-line method based on power law curve fitting and the linear influence model."}}
