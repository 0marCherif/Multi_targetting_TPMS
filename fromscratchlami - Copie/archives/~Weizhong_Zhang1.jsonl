Popular regularization techniques such as L2 weight regularization act directly on the network parameters but do not explicitly take into account how the interplay between the parameters and the network architecture may affect the induced predictive functions. To address this shortcoming, we propose a simple technique for effective function-space regularization. Drawing on the result that fully-trained wide multi-layer perceptrons are equivalent to kernel regression under the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), we propose to approximate the norm of neural network functions by the reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm under the NTK  and use it as a function-space regularizer. We prove that neural networks trained using this regularizer are arbitrarily close to kernel ridge regression solutions under the NTK. Furthermore, we provide a generalization error bound under the proposed regularizer and empirically demonstrate improved generalization and state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks where effective regularization on the induced space of functions is essential."}}

To avoid excessive computation, extracting and training only on the most informative subset is drawing increasing attention. Nevertheless, it is still an open question how to select such a subset on which the model trained generalizes on par with the full data. In this paper, we propose dynamic margin selection (DynaMS). DynaMS leverages the distance from candidate samples to the classification boundary to construct the subset, and the subset is dynamically updated during model training. We show that DynaMS converges with large probability, and for the first time show both in theory and practice that dynamically updating the subset can result in better generalization over previous works. To reduce the additional computation incurred by the selection, a light parameter sharing proxy (PSP) is designed. PSP is able to faithfully evaluate instances with respect to the current model, which is necessary for dynamic selection. Extensive analysis and experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in data selection against many state-of-the-art counterparts on benchmark datasets."}}

A new paradigm called data-generation-based zero-shot learning has achieved impressive success. In this paradigm, the synthesized data from the PLM acts as the carrier of knowledge, which is used to train a task-specific model with orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the PLM, achieving both higher performance and efficiency than prompt-based zero-shot learning methods on PLMs. The main hurdle of this approach is that the synthesized data from PLM usually contains a significant portion of low-quality samples. Fitting on such data will greatly hamper the performance of the task-specific model, making it unreliable for deployment. Previous methods remedy this issue mainly by filtering synthetic data using heuristic metrics(e.g., output confidence), or refining the data with the help of a human expert, which comes with excessive manual tuning or expensive costs. In this paper, we propose a novel noise-robust re-weighting framework SunGen to automatically construct high-quality data for zero-shot classification problems. Our framework features the ability to learn the sample weights indicating data quality without requiring any human annotation. We theoretically and empirically verify the ability of our method to help construct good-quality synthetic datasets. Notably, SunGen-LSTM yields a 9.8% relative improvement than the baseline on average accuracy across eight different established text classification tasks."}}

We first provide a holistic view of existing T-estimation methods including those with or without anchor point assumptions.  We unified them into the Minimum Geometric Envelope Operator (MGEO) framework, which tries to find the smallest T (in terms of a certain metric) that elicits a convex hull to enclose the posteriors of all the training data. Although MGEO methods show appealing theoretical properties and empirical results, we find them prone to failing when the noisy posterior estimation is imperfect, which is inevitable in practice. Specifically, we show that MGEO methods are in-consistent even with infinite samples if the noisy posterior is not estimated accurately. In view of this, we make the first effort to address this issue by proposing a novel T-estimation framework via the lens of bilevel optimization, and term it RObust Bilevel OpTimzation (ROBOT). ROBOT paves a new road beyond MGEO framework, which enjoys strong theoretical properties: identifibility, consistency and finite-sample generalization guarantees. Notably, ROBOT neither requires the perfect posterior estimation nor assumes the existence of anchor points. We further theoretically demonstrate that ROBOT is more robust in the case where MGEO methods fail. Experimentally, our framework also shows superior performance across multiple benchmarks."}}

While both of them have attracted great research interest with specific strategies developed, no known solution manages to address them in a unified framework. To overcome both challenges, we propose SmartFL, a generic approach that optimizes the server-side aggregation process with a small amount of on-server proxy data (e.g., around one hundred samples for CIFAR-10) via a subspace training technique. Specifically, the aggregation weight of each participating client at each round is optimized using the server-side proxy data, which is essentially the optimization of the global model in the convex hull spanned by client models. Since at each round, the number of tunable parameters optimized on the server side equals the number of participating clients (thus independent of the model size), we are able to train a global model with massive parameters using only a small amount of server-side proxy data. We provide theoretical analyses of the convergence and generalization capacity for SmartFL. Empirically, SmartFL achieves state-of-the-art performance on both federated learning with non-IID data distribution and federated learning with malicious clients. \n"}}

Many attempts, such as decreasing an adaptive learning rate, adopting a big batch size, incorporating a temporal decorrelation technique, seeking an analogous surrogate, etc., have been tried to promote Adam/RMSProp-type algorithms to converge. In contrast with existing approaches, we introduce an alternative easy-to-check sufficient condition, which merely depends on the parameters of the base learning rate and combinations of historical second-order moments, to guarantee the global convergence of generic Adam/RMSProp for solving large-scale non-convex stochastic optimization. Moreover, we show that the convergences of several variants of Adam, such as AdamNC, AdaEMA, etc., can be directly implied via the proposed sufficient condition in the non-convex setting. In addition, we illustrate that Adam is essentially a specifically weighted AdaGrad with exponential moving average momentum, which provides a novel perspective for understanding Adam and RMSProp. This observation coupled with this sufficient condition gives much deeper interpretations on their divergences. At last, we validate the sufficient condition by applying Adam and RMSProp to tackle a certain counterexample and train deep neural networks. Numerical results are exactly in accord with our theoretical analysis."}}
