This work focuses on recreating interactive digital twins of real-world articulated objects, which can be directly imported into virtual environments. We introduce Ditto to learn articulation model estimation and 3D geometry reconstruction of an articulated object through interactive perception. Given a pair of visual observations of an articulated object before and after interaction, Ditto reconstructs part-level geometry and estimates the articulation model of the object. We employ implicit neural representations for joint geometry and articulation modeling. Our experiments show that Ditto effectively builds digital twins of articulated objects in a category-agnostic way. We also apply Ditto to real-world objects and deploy the recreated digital twins in physical simulation. Code and additional results are available at https://ut-austin-rpl.github.io/Ditto/"}}

Figuring out the styles to suit a body shape can be a daunting task for many people. It is, therefore, essential to develop a framework for learning the compatibility of body shapes and clothing styles. Though fashion designers and fashion stylists have analyzed the correlation between human body shapes and fashion styles for a long time, this issue did not receive much attention in multimedia science. In this paper, we present a novel style recommender, on the basis of the user's body attributes. The rich amount of fashion styling knowledge from social big data is exploited for this purpose. We first construct a joint embedding of clothing styles and human body measurements with deep multimodal representation learning on a reference dataset that has been sorted to meet the fashion rules. We then discover the relevant semantic features by propagation and selection in clothing style and body shape graphs. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework when compared with several baseline methods."}}

Most existing methods adopt feature alignment either on the image level or instance level. However, image-level alignment on global features may tangle foreground/background pixels at the same time, while instance-level alignment using proposals may suffer from the background noise. Different from existing solutions, we propose a domain adaptation framework that accounts for each pixel via predicting pixel-wise objectness and centerness. Specifically, the proposed method carries out center-aware alignment by paying more attention to foreground pixels, hence achieving better adaptation across domains. We demonstrate our method on numerous adaptation settings with extensive experimental results and show favorable performance against existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

The major difficulty lies in the uncertain figure-ground separation within each bounding box since there is no supervisory signal about it. We address the difficulty by formulating the problem as a multiple instance learning (MIL) task, and generate positive and negative bags based on the sweeping lines of each bounding box. The proposed deep model integrates MIL into a fully supervised instance segmentation network, and can be derived by the objective consisting of two terms, i.e., the unary term and the pairwise term. The former estimates the foreground and background areas of each bounding box while the latter maintains the unity of the estimated object masks. The experimental results show that our method performs favorably against existing weakly supervised methods and even surpasses some fully supervised methods for instance segmentation on the PASCAL VOC dataset."}}

Also, it is always an uneasy task for people to make decisions on what to wear. An essential style tip is to dress for the body shape, i.e., knowing one's own body shape (e.g., hourglass, rectangle, round and inverted triangle) and selecting the types of clothes that will accentuate the body's good features. In the literature, although various fashion recommendation systems for clothing items have been developed, none of them had explicitly taken the user's basic body shape into consideration. In this paper, therefore, we proposed a first framework for learning the compatibility of clothing styles and body shapes from social big data, with the goal to recommend a user about what to wear better in relation to his/her essential body attributes. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach, leading to a new aspect for research into fashion recommendation."}}
