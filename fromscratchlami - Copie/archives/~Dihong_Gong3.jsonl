A major challenge in practical face recognition applications lies in significant variations between profile and frontal faces. Traditional techniques address this challenge either by synthesizing frontal faces or by pose invariant learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method with Lie algebra theory to explore how face rotation in the 3D space affects the deep feature generation process of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We prove that face rotation in the image space is equivalent to an additive residual component in the feature space of CNNs, which is determined solely by the rotation. Based on this theoretical finding, we further design a Lie Algebraic Residual Network (LARNet) for tackling pose robust face recognition. Our LARNet consists of a residual subnet for decoding rotation information from input face images, and a gating subnet to learn rotation magnitude for controlling the strength of the residual component contributing to the feature learning process. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on both frontal-profile face datasets and general face recognition datasets convincingly demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ones."}}

Previous approaches build models on datasets which do not simulate the real-world data well (e.g., small scale, insignificant variance, etc.). Existing models may rely on auxiliary information, which prevents these anti-spoofing solutions from generalizing well in practice. In this paper, we present a data collection solution along with a data synthesis technique to simulate digital medium-based face spoofing attacks, which can easily help us obtain a large amount of training data well reflecting the real-world scenarios. Through exploiting a novel Spatio-Temporal Anti-Spoof Network (STASN), we are able to push the performance on public face anti-spoofing datasets over state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Since the proposed model can automatically attend to discriminative regions, it makes analyzing the behaviors of the network possible.We conduct extensive experiments and show that the proposed model can distinguish spoof faces by extracting features from a variety of regions to seek out subtle evidences such as borders, moire patterns, reflection artifacts, etc."}}

However, matching faces with big age gaps remains a challenging problem, primarily due to the significant discrepancy of face appearance caused by aging. To reduce such discrepancy, in this paper we present a novel algorithm to remove age-related components from features mixed with both identity and age information. Specifically, we factorize a mixed face feature into two uncorrelated components: identity-dependent component and age-dependent component, where the identity-dependent component contains information that is useful for face recognition. To implement this idea, we propose the Decorrelated Adversarial Learning (DAL) algorithm, where a Canonical Mapping Module (CMM) is introduced to find maximum correlation of the paired features generated by the backbone network, while the backbone network and the factorization module are trained to generate features reducing the correlation. Thus, the proposed model learns the decomposed features of age and identity whose correlation is significantly reduced. Simultaneously, the identity-dependent feature and the age-dependent feature are supervised by ID and age preserving signals respectively to ensure they contain the correct information. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the popular public-domain face aging datasets (FG-NET, MORPH Album 2, and CACD-VS) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}

The central task of face recognition, including face verification and identification, involves face feature discrimination. However, the traditional softmax loss of deep CNNs usually lacks the power of discrimination. To address this problem, recently several loss functions such as center loss, large margin softmax loss, and angular softmax loss have been proposed. All these improved losses share the same idea: maximizing inter-class variance and minimizing intra-class variance. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, namely large margin cosine loss (LMCL), to realize this idea from a different perspective. More specifically, we reformulate the softmax loss as a cosine loss by L2 normalizing both features and weight vectors to remove radial variations, based on which a cosine margin term is introduced to further maximize the decision margin in the angular space. As a result, minimum intra-class variance and maximum inter-class variance are achieved by virtue of normalization and cosine decision margin maximization. We refer to our model trained with LMCL as CosFace. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on the most popular public-domain face recognition datasets such as MegaFace Challenge, Youtube Faces (YTF) and Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW). We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks, which confirms the effectiveness of our proposed approach."}}

To reduce the intra-class discrepancy caused by the aging, in this paper we propose a novel approach (namely, Orthogonal Embedding CNNs, or OE-CNNs) to learn the age-invariant deep face features. Specifically, we decompose deep face features into two orthogonal components to represent age-related and identity-related features. As a result, identity-related features that are robust to aging are then used for AIFR. Besides, for complementing the existing cross-age datasets and advancing the research in this field, we construct a brand-new large-scale Cross-Age Face dataset (CAF). Extensive experiments conducted on the three public domain face aging datasets (MORPH Album 2, CACD-VS and FG-NET) have shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the value of the constructed CAF dataset on AIFR. Benchmarking our algorithm on one of the most popular general face recognition (GFR) dataset LFW additionally demonstrates the comparable generalization performance on GFR."}}

Despite the extraordinary advancement in deep learning, visual object detection remains a challenging task. To overcome the deficiency of pure visual techniques, we propose to make use of meta text surrounding images on the Web for enhanced detection accuracy. In this paper we present a multimodal learning algorithm to integrate text information into visual knowledge extraction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a system that takes raw webpages as input, and automatically extracts visual knowledge (e.g. object bounding boxes) from tens of millions of images crawled from the Web. Experimental results based on 46 object categories show that the extraction precision is improved significantly from 73% (with state-of-the-art deep learning programs) to 81%, which is equivalent to a 31% reduction in error rates."}}

First, a new maximum entropy feature descriptor (MEFD) is developed that encodes the microstructure of facial images into a set of discrete codes in terms of maximum entropy. By densely sampling the encoded face image, sufficient discriminatory and expressive information can be extracted for further analysis. A new matching method is also developed, called identity factor analysis (IFA), to estimate the probability that two faces have the same underlying identity. The effectiveness of the framework is confirmed by extensive experimentation on two face aging datasets, MORPH (the largest public-domain face aging dataset) and FGNET. We also conduct experiments on the famous LFW dataset to demonstrate the excellent generalizability of our new approach."}}

In spite of the great progress in face recognition techniques, reliably recognizing faces across ages remains a difficult task. The facial appearance of a person changes substantially over time, resulting in significant intra-class variations. Hence, the key to tackle this problem is to separate the variation caused by aging from the person-specific features that are stable. Specifically, we propose a new method, called Hidden Factor Analysis (HFA). This method captures the intuition above through a probabilistic model with two latent factors: an identity factor that is age-invariant and an age factor affected by the aging process. Then, the observed appearance can be modeled as a combination of the components generated based on these factors. We also develop a learning algorithm that jointly estimates the latent factors and the model parameters using an EM procedure. Extensive experiments on two well-known public domain face aging datasets: MORPH (the largest public face aging database) and FGNET, clearly show that the proposed method achieves notable improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms."}}
