Without sufficient temporal boundary annotations, it is non-trivial to learn universal video-text alignments. In this work, we explore multi-modal correlations derived from large-scale image-text data to facilitate generalisable VMR. To address the limitations of image-text pre-training models on capturing the video changes, we propose a generic method, referred to as Visual-Dynamic Injection (VDI), to empower the model's understanding of video moments. Whilst existing VMR methods are focusing on building temporal-aware video features, being aware of the text descriptions about the temporal changes is also critical but originally overlooked in pre-training by matching static images with sentences. Therefore, we extract visual context and spatial dynamic information from video frames and explicitly enforce their alignments with the phrases describing video changes (e.g. verb). By doing so, the potentially relevant visual and motion patterns in videos are encoded in the corresponding text embeddings (injected) so to enable more accurate video-text alignments. We conduct extensive experiments on two VMR benchmark datasets (Charades-STA and ActivityNet-Captions) and achieve state-of-the-art performances. Especially, VDI yields notable advantages when being tested on the out-of-distribution splits where the testing samples involve novel scenes and vocabulary."}}

However, in unscripted natural videos, different activities mostly transit smoothly, so that it is intrinsically ambiguous to determine in labelling precisely when an activity starts and ends over time. Such uncertainties in temporal labelling are currently ignored in model training, resulting in learning mis-matched video-text correlation with poor generalisation in test. In this work, we solve this problem by introducing Elastic Moment Bounding (EMB) to accommodate flexible and adaptive activity temporal boundaries towards modelling universally interpretable video-text correlation with tolerance to underlying temporal uncertainties in pre-fixed annotations. Specifically, we construct elastic boundaries adaptively by mining and discovering frame-wise temporal endpoints that can maximise the alignment between video segments and query sentences. To enable both more accurate matching (segment content attention) and more robust localisation (segment elastic boundaries), we optimise the selection of frame-wise endpoints subject to segment-wise contents by a novel Guided Attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on three video activity localisation benchmarks demonstrate compellingly the EMB\u2019s advantages over existing methods without modelling uncertainty."}}

However, the i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) assumption commonly held in most deep learning models is somewhat non-applicable to ReID considering its objective to identify images of the same pedestrian across cameras at different locations often of variable and independent domain characteristics that are also subject to view-biased data distribution. In this work, we propose a Feature-Distribution Perturbation and Calibration (PECA) method to derive generic feature representations for person ReID, which is not only discriminative across cameras but also agnostic and deployable to arbitrary unseen target domains. Specifically, we perform per-domain feature-distribution perturbation to refrain the model from overfitting to the domain-biased distribution of each source (seen) domain by enforcing feature invariance to distribution shifts caused by perturbation. Furthermore, we design a global calibration mechanism to align feature distributions across all the source domains to improve the model generalization capacity by eliminating domain bias. These local perturbation and global calibration are conducted simultaneously, which share the same principle to avoid models overfitting by regularization respectively on the perturbed and the original distributions. Extensive experiments were conducted on eight person ReID datasets and the proposed PECA model outperformed the state-of-the-art competitors by significant margins."}}

For supervised model training, a temporal annotation of both the start and end time index of each video segment for a sentence (a video moment) must be given. This is not only very expensive but also sensitive to ambiguity and subjective annotation bias, a much harder task than image labelling. In this work, we develop a more accurate weakly-supervised solution by introducing Cross-Sentence Relations Mining (CRM) in video moment proposal generation and matching when only a paragraph description of activities without per-sentence temporal annotation is available. Specifically, we explore two cross-sentence relational constraints: (1) Temporal ordering and (2) semantic consistency among sentences in a paragraph description of video activities. Existing weakly-supervised techniques only consider within-sentence video segment correlations in training without considering cross-sentence paragraph context. This can mislead due to ambiguous expressions of individual sentences with visually indiscriminate video moment proposals in isolation. Experiments on two publicly available activity localisation datasets show the advantages of our approach over the state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods, especially so when the video activity descriptions become more complex."}}

It is based on self-discovering semantically consistent groups of unlabelled training samples with the same class concepts through a progressive affinity diffusion process. Extensive experiments on object image classification and clustering show the performance superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning models using six common image recognition benchmarks including MNIST, SVHN, STL10, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet."}}

This problem is intrinsically difficult due to unpredictable changing nature of imagery data distributions in novel domains. Pre-learned knowledge does not transfer well without making strong assumptions about the learned and the novel domains. Different methods have been studied to address the underlying problem based on different assumptions, e.g. from domain adaptation to zero-shot and few-shot learning. In this work, we address this problem by transfer clustering that aims to learn a discriminative latent space of the unlabelled target data in a novel domain by knowledge transfer from labelled related domains. Specifically, we want to leverage relative (pairwise) imagery information, which is freely available and intrinsic to a target domain, to model the target domain image distribution characteristics as well as the prior-knowledge learned from related labelled domains to enable more discriminative clustering of unlabelled target data. Our method mitigates nontransferrable prior-knowledge by self-supervision, benefiting from both transfer and self-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on four datasets for image clustering tasks reveal the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art transfer clustering techniques. We further demonstrate its competitive transferability on four zero-shot learning benchmarks."}}

Existing deep clustering methods typically rely on local learning constraints based on inter-sample relations and/or self-estimated pseudo labels. This is susceptible to the inevitable errors distributed in the neighbourhoods and suffers from error-propagation during training. In this work, we propose to solve this problem by learning the most confident clustering solution from all the possible separations, based on the observation that assigning samples from the same semantic categories into different clusters will reduce both the intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster diversity, i.e. lower partition confidence. Specifically, we introduce a novel deep clustering method named PartItion Confidence mAximisation (PICA). It is established on the idea of learning the most semantically plausible data separation, in which all clusters can be mapped to the ground-truth classes one-to-one, by maximising the \"global\" partition confidence of clustering solution. This is realised by introducing a differentiable partition uncertainty index and its stochastic approximation as well as a principled objective loss function that minimises such index, all of which together enables a direct adoption of the conventional deep networks and mini-batch based model training. Extensive experiments on six widely-adopted clustering benchmarks demonstrate our model's performance superiority over a wide range of the state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available online."}}
