It requires the agent to consistently adapt to novel tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. In this paper, we present a new continual learning approach for visual dynamics modeling and explore its efficacy in visual control and forecasting. The key assumption is that an ideal world model can provide a non-forgetting environment simulator, which enables the agent to optimize the policy in a multi-task learning manner based on the imagined trajectories from the world model. To this end, we first propose the mixture world model that learns task-specific dynamics priors with a mixture of Gaussians, and then introduce a new training strategy to overcome catastrophic forgetting, which we call predictive experience replay. Finally, we extend these methods to continual RL and further address the value estimation problems with the exploratory-conservative behavior learning approach. Our model remarkably outperforms the naive combinations of existing continual learning and visual RL algorithms on DeepMind Control and Meta-World benchmarks with continual visual control tasks. It is also shown to effectively alleviate the forgetting of spatiotemporal dynamics in video prediction datasets with evolving domains."}}

However, in practical scenarios like autonomous driving, noncontrollable dynamics that are independent or sparsely dependent on action signals often exist, making it challenging to learn effective world models. To address this issue, we propose Iso-Dream++, a model-based reinforcement learning approach that has two main contributions. First, we optimize the inverse dynamics to encourage the world model to isolate controllable state transitions from the mixed spatiotemporal variations of the environment. Second, we perform policy optimization based on the decoupled latent imaginations, where we roll out noncontrollable states into the future and adaptively associate them with the current controllable state. This enables long-horizon visuomotor control tasks to benefit from isolating mixed dynamics sources in the wild, such as self-driving cars that can anticipate the movement of other vehicles, thereby avoiding potential risks. On top of our previous work, we further consider the sparse dependencies between controllable and noncontrollable states, address the training collapse problem of state decoupling, and validate our approach in transfer learning setups. Our empirical study demonstrates that Iso-Dream++ outperforms existing reinforcement learning models significantly on CARLA and DeepMind Control."}}

Existing works on adaptation to unknown environment contexts either assume the contexts are the same for the whole episode or assume the context variables are Markovian. However, in many real-world applications, the environment context usually stays stable for a stochastic period and then changes in an abrupt and unpredictable manner within an episode, resulting in a segment structure, which existing works fail to address. To leverage the segment structure of piecewise stable context in real-world applications, in this paper, we propose a \\textit{\\textbf{Se}gmented \\textbf{C}ontext \\textbf{B}elief \\textbf{A}ugmented \\textbf{D}eep~(SeCBAD)} RL method. Our method can jointly infer the belief distribution over latent context with the posterior over segment length and perform more accurate belief context inference with observed data within the current context segment. The inferred belief context can be leveraged to augment the state, leading to a policy that can adapt to abrupt variations in context. We demonstrate empirically that SeCBAD can infer context segment length accurately and outperform existing methods on a toy grid world environment and Mujuco tasks with piecewise-stable context."}}

However, in practical scenarios such as autonomous driving, there commonly exists noncontrollable dynamics independent of the action signals, making it difficult to learn effective world models. Naturally, therefore, we need to enable the world models to decouple the controllable and noncontrollable dynamics from the entangled spatiotemporal data. To this end, we present a reinforcement learning approach named Iso-Dream, which expands the Dream-to-Control framework in two aspects. First, the world model contains a three-branch neural architecture. By solving the inverse dynamics problem, it learns to factorize latent representations according to the responses to action signals. Second, in the process of behavior learning, we estimate the state values by rolling-out a sequence of noncontrollable states (less related to the actions) into the future and associate the current controllable state with them. In this way, the isolation of mixed dynamics can greatly facilitate long-horizon decision-making tasks in realistic scenes, such as avoiding potential future risks by predicting the movement of other vehicles in autonomous driving. Experiments show that Iso-Dream is effective in decoupling the mixed dynamics and remarkably outperforms existing approaches in a wide range of visual control and prediction domains."}}

This paper summarizes the common mechanism shared by twelve previous transferability-boosting methods in a unified view, i.e., these methods all reduce game-theoretic interactions between regional adversarial perturbations. To this end, we focus on the attacking utility of all interactions between regional adversarial perturbations, and we first discover and prove the negative correlation between the adversarial transferability and the attacking utility of interactions. Based on this discovery, we theoretically prove and empirically verify that twelve previous transferability-boosting methods all reduce interactions between regional adversarial perturbations. More crucially, we consider the reduction of interactions as the essential reason for the enhancement of adversarial transferability. Furthermore, we design the interaction loss to directly penalize interactions between regional adversarial perturbations during attacking. Experimental results show that the interaction loss significantly improves the transferability of adversarial perturbations."}}

We discover and prove the negative correlation between the adversarial transferability and the interaction inside adversarial perturbations. The negative correlation is further verified through different DNNs with various inputs. Moreover, this negative correlation can be regarded as a unified perspective to understand current transferability-boosting methods. To this end, we prove that some classic methods of enhancing the transferability essentially decease interactions inside adversarial perturbations. Based on this, we propose to directly penalize interactions during the attacking process, which significantly improves the adversarial transferability. We will release the code when the paper is accepted."}}
