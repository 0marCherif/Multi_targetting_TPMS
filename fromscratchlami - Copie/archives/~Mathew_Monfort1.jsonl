However, performance changes introduced by these updates are poorly documented by providers and seldom studied in the literature. As a result, users are left wondering: do model updates introduce subtle performance changes that could adversely affect my system? Ideally, users would have access to a detailed ChangeList specifying the slices of data where model performance has improved and degraded since the update. But, producing a ChangeList is challenging because it requires (1) discovering slices in the absence of detailed annotations or metadata, (2) accurately attributing coherent concepts to the discovered slices, and (3) communicating them to the user in a digestable manner. We introduce Mocha, an interactive framework for building, verifying and releasing ChangeLists that addresses these challenges. Using it, we perform a large-scale analysis of three real-world MLaaS API updates. We produce a ChangeList for each, identifying over 100 coherent data slices on which the model\u2019s performance changed significantly. Notably, we find 63 instances where an update improves performance globally, but hurts performance on a coherent slice \u2013 a phenomenon not previously documented at scale in the literature. These findings underscore the importance of producing a detailed ChangeList when the model behind an API is updated."}}

One such method, NetDissect identifies interpretable features of a model using the Broden dataset of visual semantic labels (colors, materials, textures, objects and scenes).  Given the recent rise of a number of action recognition datasets, we propose extending the Broden dataset to include actions to better analyze learned action models.  We describe the annotation process, results from interpreting action recognition models on the extended Broden dataset and examine interpretable feature paths to help us understand the conceptual hierarchy used to classify an action."}}

Unfortunately, its applicability is difficult in settings where optimal control can only be solved approximately. While local IOC approaches have been shown to successfully learn cost functions in such settings, they rely on the availability of good reference trajectories, which might not be available at test time. We address the problem of using IOC in these computationally challenging control tasks by using a graph-based discretization of the trajectory space. Our approach projects continuous demonstrations onto this discrete graph, where a cost function can be tractably learned via IOC. Discrete control trajectories from the graph are then projected back to the original space and locally optimized using the learned cost function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with experiments conducted on two 7-degree of freedom robotic arms."}}

Recent advances in depth camera technology have significantly improved human motion tracking. However, the inherent high dimensionality of interacting with the physical world makes efficiently forecasting human intention and future behavior a challenging task. Predictive methods that estimate uncertainty are therefore critical for supporting appropriate robotic responses to the many ambiguities posed within the human-robot interaction setting.\r\n\r\nWe address these two challenges, high dimensionality and uncertainty, by employing predictive inverse optimal control methods to estimate a probabilistic model of human motion trajectories. Our inverse optimal control formulation estimates quadratic cost functions that best rationalize observed trajectories framed as solutions to linear-quadratic regularization problems. The formulation calibrates its uncertainty from observed motion trajectories, and is efficient in high-dimensional state spaces with linear dynamics. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a task of anticipating the future trajectories, target locations and activity intentions of hand motions."}}

This higher-level abstraction improves generalization in different prediction settings, but computing predictions often becomes intractable in large decision spaces. We propose the Softstar algorithm, a softened heuristic-guided search technique for the maximum entropy inverse optimal control model of sequential behavior. This approach supports probabilistic search with bounded approximation error at a significantly reduced computational cost when compared to sampling based methods. We present the algorithm, analyze approximation guarantees, and compare performance with simulation-based inference on two distinct complex decision tasks."}}
