Unfortunately, such networks suffer from disadvantages such as easy detection by hostile aircraft and potential information leakage. In this paper, we present a novel mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing protocol based on directional antennas and situation awareness data that utilizes adaptive multihop routing to avoid sending information in directions where hostile nodes are present. Our protocol is implemented in the OMNEST simulator and evaluated using two realistic flight scenarios involving 8 and 24 aircraft, respectively. The results show that our protocol has significantly fewer leaked packets than comparative protocols, but at a slightly higher cost in terms of longer packet lifetime."}}

It can maintain evolving clustering solutions separately for each stream/view and consensus clustering solutions reflecting evolving interrelations among the streams. Each stream behavior can be analyzed by different clustering techniques using a distance measure and data granularity that is specially selected for it. The properties of the MultiStream EvolveCluster algorithm are studied and evaluated with respect to different consensus clustering techniques, distance measures, and cluster evaluation measures in synthetic and real-world smart building datasets. Our evaluation results show a stable algorithm performance in synthetic data scenarios. In the case of real-world data, the algorithm behavior demonstrates sensitivity to the individual streams\u2019 data quality and the used consensus clustering technique."}}

Further, there have been tremendous advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These two trends will have a significant impact on future digital societies. The vision of an immersive, ubiquitous, and intelligent virtual space opens up new opportunities for creating an enhanced digital world in which the users are at the center of the development process, so-called intelligent realities (IRs). The \u201cHuman-Centered Intelligent Realities\u201d (HINTS) profile project will develop concepts, principles, methods, algorithms, and tools for human-centered IRs, thus leading the way for future immersive, user-aware, and intelligent interactive digital environments. The HINTS project is centered around an ecosystem combining XR and communication paradigms to form novel intelligent digital systems. HINTS will provide users with new ways to understand, collaborate with, and control digital systems. These novel ways will be based on visual and data-driven platforms which enable tangible, immersive cognitive interactions within real and virtual realities. Thus, exploiting digital systems in a more efficient, effective, engaging, and resource-aware condition. Moreover, the systems will be equipped with cognitive features based on AI and ML, which allow users to engage with digital realities and data in novel forms.

The customer life cycle framework is widely used in businesses and AI plays a role in each stage. However, implementing and generating value from AI in the customer life cycle is not always simple. When evaluating the AI against business impact and value it is critical to consider both the model performance and the policy outcome. Proper analysis of AI-derived policies must not be overlooked in order to ensure ethical and trustworthy AI. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the literature on AI in customer life cycles (CLV) from an industry perspective. The study included 31 of 224 analyzed peer-reviewed articles from Scopus search result. The results show a significant research gap regarding outcome evaluations of AI implementations in practice. This paper proposes that policy evaluation is an important tool in the AI pipeline and empathizes the significance of validating both policy outputs and outcomes to ensure reliable and trustworthy AI."}}

Then, using bibliometrics and an extensive literature review of more than 80 papers, we identify the most important research trends in these areas. In addition, our bibliometric analysis also includes trends in different geographical regions. Our results indicate that manufacturing and agriculture or forestry are the two application areas with the fastest growth. Furthermore, our bibliometric study shows that deep learning and edge or fog computing are the enabling technologies increasing the most.

One avenue is accelerating AI as close to the user as possible, i.e., at the edge, to reduce latency and increase performance. Therefore, researchers have developed low-power AI accelerators, designed specifically to accelerate machine learning and AI at edge devices. In this paper, we present an overview of low-power AI accelerators between 2019\u20132022. Low-power AI accelerators are defined in this paper based on their acceleration target and power consumption. In this survey, 79 low-power AI accelerators are presented and discussed. The reviewed accelerators are discussed based on five criteria: (i) power, performance, and power efficiency, (ii) acceleration targets, (iii) arithmetic precision, (iv) neuromorphic accelerators, and (v) industry vs. academic accelerators. CNNs and DNNs are the most popular accelerator targets, while Transformers and SNNs are on the rise."}}

Traditional clustering algorithms rely on the availability of entire datasets to model them correctly and efficiently. Such requirements are not possible in the data stream clustering scenario, where data arrives and needs to be analyzed continuously. This paper proposes a novel evolutionary clustering algorithm, entitled EvolveCluster, capable of modeling evolving data streams. We compare EvolveCluster against two other evolutionary clustering algorithms, PivotBiCluster and Split-Merge Evolutionary Clustering, by conducting experiments on three different datasets. Furthermore, we perform additional experiments on EvolveCluster to further evaluate its capabilities on clustering evolving data streams. Our results show that EvolveCluster manages to capture evolving data stream behaviors and adapts accordingly."}}

One of these constraints is energy consumption, which directly translates to battery capacity for these devices. Streaming algorithms, such as the Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT), are designed to run in such devices due to their high velocity and low memory requirements. However, they have not been designed with an energy efficiency focus. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting the nmin adaptation method, which reduces the energy consumption of the VFDT algorithm with only minor effects on accuracy. nmin adaptation allows the algorithm to grow faster in those branches where there is more confidence to create a split, and delays the split on the less confident branches. This removes unnecessary computations related to checking for splits but maintains similar levels of accuracy. We have conducted extensive experiments on 29 public datasets, showing that the VFDT with nmin adaptation consumes up to 31% less energy than the original VFDT, and up to 96% less energy than the CVFDT (VFDT adapted for concept drift scenarios), trading off up to 1.7 percent of accuracy."}}

The common approach today to correct the error is to use a lookup table for each camera-lens combination, e.g., as in Adobe PhotoShop Lightroom or DxO Optics Pro. In this paper, we propose a method that corrects the chromatic aberration error without any priot knowledge of the camera-lens combination, and does the correction already on the bayer data, i.e., before the Raw image data is interpolated to an RGB image. We evaluate our method in comparison to DxO Optics Pro, a state-of-the-art tool based on lookup tables, using 25 test images and the variance of the color differences (VCD) metric. The results show that our blind method has a similar error correction performance as DxO Optics Pro, but without prior knowledge of the camera-lens setup."}}
