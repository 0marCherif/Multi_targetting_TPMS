An extensive work over several decades has led to thousands of papers on this subject, and to many well-performing algorithms for this task. Indeed, 10 years ago, these achievements have led some researchers to suspect that \"Denoising is Dead\", in the sense that all that can be achieved in this domain has already been obtained. However, this turned out to be far from the truth, with the penetration of deep learning (DL) into image processing. The era of DL brought a revolution to image denoising, both by taking the lead in today's ability for noise removal in images, and by broadening the scope of denoising problems being treated. Our paper starts by describing this evolution, highlighting in particular the tension and synergy that exist between classical approaches and modern DL-based alternatives in design of image denoisers. The recent transitions in the field of image denoising go far beyond the ability to design better denoisers. In the 2nd part of this paper we focus on recently discovered abilities and prospects of image denoisers. We expose the possibility of using denoisers to serve other problems, such as regularizing general inverse problems and serving as the prime engine in diffusion-based image synthesis. We also unveil the idea that denoising and other inverse problems might not have a unique solution as common algorithms would have us believe. Instead, we describe constructive ways to produce randomized and diverse high quality results for inverse problems, all fueled by the progress that DL brought to image denoising. This survey paper aims to provide a broad view of the history of image denoising and closely related topics. Our aim is to give a better context to recent discoveries, and to the influence of DL in our domain."}}

Despite these remarkable achievements, recent studies have demonstrated that such classification networks are easily fooled by small malicious perturbations, also known as adversarial examples. This security weakness led to extensive research aimed at obtaining robust models. Beyond the clear robustness benefits of such models, it was also observed that their gradients with respect to the input align with human perception. Several works have identified Perceptually Aligned Gradients (PAG) as a byproduct of robust training, but none have considered it as a standalone phenomenon nor studied its own implications. In this work, we focus on this trait and test whether \\emph{Perceptually Aligned Gradients imply Robustness}. To this end, we develop a novel objective to directly promote PAG in training classifiers and examine whether models with such gradients are more robust to adversarial attacks. We present both heuristic and principled ways for obtaining target PAGs, which our method aims to learn. Specifically, we harness recent findings in score-based generative modeling as a source for PAG. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and STL validate that models trained with our method have improved robust performance, exposing the surprising bidirectional connection between PAG and robustness."}}

In order to obtain class-conditional generation, it was suggested to guide the diffusion process by gradients from a time-dependent classifier. While the idea is theoretically sound, deep learning-based classifiers are infamously susceptible to gradient-based adversarial attacks. Therefore, while traditional classifiers may achieve good accuracy scores, their gradients are possibly unreliable and might hinder the improvement of the generation results. Recent work discovered that adversarially robust classifiers exhibit gradients that are aligned with human perception, and these could better guide a generative process towards semantically meaningful images. We utilize this observation by defining and training a time-dependent adversarially robust classifier and use it as guidance for a generative diffusion model. In experiments on the highly challenging and diverse ImageNet dataset, our scheme introduces significantly more intelligible intermediate gradients, better alignment with theoretical findings, as well as improved generation results under several evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we conduct an opinion survey whose findings indicate that human raters prefer our method's results."}}

However, most methods are currently either limited to specific editing types (e.g., object overlay, style transfer), or apply to synthetically generated images, or require multiple input images of a common object. In this paper we demonstrate, for the very first time, the ability to apply complex (e.g., non-rigid) text-guided semantic edits to a single real image. For example, we can change the posture and composition of one or multiple objects inside an image, while preserving its original characteristics. Our method can make a standing dog sit down or jump, cause a bird to spread its wings, etc. -- each within its single high-resolution natural image provided by the user. Contrary to previous work, our proposed method requires only a single input image and a target text (the desired edit). It operates on real images, and does not require any additional inputs (such as image masks or additional views of the object). Our method, which we call \"Imagic\", leverages a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model for this task. It produces a text embedding that aligns with both the input image and the target text, while fine-tuning the diffusion model to capture the image-specific appearance. We demonstrate the quality and versatility of our method on numerous inputs from various domains, showcasing a plethora of high quality complex semantic image edits, all within a single unified framework."}}
