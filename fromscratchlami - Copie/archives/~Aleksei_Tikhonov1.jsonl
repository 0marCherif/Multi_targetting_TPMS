Can we say that some of them are better than others, or, ideally, choose one measure that is best in all situations? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic analysis of classification performance measures: we formally define a list of desirable properties and theoretically analyze which measures satisfy which properties. We also prove an impossibility theorem: some desirable properties cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Finally, we propose a new family of measures satisfying all desirable properties except one. This family includes the Matthews Correlation Coefficient and a so-called Symmetric Balanced Accuracy that was not previously used in classification literature. We believe that our systematic approach gives an important tool to practitioners for adequately evaluating classification results."}}

We demonstrate that this problem is crucial: there are many disagreements among the indices, these disagreements do affect which algorithms are chosen in applications, and this can lead to degraded performance in real-world systems. We propose a theoretical solution to this problem: we develop a list of desirable properties and theoretically verify which indices satisfy them. This allows for making an informed choice: given a particular application, one can first make a selection of properties that are desirable for a given application and then identify indices satisfying these. We observe that many popular indices have significant drawbacks. Instead, we advocate using other ones that are not so widely adopted but have beneficial properties."}}

In recent years a lot of methods to measure the semantic similarity of two short texts were developed. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis for more than a dozen of such methods. Using a new dataset of fourteen thousand sentence pairs human-labeled according to their semantic similarity, we demonstrate that none of the metrics widely used in the literature is close enough to human judgment in these tasks. A number of recently proposed metrics provide comparable results, yet Word Mover Distance is shown to be the most reasonable solution to measure semantic similarity in reformulated texts at the moment."}}

This information is encoded in the geometry of the embeddings and could be extracted with a straight-forward and intuitive manifold learning procedure or a contrasting map. Such a map is trained on a small labeled subset of the data and can produce new embeddings that explicitly highlight specific semantic attributes of the word. The new embeddings produced by the map are shown to improve the performance on downstream tasks."}}

In many practical cases, one can observe when nodes become infected, but the underlying network, over which a contagion or information propagates, is hidden. Inferring properties of the underlying network is important since these properties can be used for constraining infections, forecasting, viral marketing, and so on. Moreover, for many applications, it is sufficient to recover only coarse high-level properties of this network rather than all its edges. This article conducts a systematic and extensive analysis of the following problem: Given only the infection times, find communities of highly interconnected nodes. This task significantly differs from the well-studied community detection problem since we do not observe a graph to be clustered. We carry out a thorough comparison between existing and new approaches on several large datasets and cover methodological challenges specific to this problem. One of the main conclusions is that the most stable performance and the most significant improvement on the current state-of-the-art are achieved by our proposed simple heuristic approaches agnostic to a particular graph structure and epidemic model. We also show that some well-known community detection algorithms can be enhanced by including edge weights based on the cascade data."}}

First, the standard metrics for style accuracy and semantics preservation vary significantly on different re-runs. Therefore one has to report error margins for the obtained results. Second, starting with certain values of bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) between input and output and accuracy of the sentiment transfer the optimization of these two standard metrics diverge from the intuitive goal of the style transfer task. Finally, due to the nature of the task itself, there is a specific dependence between these two metrics that could be easily manipulated. Under these circumstances, we suggest taking BLEU between input and human-written reformulations into consideration for benchmarks. We also propose three new architectures that outperform state of the art in terms of this metric."}}

To facilitate the process of creation of such codes we propose two methods of their construction: the brute-force method and the analytic solution."}}

Among many algorithms proposed for this task, methods based on statistical inference are of particular interest: they are mathematically sound and were shown to provide partitions of good quality. Statistical inference methods are based on fitting some random graph model (a.k.a. null model) to the observed network by maximizing the likelihood. The choice of this model is extremely important and is the main focus of the current study. We provide an extensive theoretical and empirical analysis to compare several models: the widely used planted partition model, recently proposed degree-corrected modification of this model, and a new null model having some desirable statistical properties. We also develop and compare two likelihood optimization algorithms suitable for the models under consideration. An extensive empirical analysis on a variety of datasets shows, in particular, that the new model is the best one for describing most of the considered real-world complex networks according to the likelihood of observed graph structures."}}
