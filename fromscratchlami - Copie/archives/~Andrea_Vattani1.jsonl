The main technical idea is to show that the distribution over the documents generated by LDA can be transformed into a distribution for a much simpler generative model in which documents are generated from {\\em the same set of topics} but have a much simpler structure: documents are single topic and topics are chosen uniformly at random. Furthermore, this reduction is approximation preserving, in the sense that approximate distributions-- the only ones we can hope to compute in practice-- are mapped into approximate distribution in the simplified world. This opens up the possibility of efficiently reconstructing LDA topics in a roundabout way. Compute an approximate document distribution from the given corpus, transform it into an approximate distribution for the single-topic world, and run a reconstruction algorithm in the uniform, single topic world-- a much simpler task than direct LDA reconstruction. Indeed, we show the viability of the approach by giving very simple algorithms for a generalization of two notable cases that have been studied in the literature, $p$-separability and Gibbs sampling for matrix-like topics."}}

Quantifying the variance reduction gains due to cross-validation has been challenging due to the inherent correlations introduced by the folds. In this work we introduce a new and weak measure of stability called \\emphloss stability and relate the cross-validation performance to loss stability; we also establish that this relationship is near-optimal. Our work thus quantitatively improves the current best bounds on cross-validation."}}

In this dissertation, we use an algorithmic approach to study the behavior of multiple agents that interact with each other. A typical scenario considers a group of agents driven by both individual and collective incentives who communicate with each other through a network whose links represent potential interactions among them. We consider both coordination tasks, where the incentives of the agents are aligned, and non-coordination tasks, where their incentives are conflicting. The tasks we consider include social differentiation, selection of a reciprocating partner, and information aggregation. One of the key questions is whether the agents can solve these tasks. To address this question, we model agent behaviors algorithmically and analyze both individual and collective outcomes. For each task, we assess which algorithmic models will explain observed human behavior and which are more efficient in accomplishing the task. Finally, we study how the network structure affects outcomes and performance"}}

To study this problem, Kleinberg and Raghavan (FOCS 2005) introduced the model of query incentive networks , where the root of a binomial branching process wishes to retrieve an information -- known by each node independently with probability 1/n -- by investing as little as possible. The authors considered fixed-payment contracts in which every node strategically chooses an amount to offer its children paid upon information retrieval to convince them to seek the information in their subtrees. Kleinberg and Raghavan discovered that the investment needed at the root exhibits an unexpected threshold behavior that depends on the branching parameter b. For b>2, the investment is linear in the expected distance to the closest information (logarithmic in n, the rarity of the information), while, for 1<b<2, it becomes exponential in the same distance (i.e., polynomial in n). Arcaute et al. (EC 2007) later observed the same threshold behavior for arbitrary Galton-Watson branching processes. The DARPA Network Challenge --- retrieving the locations of ten balloons placed at undisclosed positions in the US --- has recently brought practical attention to the problems of social mobilization and information acquisition in a networked environment. The MIT Media Laboratory team won the challenge by acting as the root of a query incentive network that unfolded all over the world. However, rather than adopting a fixed-payment strategy, the team implemented a different incentive scheme based on 1/2-split contracts . Under such incentive scheme, a node u who does not possess the information can recruit a friend v through a contract stipulating that if the information is found in the subtree rooted at v, then v has to give half of her own reward back to u. Motivated by its empirical success, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of this scheme in the game theoretical setting of query incentive networks. Our main result is that split contracts are robust --- as opposed to fixed-payment contracts--- to nodes' selfishness. Surprisingly, when nodes determine the splits to offer their children based on the contracts received from their recruiters, the threshold behavior observed in the previous work vanishes, and an investment linear in the expected distance to the closest information is sufficient to retrieve the information in any arbitrary Galton-Watson process with b>1. Finally, while previous analyses considered the parameters of the branching process as constants, we are able to characterize the rate of the investment in terms of the branching process and the desired probability of success. This allows us to show improvements even in other special cases."}}

The usual strategy employed is to sample nodes so that the induced subgraph matches the original graph's degree distribution, clustering coefficient, etc., but no attempt is made to preserve fine-grained relationships between nodes, which are vital for applications like clustering, classification, and ranking. In this work, we model such relationships via the notion of Personalized PageRank Value (PPV). We show that induced subgraphs output by current sampling methods do not preserve PPVs, and propose algorithms for creating PPV-preserving subgraphs on any given subset of graph nodes. Experiments on three large real-world graphs show that the subgraphs created by our method improve upon induced subgraphs in terms of preserving PPVs, clustering accuracy, and maintaining basic graph properties."}}

In this work we study the generalization of the classical secretary problem in a setting where there is only a partial order between the elements and the goal of the algorithm is to return one of the maximal elements of the poset. This is equivalent to the auction setting where the seller has a multidimensional objective function with only a partial order among the outcomes. We obtain an algorithm that succeeds with probability at least k-k/(k-1)((1 + log k1/(k-1))k - 1), where k is the number of maximal elements in the poset and is the only information about the poset that is known to the algorithm; the success probability approaches the classical bound of 1/e as k -> 1. On the other hand, we prove an almost matching upper bound of k-1/(k-1) on the success probability of any algorithm for this problem; this upper bound holds even if the algorithm knows the complete structure of the poset."}}
