In this work, we develop a model for learning heterogeneous and dynamic patterns of velocity field data, motivated by applications in the transportation domain. We draw from basic nonparametric Bayesian modeling elements such as the infinite hidden Markov model and Gaussian process and focus on making the learning of such a stochastic model scalable for voluminous and streaming data. This is achieved by employing sequential MAP estimates from the infinite HMM model, an efficient sequential sparse GP posterior computation, and refinement of the estimates using the Viterbi algorithm, which is shown to work effectively on a careful simulation study. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques to the NGSIM dataset of complex multi-vehicle interactions."}}

For numerous machine learning tasks, data can be naturally viewed as samples drawn from spaces of functions, such as curves and surfaces, in high dimensions. Optimal transport for functional data analysis provides a useful framework of treatment for such domains. To this end, we develop an efficient algorithm for finding the stochastic transport map between functional domains and provide theoretical guarantees on the existence, uniqueness, and consistency of our estimate for the Hilbert-Schmidt operator. We validate our method on synthetic datasets and examine the functional properties of the transport map. Experiments on real-world datasets of robot arm trajectories further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on applications in domain adaptation."}}

Of particular focus is a scalable approximate inference method for the proposed model; this is achieved by employing sequential MAP estimates from the infinite HMM model and an efficient sequential GP posterior computation technique, which is shown to work effectively on simulated data sets.

In light of recent advances in solving the OT problem, OT distances are widely used as loss functions in minimum distance estimation. Despite its prevalence and advantages, however, OT is extremely sensitive to outliers. A single adversarially-picked outlier can increase OT distance arbitrarily. To address this issue, in this work we propose an outlier-robust OT formulation. Our formulation is convex but challenging to scale at a first glance. We proceed by deriving an equivalent formulation based on cost truncation that is easy to incorporate into modern stochastic algorithms for regularized OT. We demonstrate our model applied to mean estimation under the Huber contamination model in simulation as well as outlier detection on real data."}}

Temporal dynamic interactions can be described by (multiple) geometric trajectories in a suitable space over which unsupervised learning techniques may be applied to extract useful features from raw and high-dimensional data measurements. Taking a geometric approach to robust representation learning for temporal dynamic interactions, it is necessary to develop suitable metrics and a systematic methodology for comparison and for assessing the stability of an unsupervised learning method with respect to its tuning parameters. Such metrics must account for the (geometric) constraints in the physical world as well as the uncertainty associated with the learned patterns. In this paper we introduce a model-free metric based on the Procrustes distance for robust representation learning of interactions, and an optimal transport based distance metric for comparing between distributions of interaction primitives. These distance metrics can serve as an objective for assessing the stability of an interaction learning algorithm. They are also used for comparing the outcomes produced by different algorithms. Moreover, they may also be adopted as an objective function to obtain clusters and representative interaction primitives. These concepts and techniques will be introduced, along with mathematical properties, while their usefulness will be demonstrated in unsupervised learning of vehicle-to-vechicle interactions extracted from the Safety Pilot database, the world's largest database for connected vehicles."}}
