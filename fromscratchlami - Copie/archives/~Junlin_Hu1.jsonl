Most existing ReID methods focus on modifying the backbone network architecture to learn feature representations of persons; however, there are only a few methods that explore the potential performance of the network architecture to relearn features. In this article, we propose a self-regulation feature (SRF) scheme based on the network model, called SRFnet, to address the problem of the limited ability of the model for learning person features. The proposed SRFnet utilizes global branches to supervise local branches and deeply mine potential features of the network from the perspective of optimization to obtain more distinguished feature representations of persons. Different from methods that add an attention mechanism, our SRFnet can self-adjust feature learning by only adding loss functions between the local and global features of the network, and it does not require any additional convolution parameters. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that the proposed SRFnet method achieves the results of mean average precision (mAP)/Rank-1 as 93.65%/95.28% on Market1501, 89.65%/91.79% on DuckMTMC-reID, 83.79%/82.00% on CUHK03 (labeled), and 81.92%/80.21% on CUHK03 (detected) datasets, respectively. Furthermore, experimental results on cross-domain datasets also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SRFnet."}}

In this paper, we propose a sparsity-regularized geometric mean metric learning (SGMML) method to improve the well-known geometric mean metric learning (GMML) method and apply it to kinship verification task. Unlike GMML method that utilizes a linear map with fixed dimension, our SGMML method is capable of automatically learning the best projection dimension by employing the sparsity constraints on Mahalabios metric matrix. The proposed SGMML can effectively tackle the over-fitting problem and the data mixing up problem in the projected space. We conduct experiments on two benchmark kinship verification datasets, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our SGMML approach in kinship verification."}}

As there are a large number of parameters that need to be optimized in traditional metric learning algorithms, they may suffer from high computational complexity and overfitting problems in the case of insufficient training data. To alleviate this, we propose a weakly supervised compositional metric learning (WSCML) method, which utilizes a set of predetermined local discriminant metrics to learn the optimal weight combination of the component metrics. Under the large margin framework, our WSCML can effectively improve the verification accuracy by constraining the Mahalanobis distance of positive sample pairs to be less than a small threshold and that of negative sample pairs to be greater than a large threshold. In addition, we employ three regularization terms to optimize the proposed WSCML, respectively, to control the sparsity of the solution while maintaining its feasibility. Experimental results on KinFaceW-I, fine-grained face verification (FGFV), and Labled Faces in the Wild (LFW) datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

Specifically, we obtain a reference list by calculating the similarities of a probe image and all the images in the reference set. Given two probe face images, their similarity is reflected by the similarity of the two ordered reference lists.

With the applications of deep learning in the field of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for person re-identification, pseudo label methods via clustering techniques have become the mainstream route. However, the clustering procedure inevitably leads to noisy pseudo-labels. To reduce the interference of clustering noise, mutual mean-teaching (MMT) is introduced to generate reliable soft pseudo labels, however, this method is easy to fall into the local optimum. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention Random Variation (ARV) module that can be integrated into the MMT framework to develop Attention Augmented Mutual Networks (AAMN). Our ARV module generates random differences between two collaborative networks under the MMT framework to avoid the networks converging to the same kind of noise. Specifically, we propose a parameter-free Random Variation module to produce differences by randomly enhancing units of feature maps, and then combine it with an attention mechanism to enlarge networks differences and complementarity. Experimental results show that our AAMN method improves mAP of baseline method by 1.9% and 6.3% on Market-to-Duke and Duke-to-Market UDA tasks respectively."}}

The technology is very useful in sports video analysis. Most of the action recognition methods in sports mainly focus on recognizing which sport is being performed. However, recognizing of the specific action in videos is important for the analysis of some sports video such as tennis matches. Hence, in this paper, we proposed a deep historical long short-term memory network for video-based tennis action recognition and general action recognition. First, the spatial representations are extracted from each frame using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). To describe the temporal information, a stacked multi-layer long short-term memory network (LSTM) was used. The historical information of the past frames is important for modeling the action. So we propose a historical information layer that is added to the top of the multi-layered LSTM network. A historical feature of each video is generated for classification by hybridizing the hidden state of LSTM at time t and the historical updated feature at time t-1 with an updating scheme and utilized for classification. Experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method that using only simple raw RGB video can outperform the state-of-the-art baselines for both general action recognition and tennis action recognition."}}
