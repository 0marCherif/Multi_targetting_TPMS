Although the Transformer employs the self-attention mechanism to efficiently model the global interaction between token embeddings, it is inadequate for capturing short-range local context, which is essential for the accurate extraction of speaker information. In this study, we enhance the Transformer with the enhanced locality modeling in two directions. First, we propose the Locality-Enhanced Conformer (LE-Confomer) by introducing depth-wise convolution and channel-wise attention into the Conformer blocks. Second, we present the Speaker Swin Transformer (SST) by adapting the Swin Transformer, originally proposed for vision tasks, into speaker embedding network. We evaluate the proposed approaches on the VoxCeleb datasets and a large-scale Microsoft internal multilingual (MS-internal) dataset. The proposed models achieve 0.75% EER on VoxCeleb 1 test set, outperforming the previously proposed Transformer-based models and CNN-based models, such as ResNet34 and ECAPA-TDNN. When trained on the MS-internal dataset, the proposed models achieve promising results with 14.6% relative reduction in EER over the Res2Net50 model."}}

Incorporating the Squeeze-and-Excitation block into convolutional neural networks has achieved remarkable performance. However, it uses global average pooling (GAP) to simply average the features along time and frequency dimensions, which is incapable of preserving sufficient speaker information in the feature maps. In this study, we show that GAP is a special case of a discrete cosine transform (DCT) on time-frequency domain mathematically using only the lowest frequency component in frequency decomposition. To strengthen the speaker information extraction ability, we propose to utilize multi-frequency information and design two novel and effective attention modules, called Single-Frequency Single-Channel (SFSC) attention module and Multi-Frequency Single-Channel (MFSC) attention module. The proposed attention modules can effectively capture more speaker information from multiple frequency components on the basis of DCT. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the VoxCeleb datasets and a probe evaluation on the 1st 48-UTD forensic corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SFSC and MFSC attention modules can efficiently generate more discriminative speaker representations and outperform ResNet34-SE and ECAPA-TDNN systems with relative 20.9% and 20.2% reduction in EER, without adding extra network parameters."}}

In this study, we propose an effective self-supervised learning framework and a novel regularization strategy to facilitate self-supervised speaker representation learning. Different from contrastive learning-based self-supervised learning methods, the proposed self-supervised regularization (SSReg) focuses exclusively on the similarity between the latent representations of positive data pairs. We also explore the effectiveness of alternative online data augmentation strategies on both the time domain and frequency domain. With our strong online data augmentation strategy, the proposed SSReg shows the potential of self-supervised learning without using negative pairs and it can significantly improve the performance of self-supervised speaker representation learning with a simple Siamese network architecture. Comprehensive experiments on the VoxCeleb datasets demonstrate that our proposed self-supervised approach obtains a 23.4% relative improvement by adding the effective self-supervised regularization and outperforms other previous works."}}

In this study, we propose a novel framework to disentangle speaker-related and domain-specific features and apply domain adaptation on the speaker-related feature space solely. Instead of performing domain adaptation directly on the feature space where domain information is not removed, using disentanglement can efficiently boost adaptation performance. To be specific, our model\u2019s input speech from the source and target domains is first encoded into different latent feature spaces. The adversarial domain adaptation is conducted on the shared speaker-related feature space to encourage the property of domain-invariance. Further, we minimize the mutual information between speaker-related and domain-specific features for both do-mains to enforce the disentanglement. Experimental results on the VOiCES dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively generate more speaker-discriminative and domain-invariant speaker representations with a relative 20.3% reduction of EER com-pared to the original ResNet-based system."}}

In this study, we propose a pipeline solution to improve speaker verification on a small actual forensic field dataset. By leveraging large-scale out-of-domain datasets, a knowledge distillation based objective function is proposed for teacher-student learning, which is applied for short utterance forensic speaker verification. The objective function collectively considers speaker classification loss, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and similarity of embeddings. In order to advance the trained deep speaker embedding network to be robust for a small target dataset, we introduce a novel strategy to fine-tune the pre-trained student model towards a forensic target domain by utilizing the model as a finetuning start point and a reference in regularization. The proposed approaches are evaluated on the 1st 48-UTD forensic corpus, a newly established naturalistic dataset of actual homicide investigations consisting of short utterances recorded in uncontrolled conditions. We show that the proposed objective function can efficiently improve the performance of teacher-student learning on short utterances and that our fine-tuning strategy outperforms the commonly used weight decay method by providing an explicit inductive bias towards the pre-trained model."}}
