This paper introduces Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) as an efficient and effective alternative to full fine-tuning for large-scale Transformer models in vision. Taking inspiration from recent advances in efficiently tuning large language models, VPT introduces only a small amount (less than 1% of model parameters) of trainable parameters in the input space while keeping the model backbone frozen. Via extensive experiments on a wide variety of downstream recognition tasks, we show that VPT achieves significant performance gains compared to other parameter efficient tuning protocols. Most importantly, VPT even outperforms full fine-tuning in many cases across model capacities and training data scales, while reducing per-task storage cost.

Many of these posts express opinions on various aspects of society, but their unfalsifiable nature makes them ill-suited to fact-checking pipelines. In this work, we aim to distill such posts into a small set of narratives that capture the essential claims related to a given topic. Understanding and visualizing these narratives can facilitate more informed debates on social media. As a first step towards systematically identifying the underlying narratives on social media, we introduce PAPYER, a fine-grained dataset of online comments related to hygiene in public restrooms, which contains a multitude of unfalsifiable claims. We present a human-in-the-loop pipeline that uses a combination of machine and human kernels to discover the prevailing narratives and show that this pipeline outperforms recent large transformer models and state-of-the-art unsupervised topic models."}}

In this paper, we leverage such Visual Engagement clues as supervisory signals for representation learning. However, learning from engagement signals is non-trivial as it is not clear how to bridge the gap between low-level visual information and high-level social interactions. We present VisE, a weakly supervised learning approach, which maps social images to pseudo labels derived by clustered engagement signals. We then study how models trained in this way benefit subjective downstream computer vision tasks such as emotion recognition or political bias detection. Through extensive studies, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of VisE across a diverse set of classification tasks beyond the scope of conventional recognition <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> ."}}

In this paper, we study the intent behind social media images with an aim to analyze how visual information can help the recognition of human intent. Towards this goal, we introduce an intent dataset, Intentonomy, comprising 14K images covering a wide range of everyday scenes. These images are manually annotated with 28 intent categories that are derived from a social psychology taxonomy. We then systematically study whether, and to what extent, commonly used visual information, i.e., object and context, contribute to human motive understanding. Based on our findings, we conduct further study to quantify the effect of attending to object and context classes as well as textual information in the form of hashtags when training an intent classifier. Our results quantitatively and qualitatively shed light on how visual and textual information can produce observable effects when predicting intent."}}

Most deep learning-based methods rely on a late fusion technique whereby multiple feature types are encoded and concatenated and then a multi layer perceptron (MLP) combines the fused embedding to make predictions. This has several limitations, such as an unnatural enforcement that all features be present at all times as well as constraining only a constant number of occurrences of a feature modality at any given time. Furthermore, as more modalities are added, the concatenated embedding grows. To mitigate this, we propose Deep Multi-Modal Sets: a technique that represents a collection of features as an unordered set rather than one long ever-growing fixed-size vector. The set is constructed so that we have invariance both to permutations of the feature modalities as well as to the cardinality of the set. We will also show that with particular choices in our model architecture, we can yield interpretable feature performance such that during inference time we can observe which modalities are most contributing to the prediction.With this in mind, we demonstrate a scalable, multi-modal framework that reasons over different modalities to learn various types of tasks. We demonstrate new state-of-the-art performance on two multi-modal datasets (Ads-Parallelity [34] and MM-IMDb [1])."}}
