Such a capability could advance Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Planning algorithms, but achieving it is challenging. Inaccuracies in model estimates can compound, resulting in increased errors over long horizons. We approach this problem from the lens of Koopman theory, where the nonlinear dynamics of the environment can be linearized in a high-dimensional latent space. This allows us to efficiently parallelize the sequential problem of long-range prediction using convolution while accounting for the agent\u2019s action at every time step. Our approach also enables stability analysis and better control over gradients through time. Taken together, these advantages result in significant improvement over the existing approaches, both in the efficiency and the accuracy of modeling dynamics over extended horizons. We also show that this model can be easily incorporated into dynamics modeling for model-based planning and model-free RL and report promising experimental results."}}

We design methods for optimizing connection forms in local neighborhoods and apply these to a statistical analysis of heart fiber geometry, using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. This application of moving frames corroborates and extends recent characterizations of muscle fiber orientation in the heart wall, but also provides for a rich geometrical interpretation. In particular, we can now obtain direct local measurements of the variation of the helix and transverse angles, of fiber fanning and twisting, and of the curvatures of the heart wall in which these fibers lie."}}

A significant challenge for the quantitative analysis of such volumetric data using computer vision is the degradation of image quality at increased depths due to light scattering, absorption and optical factors. We here introduce a generative cycle consistent adversarial network (Cycle-GAN) to mitigate these effects, which exploits the property that since the tissue is self-similar, the appearance of the shallow layers can serve as a proxy for that of depth degradation-free data. The network model obtains a bi-directional mapping between the shallow and deep layers so that the restored deep layers resemble the shallow ones. We demonstrate this approach's utility on a dataset of images obtained by confocal imaging of thick cardiac tissue sections from the mouse. Our experiments show that the restored deeper layers are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the shallow ones, that the restored tissue images are amenable to geometric analysis and that in general such an approach outperforms other methods both qualitatively, as well as quantitatively."}}

Whereas prior work on exploiting symmetries in deep RL can only incorporate predefined linear transformations, our approach allows for non-linear symmetry transformations of state-action pairs to be learned from the data itself. This is achieved through an equivariant Lie algebraic parameterization of state and action encodings, equivariant latent transition models, and the use of symmetry-based losses. We demonstrate the advantages of our learned equivariant representations for Atari games, in a data-efficient setting limited to 100k steps of interactions with the environment. Our method, which we call Equivariant representations for RL (EqR), outperforms many previous methods in a similar setting by achieving a median human-normalized score of 0.418, and surpassing human-level performance on 8 out of the 26 games."}}

Such elements could be regions in an image output by a region proposal network, or words in a sentence, represented by word embedding. Thus far the learning of attention weights has been driven solely by the minimization of task specific loss functions. We introduce a method for learning attention weights to better emphasize informative pair-wise relations between entities. The key component is a novel center-mass cross entropy loss, which can be applied in conjunction with the task specific ones. We further introduce a focused attention backbone to learn these attention weights for general tasks. We demonstrate that the focused supervision leads to improved attention distribution across meaningful entities, and that it enhances the representation by aggregating features from them. Our focused attention module leads to state-of-the-art recovery of relations in a relationship proposal task and boosts performance for various vision and language tasks."}}

Such systems have been trained on photographs which include color, texture and shading cues. The geometry of shapes and surfaces, as conveyed by scene contours, is not explicitly considered for this task. Remarkably, humans can accurately recognize natural scenes from line drawings, which consist solely of contour-based shape cues. Here we report the first computer vision study on scene categorization of line drawings derived from popular databases including an artist scene database, MIT67 and Places365. Specifically, we use off-the-shelf pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform scene classification given only contour information as input, and find performance levels well above chance. We also show that medial-axis based contour salience methods can be used to select more informative subsets of contour pixels, and that the variation in CNN classification performance on various choices for these subsets is qualitatively similar to that observed in human performance. Moreover, when the salience measures are used to weight the contours, we find that these weights boost our CNN performance above that for unweighted contour input. That is, the medial axis based salience weights appear to add useful information that is not available when CNNs are trained to use contours alone."}}

Many recent methods frame object skeleton detection as a binary pixel classification problem, which is similar in spirit to learning-based edge detection, as well as to semantic segmentation methods. In the present article, we depart from this strategy by training a CNN to predict a two-dimensional vector field, which maps each scene point to a candidate skeleton pixel, in the spirit of flux-based skeletonization algorithms. This \"image context flux\" representation has two major advantages over previous approaches. First, it explicitly encodes the relative position of skeletal pixels to semantically meaningful entities, such as the image points in their spatial context, and hence also the implied object boundaries. Second, since the skeleton detection context is a region-based vector field, it is better able to cope with object parts of large width. We evaluate the proposed method on three benchmark datasets for skeleton detection and two for symmetry detection, achieving consistently superior performance over state-of-the-art methods."}}

Thus far, however, point features have been abstracted in an independent and isolated manner, ignoring the relative layout of neighboring points as well as their features. In the present article, we propose to overcome this limitation by using spectral graph convolution on a local graph, combined with a novel graph pooling strategy. In our approach, graph convolution is carried out on a nearest neighbor graph constructed from a point\u2019s neighborhood, such that features are jointly learned. We replace the standard max pooling step with a recursive clustering and pooling strategy, devised to aggregate information from within clusters of nodes that are close to one another in their spectral coordinates, leading to richer overall feature descriptors. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets, we show a consistent demonstrable advantage for the tasks of both point set classification and segmentation.

However, their application to object recognition and detection thus far has focused largely on intensity or color images as inputs. Motivated by demonstrations that depth can enhance the performance of CNN-based approaches [2][5], in this paper we consider the benefits of also including differential geometric shape features. This elementary idea of using zeroth order (depth), first-order (surface normal) and second-order (surface curvature) features in a principled manner boosts the performance of a CNN that has been pretrained on a color image database. Notably, in an object detection task involving 19 categories we achieve 39.30% accuracy on the NYUv2 dataset, which is a 10.4% improvement over the current state-of-the-art accuracy of 35.6% using the method in [5]. In the simpler scenario of turntable style object recognition, our experiments on the University of Washington (UW) RGB-D dataset yield an accuracy of 88.7% correct recognition over 51 object categories, where the best competing result is 87.5% [2]. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that the abstraction of surface shape benefits object detection and recognition."}}
