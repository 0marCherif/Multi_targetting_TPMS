AV companies typically focus on collecting data from diverse scenarios and locations, but not camera rig configurations, due to cost. As a result, only a small number of rig variations exist across most fleets. In this paper, we study how AV perception models are affected by changes in camera viewpoint and propose a way to scale them across vehicle types without repeated data collection and labeling. Using bird\u2019s eye view (BEV) segmentation as a motivating task, we find through extensive experiments that existing perception models are surprisingly sensitive to changes in camera viewpoint. When trained with data from one camera rig, small changes to pitch, yaw, depth, or height of the camera at inference time lead to large drops in performance. We introduce a technique for novel view synthesis and use it to transform collected data to the viewpoint of target rigs, allowing us to train BEV segmentation models for diverse target rigs without any additional data collection or labeling cost. To analyze the impact of viewpoint changes, we leverage synthetic data to mitigate other gaps (content, ISP, etc). Our approach is then trained on real data and evaluated on synthetic data, enabling evaluation on diverse target rigs. We release all data for use in future work. Our method is able to recover an average of 14.7% of the IoU that is otherwise lost when deploying to new rigs."}}

Modern mass media make extensive use of images to persuade people to make commercial and political decisions. These effects and techniques are widely studied in the social sciences, but behavioral studies do not scale to massive datasets. Computer vision has made great strides in building syntactical representations of images, such as detection and identification of objects. However, the pervasive use of images for communicative purposes has been largely ignored. We extend the significant advances in syntactic analysis in computer vision to the higher-level challenge of understanding the underlying communicative intent implied in images. We begin by identifying nine dimensions of persuasive intent latent in images of politicians, such as \"socially dominant, \" \"energetic, \" and \"trustworthy, \" and propose a hierarchical model that builds on the layer of syntactical attributes, such as \"smile\" and \"waving hand, \" to predict the intents presented in the images. To facilitate progress, we introduce a new dataset of 1, 124 images of politicians labeled with ground-truth intents in the form of rankings. This study demonstrates that a systematic focus on visual persuasion opens up the field of computer vision to a new class of investigations around mediated images, intersecting with media analysis, psychology, and political communication."}}

Primarily focusing on the latter, recent studies of emergent communication overlook the sketches; they do not account for the evolution process through which symbolic sign systems emerge in the trade-off between iconicity and symbolicity. In this work, we take the very first step to model and simulate this process via two neural agents playing a visual communication game; the sender communicates with the receiver by sketching on a canvas. We devise a novel reinforcement learning method such that agents are evolved jointly towards successful communication and abstract graphical conventions. To inspect the emerged conventions, we define three key properties -- iconicity, symbolicity, and semanticity -- and design evaluation methods accordingly. Our experimental results under different controls are consistent with the observation in studies of human graphical conventions. Of note, we find that evolved sketches can preserve the continuum of semantics under proper environmental pressures. More interestingly, co-evolved agents can switch between conventionalized and iconic communication based on their familiarity with referents. We hope the present research can pave the path for studying emergent communication with the modality of sketches."}}

One of the most fundamental collaborative tasks in any setting is the object handover. Human-to-robot handovers can take either of two approaches: (1) direct hand-to-hand or (2) indirect hand-to-placement-to-pick-up. The latter approach ensures minimal contact between the human and robot but can also result in increased idle time due to having to wait for the object to first be placed down on a surface. To minimize such idle time, the robot must preemptively predict the human intent of where the object will be placed. Furthermore, for the robot to preemptively act in any sort of productive manner, predictions and motion planning must occur in real-time. We introduce a novel prediction-planning pipeline that allows the robot to preemptively move towards the human agent's intended placement location using gaze and gestures as model inputs. In this paper, we investigate the performance and drawbacks of our early intent predictor-planner as well as the practical benefits of using such a pipeline through a human-robot case study."}}

MMCHIVED contains city-day event data using a new source of data, text and images shared on social media. These data enables the improved measurement of theoretically important variables such as protest size, protester and state violence, protester demographics, and emotions. In Venezuela, MMCHIVED records many more protests than existing datasets. In Chile, it records slightly more events than the Armed Conflict Location and Events Dataset (ACLED). These extra events are from small cities far from Caracas and Santiago, an improvement of coverage over datasets that rely on newspapers, and the paper confirms they are true positives. While MMCHIVED covers protest events in Chile and Venezuela, the approach used in the paper is generalizable and could generate protest event data in 107 countries containing 97.14% of global GDP and 82.7% of the world's population."}}

Due to their high geometric nonlinearity and elasticity, rod-on-rod contact remains a challenging problem tackled by researchers in both computational mechanics and computer graphics. Typically, frictional contact is regarded as constraints for the equations of motions of a system. Such constraints are often computed independently at every time step in a dynamic simulation, thus slowing down the simulation and possibly introducing numerical convergence issues. This paper proposes a fully implicit penalty-based frictional contact method, Implicit Contact Model (IMC), that efficiently and robustly captures accurate frictional contact responses. We showcase our algorithm's performance for the challenging and novel contact scenario of flagella bundling in fluid medium, a significant phenomenon in biology that motivates novel engineering applications in soft robotics. In addition to this, we offer a side-by-side comparison with Incremental Potential Contact (IPC), a state-of-the-art contact handling algorithm. We show that IMC possesses comparable accuracy to IPC while converging at a faster rate for the flagella bundling case."}}

Recent studies have shown that many computer vision models and datasets exhibit demographic biases and proposed mitigation strategies. These works attempt to address accuracy disparity, spurious correlations, or unbalanced representations in datasets in tasks such as face recognition, verification and expression and attribute classification. These tasks, however, all require face detection as the first preprocessing step, and surprisingly, there has been little effort in identifying or mitigating biases in face detection. Biased face detectors themselves pose a threat against fair and ethical AI systems, and their biases may be further passed on to subsequent downstream tasks such as face recognition in a computer vision pipeline. This paper therefore investigates the problem of biases in face detection, focusing on accuracy disparity of detectors between demographic groups including gender, age group, and skin tone. We collect perceived demographic attributes on a popular face detection benchmark dataset, WIDER FACE, report skewed demographic distributions, and compare detection performance between groups. In order to mitigate the biases, we apply three mitigation methods that have been introduced in the recent literature and also propose two novel methods. Experimental results show that these methods are effective in reducing demographic biases. We also discuss how the effectiveness varies by demographic attributes, detection easiness, and multiple detectors, which will shed light on this new topic of addressing face detection bias."}}

However, generating semantic explanations about the learned representation is challenging without direct supervision to produce such explanations. We propose a general framework, Latent Visual Semantic Explainer (LaViSE), to teach any existing convolutional neural network to generate text descriptions about its own latent representations at the filter level. Our method constructs a mapping between the visual and semantic spaces using generic image datasets, using images and category names. It then transfers the mapping to the target domain which does not have semantic labels. The proposed framework employs a modular structure and enables to analyze any trained network whether or not its original training data is available. We show that our method can generate novel descriptions for learned filters beyond the set of categories defined in the training dataset and perform an extensive evaluation on multiple datasets. We also demonstrate a novel application of our method for unsupervised dataset bias analysis which allows us to automatically discover hidden biases in datasets or compare different subsets without using additional labels. The dataset and code are made public to facilitate further research."}}
