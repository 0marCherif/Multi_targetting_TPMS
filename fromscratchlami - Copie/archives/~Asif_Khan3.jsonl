The complementarity determining region 3 of the antibody variable heavy chain (CDRH3) often dominates antigen-binding specificity.

The combinatorial structure of CDRH3 sequences makes it impossible to query binding-affinity oracles exhaustively. Moreover, antibodies are expected to have high target specificity and developability. Here, we present AntBO, a combinatorial Bayesian optimization framework utilizing a CDRH3 trust region for an in silico design of antibodies with favorable developability scores. The in silico experiments on 159 antigens demonstrate that AntBO is a step toward practically viable in vitro antibody design. In under 200 calls to the oracle, AntBO suggests antibodies outperforming the best binding sequence from 6.9 million experimentally obtained CDRH3s. Additionally, AntBO finds very-high-affinity CDRH3 in only 38 protein designs while requiring no domain knowledge."}}

The CDRH3 region located at the tip of variable chains of an antibody dominates antigen-binding specificity. Therefore, it is a priority to design optimal antigen-specific CDRH3 regions to develop therapeutic antibodies. However, the combinatorial nature of CDRH3 sequence space makes it impossible to search for an optimal binding sequence exhaustively and efficiently using computational approaches. Here, we present \\texttt{AntBO}: a combinatorial Bayesian optimisation framework enabling efficient \\textit{in silico} design of the CDRH3 region. Ideally, antibodies are expected to have high target specificity and developability. We introduce a CDRH3 trust region that restricts the search to sequences with favourable developability scores to achieve this goal. For benchmarking, \\texttt{AntBO} uses the \\texttt{Absolut!} software suite as a black-box oracle to score the target specificity and affinity of designed antibodies \\textit{in silico} in an unconstrained fashion~\\citep{robert2021one}. The experiments performed for $159$ discretised antigens used in \\texttt{Absolut!} demonstrate the benefit of \\texttt{AntBO} in designing CDRH3 regions with diverse biophysical properties. In under $200$ calls to black-box oracle, \\texttt{AntBO} can suggest antibody sequences that outperform the best binding sequence drawn from 6.9 million experimentally obtained CDRH3s and a commonly used genetic algorithm baseline. Additionally, \\texttt{AntBO} finds very-high affinity CDRH3 sequences in only 38 protein designs whilst requiring no domain knowledge. We conclude \\texttt{AntBO} brings automated antibody design methods closer to what is practically viable for in vitro experimentation."}}

To reconstruct the speech signal first a magnitude spectrogram is generated by the neural network, which is then utilized by methods like the Griffin-Lim algorithm to reconstruct a phase spectrogram. This procedure bears the problem that the generated magnitude spectrogram may not be consistent, which is required for finding a phase such that the full spectrogram has a natural-sounding speech waveform. In this work, we approach this problem by proposing a condition encouraging spectrogram consistency during the adversarial training procedure. We demonstrate our approach on the task of translating the voice of a male speaker to that of a female speaker, and vice versa. Our experimental results on the Librispeech corpus show that the model trained with the TF consistency provides a perceptually better quality of speech-to-speech conversion."}}

Each literal node contains an entity\u2019s attribute value (e.g.\u00a0the height of an entity of type person) and thereby encodes information which in general cannot be represented by relations between entities alone. However, most of the existing embedding- or latent-feature-based methods for knowledge graph analysis only consider entity nodes and relation edges, and thus do not take the information provided by literals into account. In this paper, we extend existing latent feature methods for link prediction by a simple portable module for incorporating literals, which we name LiteralE. Unlike in concurrent methods where literals are incorporated by adding a literal-dependent term to the output of the scoring function and thus only indirectly affect the entity embeddings, LiteralE directly enriches these embeddings with information from literals via a learnable parametrized function. This function can be easily integrated into the scoring function of existing methods and learned along with the entity embeddings in an end-to-end manner. In an extensive empirical study over three datasets, we evaluate LiteralE-extended versions of various state-of-the-art latent feature methods for link prediction and demonstrate that LiteralE presents an effective way to improve their performance. For these experiments, we augmented standard datasets with their literals, which we publicly provide as testbeds for further research. Moreover, we show that LiteralE leads to an qualitative improvement of the embeddings and that it can be easily extended to handle literals from different modalities."}}
