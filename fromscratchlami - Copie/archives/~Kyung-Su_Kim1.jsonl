Flatness, which measures the perturbation resilience of pre-trained parameters for loss values, is widely acknowledged as an essential predictor of generalization. While the concept of flatness has been formalized as a PAC-Bayes bound, it has been observed that the generalization bounds can vary arbitrarily depending on the scale of the model parameters. Despite previous attempts to address this issue, generalization bounds remain vulnerable to function-preserving scaling transformations or are limited to impractical network structures. In this paper, we introduce new PAC-Bayes prior and posterior distributions invariant to scaling transformations, achieved through the \\textit{decomposition of perturbations into scale and connectivity components}. In this way, this approach expands the range of networks to which the resulting generalization bound can be applied, including those with practical transformations such as weight decay with batch normalization. Moreover, we demonstrate that scale-dependency issues of flatness can adversely affect the uncertainty calibration of Laplace approximation, and we propose a solution using our invariant posterior. Our proposed invariant posterior allows for effective measurement of flatness and calibration with low complexity while remaining invariant to practical parameter transformations, also applying it as a reliable predictor of neural network generalization."}}

However, the main limitation of the MUSIC-like methods is that they most likely fail to recover the signal when a partial support estimate of k \u2212 rank ( X 0 ) indices for their input is not fully correct. We proposed a computationally efficient algorithm called two-stage iterative method to detect the remained support (T-IDRS), its special version termed by two-stage orthogonal subspace matching pursuit (TSMP), and its variant called TSMP with sparse Bayesian learning (TSML) by exploiting more than the sparsity k to estimate the signal matrix. They improve on the MUSIC-like methods such that these are guaranteed to recover the signal and its support while the existing MUSIC-like methods will fail in the practically significant case of MMV when rank ( X 0 ) \u2215 k is sufficiently small. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes have low complexities and most likely outperform other related methods. A condition of the minimum m required for TSMP to recover the signal matrix is derived in the noiseless case to be applicable to a wide class of the sensing matrix."}}

Unlike the maximum a posteriori (MAP) support detection, which was proposed by Lee to estimate the support by selecting an index with the maximum likelihood ratio of the correlation given by a normalized version of the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), the proposed method uses the correlation given by the matching pursuit proposed by Davies and Eldar. BMMP exploits the diversity gain to estimate the support by considering multiple support candidates, each of which is obtained by iteratively selecting an index set with a size different for each candidate. In particular, BMMP considers an extended support estimate whose maximal size is $m$ in the process to obtain each of the support candidates. It is observed that BMMP outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and approaches the ideal limit of the signal sparsity in our simulation setting."}}

These contents are, unhappily, processed and distributed without protection. This paper proposes a practical video watermarking technique on the compressed domain that is real-time and robust against video processing attacks. In particular, we focus on video processing that is commonly used in practice such as downscaling resolution, framerate changing, and transcoding. Most previous watermarking algorithms are unable to survive when these processings are strong or composite. We extract low frequency coefficients of frames in fast by partly decoding videos and apply a quantization index modulation scheme to embed and detect the watermark. On an Intel architecture computer, we implement a prototype system and measure performance against video processing attacks frequently occur in the real world. Simulation results show that our video watermarking system satisfies real-time requirements and is robust to protect the copyright of HD video contents."}}

The proposed scheme enables the detection of a tampered region and then recovers it by using the embedded information selected as the recovery feature. Moreover, since reversibility helps in taking the correct decision during image analysis, it is highly desired in quality-sensitive imaging such as medical imaging and satellite imaging, where even minimal distortion introduced by embedding data is unacceptable. To extract the recovery feature, we analyze the image homogeneity using quad-tree decomposition, which adaptively divides a square image into several variable-sized blocks, and choose the average value of each block as the feature. This makes the length of the feature more efficient while ensuring that the visual quality of the restored image is better than that in the case of the conventional fixed-size block-based approach. Through experiments on 8-bit, 12-bit, and 16-bit images, we demonstrate the effectiveness of tampering localization of the proposed method and show that restoration is achieved with high visual quality. Highlights \u25ba We model region-based image tampering detection and restoring scheme. \u25ba We utilize reversible data hiding technique and image homogeneity analysis. \u25ba Effectiveness of tampering localization is examined for 8-,12-,16-bit images. \u25ba Recovery performance for the tampered edge and texture areas is outstanding.
