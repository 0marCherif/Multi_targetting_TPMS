When it comes to climate predictions, fine spatio-temporal resolutions are required to resolve all turbulent scales in the fluid simulations. This makes the task of accurately resolving these scales computationally out of reach even with modern supercomputers. As a result, climate modelers solve these PDEs on grids that are too coarse (3km to 200km on each side), which hinders the accuracy and usefulness of the predictions. In this paper, we leverage the recent advances in Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to design a novel architecture that predicts the spatially continuous solution of a PDE given a spatial position query. By augmenting coordinate-based architectures with Graph Neural Networks (GNN), we enable zero-shot generalization to new non-uniform meshes and long-term predictions up to 250 frames ahead that are physically consistent. Our Mesh Agnostic Neural PDE Solver (MAgNet) is able to make accurate predictions across a variety of PDE simulation datasets and compares favorably with existing baselines. Moreover, our model generalizes well to different meshes and resolutions up to four times those trained on."}}

Based on ground temperature time series at different depths, we estimate the diffusivity at 49 Swiss stations using Fourier analysis. Using a geology database, the diffusivity estimations are cross-validated with typical values for common rocks. Random Forests, an ML algorithm, are used to train a model using the previous diffusivity estimations as output values and multiple geological, elevation and temperature features. The model, showing a testing error of 16.5%, is then used to perform the estimation of apparent diffusivity everywhere in Switzerland."}}
