The evolution of these networks over time has motivated several recent studies to identify local communities in temporal networks. Given any query nodes, Community Search aims to find a densely connected subgraph containing query nodes. However, existing community search approaches in temporal networks have two main limitations: (1) they adopt pre-defined subgraph patterns to model communities, which cannot find communities that do not conform to these patterns in real-world networks, and (2) they only use the aggregation of disjoint structural information to measure quality, missing the dynamic of connections and temporal properties. In this paper, we propose a query-driven Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (CS-TGN) that can capture flexible community structures by learning from the ground-truth communities in a data-driven manner. CS-TGN first combines the local query-dependent structure and the global graph embedding in each snapshot of the network and then uses a GRU cell with contextual attention to learn the dynamics of interactions and update node embeddings over time. We demonstrate how this model can be used for interactive community search in an online setting, allowing users to evaluate the found communities and provide feedback. Experiments on real-world temporal graphs with ground-truth communities validate the superior quality of the solutions obtained and the efficiency of our model in both temporal and interactive static settings."}}

Given any query nodes, CS seeks to find a densely connected subgraph containing query nodes. Most existing approaches usually study networks with a single type of proximity between nodes, which defines a single view of a network. However, in many applications such as biological, social, and transportation networks, interactions between objects span multiple aspects, yielding networks with multiple views, called multiplex networks. Existing CS approaches in multiplex networks adopt pre-defined subgraph patterns to model the communities, which cannot find communities that do not have such pre-defined patterns in real-world networks. In this paper, we propose a query-driven graph convolutional network in multiplex networks, CS-MLGCN, that can capture flexible community structures by learning from the ground-truth communities in a data-driven fashion. CS-MLGCN first combines the local query-dependent structure and global graph embedding in each type of proximity and then uses an attention mechanism to incorporate information on different types of relations. Experiments on real-world graphs with ground-truth communities validate the quality of the solutions we obtain and the efficiency of our model."}}

In applications such as biological, social, and transportation networks, interactions between objects span multiple aspects. Multilayer (ML) networks have been proposed for accurately modeling such applications. In this paper, we present FirmCore, a new family of dense subgraphs in ML networks, and show that it satisfies many of the nice properties of k-cores in single-layer graphs. Unlike the state of the art core decomposition of ML graphs, FirmCores have a polynomial time algorithm, making them a powerful tool for understanding the structure of massive ML networks. We also extend FirmCore for directed ML graphs. We show that FirmCores and directed FirmCores can be used to obtain efficient approximation algorithms for finding the densest subgraphs of ML graphs and their directed counterparts. Our extensive experiments over several real ML graphs show that our FirmCore decomposition algorithm is significantly more efficient than known algorithms for core decompositions of ML graphs. Furthermore, it returns solutions of matching or better quality for the densest subgraph problem over (possibly directed) ML graphs."}}
