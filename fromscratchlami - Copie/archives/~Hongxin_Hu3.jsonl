However, those edge-cloud collaborative inference systems are vulnerable to emerging reconstruction attacks, where malicious cloud service providers are able to recover the edge-side users\u2019 private data. To defend against such attacks, several defense countermeasures have been recently introduced. Unfortunately, little is known about the robustness of those defense countermeasures. In this paper, we take the first step towards measuring the robustness of those state-of-the-art defenses with respect to reconstruction attacks. Specifically, we show that the latent privacy features are still retained in the obfuscated representations. Motivated by such an observation, we design a technology called Sensitive Feature Distillation (SFD) to restore sensitive information from the protected feature representations. Our experiments show that SFD can break through defense mechanisms in model partitioning scenarios, demonstrating the inadequacy of existing defense mechanisms as a privacy-preserving technique against reconstruction attacks. We hope our findings inspire further work in improving the robustness of defense mechanisms against reconstruction attacks for collaborative inference systems."}}

In deep learning, a typical strategy for transfer learning is to freeze the early layers of a pre-trained model and fine-tune the rest of its layers on the target domain. Previous work focuses on the accuracy of the transferred model but neglects the transfer of adversarial robustness. In this work, we first show that transfer learning improves the accuracy on the target domain but degrades the inherited robustness of the target model. To address such a problem, we propose a novel cooperative adversarially-robust transfer learning (CARTL) by pre-training the model via feature distance minimization and fine-tuning the pre-trained model with non-expansive fine-tuning for target domain tasks. Empirical results show that CARTL improves the inherited robustness by about 28% at most compared with the baseline with the same degree of accuracy. Furthermore, we study the relationship between the batch normalization (BN) layers and the robustness in the context of transfer learning, and we reveal that freezing BN layers can further boost the robustness transfer."}}

The lack of interpretability makes DL-based networking systems prohibitive to deploy in practice. In this paper, we propose Metis, a framework that provides interpretability for two general categories of networking problems spanning local and global control. Accordingly, Metis introduces two different interpretation methods based on decision tree and hypergraph, where it converts DNN policies to interpretable rule-based controllers and highlight critical components based on analysis over hypergraph. We evaluate Metis over two categories of state-of-the-art DL-based networking systems and show that Metis provides human-readable interpretations while preserving nearly no degradation in performance. We further present four concrete use cases of Metis, showcasing how Metis helps network operators to design, debug, deploy, and ad-hoc adjust DL-based networking systems."}}

The IoT malware attacks are usually composed of three stages: intrusion, infection and monetization. Existing approaches for IoT malware detection cannot effectively identify the executed malicious activities at intrusion and infection stages, and thus cannot help stop potential attacks timely. In this paper, we present DeepPower, a non-intrusive approach to infer malicious activities of IoT malware via analyzing power side-channel signals using deep learning. DeepPower first filters raw power signals of IoT devices to obtain suspicious signals, and then performs a fine-grained analysis on these signals to infer corresponding executed activities inside the devices. DeepPower determines whether there exists an ongoing malware infection by conducting a correlation analysis on these identified activities. We implement a prototype of DeepPower leveraging low-cost sensors and devices and evaluate the effectiveness of DeepPower against real-world IoT malware using commodity IoT devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that DeepPower is able to detect infection activities of different IoT malware with a high accuracy without any changes to the monitored devices."}}

However, with the soaring throughput of networks reaching hundreds of Gbps, it becomes more and more challenging for traffic analysis applications to keep up with today's high-speed large-volume network traffic. In particular, existing feature extractor components in traffic analysis are suffering from undesirable communications, storage, and computation bottleneck. To this end, this paper presents FastFE, a high-speed feature extractor that leverages the capability of new-generation programmable switches to generate desired traffic features flexibly and efficiently. We provide a set of general, easy-to-use, and expressive interfaces for operators to express which traic features they desire, and a policy enforcement engine that can effectively translate these policies into underlying primitives in programmable switches and commodity servers. Our case study on a state-of-the-art ML-based traffic analysis application, Kitsune, demonstrates the significant advancement of FastFE and its low overheads. As an ongoing work, we are working on a full prototype design and implementation, and hope FastFE can serve as a crucial build block for future ML-based traffic analysis applications."}}

Each Crescendo block contains independent convolution paths with increased depths. The numbers of convolution layers and parameters are only increased linearly in Crescendo blocks. In experiments, CrescendoNet with only 15 layers outperforms almost all networks without residual connections on benchmark datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN. Given sufficient amount of data as in SVHN dataset, CrescendoNet with 15 layers and 4.1M parameters can match the performance of DenseNet-BC with 250 layers and 15.3M parameters. CrescendoNet provides a new way to construct high performance deep convolutional neural networks without residual connections. Moreover, through investigating the behavior and performance of subnetworks in CrescendoNet, we note that the high performance of CrescendoNet may come from its implicit ensemble behavior, which differs from the FractalNet that is also a deep convolutional neural network without residual connections. Furthermore, the independence between paths in CrescendoNet allows us to introduce a new path-wise training procedure, which can reduce the memory needed for training."}}
