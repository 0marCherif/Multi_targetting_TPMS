Used in combination with deep learning, such systems now offer state-of-the-art performance at monocular depth estimation, extended depth-of-field imaging, lensless imaging, and other tasks. Inspired by recent advances in spatial light modulator (SLM) technology, this paper answers a natural question: Can one encode additional information and achieve superior performance by changing a phase mask dynamically over time? We first prove that the set of PSFs described by static phase masks is non-convex and that, as a result, time-averaged PSFs generated by dynamic phase masks are fundamentally more expressive. We then demonstrate, in simulation, that time-averaged dynamic (TiDy) phase masks can offer substantially improved monocular depth estimation and extended depth-of-field imaging performance."}}

Accordingly, a host of specialized HDR sensors have been developed, the most successful of which are based on capturing variable per-pixel exposures. In essence, these methods capture an entire exposure bracket sequence at once in a single shot. This paper presents a straightforward but highly effective approach for turning an off-the-shelf polarization camera into a high-performance HDR camera. By placing a linear polarizer in front of the polarization camera, we are able to simultaneously capture four images with varied exposures, which are determined by the orientation of the polarizer. We develop an outlier-robust and self-calibrating algorithm to reconstruct an HDR image (at a single polarity) from these measurements. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with extensive real-world experiments."}}

While one can solve such problems by training a neural network with vast quantities of paired training data, such paired training data is often unavailable. In this paper, we propose a generalized framework for training image reconstruction networks when paired training data is scarce. In particular, we demonstrate the ability of image denoising algorithms and, by extension, denoising diffusion models to supervise network training in the absence of paired training data."}}

By imaging the eyes of a moving person, we can collect multiple views of a scene outside the camera's direct line of sight through the reflections in the eyes. In this paper, we reconstruct a 3D scene beyond the camera's line of sight using portrait images containing eye reflections. This task is challenging due to 1) the difficulty of accurately estimating eye poses and 2) the entangled appearance of the eye iris and the scene reflections. Our method jointly refines the cornea poses, the radiance field depicting the scene, and the observer's eye iris texture. We further propose a simple regularization prior on the iris texture pattern to improve reconstruction quality. Through various experiments on synthetic and real-world captures featuring people with varied eye colors, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to recover 3D scenes using eye reflections."}}

In addition, training such a network is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality: As one increases the dimensions of the specification-space (i.e., the number of parameters needed to describe the noise distribution) the number of unique specifications one needs to train for grows exponentially. Uniformly sampling this space will result in a network that does well at very challenging problem specifications but poorly at easy problem specifications, where even large errors will have a small effect on the overall mean-squared-error. \nIn this work we propose training denoising networks using an adaptive-sampling strategy. Our work improves upon a recent universal denoiser training strategy by extending the results to higher dimensions and by incorporating a polynomial approximation of the true specification-loss landscape. We test our method on joint Poisson-Gaussian-speckle noise and demonstrate that, with our training strategy, a single trained generalist denoiser network can achieve mean-squared-errors within a relatively uniform bound of specialized denoiser networks across a large range of operating conditions."}}

Our approach requires no paired training data, adapts itself to the distribution of the turbulence, leverages domain-specific data priors, and can generalize from tens to thousands of measurements. We achieve such functionality through an adversarial sensing framework adapted from CryoGAN (Gupta et al. 2021), which uses a discriminator network to match the distributions of captured and simulated measurements. Our framework builds on CryoGAN by (1) generalizing the forward measurement model to incorporate physically accurate and computationally efficient models for light propagation through anisoplanatic turbulence, (2) enabling adaptation to slightly misspecified forward models, and (3) leveraging domain-specific prior knowledge using pretrained generative networks, when available. We validate TurbuGAN on both computationally simulated and experimentally captured images distorted with anisoplanatic turbulence."}}

Unlike pretrained feedforward neural networks, the same DIP can generalize to arbitrary inverse problems, from denoising to phase retrieval, while offering competitive performance at each task. The central disadvantage of DIP is that, while feedforward neural networks can reconstruct an image in a single pass, DIP must gradually update its weights over hundreds to thousands of iterations, at a significant computational cost. In this work we use meta-learning to massively accelerate DIP-based reconstructions. By learning a proper initialization for the DIP weights, we demonstrate a 10x improvement in runtimes across a range of inverse imaging tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that a network trained to quickly reconstruct faces also generalizes to reconstructing natural image patches."}}
