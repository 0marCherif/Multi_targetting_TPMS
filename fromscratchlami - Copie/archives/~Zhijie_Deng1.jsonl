Yet, the data collected from the open world are unavoidably polluted by noise, which may significantly undermine the efficacy of the learned models. Various attempts have been made to reliably train DNNs under data noise, but they separately account for either the noise existing in the labels or that existing in the images. A naive combination of the two lines of works would suffer from the limitations in both sides, and miss the opportunities to handle the two kinds of noise in parallel. This works provides a first, unified framework for reliable learning under the joint (image, label)-noise. Technically, we develop a confidence-based sample filter to progressively filter out noisy data without the need of pre-specifying noise ratio. Then, we penalize the model uncertainty of the detected noisy data instead of letting the model continue over-fitting the misleading information in them. Experimental results on various challenging synthetic and real-world noisy datasets verify that the proposed method can outperform competing baselines in the aspect of classification performance."}}

Traditional nonparametric solutions based on the Nystr\u00f6m formula suffer from scalability issues. Recent work has resorted to a parametric approach, i.e., training neural networks to approximate the eigenfunctions. However, the existing method relies on an expensive orthogonalization step and is difficult to implement. We show that these problems can be fixed by using a new series of objective functions that generalizes the EigenGame~\\citep{gemp2020eigengame} to function space. We test our method on a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning problems and show it provides accurate approximations to the eigenfunctions of polynomial, radial basis, neural network Gaussian process, and neural tangent kernels. Finally, we demonstrate our method can scale up linearised Laplace approximation of deep neural networks to modern image classification datasets through approximating the Gauss-Newton matrix.

Moreover, modern neural networks have been found to be poorly calibrated and make overconfident predictions regardless of inherent sample difficulty and data uncertainty. To address this issue, we propose to utilize large-scale pre-trained models to guide downstream model training with sample difficulty-aware entropy regularization. Pre-trained models that have been exposed to large-scale datasets and do not overfit the downstream training classes enable us to measure each training sample difficulty via feature-space Gaussian modeling and relative Mahalanobis distance computation. Importantly, by adaptively penalizing overconfident prediction based on the sample's difficulty, we simultaneously improve accuracy and uncertainty calibration on various challenging benchmarks, consistently surpassing competitive baselines for reliable prediction."}}

A MOGP prior over the parameters of the dedicated likelihoods for classification, regression and point process tasks can facilitate sharing of information between heterogeneous tasks, while allowing for nonparametric parameter estimation. To circumvent the non-conjugate Bayesian inference in the MOGP modulated heterogeneous multi-task framework, we employ the data augmentation technique and derive a mean-field approximation to realize closed-form iterative updates for estimating model parameters. We demonstrate the performance and inference on both 1D synthetic data as well as 2D urban data of Vancouver."}}

This paper aims to bridge the gap, establishing a simple and effective baseline for training-free diffusion model-based long video editing. As suggested by prior arts, we build the pipeline upon ControlNet, which excels at various image editing tasks based on text prompts. To break down the length constraints caused by limited computational memory, we split the long video into consecutive windows and develop a novel cross-window attention mechanism to ensure the consistency of global style and maximize the smoothness among windows. To achieve more accurate control, we extract the information from the source video via DDIM inversion and integrate the outcomes into the latent states of the generations. We also incorporate a video frame interpolation model to mitigate the frame-level flickering issue. Extensive empirical studies verify the superior efficacy of our method over competing baselines across scenarios, including the replacement of the attributes of foreground objects, style transfer, and background replacement. In particular, our method manages to edit videos with up to 128 frames according to user requirements. Code is available at https://github.com/zhijie-group/LOVECon."}}

The real-world applications of these models require particular attention to their safety and fidelity, but this has not been sufficiently explored. One fundamental question is whether existing T2I DMs are robust against variations over input texts. To answer it, this work provides the first robustness evaluation of T2I DMs against real-world attacks. Unlike prior studies that focus on malicious attacks involving apocryphal alterations to the input texts, we consider an attack space spanned by realistic errors (e.g., typo, glyph, phonetic) that humans can make, to ensure semantic consistency. Given the inherent randomness of the generation process, we develop novel distribution-based attack objectives to mislead T2I DMs. We perform attacks in a black-box manner without any knowledge of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for attacking popular T2I DMs and simultaneously reveal their non-trivial robustness issues. Moreover, we provide an in-depth analysis of our method to show that it is not designed to attack the text encoder in T2I DMs solely."}}

Traditional solutions prioritizing easy or hard samples lack the flexibility to handle such a variety simultaneously. Recent work has proposed a more reasonable data selection principle by examining the data's impact on the model's generalization loss. However, its practical adoption relies on less principled approximations and additional clean holdout data. This work solves these problems by leveraging a lightweight Bayesian treatment and incorporating off-the-shelf zero-shot predictors built on large-scale pre-trained models. The resulting algorithm is efficient and easy-to-implement. We perform extensive empirical studies on challenging benchmarks with considerable data noise and imbalance in the online batch selection scenario, and observe superior training efficiency over competitive baselines. Notably, on the challenging WebVision benchmark, our method can achieve similar predictive performance with significantly fewer training iterations than leading data selection methods."}}

A typical DPM framework includes a forward process that gradually diffuses the data distribution and a reverse process that recovers the data distribution from time-dependent data scores. In this work, we observe that the stochastic reverse process of data scores is a martingale, from which concentration bounds and the optional stopping theorem for data scores can be derived. Then, we discover a simple way for calibrating an arbitrary pretrained DPM, with which the score matching loss can be reduced and the lower bounds of model likelihood can consequently be increased. We provide general calibration guidelines under various model parametrizations. Our calibration method is performed only once and the resulting models can be used repeatedly for sampling. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets to empirically validate our proposal. Our code is at https://github.com/thudzj/Calibrated-DPMs."}}
