In this paper we propose two methodologies aimed at addressing this problem. Both are based on adding Gaussian noise to the data to remove the dimensionality mismatch during training, and both provide a denoising mechanism whose goal is to sample from the model as though no noise had been added to the data. Our first approach is based on Tweedie's formula, and the second on models which take the variance of added noise as a conditional input. We show that surprisingly, while well motivated, these approaches only sporadically improve performance over not adding noise, and that other methods of addressing the dimensionality mismatch are more empirically adequate."}}

However, we argue here that the manifold hypothesis is incomplete, as it does not allow any variation in the intrinsic dimensionality of different sub-regions of the data space. We thus posit the union of manifold hypothesis, which states that high-dimensional data of interest comes from a union of disjoint manifolds; this allows intrinsic dimensionality to vary. We empirically verify this hypothesis on image datasets using a standard estimator of intrinsic dimensionality, and also demonstrate an improvement in classification performance derived from this hypothesis. We hope our work will encourage the community to further explore the benefits of considering the union of manifolds structure in data."}}

In this paper, we argue that this hypothesis does not properly capture the low-dimensional structure typically present in image data.

To address this deficiency, we consider the union of manifolds hypothesis, which states that data lies on a disjoint union of manifolds of varying intrinsic dimensions. We empirically verify this hypothesis on commonly-used image datasets, finding that indeed, observed data lies on a disconnected set and that intrinsic dimension is not constant. We also provide insights into the implications of the union of manifolds hypothesis in deep learning, both supervised and unsupervised, showing that designing models with an inductive bias for this structure improves performance across classification and generative modelling tasks.

Current probabilistic models represent this manifold by mapping an $m$-dimensional latent variable through a neural network $f_\\theta: \\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$. Such procedures, which we call pushforward models, incur a straightforward limitation: manifolds cannot in general be represented with a single parameterization, meaning that attempts to do so will incur either computational instability or the inability to learn probability densities within the manifold. To remedy this problem, we propose to model $\\mathcal{M}$ as a neural implicit manifold: the set of zeros of a neural network. To learn the data distribution within $\\mathcal{M}$, we introduce constrained energy-based models, which use a constrained variant of Langevin dynamics to train and sample within a learned manifold. The resulting model can be manipulated with an arithmetic of manifolds, which allows practitioners to take unions and intersections of model manifolds. In experiments on synthetic and natural data, we show that constrained EBMs can learn manifold-supported distributions with complex topologies more accurately than pushforward models."}}

Unfortunately, the application of privacy enhancing technologies can worsen unfair tendencies in models. In particular, one of the most widely used techniques for private model training, differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD), frequently intensifies disparate impact on groups within data. In this work we study the fine-grained causes of unfairness in DPSGD and identify gradient misalignment due to inequitable gradient clipping as the most significant source. This observation leads us to a new method for reducing unfairness by preventing gradient misalignment in DPSGD."}}

We also show that classes with higher intrinsic dimensions are harder to classify, and how this insight can be used to improve classification accuracy. We then turn our attention to the impact of this hypothesis in the context of deep generative models (DGMs). Most current DGMs struggle to model datasets with several connected components and/or varying intrinsic dimensions. To tackle these shortcomings, we propose clustered DGMs, where we first cluster the data and then train a DGM on each cluster. We show that clustered DGMs can model multiple connected components with different intrinsic dimensions, and empirically outperform their non-clustered counterparts without increasing computational requirements."}}

This formulation directly contradicts the manifold hypothesis, which states that observed data lies on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional ambient space. In this paper we investigate the pathologies of maximum-likelihood training in the presence of this dimensionality mismatch. We formally prove that degenerate optima are achieved wherein the manifold itself is learned but not the distribution on it, a phenomenon we call manifold overfitting. We propose a class of two-step procedures consisting of a dimensionality reduction step followed by maximum-likelihood density estimation, and prove that they recover the data-generating distribution in the nonparametric regime, thus avoiding manifold overfitting. We also show that these procedures enable density estimation on the manifolds learned by implicit models, such as generative adversarial networks, hence addressing a major shortcoming of these models. Several recently proposed methods are instances of our two-step procedures; we thus unify, extend, and theoretically justify a large class of models."}}
