We propose AudioGen, an auto-regressive generative model, operating on a learnt discrete audio representation, that generates audio samples conditioned on text inputs. The task of text-to-audio generation poses multiple challenges. Due to the way audio travels through a medium, differentiating ``objects'' can be a difficult task (e.g., separating multiple people simultaneously speaking). This is further complicated by real-world recording conditions (e.g., background noise, reverberation, etc.). Scarce text annotations impose another constraint, limiting the ability to scale models. Finally, modeling high fidelity audio requires one to operate over extremely long sequences. To alleviate the aforementioned challenges we propose an augmentation technique that mixes different audio samples, driving the model to internally learn to separate multiple sources. We curated 10 datasets containing different types of audio and text annotations to handle the scarcity of text-audio data points. For faster inference, we explore the use of multi-stream modeling, allowing the use of shorter sequences while maintaining a similar bitrate and perceptual quality. Finally, we apply classifier-free guidance to improve adherence to text. Comparing to the evaluated baselines, AudioGen outperforms over both objective and subjective metrics. We further conduct an ablation study to gauge the effects of pre-trained text and audio components."}}

However, their robustness capabilities have not been extensively investigated. This work focuses on self-supervised representations for spoken generative language models. First, we empirically demonstrate how current state-of-the-art speech representation models lack robustness to basic signal variations that do not alter the spoken information. To overcome this, we propose an effective and efficient method to learn robust self-supervised speech representation for generative spoken language modeling. The proposed approach is based on applying a set of signal transformations to the speech signal and optimizing the model using an iterative pseudo-labeling scheme. Our method significantly improves over the evaluated baselines when considering encoding metrics. We additionally evaluate our method on the speech-to-speech translation task. We consider Spanish-English and French-English conversions and empirically demonstrate the benefits of following the proposed approach."}}

First, we evaluated our model when the spoken phonemes were not given as input. Results on the TIMIT and Buckeye corpora suggest that the proposed model is superior to the baseline models and reaches state-of-the-art performance in terms of F1 and R-value. We further explore the use of phonetic transcription as additional supervision and show this yields minor improvements in performance but substantially better convergence rates. We additionally evaluate the model on a Hebrew corpus and demonstrate such phonetic supervision can be beneficial in a multi-lingual setting."}}

Traditionally, digital signal processing techniques, such as least significant bit encoding, were used for hiding messages. In this paper, we explore the use of deep neural networks as steganographic functions for speech data. We showed that steganography models proposed for vision are less suitable for speech, and propose a new model that includes the short-time Fourier transform and inverse-short-time Fourier transform as differentiable layers within the network, thus imposing a vital constraint on the network outputs. We empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing to deep learning based on several speech datasets and analyzed the results quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, we showed that the proposed approach could be applied to conceal multiple messages in a single carrier using multiple decoders or a single conditional decoder. Lastly, we evaluated our model under different channel distortions. Qualitative experiments suggest that modifications to the carrier are unnoticeable by human listeners and that the decoded messages are highly intelligible."}}

However, this comes with a major concern: deep networks have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are slightly modified inputs that are intentionally designed to cause a misclassification by the model. In the domains of images and speech, the modifications are so small that they are not seen or heard by humans, but nevertheless greatly affect the classification of the model. Deep learning models have been successfully applied to malware detection. In this domain, generating adversarial examples is not straightforward, as small modifications to the bytes of the file could lead to significant changes in its functionality and validity. We introduce a novel loss function for generating adversarial examples specifically tailored for discrete input sets, such as executable bytes. We modify malicious binaries so that they would be detected as benign, while preserving their original functionality, by injecting a small sequence of bytes (payload) in the binary file. We applied this approach to an end-to-end convolutional deep learning malware detection model and show a high rate of detection evasion. Moreover, we show that our generated payload is robust enough to be transferable within different locations of the same file and across different files, and that its entropy is low and similar to that of benign data sections."}}
