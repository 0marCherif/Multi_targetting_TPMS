Beyond the question of existence, one would like to compute formulas for these symmetries, towards the eventual goal of solving the systems more efficiently. We describe and implement one possible approach to this task using numerical homotopy continuation and multivariate rational function interpolation. We illustrate our methods on several examples, including two cases with nonlinear symmetries which appear in applications from computer vision and robotics."}}

The Galois/monodromy group allows us to decide when a given problem decomposes into algebraic subproblems, and whether or not it has any symmetries. Tools from numerical algebraic geometry and computational group theory allow us to apply this framework to classical and novel reconstruction problems. We consider three classical cases\u2014three-point absolute pose, five-point relative pose, and four-point homography estimation for calibrated cameras\u2014where the decomposition and symmetries may be naturally understood in terms of the Galois/monodromy group. We then show how our framework can be applied to novel problems from absolute and relative pose estimation. For instance, we discover new symmetries for absolute pose problems involving mixtures of point and line features. We also describe a problem of estimating a pair of calibrated homographies between three images. For this problem of degree 64, we can reduce the degree to 16, the latter better reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of algebraically solving the problem. As a byproduct, we obtain new constraints on compatible homographies, which may be of independent interest."}}

This atlas offers a unifying framework for the study of problems in 3D computer vision. We initiate the study of the atlas by completely characterizing a part of the atlas stemming from the triangulation problem. We conclude with several open problems and generalizations of the atlas."}}

These improvements may be applied to the basic algorithms of numerical algebraic geometry in the settings of both projective and multiprojective varieties. Our computational experiments demonstrate significant savings obtained on several benchmark systems. We also present an extended case study on maximum likelihood estimation for rank-constrained symmetric $n\\times n$ matrices, in which multiprojective $u$-generation allows us to complete the list of ML degrees for $n\\le 6.$"}}

We design a learning strategy for selecting a starting problem-solution pair that can be numerically continued to the problem and the solution of interest. We demonstrate our approach by developing a RANSAC solver for the problem of computing the relative pose of three calibrated cameras, via a minimal relaxation using four points in each view.
