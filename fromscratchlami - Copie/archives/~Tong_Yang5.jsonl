The core idea is to decouple the generalization of the sensory-motor policy to the design of a fast-adaptable perception module and a simulated generic policy module. The framework consists of a segmentation network (SN), a virtual sensor network (VSN), and a controller network (CN). Concretely, the VSN is trained to measure the pose of the unseen shape from a segmented image. After that, given the shape-agnostic pose measurement, the CN is trained to achieve generic peg-in-hole. Finally, when applying to real unseen holes, we only have to fine-tune the SN required by the simulated VSN+CN. To further minimize the transfer cost, we propose to automatically collect and annotate the data for the SN after one-minute human teaching. Simulated and real-world results are presented under the configurations of eye-to/in-hand. An electric vehicle charging system with the proposed policy inside achieves a 10/10 success rate in 2-3s, using only hundreds of auto-labeled samples for the SN transfer."}}

The workspace is proven to be topologically a simply-connected subset and geometrically a convex subset of the set of all configurations. As a direct result, the tether-length-admissible optimal path between two configurations is proven exactly the untethered collision-free locally shortest path in the homotopy specified by the concatenation of the tether curve of the given configurations, which can be simply constructed by performing an untethered path shortening process in the 2D environment instead of a path searching process in the pre-calculated workspace. The convexity is an intrinsic property to the tethered robot kinematics, thus has universal impacts on all high-level distance-optimal tethered path planning tasks: The most time-consuming workspace pre-calculation (WP) process is replaced with a goal configuration pre-calculation (GCP) process, and the homotopy-aware path searching process is replaced with untethered path shortening processes. Motivated by the workspace convexity, efficient algorithms to solve the following problems are naturally proposed: (a) The optimal tethered reconfiguration (TR) planning problem is solved by a locally untethered path shortening (UPS) process, (b) The classic optimal tethered path (TP) planning problem (from a starting configuration to a goal location whereby the target tether state is not assigned) is solved by a GCP process and $n$ UPS processes, where $n$ is the number of tether-length-admissible configurations that visit the goal location, (c) The optimal tethered motion to visit a sequence of multiple goal locations, referred to as"}}

Motivated by accelerating the inefficient exploration of the homotopy-augmented space of the 2D environment, our fundamental idea is to identify the non-$k$-optimal path topologies as early as possible and terminate the pathfinding along them. This is a non-trivial practice because it has to be done at an intermediate state of the path planning process when locally shortest paths have not been fully constructed. In other words, the paths to be compared have not rendezvoused at the goal location, which makes the homotopy theory, modelling the spatial relationship among the paths having the same endpoint, not applicable. This paper is the first work that develops a systematic distance-based topology simplification mechanism to solve the $k$-SNPP task, whose core contribution is to assert the distance-based order of non-homotopic locally shortest paths before constructing them. If the order can be predicted, then those path topologies having more than $k$ better topologies are proven free of the desired $k$ paths and thus can be safely discarded during the path planning process. To this end, a hierarchical topological tree is proposed as an implementation of the mechanism, whose nodes are proven to expand in non-homotopic directions and edges (collision-free path segments) are proven locally shortest. With efficient criteria that observe the order relations between partly constructed locally shortest paths being imparted into the tree, the tree nodes that expand in non-$k$-optimal topologies will not be expanded. As a result, the computational time for solving the $k$-SNPP problem is reduced by near two orders of magnitude."}}

It has been observed that due to the severe folding and overlapped texture of garments, treating a video of the continuous deformation of cloth as a set of disordered static figures would be ineffective which leads to low classification precision performed by an image-based garment classifier. In contrast, a high-level decision making module that leverages the classification results of each single image would significantly increase the algorithm performance. In this paper, we incorporate the optical flow variation of deformable cloth between consecutive configurations as a representative of how it is traversing within the confidence interval of the image-based classifier. We claim that it is not the number of video frames but the sum of optical flow variation of the garment configuration between consecutive frames having the same category label that constitutes the belief of garment classification. In other words, if two consecutive visual appearances of the garment could be identified as the same category by the image-based classifier, then the more diverged that two configurations are, the more confident that the garment is correctly identified. Experimental comparisons between the state-of-the-art algorithm and the proposed algorithm in a public dataset have been provided which prove the validity of the proposed algorithm."}}

The scenario is often encountered in typical industrial settings, for instance when the object presents itself along a conveyor belt and its surface can not be serviced at a single location - the object being large or complex for that endeavour. Given the non-bijective nature of manipulator kinematics between task and joint space, without explicit consideration of joint-space continuity during its construction, a continuous coverage path designed in task-space may easily be truncated into intermittent segments where the manipulator needs to adopt a different configuration to continue the task, resulting in manipulator motions where the end-effector will need to lift off the surface, an altogether undesirable characteristic affecting the quality of the final product for smooth operations on objects such as polishing, painting or deburring. In this work, a novel algorithm to optimally partition the task-space whilst considering the various finite locations where the object may be stationed is proposed that ensures joint-space coverage continuity with minimal lift-offs. Results from the algorithm being challenged to achieve coverage of a number of objects, both in simulation and in real tests with an industrial manipulator, prove the effectiveness of the proposed planner when compared with classical coverage strategies faced with the same problem."}}

In this letter, the Fourier series are introduced to parameterize irregular closed shape features and the SLAM problem with Fourier series feature parameterization is formulated. A submap joining process is also derived in order to reduce the high dependence on precise initial guess and the computing time. The proposed method has been evaluated on both synthetic and actual data and is able to obtain accurate trajectory and feature boundaries. The practical experiment also shows that our method surpasses Cartographer under certain scenarios. We also show that our method has the ability to be applied to the general environment."}}

One of the applications is rotating LSLVS as a 3-D LiDAR, which is applicable to tasks with limited power consumption, such as the planetary exploration task. Accurate calibration between the LSLVS and the rotating platform is essential to such system, which is difficult for the characteristics of the movement and the problem of time synchronization. In this work, we aim to perform the spatial and the temporal calibration for the rotating LSLVS in two stages. In the first stage, the extrinsic parameters are calculated based on the image data captured in different orientations, during which the LSLVS remains static to avoid errors caused by time offset. Also, multiple constraints are added in this stage in order to have the high accuracy and robustness of calibration. Then, in the second stage, with the extrinsic parameters being precisely calibrated, the temporal calibration is performed by minimizing the reprojection errors of visual feature points, which indicates the asynchronization between the trajectory profile of the LSLVS recorded by the rotating platform and retrieved from images. The observability of the extrinsic parameters and the time delay are analyzed in detail. Simulated and realistic experiments show the competitive accuracy and robustness of the proposed method."}}

Considering the limitation of single type of sensor, fusing measurements from multiple sensors with complementary properties is a valuable task for study. In this paper, we propose a decoupled optimization-based framework for global\u2013local sensor fusion, which fuses the intermittent 3D global positions and high-frequent 6D odometry poses to infer the 6D global localization results in real-time. The fusion process is formulated as estimating the relative transformation between global and local reference coordinates, translational extrinsic calibration, and the scale of the local pose estimator. We validate the full observability of the system under general movements, and further analyze the degenerated movement patterns where some related system state would be unobservable. A degeneration-aware sensor fusion method is designed which detects the degenerated directions before optimization, and adds constraints specifically along these directions to relieve the effect of the noise. The proposed degeneration-aware global\u2013local sensor fusion method is validated in both simulation and real-world datasets with different sensor configurations, and shows its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and robustness compared with other decoupled sensor fusion methods for global localization."}}

The problem is motivated by the automatic polishing of an object. Due to the non-bijective mapping between the workspace and the joint-space, a continuous coverage path in the workspace may easily be truncated in the joint-space, incuring undesirable end effector lift-offs. Inversely, there may be multiple configuration choices to cover the same point of a coverage path through the solution of the Inverse Kinematics. The solution departs from the conventional local optimisation of the coverage path shape in task space, or choosing appropriate but possibly disconnected configurations, to instead explicitly explore the leaast number of discontinuous motions through the analysis of the structure of valid configurations in joint-space. The two novel contributions of this paper include proof that the least number of path discontinuities is predicated on the surrounding environment, independent from the choice of the actual coverage path; thus has a minimum. And an efficient finite cellular decomposition method to optimally divide the workspace into the minimum number of cells, each traversable without discontinuties by any arbitrary coverage path within. Extensive simulation examples and real-world results on a 5 DoF manipulator are presented to prove the validity of the proposed strategy in realistic settings."}}
