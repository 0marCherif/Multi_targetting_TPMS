Aquarium achieves stable simulation with accurate flow physics by directly integrating over the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a fully implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme with a second-order finite-volume spatial discretization. The fluid and robot physics are coupled using the immersed-boundary method by formulating the no-slip condition as an equality constraint applied directly to the Navier-Stokes system. This choice of coupling allows the fluid-structure interaction to be posed and solved as a nonlinear optimization problem. This optimization-based formulation is then exploited using the implicit-function theorem to compute derivatives. Derivatives can then be passed to downstream gradient-based optimization or learning algorithms. We demonstrate Aquarium's ability to accurately simulate coupled fluid-robot physics with numerous 2D examples, including a cylinder in free stream and a soft robotic fish tail with hardware validation. We also demonstrate Aquarium's ability to provide analytical gradients by performing gradient-based shape-and-gait optimization of an oscillating diamond foil to maximize its generated thrust."}}

But modeling soft robots has mostly involved coarse approximations that do not suitably describe the dynamics and deformations. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a more expressive approach for modeling highly deformable structures such as dynamic, elastomeric soft robots. Recently, Differentiable Projective Dynamics (DiffPD) has been proposed as a fast and differentiable FEM; however, DiffPD lacks rigorous benchmarking against reality. In this paper, we compare virtual robot models simulated using DiffPD with measurements from their physical counterparts. In particular, we examine several soft structures with different morphologies: a clamped beam under external force, a pneumatically actuated soft robotic arm, and a soft robotic fish tail. We also advance DiffPD by proposing a predictive model for pneumatic soft robot actuation.  \nThrough our case-studies, we provide strategies and algorithms for matching real-world physics in simulation, thus making DiffPD useful for robots in reality."}}

Graph neural networks show promise in accurately representing irregularly meshed objects and learning their dynamics, but have so far required supervision through large datasets. In this work, we represent meshes naturally as graphs, process these using Graph Networks, and formulate our physics-based loss to provide an unsupervised learning framework for partial differential equations (PDE). We quantitatively compare our results to a classical numerical PDE solver, and show that our computationally efficient approach can be used as an interactive PDE solver that is adjusting boundary conditions in real-time and remains sufficiently close to the baseline solution. Our inherently differentiable framework will enable the application of PDE solvers in interactive settings, such as model-based control of soft-body deformations, or in gradient-based optimization methods that require a fully differentiable pipeline."}}

Unfortunately, current soft robotic swimmers are vastly inferior to evolved biological swimmers, especially in terms of controllability, efficiency, maneuverability, and longevity. Additionally, the tedious iterative fabrication and empirical testing required to design soft robots has hindered their optimization. In this work, we tackle this challenge by providing an efficient and straightforward pipeline for designing and fabricating soft robotic swimmers equipped with electrostatic actuation. We streamline the process to allow for rapid additive manufacturing, and show how a differentiable simulation can be used to match a simplified model to the real deformation of a robotic swimmer. We perform several experiments with the fabricated swimmer by varying the voltage and actuation frequency of the swimmer's antagonistic muscles. We show how the voltage and frequency vary the locomotion speed of the swimmer while moving in liquid oil and observe a clear optimum in forward swimming speed. The differentiable simulation model we propose has various downstream applications, such as control and shape optimization of the swimmer; optimization results can be directly mapped back to the real robot through our sim-to-real matching."}}
