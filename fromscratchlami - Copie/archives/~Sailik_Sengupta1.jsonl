In this work, we investigate how robust IC/SL models are to noisy data. We collect and publicly release a test-suite for seven common noise types found in production human-to-bot conversations (abbreviations, casing, misspellings, morphological variants, paraphrases, punctuation and synonyms). On this test-suite, we show that common noise types substantially degrade the IC accuracy and SL F1 performance of state-of-the-art BERT-based IC/SL models. By leveraging cross-noise robustness transfer -- training on one noise type to improve robustness on another noise type -- we design aggregate data-augmentation approaches that increase the model performance across all seven noise types by +10.8% for IC accuracy and +15 points for SL F1 on average. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to present a single IC/SL model that is robust to a wide range of noise phenomena."}}

In this paper, we propose a moving-target approach to thwart and countersurveil such adversaries, wherein live (non-decoy) enterprise software services are automatically modified to deceptively emulate vulnerable legacy versions that entice attackers. A game-theoretic framework chooses which emulated software stacks, versions, configurations, and vulnerabilities yield the best defensive payoffs and most useful threat data given a specific attack model. The results show that effective movement strategies can be computed to account for pragmatic aspects of deception, such as the utility of various intelligence-gathering actions, impact of vulnerabilities, performance costs of patch deployment, complexity of exploits, and attacker profile."}}

To take away an attacker's advantage of reconnaissance, researchers have proposed proactive defense methods such as Moving Target Defense (MTD). To find good movement strategies, researchers have modeled MTD as leader-follower games between the defender and a cyber-adversary. We argue that existing models are inadequate in sequential settings when there is incomplete information about rational adversary and yield sub-optimal movement strategies. Further, while there exists an array of work on learning defense policies in sequential settings for cyber-security, they are either unpopular due to scalability issues arising out of incomplete information or tend to ignore the strategic nature of the adversary simplifying the scenario to use single-agent reinforcement learning techniques. To address these concerns, we propose (1) a unifying game-theoretic model, called the Bayesian Stackelberg Markov Games (BSMGs), that can model uncertainty over attacker types and the nuances of an MTD system and (2) a Bayesian Strong Stackelberg Q-learning (BSS-Q) approach that can, via interaction, learn the optimal movement policy for BSMGs within a reasonable time. We situate BSMGs in the landscape of incomplete-information Markov games and characterize the notion of Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE) in them. We show that our learning approach converges to an SSE of a BSMG and then highlight that the learned movement policy (1) improves the state-of-the-art in MTD for web-application security and (2) converges to an optimal policy in MTD domains with incomplete information about adversaries even when prior information about rewards and transitions is absent."}}

While these misclassifications may be inevitable, all failure modes cannot be considered equal. Certain misclassifications (eg. classifying the image of a dog to an airplane) can perplex humans and result in the loss of human trust in the system. Even worse, these errors (eg. a person misclassified as a primate) can have odious societal impacts. Thus, in this work, we aim to reduce inexplicable errors. To address this challenge, we first discuss methods to obtain the class-level semantics that capture the human's expectation ($M^h$) regarding which classes are semantically close {\\em vs.} ones that are far away. We show that for popular image benchmarks (like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet), class-level semantics can be readily obtained by leveraging either human subject studies or publicly available human-curated knowledge bases. Second, we propose the use of Weighted Loss Functions (WLFs) to penalize misclassifications by the weight of their inexplicability. Finally, we show that training (or fine-tuning) existing classifiers with the proposed methods lead to Deep Neural Networks that have (1) comparable top-1 accuracy, (2) more explicable failure modes on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) test data, and (3) incur significantly less cost in the gathering of additional human labels compared to existing works."}}

The central idea for such decision support systems is to augment the capabilities of the human-in-the-loop with automated planning techniques and enhance the quality of decision-making. In addition to providing planning support, effective decision support systems must be able to provide intuitive explanations based on specific user queries for proposed decisions to its end users. Using this as motivation, we present our decision support system RADAR-X that showcases the ability to engage the user in an interactive explanatory dialogue by first enabling them to specify an alternative to a proposed decision (which we refer to as foils), and then providing contrastive explanations to these user-specified foils which helps the user understand why a specific plan was chosen over the alternative (or foil). Furthermore, the system uses this dialogue to elicit the user's latent preferences and provides revised plan suggestions through three different interaction strategies."}}

To take away this asymmetric advantage, Moving Target Defense (MTD) continuously shifts the configuration of the underlying system, in turn reducing the success rate of cyberattacks. In this survey, we analyze the recent advancements made in the development of MTDs and highlight (1) how these defenses can be defined using common terminology, (2) can be made more effective with the use of artificial intelligence techniques for decision making, (3) be implemented in practice and (4) evaluated. We first define an MTD using a simple and yet general notation that captures the key aspects of such defenses. We then categorize these defenses into different sub-classes depending on what they move, when they move and how they move. In trying to answer the latter question, we showcase the use of domain knowledge and game-theoretic modeling can help the defender come up with effective and efficient movement strategies. Second, to understand the practicality of these defense methods, we discuss how various MTDs have been implemented and find that networking technologies such as Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization act as key enablers for implementing these dynamic defenses. We then briefly highlight MTD test-beds and case-studies to aid readers who want to examine or deploy existing MTD techniques. Third, our survey categorizes proposed MTDs based on the qualitative and quantitative metrics they utilize to evaluate their effectiveness in terms of security and performance. We use well-defined metrics such as risk analysis and performance costs for qualitative evaluation and metrics based on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA), attack representation, QoS impact, and targeted threat models for quantitative evaluation. Finally, we show that our categorization of MTDs is effective in identifying novel research areas and highlight directions for future research."}}

Explaining AI-Moderated Task-Allocation Outcomes using Negotiation Trees", "abstract": "Task-allocation is an important problem in multi-agent systems. It becomes more challenging when the team-members are humans with imperfect knowledge about their teammates' costs and the overall performance metric. While distributed task-allocation methods let the team-members engage in iterative dialog to reach a consensus, the process can take a considerable amount of time and communication. On the other hand, a centralized method that simply outputs an allocation may result in discontented human team-members who, due to their imperfect knowledge and limited computation capabilities, perceive the allocation to be unfair. To address these challenges, we propose a centralized Artificial Intelligence Task Allocation (AITA) that simulates a negotiation and produces a negotiation-aware task allocation that is fair. If a team-member is unhappy with the proposed allocation, we allow them to question the proposed allocation using a counterfactual. By using parts of the simulated negotiation, we are able to provide contrastive explanations that providing minimum information about other's costs to refute their foil. With human studies, we show that (1) the allocation proposed using our method does indeed appear fair to the majority, and (2) when a counterfactual is raised, explanations generated are easy to comprehend and convincing. Finally, we empirically study the effect of different kinds of incompleteness on the explanation-length and find that underestimation of a teammate's costs often increases it."}}

Thus, regularly monitoring the behavior of such components is of utmost importance. Furthermore, the recent increase in the number of cyberattacks on such systems demands that such monitoring strategies should be robust. In this paper, we draw inspiration from work in Moving Target Defense (MTD) and consider a dynamic monitoring strategy that makes it difficult for an attacker to prevent unique identification of behavioral signals that indicate the status of HVTs. We first formulate the problem of finding a differentially immune configuration set for an MTD in the context of power grids and then propose algorithms to compute it. To find the optimal movement strategy, we model the MTD as a two-player game and consider the Stackelberg strategy. With the help of IEEE test cases, we show the efficacy and scalability of our proposed approaches."}}

While practitioners celebrate synthetic data generation using GANs as an economical way to augment data for training data-hungry machine learning models, it is unclear whether they recognize the perils of such techniques when applied to real world datasets biased along latent dimensions. Specifically, we show that (1) traditional GANs further skew the distribution of a dataset consisting of engineering faculty headshots, generating minority modes less often and of worse quality and (2) image-to-image translation (conditional) GANs also exacerbate biases by lightening skin color of non-white faces and transforming female facial features to be masculine when generating faces of engineering professors. Thus, our study is meant to serve as a cautionary tale."}}
