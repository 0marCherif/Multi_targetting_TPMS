By regarding intersections as agents, most of the reinforcement learning-based methods generate agents\u2019 actions independently.

However, when agents act synchronously in these works, the perceived action value is biased, and the information exchanged is insufficient. In this work, we first propose a novel Multi-agent Communication and Action Rectification (MaCAR) framework. It enables active communication between agents by considering the impact of synchronous actions of agents. Another fundamental problem of traffic light control is the balance between traffic demand and road supply capacity. To fully describe the relation between traffic demand and road supply capacity (Supply-Demand modeling, SD), we further model and forecast the Supply-Demand relation to facilitating the effectiveness of the model\u2019s action. The experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Combining the SD with MaCAR, SD-MaCAR can further boost the traffic light control performance even in traffic accident scenarios."}}

It is challenging due to the significant variations inside the target scenario, e.g., different camera viewpoint, illumination changes, and occlusion. These variations result in a gap between each mini-batch\u2019s distribution and the whole dataset\u2019s distribution when using mini-batch training. In this paper, we study model fine-tuning from the perspective of the aggregation and utilization of the dataset\u2019s global information when using mini-batch training. Specifically, we introduce a novel network structure called Batch-related Convolutional Cell (BConv-Cell), which progressively collects the dataset\u2019s global information into a latent state and uses it to rectify the extracted feature. Based on BConv-Cells, we further proposed the Progressive Transfer Learning (PTL) method to facilitate the model fine-tuning process by jointly optimizing BConv-Cells and the pre-trained ReID model. Empirical experiments show that our proposal can greatly improve the ReID model\u2019s performance on MSMT17, Market-1501, CUHK03, and DukeMTMC-reID datasets. Moreover, we extend our proposal to the general image classification task. The experiments in several image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposal can significantly improve baseline models\u2019 performance.

The vehicle trajectory transition patterns are studied to explicitly model the spatial traffic demand via graph propagation along the road network; an attention mechanism is designed to learn the temporal dependencies based on neighborhood traffic status; and finally, a fusion of multi-step prediction is integrated into the graph neural network design. The proposed approach is evaluated with a real-world trajectory dataset. Experiment results show that the proposed TrGNN model achieves over 5% error reduction when compared with the state-of-the-art approaches across all metrics for normal traffic, and up to 14% for atypical traffic during peak hours or abnormal events. The advantage of trajectory transitions especially manifest itself in inferring high fluctuation of flows as well as non-recurrent flow patterns."}}

A side effect of data imbalance occurs when a few abnormal data face a vast number of normal data. The latest VAD works use triplet loss or data re-sampling strategy to lessen this problem. However, there is still no elaborately designed structure for discriminative VAD with a few anomalies. In this paper, we propose a DiscRiminative-gEnerative duAl Memory (DREAM) anomaly detection model to take advantage of a few anomalies and solve data imbalance. We use two shallow discriminators to tighten the normal feature distribution boundary along with a generator for the next frame prediction. Further, we propose a dual memory module to obtain a sparse feature representation in both normality and abnormality space. As a result, DREAM not only solves the data imbalance problem but also learn a reasonable feature space. Further theoretical analysis shows that our DREAM also works for the unknown anomalies. Comparing with the previous methods on UCSD Ped1, UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech, our model outperforms all the baselines with no extra parameters. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of our dual memory module and discriminative-generative network."}}

Most of the unsupervised hashing methods learn to map images into semantic similarity-preserving hash codes by constructing local semantic similarity structure from the pre-trained model as the guiding information, i.e., treating each point pair similar if their distance is small in feature space. However, due to the inefficient representation ability of the pre-trained model, many false positives and negatives in local semantic similarity will be introduced and lead to error propagation during the hash code learning. Moreover, few of the methods consider the robustness of models, which will cause instability of hash codes to disturbance. In this paper, we propose a new method named Comprehensive sImilarity Mining and cOnsistency learNing (CIMON). First, we use global refinement and similarity statistical distribution to obtain reliable and smooth guidance. Second, both semantic and contrastive consistency learning are introduced to derive both disturb-invariant and discriminative hash codes. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art methods in both retrieval performance and robustness."}}

Thus, tackling the class imbalance trouble of SGG is critical and challenging. In this paper, we first discover that when predicate labels have strong correlation with each other, prevalent re-balancing strategies (e.g., re-sampling and re-weighting) will give rise to either over-fitting the tail data (e.g., bench sitting on sidewalk rather than on), or still suffering the adverse effect from the original uneven distribution (e.g., aggregating varied parked on/standing on/sitting on into on). We argue the principal reason is that re-balancing strategies are sensitive to the frequencies of predicates yet blind to their relatedness, which may play a more important role to promote the learning of predicate features. Therefore, we propose a novel Predicate-Correlation Perception Learning (PCPL for short) scheme to adaptively seek out appropriate loss weights by directly perceiving and utilizing the correlation among predicate classes. Moreover, our PCPL framework is further equipped with a graph encoder module to better extract context features. Extensive experiments on the benchmark VG150 dataset show that the proposed PCPL performs markedly better on tail classes while well-preserving the performance on head ones, which significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods."}}

By introducing data augmentation, most of the latest methods look into deep clustering from the perspective that the original image and its transformation should share similar semantic clustering assignment. However, the representation features could be quite different even they are assigned to the same cluster since softmax function is only sensitive to the maximum value. This may result in high intra-class diversities in the representation feature space, which will lead to unstable local optimal and thus harm the clustering performance. To address this drawback, we proposed Deep Robust Clustering (DRC). Different from existing methods, DRC looks into deep clustering from two perspectives of both semantic clustering assignment and representation feature, which can increase inter-class diversities and decrease intra-class diversities simultaneously. Furthermore, we summarized a general framework that can turn any maximizing mutual information into minimizing contrastive loss by investigating the internal relationship between mutual information and contrastive learning. And we successfully applied it in DRC to learn invariant features and robust clusters. Extensive experiments on six widely-adopted deep clustering benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DRC in both stability and accuracy. e.g., attaining 71.6% mean accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is 7.1% higher than state-of-the-art results."}}

However, most public ReID datasets are collected in a short time window in which persons' appearance rarely changes. In real-world applications such as in a shopping mall, the same person's clothing may change, and different persons may wearing similar clothes. All these cases can result in an inconsistent ReID performance, revealing a critical problem that current ReID models heavily rely on person's apparels. Therefore, it is critical to learn an apparel-invariant person representation under cases like cloth changing or several persons wearing similar clothes. In this work, we tackle this problem from the viewpoint of invariant feature representation learning. The main contributions of this work are as follows. (1) We propose the semi-supervised Apparel-invariant Feature Learning (AIFL) framework to learn an apparel-invariant pedestrian representation using images of the same person wearing different clothes. (2) To obtain images of the same person wearing different clothes, we propose an unsupervised apparel-simulation GAN (AS-GAN) to synthesize cloth changing images according to the target cloth embedding. It's worth noting that the images used in ReID tasks were cropped from real-world low-quality CCTV videos, making it more challenging to synthesize cloth changing images. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets comparing with several baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposal can improve the ReID performance of the baseline models."}}
