Similar to other database architectures, LSM trees take into account information about the expected workload (e.g., reads vs. writes, point vs. range queries) to optimize their performance via tuning. Operating in shared infrastructure like the cloud, however, comes with a degree of workload uncertainty due to multi-tenancy and the fast-evolving nature of modern applications. Systems with static tuning discount the variability of such hybrid workloads and hence provide an inconsistent and overall suboptimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce Endure - a new paradigm for tuning LSM trees in the presence of workload uncertainty. Specifically, we focus on the impact of the choice of compaction policies, size-ratio, and memory allocation on the overall performance. Endure considers a robust formulation of the throughput maximization problem, and recommends a tuning that maximizes the worst-case throughput over a neighborhood of each expected workload. Additionally, an uncertainty tuning parameter controls the size of this neighborhood, thereby allowing the output tunings to be conservative or optimistic. Through both model-based and extensive experimental evaluation of Endure in the state-of-the-art LSM-based storage engine, RocksDB, we show that the robust tuning methodology consistently outperforms classical tun-ing strategies. We benchmark Endure using 15 workload templates that generate more than 10000 unique noisy workloads. The robust tunings output by Endure lead up to a 5$\\times$ improvement in through-put in presence of uncertainty. On the flip side, when the observed workload exactly matches the expected one, Endure tunings have negligible performance loss."}}

Such systems attempt to balance the objectives of multiple stakeholders including sellers, buyers, and the platform itself. The difficulty in providing recommendations that maximize the utility for a buyer, while simultaneously representing all the sellers on the platform has lead to many interesting research problems.Traditionally, they have been formulated as integer linear programs which compute recommendations for all the buyers together in an \\emph{offline} fashion, by incorporating coverage constraints so that the individual sellers are proportionally represented across all the recommended items. Such approaches can lead to unforeseen biases wherein certain buyers consistently receive low utility recommendations in order to meet the global seller coverage constraints. To remedy this situation, we propose a general formulation that incorporates seller coverage objectives alongside individual buyer objectives in a real-time personalized recommender system. In addition, we leverage highly scalable submodular optimization algorithms to provide recommendations to each buyer with provable theoretical quality bounds. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate the efficacy of our approach using data from an online real-estate marketplace."}}

An ideal solution aims to minimize the response time for each hyperlocal passenger ride request, while simultaneously maintaining high demand satisfaction and supply utilization across the entire city. Economists tend to rely on dynamic pricing mechanisms that stifle price-sensitive excess demand and resolve supply-demand imbalances that emerge in specific neighborhoods. In contrast, computer scientists primarily view it as a demand prediction problem with the goal of preemptively repositioning supply to such neighborhoods using black-box coordinated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based approaches. Here, we introduce explainability in the existing supply-repositioning approaches by establishing the need for coordination between the drivers at specific locations and times. Explicit need-based coordination allows our framework to use a simpler non-deep reinforcement learning-based approach, thereby enabling it to explain its recommendations ex-post. Moreover, it provides envy-free recommendations i.e., drivers at the same location and time do not envy one another's expected future earnings. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our framework. Finally, in contrast to previous works, we make available a reinforcement learning environment for end-to-end reproducibility of our work and to encourage future comparative studies."}}

Although there are many studies that consider ride-hailing platforms holistically, e.g., from the perspective of supply and demand equilibria, little emphasis has been placed on optimization for the individual, self-interested drivers that currently comprise these fleets. While some individuals drive opportunistically either as their schedule allows or on a fixed schedule, we show that strategic behavior regarding when and where to drive can substantially increase driver income. In this paper, we formalize the problem of devising a driver strategy to maximize expected earnings, describe a series of dynamic programming algorithms to solve these problems under different sets of modeled actions available to the drivers, and exemplify the models and methods on a large scale simulation of driving for Uber in NYC. In our experiments, we use a newly-collected dataset that combines the NYC taxi rides dataset along with Uber API data, to build time-varying traffic and payout matrices for a representative six-month time period in greater NYC. From this input, we can reason about prospective itineraries and payoffs. Moreover, the framework enables us to rigorously reason about and analyze the sensitivity of our results to perturbations in the input data. Among our main findings is that repositioning throughout the day is key to maximizing driver earnings, whereas \u00bbchasing surge' is typically misguided and sometimes a costly move."}}
