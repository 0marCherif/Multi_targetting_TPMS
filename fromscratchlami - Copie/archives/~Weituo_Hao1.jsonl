The very standard paradigm is \\emph{pre-training}: a large model with billions of parameters is trained on a surrogate task and then adapted to the downstream task of interest via fine-tuning. Knowledge transfer is what makes the pre-training possible, but the scale is what makes it powerful, which requires the availability of much more training data and computing resources. </p><p>\\hspace{0.5cm} Along with the great success of deep learning, fueled by larger datasets and more computation capability, however, come a series of interesting research topics. First, most pre-trained models learn on one-modal(vision or text) dataset and are designed for the single-step downstream task such as classification. Does pre-training for more complex tasks such as reinforcement learning still work? Second, pre-trained models obtain impressive empirical performance at the price of deployment challenges on low-resource(both memory and computation) platforms. How to compress the large models into smaller ones in an efficient way? Third, collecting sufficient training data is often expensive, time-consuming, or even unrealistic in many scenarios due to privacy constraints. Does it exist a training paradigm without data exchange? </p><p>\\hspace{0.5cm}For less explored questions mentioned above, I conducted several projects related but not limited to: $\\RN{1}$) large-scale pre-training based on multi-modal input for vision and language navigation, proofing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer across complex tasks via ~\\emph{pre-training}; $\\RN{2}$) data augmentation for compressing large-scale language models, improving the efficiency of knowledge transfer in the teacher-student \\emph{distillation} framework; $\\RN{3}$) weight factorization for model weights sharing in \\emph{Federated Learning}, achieving the trade-off between model performance and data privacy. </p>"}}

However, many previous works focus on refining individual components of encoder-decoder architecture that maps music to caption tokens, ignoring the potential benefits of correspondence between audio and lyrics. In this paper, we propose to explicitly learn the multimodal alignment through contrastive learning. By learning audio-lyrics correspondence, the model is guided to learn better cross-modal consistency, thus generating high-quality captions. We provide both theoretical and empirical results demonstrating the advantage of the proposed method, and achieve new state-of-the-art on two music captioning datasets."}}

In light of this need, federated learning has emerged as a popular training paradigm. However, many federated learning approaches trade transmitting data for communicating updated weight parameters for each local device. Therefore, a successful breach that would have otherwise directly compromised the data instead grants whitebox access to the local model, which opens the door to a number of attacks, including exposing the very data federated learning seeks to protect. Additionally, in distributed scenarios, individual client devices commonly exhibit high statistical heterogeneity. Many common federated approaches learn a single global model; while this may do well on average, performance degrades when the i.i.d. assumption is violated, underfitting individuals further from the mean and raising questions of fairness. To address these issues, we propose Weight Anonymized Factorization for Federated Learning (WAFFLe), an approach that combines the Indian Buffet Process with a shared dictionary of weight factors for neural networks. Experiments on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate WAFFLe\u2019s significant improvement to local test performance and fairness while simultaneously providing an extra layer of security."}}

In this paper, we proposed the first neural debiasing method for a pretrained sentence encoder, which transforms the pretrained encoder outputs into debiased representations via a fair filter (FairFil) network. To learn the FairFil, we introduce a contrastive learning framework that not only minimizes the correlation between filtered embeddings and bias words but also preserves rich semantic information of the original sentences. On real-world datasets, our FairFil effectively reduces the bias degree of pretrained text encoders, while continuously showing desirable performance on downstream tasks.

To aid and accelerate the diagnosis process, automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 via deep learning models has recently been explored by researchers across the world. While different data-driven deep learning models have been developed to mitigate the diagnosis of COVID-19, the data itself is still scarce due to patient privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) is a natural solution because it allows different organizations to cooperatively learn an effective deep learning model without sharing raw data. However, recent studies show that FL still lacks privacy protection and may cause data leakage. We investigate this challenging problem by proposing a simple yet effective algorithm, named \\textbf{F}ederated \\textbf{L}earning \\textbf{o}n Medical Datasets using \\textbf{P}artial Networks (FLOP), that shares only a partial model between the server and clients. Extensive experiments on benchmark data and real-world healthcare tasks show that our approach achieves comparable or better performance while reducing the privacy and security risks. Of particular interest, we conduct experiments on the COVID-19 dataset and find that our FLOP algorithm can allow different hospitals to collaboratively and effectively train a partially shared model without sharing local patients' data."}}

To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel federated learning system that employs zero-shot data augmentation on under-represented data to mitigate statistical heterogeneity, and encourage more uniform accuracy performance across clients in federated networks.

Previous works have made progress on voice conversion with parallel training data and pre-known speakers. However, zero-shot voice style transfer, which learns from non-parallel data and generates voices for previously unseen speakers, remains a challenging problem. In this paper we propose a novel zero-shot voice transfer method via disentangled representation learning. The proposed method first encodes speaker-related style and voice content of each input voice into separate low-dimensional embedding spaces, and then transfers to a new voice by combining the source content embedding and target style embedding through a decoder. With information-theoretic guidance, the style and content embedding spaces are representative and (ideally) independent of each other. On real-world datasets, our method outperforms other baselines and obtains state-of-the-art results in terms of transfer accuracy and voice naturalness."}}

Nevertheless, the improved results are attained at the price of bigger models, more power consumption, and slower inference, which hinder their applicability to low-resource (both memory and computation) platforms. Knowledge distillation (KD) has been demonstrated as an effective framework for compressing such big models. However, large-scale neural network systems are prone to memorize training instances, and thus tend to make inconsistent predictions when the data distribution is altered slightly. Moreover, the student model has few opportunities to request useful information from the teacher model when there is limited task-specific data available. To address these issues, we propose MixKD, a data-agnostic distillation framework that leverages mixup, a simple yet efficient data augmentation approach, to endow the resulting model with stronger generalization ability. Concretely, in addition to the original training examples, the student model is encouraged to mimic the teacher's behavior on the linear interpolation of example pairs as well. We prove from a theoretical perspective that under reasonable conditions MixKD gives rise to a smaller gap between the generalization error and the empirical error. To verify its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on the GLUE benchmark, where MixKD consistently leads to significant gains over the standard KD training, and outperforms several competitive baselines. Experiments under a limited-data setting and ablation studies further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach."}}
