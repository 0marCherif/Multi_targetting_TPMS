This technique has been shown to perform well for applications in drug discovery, utilizing structural features of small molecules to predict activity. However, the application of deep learning to discriminating features of kinase inhibitors has not been well explored. Small molecule kinase inhibitors are an important class of anti-cancer agents and have demonstrated impressive clinical efficacy in several different diseases. However, resistance is often observed mediated by adaptive Kinome reprogramming or subpopulation diversity. Therefore, polypharmacology and combination therapies offer potential therapeutic strategies for patients with resistant disease. Their development would benefit from more comprehensive and dense knowledge of small-molecule inhibition across the human Kinome. Because such data is not publicly available, we evaluated multiple machine learning methods to predict small molecule inhibition of 342 kinases using over 650K aggregated bioactivity annotations for over 300K small molecules curated from ChEMBL and the Kinase Knowledge Base (KKB). Our results demonstrated that multi-task deep neural networks outperform classical single-task methods, offering potential towards predicting activity profiles and filling gaps in the available data."}}

However, mainstream vHTS tools have significant limitations: ligand-based methods depend on knowledge of existing chemical matter, while structure-based tools such as docking involve significant approximations that limit their accuracy. Recent advances in scientific methods coupled with dramatic speedups in computational processing with GPUs make this an opportune time to consider the role of more rigorous methods that could improve the predictive power of vHTS workflows. In this Perspective, we assert that alchemical binding free energy methods using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have matured to the point where they can be applied in virtual screening campaigns as a final scoring stage to prioritize the top molecules for experimental testing. Specifically, we propose that alchemical absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations offer the most direct and computationally efficient approach within a rigorous statistical thermodynamic framework for computing binding energies of diverse molecules, as is required for virtual screening. ABFE calculations are particularly attractive for drug discovery at this point in time, where the confluence of large-scale genomics data and insights from chemical biology have unveiled a large number of promising disease targets for which no small molecule binders are known, precluding ligand-based approaches, and where traditional docking approaches have foundered to find progressible chemical matter."}}

In particular, this work re-examines concerted (a.k.a., one-step or unified) alchemical transformations commonly used in the prediction of hydration and relative binding free energies (RBFEs). We first classify several known challenges in these calculations into three categories: endpoint catastrophes, particle collapse, and large gradient-jumps. While endpoint catastrophes have long been addressed using softcore potentials, the remaining two problems occur much more sporadically and can result in either numerical instability (i.e., complete failure of a simulation) or inconsistent estimation (i.e., stochastic convergence to an incorrect result)."}}

Alchemical free energy simulations offer a highly accurate and computationally efficient route to achieving this goal. While the AMBER molecular dynamics package has successfully been used for alchemical free energy simulations in academic research groups for decades, widespread impact in industrial drug discovery settings has been minimal because of the previous limitations within the AMBER alchemical code, coupled with challenges in system setup and postprocessing workflows. Through a close academia-industry collaboration we have addressed many of the previous limitations with an aim to improve accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of alchemical binding free energy simulations in industrial drug discovery applications."}}

The hallmark of these methods is the use of \"bridging\" potential energy functions representing _alchemical_ intermediate states that cannot exist as real chemical species. The data collected from these bridging alchemical thermodynamic states allows the efficient computation of transfer free energies (or differences in transfer free energies) with orders of magnitude less simulation time than simulating the transfer process directly. While these methods are highly flexible, care must be taken in avoiding common pitfalls to ensure that computed free energy differences can be robust and reproducible for the chosen force field, and that appropriate corrections are included to permit direct comparison with experimental data."}}
