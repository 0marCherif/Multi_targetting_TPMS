Our goal is to enable a single end-to-end trained model to both learn to map robot observations to actions and enjoy the benefits of large-scale pretraining on language and vision-language data from the web. To this end, we propose to co-fine-tune state-of-the-art vision-language models on both robotic trajectory data and Internet-scale vision-language tasks, such as visual question answering. In contrast to other approaches, we propose a simple, general recipe to achieve this goal: in order to fit both natural language responses and robotic actions into the same format, we express the actions as text tokens and incorporate them directly into the training set of the model in the same way as natural language tokens. We refer to such category of models as vision-language-action models (VLA) and instantiate an example of such a model, which we call RT-2. Our extensive evaluation (6k evaluation trials) shows that our approach leads to performant robotic policies and enables RT-2 to obtain a range of emergent capabilities from Internet-scale training. This includes significantly improved generalization to novel objects, the ability to interpret commands not present in the robot training data (such as placing an object onto a particular number or icon), and the ability to perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user commands (such as picking up the smallest or largest object, or the one closest to another object). We further show that incorporating chain of thought reasoning allows RT-2 to perform multi-stage semantic reasoning, for example figuring out which object to pick up for use as an improvised hammer (a rock), or which type of drink is best suited for someone who is tired (an energy drink)."}}

In contrast, creating general instruction-following embodied agents remains a difficult challenge. Prior work that uses pure language-only models lack visual grounding, making it difficult to connect language instructions with visual observations. On the other hand, methods that use pre-trained vision-language models typically come with divided language and visual representations, requiring designing specialized network architecture to fuse them together. We propose a simple yet effective model for robots to solve instruction-following tasks in vision-based environments. Our InstructRL method consists of a multimodal transformer that encodes visual observations and language instructions, and a policy transformer that predicts actions based on encoded representations. The multimodal transformer is pre-trained on millions of image-text pairs and natural language text, thereby producing generic cross-modal representations of observations and instructions. The policy transformer keeps track of the full history of observations and actions, and predicts actions autoregressively. We show that this unified transformer model outperforms all state-of-the-art pre-trained or trained-from-scratch methods in both single-task and multi-task settings. Our model also shows better model scalability and generalization ability than prior work."}}

In this work, we propose a simple technique that significantly boosts the performance of LLMs without adding computational cost. Our key observation is that, by performing the next token prediction task with randomly selected past tokens masked out, we can improve the quality of the learned representations for downstream language understanding tasks. We hypothesize that randomly masking past tokens prevents over-attending to recent tokens and encourages attention to tokens in the distant past. By randomly masking input tokens in the PaLM model, we show that we can significantly improve PaLM's zero-shot performance on the SuperGLUE benchmark from 55.7 to 59.2. Experimental results show that FCM also improves PaLM's zero- and few-shot performance on a diverse suite of tasks, including commonsense reasoning, natural language inference and cloze completion. Moreover, we show that our technique also helps representation learning, significantly improving PaLM's finetuning results on SuperGLUE.\n"}}

One particularly popular application of such models is text-to-image generation, which is typically obtained via a two-stage process: in the first stage, a representation model is trained via self-supervised objectives; then in the second stage, a conditional generative decoder is trained on top of the representation to generate natural images. In this work, we aim at bringing representation learning and conditional generation together by unifying the two stages into a single model and training objective. We present UPGen, a unified pre-trained model for both representation learning and generation. UPGen is trained with a simple masked token prediction objective on a flexible mixture of image and language data. We use a pre-trained VQGAN image tokenizer to convert images into discrete tokens, then train a masked token prediction model on both paired image-text datasets and unpaired language datasets, using randomly sampled mask ratios. We show that this masked token prediction model can be directly used to generate images and language by iteratively re-masking and predicting the masked tokens. We demonstrate empirically that UPGen serves as both a good representation learning model and a generative model for both image and language."}}

Moreover, these methods are limited to paired image-text data, and cannot leverage widely-available unpaired data. In this paper, we investigate whether a large multimodal model trained purely via masked token prediction, without using modality-specific encoders or contrastive learning, can learn transferable representations for downstream tasks. We propose a simple and scalable network architecture, the Multimodal Masked Autoencoder (M3AE), which learns a unified encoder for both vision and language data via masked token prediction. We provide an empirical study of M3AE trained on a large-scale image-text dataset, and find that M3AE is able to learn generalizable representations that transfer well to downstream tasks. Surprisingly, we find that M3AE benefits from a higher text mask ratio (50-90%), in contrast to BERT whose standard masking ratio is 15%, due to the joint training of two data modalities. We also provide qualitative analysis showing that the learned representation incorporates meaningful information from both image and language. Lastly, we demonstrate the scalability of M3AE with larger model size and training time, and its flexibility to train on both paired image-text data as well as unpaired data.\n"}}

A representative class of algorithms exploits spectral decomposition of the stochastic transition dynamics to construct representations that enjoy strong theoretical properties in idealized settings. However, current spectral methods suffer from limited applicability because they are constructed for\nstate-only aggregation and are derived from a policy-dependent transition kernel, without considering the issue of exploration. To address these issues, we propose an alternative spectral method, Spectral Decomposition Representation (SPEDER), that extracts a state-action abstraction from the dynamics without inducing spurious dependence on the data collection policy, while also balancing the exploration-versus-exploitation trade-off during learning. A theoretical analysis establishes the sample efficiency of the proposed algorithm in both the online and offline settings. In addition, an experimental investigation demonstrates superior performance over current state-of-the-art algorithms across several RL benchmarks."}}

In the subfields of vision and language, this was largely achieved by scaling up transformer-based models and training them on large, diverse datasets. Motivated by this progress, we investigate whether the same strategy can be used to produce generalist reinforcement learning agents. Specifically, we show that a single transformer-based model \u2013 with a single set of weights \u2013 trained purely offline can play a suite of up to 46 Atari games simultaneously at close-to-human performance. When trained and evaluated appropriately, we find that the same trends observed in language and vision hold, including scaling of performance with model size and rapid adaptation to new games via fine-tuning. We compare several approaches in this multi-game setting, such as online and offline RL methods and behavioral cloning, and find that our Multi-Game Decision Transformer models offer the best scalability and performance. We release the pre-trained models and code to encourage further research in this direction."}}

Our main result is the analytic gradient of any f-divergence between the agent and expert state distribution w.r.t. reward parameters. Based on the derived gradient, we present an algorithm, f-IRL, that recovers a stationary reward function from the expert density by gradient descent. We show that f-IRL can learn behaviors from a hand-designed target state density or implicitly through expert observations. Our method outperforms adversarial imitation learning methods in terms of sample efficiency and the required number of expert trajectories on IRL benchmarks. Moreover, we show that the recovered reward function can be used to quickly solve downstream tasks, and empirically demonstrate its utility on hard-to-explore tasks and for behavior transfer across changes in dynamics."}}

In this work, we introduce a framework for using weak supervision to automatically disentangle this semantically meaningful subspace of tasks from the enormous space of nonsensical \"chaff\" tasks. We show that this learned subspace enables efficient exploration and provides a representation that captures distance between states. On a variety of challenging, vision-based continuous control problems, our approach leads to substantial performance gains, particularly as the complexity of the environment grows."}}
