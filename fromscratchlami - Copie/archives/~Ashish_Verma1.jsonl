Especially, for the cases of adversarial training or for training a newly synthesized model, one would not know the best learning rate regime beforehand. We propose an automated algorithm for determining the learning rate trajectory, that works across datasets and models for both natural and adversarial training, without requiring any dataset/model specific tuning. It is a stand-alone, parameterless, adaptive approach with no computational overhead. We theoretically discuss the algorithm's convergence behavior. We empirically validate our algorithm extensively. Our results show that our proposed approach \\emph{consistently} achieves top-level accuracy compared to SOTA baselines in the literature in natural training, as well as in adversarial training."}}

We do filter pruning followed by low-rank decomposition using Tucker decomposition for model compression.\n\nWe show that our approach achieves upto 57\\% higher model compression when compared to either Tucker Decomposition or Filter pruning alone  at similar accuracy for GoogleNet. Also, it reduces the Flops by upto 48\\% thereby making the inferencing faster."}}

However, the task of mobile query classification is made difficult by the presence of more inter-active and personalized queries like map, command and control, dialogue, joke etc. Voice queries are made more difficult than typed queries due to the errors introduced by the automatic speech recognizer. This is the first paper, to the best of our knowledge, to bring the complexities of voice search and intent classification together. In this paper, we propose some novel features for intent classification, like the url's of the search engine results for the given query. We also show the effectiveness of other features derived from the part-of-speech information of the query and search engine results, in proposing a multi-stage classifier for intent classification. We evaluate the classifier using tagged data, collected from a voice search android application, where we achieve an average of 22% f-score improvement per category, over the commonly used bag-of-words baseline."}}

Enterprises are taking a hard look at this open, unmediated platform because the community effect generated on this channel can have a telling effect on their brand image, potential market opportunity and customer loyalty. In this work we present our experiences in building a system that mines conversations on social platforms to identify and prioritize those posts and messages that are relevant to enterprises. The system presented in this work aims to empower an agent or a representative in an enterprise to monitor, track and respond to customer communication while also encouraging community participation."}}

The primary reason is that on-field practitioners are required to be both technically proficient and knowledgeable about the business. The recent abundance of unstructured business data has thrown up new opportunities for analytics, but has also multiplied the deployment challenge, since interpretation of concepts derived from textual sources require a deep understanding of the business. In such a scenario, a managed service for analytics comes up as the best alternative. A managed analytics service is centered around a business analyst who acts as a liaison between the business and the technology. This calls for new tools that assist the analyst to be efficient in the tasks that she needs to execute. Also, the analytics needs to be repeatable , in that the delivered insights should not depend heavily on the expertise of specific analysts. These factors lead us to identify new areas that open up for KDD research in terms of 'time-to-insight' and repeatability for these analysts. We present our analytics framework in the form of a managed service offering for CRM analytics. We describe different analyst-centric tools using a case study from real-life engagements and demonstrate their effectiveness."}}
