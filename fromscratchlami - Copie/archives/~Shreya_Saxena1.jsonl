When decoding behavior from neural activity, early detection of behavior may help in devising corrective neural stimulation before the onset of behavior. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are common models to model sequence data. However, standard RNNs are not able to handle data with temporal distribution shifts to guarantee robust classification across time. To enable the network to utilize all temporal features of the neural input data, and to enhance the memory of an RNN, we propose a novel approach: RNNs with time-varying weights, here termed Time-Varying RNNs (TV-RNNs). These models are able to not only predict the class of the time-sequence correctly but also lead to accurate classification earlier in the sequence than standard RNNs. In this work, we focus on early robust sequential classification of brain-wide neural activity across time using TV-RNNs as subjects perform a motor task."}}

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been shown to perform successful classification for sequence data. However, they are black box models: once trained, it is difficult to uncover the mechanisms that they are using to classify. In this study, we analyze the effect of RNNs on classifying behavior using a simulated dataset and a widefield neural activity dataset as mice perform a self-initiated behavior. We show that RNNs are comparable to, or outperform, traditional classification methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and can also lead to accurate prediction of behavior. Using dimensionality reduction, we visualize the activity of the RNNs to better understand the classification mechanisms of the RNNs. Finally, we are able to accurately pinpoint the effect of different regions on behavioral classification. This study highlights the utility and interpretability of RNNs while classifying behavior using neural activity from different regions."}}

Yet the corresponding trade-offs between these factors and tracking motor commands have not been rigorously quantified. We use feedback control principles to quantify performance limitations of the sensorimotor control system (SCS) to track fast periodic movements. We show that (1) linear models of the SCS fail to predict known undesirable phenomena, including skipped cycles, overshoot and undershoot, produced when tracking signals in the \u201cfast regime,\u201d while nonlinear pulsatile control models can predict such undesirable phenomena, and (2) tools from nonlinear control theory allow us to characterize fundamental limitations in this fast regime. Using a validated and tractable nonlinear model of the SCS, we derive an analytical upper bound on frequencies that the SCS model can reliably track before producing such undesirable phenomena as a function of the neurons' biophysical constraints and muscle dynamics. The performance limitations derived here have important implications in sensorimotor control. For example, if the primary motor cortex is compromised due to disease or damage, the theory suggests ways to manipulate muscle dynamics by adding the necessary compensatory forces using an assistive neuroprosthetic device to restore motor performance and, more important, fast and agile movements. Just how one should compensate can be informed by our SCS model and the theory developed here."}}

Here, we introduce Localized semi-NMF (LocaNMF), an algorithm that efficiently decomposes widefield video data into meaningful spatial and temporal components that can be decoded and compared across different behavioral sessions and experimental conditions. Mapping the inferred components onto well-defined brain regions using a widely-used brain atlas provides an interpretable, stable decomposition. LocaNMF allows us to satisfactorily extract the activity of the different brain regions in individual mice in a data-driven manner, while taking into account mouse-specific and preparation-specific differences."}}

Behavior has traditionally been characterized by low-dimensional, task-related variables such as movement speed or response times. More recently, there has been a growing interest in automated analysis of high-dimensional video data collected during experiments. Here we introduce a probabilistic framework for the analysis of behavioral video and neural activity. This framework provides tools for compression, segmentation, generation, and decoding of behavioral videos. Compression is performed using a convolutional autoencoder (CAE), which yields a low-dimensional continuous representation of behavior. We then use an autoregressive hidden Markov model (ARHMM) to segment the CAE representation into discrete \"behavioral syllables.\" The resulting generative model can be used to simulate behavioral video data. Finally, based on this generative model, we develop a novel Bayesian decoding approach that takes in neural activity and outputs probabilistic estimates of the full-resolution behavioral video. We demonstrate this framework on two different experimental paradigms using distinct behavioral and neural recording technologies."}}

In the case of sequential data, closed-form inference is possible when the transition and observation functions are linear. However, approximate inference techniques are usually necessary when dealing with nonlinear evolution and observations. Here, we propose a novel variational inference framework for the explicit modeling of time series, Variational Inference for Nonlinear Dynamics (VIND), that is able to uncover nonlinear observation and latent dynamics from sequential data. The framework includes a structured approximate posterior, and an algorithm that relies on the fixed-point iteration method to find the best estimate for latent trajectories. We apply the method to several datasets and show that it is able to accurately infer the underlying dynamics of these systems, in some cases substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods."}}
