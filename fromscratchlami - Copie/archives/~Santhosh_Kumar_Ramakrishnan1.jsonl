We present an approach that links egocentric video and camera pose over time by learning representations that are predictive of the camera-wearer's (potentially unseen) local surroundings to facilitate human-centric environment understanding. We train such models using videos from agents in simulated 3D environments where the environment is fully observable, and test them on real-world videos of house tours from unseen environments. We show that by grounding videos in their physical environment, our models surpass traditional scene classification models at predicting which room a camera-wearer is in (where frame-level information is insufficient), and can leverage this grounding to localize video moments corresponding to environment-centric queries, outperforming prior methods.

HM3DSEM is the largest dataset of 3D real-world spaces with densely annotated semantics that is currently available to the academic community. It consists of 142,646 object instance annotations across 216 3D spaces and 3,100 rooms within those spaces. The scale, quality, and diversity of object annotations far exceed those of datasets from prior work. A key difference setting apart HM3DSEM from other datasets is the use of texture information to annotate pixel-accurate object boundaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HM3DSEM dataset for the Object Goal Navigation task using different methods. Policies trained using HM3DSEM perform comparable or better than those trained on prior datasets."}}

HM3D contains 112.5k m^2 of navigable space, which is 1.4 - 3.7\u00d7 larger than other building-scale datasets (MP3D, Gibson). When compared to existing photorealistic 3D datasets (Replica, MP3D, Gibson, ScanNet), rendered images from HM3D have 20 - 85% higher visual \ufb01delity w.r.t. counterpart images captured with real cameras, and HM3D meshes have 34 - 91% fewer artifacts due to incomplete surface reconstruction.\n\nThe increased scale, \ufb01delity, and diversity of HM3D directly impacts the performance of embodied AI agents trained using it.
