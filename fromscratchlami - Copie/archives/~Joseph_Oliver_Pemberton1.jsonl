In neuroscience, it is unclear whether the brain could adopt a similar strategy to correctly modify its synapses. Recent models have attempted to bridge this gap while being consistent with a range of experimental observations. However, these models are either unable to effectively backpropagate error signals across multiple layers or require a multi-phase learning process, neither of which are reminiscent of learning in the brain. Here, we introduce a new model, Bursting Cortico-Cortical Networks (BurstCCN), which solves these issues by integrating known properties of cortical networks namely bursting activity, short-term plasticity (STP) and dendrite-targeting interneurons. BurstCCN relies on burst multiplexing via connection-type-specific STP to propagate backprop-like error signals within deep cortical networks. These error signals are encoded at distal dendrites and induce burst-dependent plasticity as a result of excitatory-inhibitory top-down inputs. First, we demonstrate that our model can effectively backpropagate errors through multiple layers using a single-phase learning process. Next, we show both empirically and analytically that learning in our model approximates backprop-derived gradients. Finally, we demonstrate that our model is capable of learning complex image classification tasks (MNIST and CIFAR-10). Overall, our results suggest that cortical features across sub-cellular, cellular, microcircuit and systems levels jointly underlie single-phase efficient deep learning in the brain."}}

For credit to be assigned across neural networks they must, in principle, wait for specific neural computations to finish. How the brain deals with this inherent locking problem has remained unclear. Deep learning methods suffer from similar locking constraints both on the forward and feedback phase. Recently, decoupled neural interfaces (DNIs) were introduced as a solution to the forward and feedback locking problems in deep networks.\nHere we propose that a specialised brain region, the cerebellum, helps the cerebral cortex solve similar locking problems akin to DNIs. To demonstrate the potential of this framework we introduce a systems-level model in which a recurrent cortical network receives online temporal feedback predictions from a cerebellar module. We test this cortico-cerebellar recurrent neural network (ccRNN) model on a number of sensorimotor (line and digit drawing) and cognitive tasks (pattern recognition and caption generation) that have been shown to be cerebellar-dependent. In all tasks, we observe that ccRNNs facilitates learning while reducing ataxia-like behaviours, consistent with classical experimental observations. Moreover, our model also explains recent behavioural and neuronal observations while making several testable predictions across multiple levels.\nOverall, our work offers a novel perspective on the cerebellum as a brain-wide decoupling machine for efficient credit assignment and opens a new avenue between deep learning and neuroscience."}}

For credit to be correctly assigned across multiple cortical areas a given area should, in principle, wait for others to finish their computation. How the brain deals with this locking problem has remained unclear. Deep learning methods suffer from similar locking constraints both on the forward and backward phase. Recently, decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) were introduced as a solution to the forward and backward locking problems.\nHere we propose that a specialised brain region, the cerebellum, helps the cerebral cortex solve the locking problem closely matching the computations and architecture of DNI. In particular, we propose that classical cerebellar forward and inverse models are equivalent to solving the backward and forward locking problems, respectively. To demonstrate the potential of this framework we focus on modelling a given brain area as a recurrent neural network in which the cerebellum approximates temporal feedback signals as provided by BPTT. We tested the cortico-cerebellar-DNI (CC-DNI) model in a range of sensorimotor and cognitive tasks that have been shown to be cerebellar-dependent. First, we show that the CC-DNI unlocking mechanisms can facilitate learning in a simple target reaching task. Next, by building on the sequential MNIST task we demonstrate that these results generalise to more complex sensorimotor tasks. Our cortico-cerebellar model readily applies to a wider range of modalities, to demonstrate this we tested the model in a cognitive task, caption generation. Models without the cerebellar-DNI component exhibit deficits similar to those observed in cerebellar patients in both motor and cognitive tasks. Moreover, we used CC-DNI to generate a set of specific neuroscience predictions. Finally, we introduce a CC-DNI model with highly sparse connectivity as observed in the cerebellum, which substantially reduces the number of parameters while improving learning through decorrelation.\nOverall, our work offers a novel perspective on the cerebellum as a brain-wide decoupling machine for efficient credit assignment and opens a new avenue of research between deep learning and neuroscience."}}
