Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based approaches become an essential strand to learn low-dimensional continuous embeddings of the entire graphs for graph label prediction. While GNNs explicitly aggregate the neighborhood information and implicitly capture the topological structure for graph representation, they ignore the relationships among graphs. In this paper, we propose a Graph-Graph Similarity Network to tackle the graph classification problem by constructing a SuperGraph through learning the relationships among graphs. Each node in the SuperGraph represents an input graph, and the weights of edges denote the similarity between graphs. By this means, the graph classification is then transformed into a classical node classification problem. Specifically, we employ an Adversarial Autoencoder to align embeddings of all the graphs to a same distribution. After the alignment, we design the Graph-Graph Similarity Network to learn the similarity between graphs, which function as the adjacency matrix of the SuperGraph. By running node classification algorithms on the SuperGraph, we can predict the labels of graphs. Experiments on five widely used benchmarks under a fair setting demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}}

In response to the need of mitigating discrimination, fairness has been regarded as a crucial property in algorithmic design. In this work, we study the problem of disparate impact on graph-structured data. Specifically, we focus on dyadic fairness, which articulates a fairness concept that a predictive relationship between two instances should be independent of the sensitive attributes. Based on this, we theoretically relate the graph connections to dyadic fairness on link predictive scores in learning graph neural networks, and reveal that regulating weights on existing edges in a graph contributes to dyadic fairness conditionally. Subsequently, we propose our algorithm, \\textbf{FairAdj}, to empirically learn a fair adjacency matrix with proper graph structural constraints for fair link prediction, and in the meanwhile preserve predictive accuracy as much as possible. Empirical validation demonstrates that our method delivers effective dyadic fairness in terms of various statistics, and at the same time enjoys a favorable fairness-utility tradeoff."}}

Using the proposed framework, one could construct embedding models that naturally accommodate all possible local graph patterns, which are necessary for reproducing a complete graph from atomic knowledge triplets. We reconstruct many state-of-the-art models from the framework and re-interpret them as embeddings with different groups. Moreover, we also propose new instantiation models using simple continuous non-abelian groups."}}

Biological neurons work far beyond linearly summing up synaptic inputs and then transforming the integrated information.  A biological neuron change firing modes accordingly to peripheral factors (e.g., neuromodulators) as well as intrinsic ones.  Our modification connects a new type of ANN nodes, which mimic the function of biological neuromodulators and are termed modulators, to enable other traditional ANN nodes to adjust their activation sensitivities in run-time based on their input patterns.  In this manner, we enable the slope of the activation function to be context dependent.  This modification produces statistically significant improvements in comparison with traditional ANN nodes in the context of Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks. "}}

A model, synthetic active system composed of microtubule polymers driven by protein motors spontaneously forms a liquid-crystalline nematic phase. Extensile stress created by the protein motors precipitates continuous buckling and folding of the microtubules creating motile topological defects and turbulent fluid flows. Defect motion is determined by the rheological properties of the material; however, these remain largely unquantified. Measuring defects dynamics can yield fundamental insights into active nematics, a class of materials that include bacterial films and animal cells. Current methods for defect detection lack robustness and precision, and require fine-tuning for datasets with different visual quality.  In this study, we applied Deep Learning to train a defect detector to automatically analyze microscopy videos of the microtubule active nematic.  Experimental results indicate that our method is robust and accurate. It is expected to significantly increase the amount of video data that can be processed."}}
