This \u201cearly\u201d olfactory information processing has two important characteristics. First, response of a PN to its cognate ORN is normalized by the overall activity of other ORNs, a phenomenon termed \u201cdivisive normalization.\u201d Second, PNs respond strongly to the onset of ORN activities, but they adapt to prolonged or continuously varying inputs. Despite the importance of these characteristics for learning and memory, their underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we develop a circuit model for describing the ORN-LN-PN dynamics by including key neuron-neuron interactions such as short-term plasticity (STP) and presynaptic inhibition (PI). By fitting our model to experimental data quantitatively, we show that a strong STP balanced between short-term facilitation (STF) and short-term depression (STD) is responsible for the observed nonlinear divisive normalization in Drosophila. Our circuit model suggests that either STP or PI alone can lead to adaptive response. However, by comparing our model results with experimental data, we find that both STP and PI work together to achieve a strong and robust adaptive response. Our model not only helps reveal the mechanisms underlying two main characteristics of the ..."}}

In this work, we study the statistical mechanics of learning in Deep Linear Neural Networks (DLNNs) in which the input-output function of an individual unit is linear. Despite the linearity of the units, learning in DLNNs is nonlinear, hence studying its properties reveals some of the features of nonlinear Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Importantly, we solve exactly the network properties following supervised learning using an equilibrium Gibbs distribution in the weight space. To do this, we introduce the Back-Propagating Kernel Renormalization (BPKR), which allows for the incremental integration of the network weights starting from the network output layer and progressing backward until the first layer's weights are integrated out. This procedure allows us to evaluate important network properties, such as its generalization error, the role of network width and depth, the impact of the size of the training set, and the effects of weight regularization and learning stochasticity. BPKR does not assume specific statistics of the input or the task's output. Furthermore, by performing partial integration of the layers, the BPKR allows us to compute the properties of the neural representations across the different hidden layers. We have proposed an extension of the BPKR to nonlinear DNNs with ReLU. Surprisingly, our numerical simulations reveal that despite the nonlinearity, the predictions of our theory are largely shared by ReLU networks in a wide regime of parameters. Our work is the first exact statistical mechanical study of learning in a family of DNNs, and the first successful theory of learning through successive integration of DoFs in the learned weight space."}}

Recent studies suggest an intriguing link between balance on fast timescales, tight balance, and efficient information coding with spikes. We further this connection by taking a principled approach to optimal balanced networks of excitatory (E) and inhibitory(I) neurons. By deriving E-I spiking neural networks from greedy spike-based optimizations of constrained minimax objectives, we show that tight balance arises from correcting for deviations from the minimax optimum. We predict specific neuron firing rates in the networks by solving the minimax problems, going beyond statistical theories of balanced networks. We design minimax objectives for reconstruction of an input signal, associative memory, and storage of manifold attractors, and derive from them E-I networks that perform the computation. Overall, we present a novel normative modeling approach for spiking E-I networks, going beyond the widely-used energy-minimizing networks that violate Dale\u2019s law. Our networks can be used to model cortical circuits and computations."}}
