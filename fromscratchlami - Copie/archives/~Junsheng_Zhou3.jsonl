Current methods achieve encouraging results by mapping local patches to normal vectors or learning local surface fitting using neural networks. However, these methods are not generalized well to unseen scenarios and are sensitive to parameter settings. To resolve these issues, we propose an implicit function to learn an angle field around the normal of each point in the spherical coordinate system, which is dubbed as Neural Angle Fields (NeAF). Instead of directly predicting the normal of an input point, we predict the angle offset between the ground truth normal and a randomly sampled query normal. This strategy pushes the network to observe more diverse samples, which leads to higher prediction accuracy in a more robust manner. To predict normals from the learned angle fields at inference time, we randomly sample query vectors in a unit spherical space and take the vectors with minimal angle values as the predicted normals. To further leverage the prior learned by NeAF, we propose to refine the predicted normal vectors by minimizing the angle offsets. The experimental results with synthetic data and real scans show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art under widely used benchmarks."}}

Self-supervised learning, which is used on raw and unlabeled data to pre-train deep neural networks, is a promising approach to address this issue. Existing works usually take the common aid from auto-encoders to establish the self-supervision by the self-reconstruction schema. However, the previous auto-encoders merely focus on the global shapes and do not distinguish the local and global geometric features apart. To address this problem, we present a novel and efficient self-supervised point cloud representation learning framework, named 3D Occlusion Auto-Encoder (3D-OAE), to facilitate the detailed supervision inherited in local regions and global shapes. We propose to randomly occlude some local patches of point clouds and establish the supervision via inpainting the occluded patches using the remaining ones. Specifically, we design an asymmetrical encoder-decoder architecture based on standard Transformer, where the encoder operates only on the visible subset of patches to learn local patterns, and a lightweight decoder is designed to leverage these visible patterns to infer the missing geometries via self-attention. We find that occluding a very high proportion of the input point cloud (e.g. 75%) will still yield a nontrivial self-supervisory performance, which enables us to achieve 3-4 times faster during training but also improve accuracy. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on a diverse range of downstream discriminative and generative tasks."}}

So far, most of the previous methods still struggle to extract semantic attributes for 3D reconstruction task. Since the semantic attributes of a single image are usually implicit and entangled with each other, it is still challenging to reconstruct 3D shape with detailed semantic structures represented by the input image. To address this problem, we propose 3DAttriFlow to disentangle and extract semantic attributes through different semantic levels in the input images. These disentangled semantic attributes will be integrated into the 3D shape reconstruction process, which can provide definite guidance to the reconstruction of specific attribute on 3D shape. As a result, the 3D decoder can explicitly capture high-level semantic features at the bottom of the network, and utilize low-level features at the top of the network, which allows to reconstruct more accurate 3D shapes. Note that the explicit disentangling is learned without extra labels, where the only supervision used in our training is the input image and its corresponding 3D shape. Our comprehensive experiments on ShapeNet dataset demonstrate that 3DAttriFlow outperforms the state-of-the-art shape reconstruction methods, and we also validate its generalization ability on shape completion task.

With a single incomplete point cloud, it becomes the partial point cloud completion problem. Given multiple different observations, 3D reconstruction can be addressed by performing partial-to-partial point cloud registration. Recently, a large-scale Multi-View Partial (MVP) point cloud dataset has been released, which consists of over 100,000 high-quality virtual-scanned partial point clouds. Based on the MVP dataset, this paper reports methods and results in the Multi-View Partial Point Cloud Challenge 2021 on Completion and Registration. In total, 128 participants registered for the competition, and 31 teams made valid submissions. The top-ranked solutions will be analyzed, and then we will discuss future research directions."}}
