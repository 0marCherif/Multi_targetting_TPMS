A federated query can take a query and provide data analysis based on data from various data engines. Since the query data originates from multiple data engines, federated queries usually rely on join operation and data migration to complete the query and take a long time. The challenges of optimizing federated queries lie on join order selection and data migration coordination. However, enumerating all join orders is impractical because the set of join orders grows exponentially with the number of relations to be joined. To improve the performance of federated queries, we present a deep reinforcement learning-based approach on optimizing join order and join engine selection for federated queries and design an deep Q-network-based (DQN-based) optimizer. The DQN-based optimizer can generate join search policies that optimize the join order selection for datasets with a given cost model. Based on the DQN-based optimizer, we implement a federated query system Coral which can provide optimization for join order selection of federated queries. With the optimized join order, Coral can transform a federated query into a set of subqueries which will be assigned to and executed on different data engines. We also propose a subquery cache optimization to optimize data migration during the query execution. The extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that Coral can significantly reduce the query latency of federated queries and achieve a speedup of up to 5.03 $$\\times $$ \u00d7 compared to the cutting-edge federated query systems."}}

In existing heterogeneous GNNs, meta-path plays an essential role. However, recent work pointed out that simple homogeneous graph model without meta-path can also achieve comparable results, which calls into question the necessity of meta-path. In this paper, we first present the intrinsic difference about meta-path-based and meta-path-free models, i.e., how to select neighbors for node aggregation. Then, we propose a novel framework to utilize the rich type semantic information in heterogeneous graphs comprehensively, namely HAGNN (Hybrid Aggregation for Heterogeneous GNNs). The core of HAGNN is to leverage the meta-path neighbors and the directly connected neighbors simultaneously for node aggregations. HAGNN divides the overall aggregation process into two phases: meta-path-based intra-type aggregation and meta-path-free inter-type aggregation. During the intra-type aggregation phase, we propose a new data structure called fused meta-path graph and perform structural semantic aware aggregation on it. Finally, we combine the embeddings generated by each phase. Compared with existing heterogeneous GNN models, HAGNN can take full advantage of the heterogeneity in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experimental results on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction tasks show that HAGNN outperforms the existing modes, demonstrating the effectiveness of HAGNN."}}

The existing global attack methods treat all nodes in the graph as their attack targets. Although existing methods have achieved excellent results, there is still considerable space for improvement. The key problem is that the current approaches rigidly follow the definition of global attacks. They ignore an important issue, i.e., different nodes have different robustness and are not equally resilient to attacks. From a global attacker's view, we should arrange the attack budget wisely, rather than wasting them on highly robust nodes. To this end, we propose a totally new method named partial graph attack (PGA), which selects the vulnerable nodes as attack targets. First, to select the vulnerable items, we propose a hierarchical target selection policy, which allows attackers to only focus on easy-to-attack nodes. Then, we propose a cost-effective anchor-picking policy to pick the most promising anchors for adding or removing edges, and a more aggressive iterative greedy-based attack method to perform more efficient attacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PGA can achieve significant improvements in both attack effect and attack efficiency compared to other existing graph global attack methods."}}

Despite effectiveness, graph neural network (GNN)-based methods suffer from data sparsity in real scenarios. Recently, contrastive learning (CL) has been used to address the problem of data sparsity. However, most CL-based methods only leverage the original user-item interaction graph to construct the CL task, lacking the explicit exploitation of the higher-order information (i.e., user-user and item-item relationships). Even for the CL-based method that uses the higher-order information, the reception field of the higher-order information is fixed and regardless of the difference between nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive multi-view fusion contrastive learning framework, named AdaMCL, for graph collaborative filtering. To exploit the higher-order information more accurately, we propose an adaptive fusion strategy to fuse the embeddings learned from the user-item and user-user graphs. Moreover, we propose a multi-view fusion contrastive learning paradigm to construct effective CL tasks. Besides, to alleviate the noisy information caused by aggregating higher-order neighbors, we propose a layer-level CL task. Extensive experimental results reveal that AdaMCL is effective and outperforms existing collaborative filtering models significantly."}}

In recent years, great efforts have been devoted to Automated Feature Engineering (AutoFE) to replace expensive human labor. However, all existing methods treat AutoFE as an optimization problem over a discrete feature space. Huge search space leads to significant computational overhead. Unlike previous work, we perform AutoFE in a continuous vector space and propose a differentiable method called DIFER in this paper. We first introduce a feature optimizer based on the encoder-predictor-decoder framework, which maps features into the continuous vector space via the encoder, optimizes the embedding along the gradient direction induced by the predictor, and recovers better features from the optimized embedding by the decoder. Based on the feature optimizer, we employ a feature evolution method to search for better features iteratively. Extensive experiments on classification and regression datasets demonstrate that DIFER can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art AutoFE methods in terms of both model performance and computational efficiency.

Due to the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to perform adversarial attacks under the black-box setting, where the architecture/parameters and training data of target systems cannot be easily accessed by attackers. However, generating high-quality fake user profiles under black-box setting is rather challenging with limited resources to target systems. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a novel strategy by leveraging items' attribute information (i.e., items' knowledge graph), which can be publicly accessible and provide rich auxiliary knowledge to enhance the generation of fake user profiles. More specifically, we propose a knowledge graph-enhanced black-box attacking framework (KGAttack) to effectively learn attacking policies through deep reinforcement learning techniques, in which knowledge graph is seamlessly integrated into hierarchical policy networks to generate fake user profiles for performing adversarial black-box attacks. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting."}}

Inspired by the success of neural architecture search (NAS), searching the GNN architectures automatically has attracted more and more attention. Motivated by the fact that the search space plays a critical role in the NAS, we propose a novel and effective graph neural architecture search method called PSP from the perspective of search space design in this paper. We first propose an expressive search space composed of multiple cells. Instead of searching the entire architecture, we focus on searching the architecture of the cell. Then, we propose a progressive space pruning-based algorithm to search the architectures efficiently. Moreover, the data-specific search spaces and architectures ob-tained by PSP can be transferred to new graph datasets based on meta-learning. Extensive experimental results on different types of graph datasets reveal that PSP outperforms the state-of-the-art handcrafted architectures and the existing NAS methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency."}}
