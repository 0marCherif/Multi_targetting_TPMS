First, we offer a generalization bound using the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model. The bound describes the gap between the expected loss and empirical loss of the NE approximator. Afterward, we prove the agnostic PAC learnability of the Nash approximator. In addition to theoretical analysis, we demonstrate an application of NE approximator in experiments. The trained NE approximator can be used to warm-start and accelerate classical NE solvers. Together, our results show the practicability of approximating NE through function approximation."}}

However, existing approaches neglect externalities, such as the interaction between ads and organic items. In this paper, we propose a general framework, namely Score-Weighted VCG, for designing learning-based ad auctions that account for externalities. The framework decomposes the optimal auction design into two parts: designing a monotone score function and an allocation algorithm, which facilitates data-driven implementation. Theoretical results demonstrate that this framework produces the optimal incentive-compatible and individually rational ad auction under various externality-aware CTR models while being data-efficient and robust. Moreover, we present an approach to implement the proposed framework with a matching-based allocation algorithm. Experiment results on both real-world and synthetic data illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}

The framework includes an intuitive representation module (System 1) and an inference module (System 2). System 1 is designed to understand the user\u2019s historical interaction sequences with external knowledge graph. System 2 is built to make recommendations by reinforcement learning to consider long-term returns and diversity. We demonstrate the performance of our method on a wide range of recommendation datasets. Experiments show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art models regarding both relevance and diversity."}}

Recently, a variety of methods have been developed for this problem, which generally try to learn effective representations of users and items and then match items to users according to their representations. Though these methods have been shown quite effective, they lack good explanations, which are critical to recommender systems. In this paper, we take a different route and propose generating recommendations by finding meaningful paths from users to items. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a sequential decision process, where the target user is defined as the initial state, and the edges on the graphs are defined as actions. We shape the rewards according to existing state-of-the-art methods and then train a policy function with policy gradient methods. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our proposed method not only provides effective recommendations but also offers good explanations."}}

The problem is very challenging since (1) the input features (e.g., the user id, user age, item id, item category) are usually sparse and high-dimensional, and (2) an effective prediction relies on high-order combinatorial features (a.k.a. cross features), which are very time-consuming to hand-craft by domain experts and are impossible to be enumerated. Therefore, there have been efforts in finding low-dimensional representations of the sparse and high-dimensional raw features and their meaningful combinations. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient method called the AutoInt to automatically learn the high-order feature interactions of input features. Our proposed algorithm is very general, which can be applied to both numerical and categorical input features. Specifically, we map both the numerical and categorical features into the same low-dimensional space. Afterwards, a multi-head self-attentive neural network with residual connections is proposed to explicitly model the feature interactions in the low-dimensional space. With different layers of the multi-head self-attentive neural networks, different orders of feature combinations of input features can be modeled. The whole model can be efficiently fit on large-scale raw data in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that our proposed approach not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for prediction but also offers good explainability.
