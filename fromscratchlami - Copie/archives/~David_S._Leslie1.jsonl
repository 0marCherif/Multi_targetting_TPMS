We focus on the practical but  challenging setting of decentralized MARL, where agents make decisions without coordination by a centralized controller, but only based on their own payoffs and local actions executed. The agents need not observe the opponent's actions or payoffs, possibly being even  oblivious to the presence of the opponent, nor be aware of the zero-sum structure of the underlying game, a setting also referred to as radically uncoupled in the literature of learning in games. In this paper, we develop a radically uncoupled Q-learning dynamics that is both rational and convergent: the learning dynamics converges to the best response to the opponent's strategy when the opponent follows an asymptotically stationary strategy;  when both agents adopt the learning dynamics, they converge to the Nash equilibrium of the game. The key challenge in this decentralized setting is the non-stationarity of the environment from an agent's perspective, since both her own payoffs and the system evolution depend on the actions of other agents, and each agent adapts her policies simultaneously and independently. To address this issue, we develop a two-timescale learning dynamics where each agent updates her local Q-function and value function estimates concurrently, with the latter happening at a slower timescale."}}

As a result, levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the atmosphere dropped. In this work, we use 550,134 NO2 data points from 237 stations in the UK to build a spatiotemporal Gaussian process capable of predicting NO2 levels across the entire UK. We integrate several covariate datasets to enhance the model's ability to capture the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of NO2. Our numerical analyses show that, within two weeks of a UK lockdown being imposed, UK NO2 levels dropped 36.8%. Further, we show that as a direct result of lockdown NO2 levels were 29-38% lower than what they would have been had no lockdown occurred. In accompaniment to these numerical results, we provide a software framework that allows practitioners to easily and efficiently fit similar models. "}}

A novel approximation is proposed for the information gain -- an information-theoretic quantity central to solving a range of BO problems, including noisy, multi-fidelity and batch optimisations across both continuous and highly-structured discrete spaces. Previously, these problems have been tackled separately within information-theoretic BO, each requiring a different sophisticated approximation scheme, except for batch BO, for which no computationally-lightweight information-theoretic approach has previously been proposed. GIBBON (General-purpose Information-Based Bayesian OptimisatioN) provides a single principled framework suitable for all the above, out-performing existing approaches whilst incurring substantially lower computational overheads. In addition, GIBBON does not require the problem's search space to be Euclidean and so is the first high-performance yet computationally light-weight acquisition function that supports batch BO over general highly structured input spaces like molecular search and gene design. Moreover, our principled derivation of GIBBON yields a natural interpretation of a popular batch BO heuristic based on determinantal point processes. Finally, we analyse GIBBON across a suite of synthetic benchmark tasks, a molecular search loop, and as part of a challenging batch multi-fidelity framework for problems with controllable experimental noise."}}

We introduce a variational Bayesian Recurrent Neural Net recommender system that acts on time series of interactions between the internet platform and the user, and which scales to real world industrial situations. The recommender system is tested both online on real users, and on an offline dataset collected from a Norwegian web-based marketplace, FINN.no, that is made public for research. This is one of the first publicly available datasets which includes all the slates that are presented to users as well as which items (if any) in the slates were clicked on. Such a data set allows us to move beyond the common assumption that implicitly assumes that users are considering all possible items at each interaction. Instead we build our likelihood using the items that are actually in the slate, and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches theoretically and in experiments. We also introduce a hierarchical prior for the item parameters based on group memberships. Both item parameters and user preferences are learned probabilistically. Furthermore, we combine our model with bandit strategies to ensure learning, and introduce `in-slate Thompson Sampling' which makes use of the slates to maximise explorative opportunities. We show experimentally that explorative recommender strategies perform on par or above their greedy counterparts. Even without making use of exploration to learn more effectively, click rates increase simply because of improved diversity in the recommended slates."}}

Finally, we present a modified \u03b4-converging best-response dynamic, in which the discount rate converges to 1, and the learned value converges to the asymptotic value of the zero-sum stochastic game. The critical feature of all the dynamic processes is a separation of adaption rates: beliefs about the value of states adapt more slowly than the strategies adapt, and in the case of the \u03b4-converging dynamic the discount rate adapts more slowly than everything else."}}

Abstract We consider the problem of sequentially choosing observation regions along a line, with an aim of maximising the detection of events of interest. Such a problem may arise when monitoring the movements of endangered or migratory species, detecting crossings of a border, policing activities at sea, and in many other settings. In each case, the key operational challenge is to learn an allocation of surveillance resources which maximises successful detection of events of interest. We present a combinatorial multi-armed bandit model with Poisson rewards and a novel filtered feedback mechanism - arising from the failure to detect certain intrusions - where reward distributions are dependent on the actions selected. Our solution method is an upper confidence bound approach and we derive upper and lower bounds on its expected performance. We prove that the gap between these bounds is of constant order, and demonstrate empirically that our approach is more reliable in simulated problems than competing algorithms."}}

However its use in continuum armed bandit problems has received relatively little attention. We provide the first bounds on the regret of Thompson Sampling for continuum armed bandits under weak conditions on the function class containing the true function and sub-exponential observation noise. The eluder dimension is a recently proposed measure of the complexity of a function class, which has been demonstrated to be useful in bounding the Bayesian regret of Thompson Sampling for simpler bandit problems under sub-Gaussian observation noise. We derive a new bound on the eluder dimension for classes of functions with Lipschitz derivatives, and generalise previous analyses in multiple regards."}}
