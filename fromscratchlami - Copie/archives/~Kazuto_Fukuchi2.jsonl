We introduce a preference relation between patterns and aim to discover the most preferred patterns under the constraint of statistical significance, which has never been considered in existing SSPM problems. We propose an iterative multiple testing procedure that can alternately reject a hypothesis and safely ignore the less useful hypotheses than the rejected one. By filtering out patterns with low utility, we can avoid the significance budget consumption of rejecting useless (uninteresting) patterns and focus the significance budget on more useful patterns, leading to more useful discoveries. We show that the proposed method can control the familywise error rate (FWER) under certain assumptions, which can be satisfied by a realistic problem class in SSPM. We also show that the proposed method always discovers equally or more useful patterns than Tarone-Bonferroni and Subfamily-wise Multiple Testing (SMT). Finally, we conducted several experiments with both synthetic and real-world data to evaluate the performance of our method. The proposed method discovered many more useful patterns in the experiments with real-world datasets than the existing method for all five conducted tasks."}}

The Transformer attains the state-of-the-art in several tasks of sequence data analysis, and its variants, such as BERT and GPT-3, are used as a defacto-standard for solving general tasks in natural language processing (NLP). This work presents a 3-party multi-party computation (MPC) protocol for secure inference of the Transfomer in the honest majority setting. The attention layer is the most time-consuming part when implementing an MPC protocol for the Transformer with existing building blocks. The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer that captures and exploits complex dependencies among elements in the input sequences. The attention mechanism invokes the exponentiation function O(S <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> ) times, which becomes a major bottleneck when implementing the Transformer with existing MPC primitives. To deal with this, we employ the Performer [11], a variant of the Transformer where the sigmoid function that invokes the exponentiation function is replaced with the ReLU function, a more MPC-friendly nonlinear function. Also, by introducing a kernel-based approximation of the attention matrix with random orthogonal matrices, we show that the attention layer can be processed with O(S) times calls of the ReLU function. We investigate the efficiency of the proposed method by an end-to-end implementation of the Transformer with 3-party MPC. Experimental evaluation shows that, for translating a sequence where the output sequence length is 64, the entire computation time takes about 19 minutes in the LAN environment."}}

However, sometimes concept-based explanations may cause false positives, which misregards unrelated concepts as important for the prediction task. Our goal is to find the statistically significant concept for classification to prevent misinterpretation. In this study, we propose a method using a deep learning model to learn the image concept and then using the knockoff sample to select the important concepts for prediction by controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) under a certain value. We evaluate the proposed method in our experiments on both synthetic and real data. Also, it shows that our method can control the FDR properly while selecting highly interpretable concepts to improve the trustworthiness of the model."}}
