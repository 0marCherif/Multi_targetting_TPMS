In fact, users\u2019 reading preferences are often driven by his/her high-level goal-oriented intentions. For example, in order to satisfy the intention of traveling, a user may prefer to read news about national parks or hiking activities. However, existing methods for news recommendations often focus on capturing users\u2019 low-level preferences towards specific news only, neglecting to model their intrinsic reading intentions, leading to insufficient modeling of users and thus suboptimal recommendation performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel intention-aware personalized news recommendation model (IPNR), to accurately model both a user\u2019s reading intentions and his/her preference for personalized next-news recommendations. In addition to modeling users\u2019 reading preferences, our proposed model IPNR can also capture users\u2019 reading intentions and the transitions over intentions for better predicting the next piece of news which may interest the user. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that IPNR outperforms the state-of-the-art news recommendation methods in terms of recommendation accuracy (The source code is available at: https://github.com/whonor/IPNR )."}}

However, medical question summarization is very challenging due to obvious distinctions in health trouble descriptions from patients and doctors. Although existing works have attempted to utilize Seq2Seq, reinforcement learning, or contrastive learning to solve the problem, two challenges remain: how to correctly capture question focus to model its semantic intention, and how to obtain reliable datasets to fairly evaluate performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel medical question summarization framework using entity-driven contrastive learning (ECL). ECL employs medical entities in frequently asked questions (FAQs) as focuses and devises an effective mechanism to generate hard negative samples. This approach forces models to pay attention to the crucial focus information and generate more ideal question summarization. Additionally, we find that some MQA datasets suffer from serious data leakage problems, such as the iCliniq dataset's 33% duplicate rate. To evaluate the related methods fairly, this paper carefully checks leaked samples to reorganize more reasonable datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ECL method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by accurately capturing question focus and generating medical question summaries.

Recent work on modeling sentence semantic relations with deep neural models has shown its great potential in improving the performance of sentence matching. However, existing sentence matching methods usually focus on generating word-level sentence representation, which neglects the character-level information and leads to weak semantic representations. Also, they usually capture the interactive features with an attention-based alignment, which are typically implemented on sentence level and neglect the interactions among characters, words and sentences. This paper proposes a novel Chinese sentence matching model with Multiple Alignments and Feature Augmentation (MAFA). Specifically, the model first employs the multi-level embedding layer to accept the character and word sequences of sentences, and introduces the multiple alignment layer to capture the interactions among characters, words and sentences in turn. Then, the feature augmentation layer is applied to combine the interactive features to generate the final semantic matching representations. Finally, the prediction layer is utilized to judge the matching degree of the input sentences. Substantial and extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world data sets to show that MAFA significantly outperforms the competing methods and achieve comnarable nerformance with BERT-based methods."}}

Listening to news is a popular method of relaxing during a journey; as a result, travelers require automatic recommendations of preferred news programs. Most existing news recommender systems usually learn topic-level representations of users and news for recommendations while neglecting to learn more informative aspect-level features, resulting in limited recommendation performance. To bridge this significant gap, we propose a novel Aspect-driven News Recommender System (ANRS) built on aspect-level user preferences and news representation learning. In ANRS, a news aspect-level encoder and a user aspect-level encoder are devised to learn the fine-grained aspect-level representations of users\u2019 preferences and news characteristics respectively. These representations are subsequently fed into a click predictor to predict the probability of a given user clicking on the candidate news item. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baseline methods."}}

With the prevalence of deep learning, the encoder-decoder architecture is dominantly adopted for this task. Accurately encoding the source information is of key importance to text generation, because the target text can be generated only when accurate and complete source information is captured by the encoder and fed into the decoder. However, most existing approaches fail to effectively encode and learn the entire source information, as some features are easy to be missed along with the encoding procedures of the encoder. Similar problems also confuse the implementation of the decoder. How to reduce the problem of information loss in the encoder-decoder model is critical for text generation. To address this issue, we propose a novel correlation encoder-decoder model, which optimizes both the encoder and the decoder to reduce the problem of information loss by enforcing them to minimize the differences between hierarchical layers by maximizing the mutual information. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model substantially outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

Due to its wide applicability in the real-world E-commerce industry, the studies NBR have attracted increasing attention in recent years. NBRs have been widely studied and much progress has been achieved in this area with a variety of NBR approaches having been proposed. However, an important issue is that there is a lack of a systematic and unified evaluation over the various NBR approaches. Different studies often evaluate NBR approaches on different datasets, under different experimental settings, making it hard to fairly and effectively compare the performance of different NBR approaches. To bridge this gap, in this work, we conduct a systematical empirical study in NBR area. Specifically, we review the representative work in NBR and analyze their cons and pros. Then, we run the selected NBR algorithms on the same datasets, under the same experimental setting and evaluate their performances using the same measurements. This provides a unified framework to fairly compare different NBR approaches. We hope this study can provide a valuable reference for the future research in this vibrant area."}}

Benefiting from the superiority of graph neural networks (GNN) in learning complex dependencies, GNN-based SBRs have become the main stream of SBRs in recent years. Most GNN-based SBRs are based on a strong assumption of adjacent dependency, which means any two adjacent items in a session are necessarily dependent here. However, based on our observation, the adjacency does not necessarily indicate dependency due to the uncertainty and complexity of user behaviours. Therefore, the aforementioned assumption does not always hold in the real-world cases and thus easily leads to two deficiencies: (1) the introduction of false dependencies between items which are adjacent in a session but are not really dependent, and (2) the missing of true dependencies between items which are not adjacent but are actually dependent. Such deficiencies significantly downgrade accurate dependency learning and thus reduce the recommendation performance. Aiming to address these deficiencies, we propose a novel review-refined inter-item graph neural network (RI-GNN), which utilizes the topic information extracted from items\u2019 reviews to refine dependencies between items. Experiments on two public real-world datasets demonstrate that RI-GNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (The implementation is available at https://github.com/Nishikata97/RI-GNN. )."}}
