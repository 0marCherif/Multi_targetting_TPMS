While adversarial training methods aim at training more robust models, these techniques often result in a lower unperturbed (clean) test accuracy, including the most widely used Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) method. In this work, we propose uncertainty-targeted attacks (UTA), where the perturbations are obtained by maximizing the model's estimated uncertainty. We demonstrate on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 that this approach does not drastically deteriorate the clean test accuracy relative to PGD whilst it is robust to PGD attacks. In particular, uncertainty-based attacks allow for using larger $L_\\infty$-balls around the training data points, are less prone to overfitting the attack, and yield improved generalization-robustness trade-off."}}

Often, these methods are either non-interpretable due to their non-invertibility or are notoriously difficult to train due to their numerous hyperparameters. We exploit the exactly reversible encoder-decoder structure of normalizing flows to perform perturbations in the latent space. We demonstrate that these on-manifold perturbations match the performance of advanced DA techniques---reaching $96.6\\%$ test accuracy for CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18 and outperform existing methods particularly in low data regimes---yielding $10$--$25\\%$ relative improvement of test accuracy from classical training. We find our latent adversarial perturbations, adaptive to the classifier throughout its training, are most effective."}}

The underlying minmax optimization is highly susceptible to the variance of the stochastic gradient and the rotational component of the associated game vector field. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Lookahead algorithm for minmax optimization, originally developed for single objective minimization only. The backtracking step of our Lookahead\u2013minmax naturally handles the rotational game dynamics, a property which was identified to be key for enabling gradient ascent descent methods to converge on challenging examples often analyzed in the literature. Moreover, it implicitly handles high variance without using large mini-batches, known to be essential for reaching state of the art performance. Experimental results on MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet demonstrate a clear advantage of combining Lookahead\u2013minmax with Adam or extragradient, in terms of performance and improved stability, for negligible memory and computational cost. Using 30-fold fewer parameters and 16-fold smaller minibatches we outperform the reported performance of the class-dependent BigGAN on CIFAR-10 by obtaining FID of 12.19 without using the class labels, bringing state-of-the-art GAN training within reach of common computational resources."}}

We address this issue with a novel stochastic variance-reduced extragradient (SVRE) optimization algorithm that improves upon the best convergence rates proposed in the literature. We observe empirically that SVRE performs similarly to a batch method on MNIST while being computationally cheaper, and that SVRE yields more stable GAN training on standard datasets."}}

In spite of this success, they gained a reputation for being difficult to train, what results in a time-consuming and human-involved development process to use them. We consider an alternative training process, named SGAN, in which several adversarial \"local\" pairs of networks are trained independently so that a \"global\" supervising pair of networks can be trained against them. The goal is to train the global pair with the corresponding ensemble opponent for improved performances in terms of mode coverage. This approach aims at increasing the chances that learning will not stop for the global pair, preventing both to be trapped in an unsatisfactory local minimum, or to face oscillations often observed in practice. To guarantee the latter, the global pair never affects the local ones. The rules of SGAN training are thus as follows: the global generator and discriminator are trained using the local discriminators and generators, respectively, whereas the local networks are trained with their fixed local opponent. Experimental results on both toy and real-world problems demonstrate that this approach outperforms standard training in terms of better mitigating mode collapse, stability while converging and that it surprisingly, increases the convergence speed as well."}}

The reduction of camera prices allows for the generalization of static multi-camera set-ups. Using joint visual information from multiple synchronized cameras gives the opportunity to improve detection performance. In this paper, we present a new large-scale and high-resolution dataset. It has been captured with seven static cameras in a public open area, and unscripted dense groups of pedestrians standing and walking. Together with the camera frames, we provide an accurate joint (extrinsic and intrinsic) calibration, as well as 7 series of 400 annotated frames for detection at a rate of 2 frames per second. This results in over 40,000 bounding boxes delimiting every person present in the area of interest, for a total of more than 300 individuals. We provide a series of benchmark results using baseline algorithms published over the recent months for multi-view detection with deep neural networks, and trajectory estimation using a non-Markovian model."}}
