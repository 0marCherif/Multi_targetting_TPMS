In addition, real-life networks are likely to be incompletely observed, with missing links due to individual non-response or machine failures. Therefore, identifying outliers in the presence of missing links is a crucial problem in network analysis. A new algorithm is introduced to detect outliers in a network and simultaneously predict the missing links. The proposed method is statistically sound: under fairly general assumptions, this algorithm exactly detects the outliers, and achieves the best known error for the prediction of missing links with polynomial computational cost. The sub-linear convergence of the algorithm is proven, which confirms its computational efficiency. A simulation study is provided, which demonstrates the good behaviour of the algorithm in terms of outlier detection and prediction of the missing links. The method is also illustrated with an application in epidemiology and with the analysis of a political Twitter network. The algorithm is freely available as an R package on the Comprehensive R Archive Network."}}

At each round, a player selects an action described by a covariate and by a sensitive attribute. The perceived reward is a linear combination of the covariates of the chosen action, but the player only observes a biased evaluation of this reward, depending on the sensitive attribute. To characterize the difficulty of this problem, we design a phased elimination algorithm that corrects the unfair evaluations, and establish upper bounds on its regret. We show that the worst-case regret is smaller than $\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa_* ^{1/3}\\log(T)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, where $\\kappa_*$ is an explicit geometrical constant characterizing the difficulty of bias estimation. We prove lower bounds on the worst-case regret for some sets of actions showing that this rate is tight up to a possible sub-logarithmic factor. We also derive gap-dependent upper bounds on the regret, and  matching lower bounds for some problem instance. Interestingly, these results reveal a transition between a regime where the problem is as difficult as its unbiased counterpart, and a regime where it can be much harder."}}

In the awareness framework, akin to the classical unconstrained classification case, we show that maximizing accuracy under this fairness constraint is equivalent to solving a corresponding regression problem followed by thresholding at level $1/2$. We extend this result to linear-fractional classification measures (e.g., ${\\rm F}$-score, AM measure, balanced accuracy, etc.), highlighting the fundamental role played by the regression problem in this framework. Our results leverage recently developed connection between the demographic parity constraint and the multi-marginal optimal transport formulation. Informally, our result shows that the transition between the unconstrained problems and the fair one is achieved by replacing the conditional expectation of the label by the solution of the fair regression problem. Finally, leveraging our analysis, we demonstrate an equivalence between the awareness and the unawareness setups in the case of two sensitive groups."}}

Each action can be completed at most once and results in a stochastic reward with unknown mean. The goal of the agent is to maximize her cumulative reward. Non trivial strategies are possible when side information on the actions is available, for example in the form of covariates. Focusing on a nonparametric setting, where the mean reward is an unknown function of a one-dimensional covariate, we propose an optimal strategy for this problem. Under natural assumptions on the reward function, we prove that the optimal regret scales as $O(T^{1/3})$ up to poly-logarithmic factors when the budget $T$ is proportional to the number of actions $N$. When $T$ becomes small compared to $N$, a smooth transition occurs. When the ratio $T/N$ decreases from a constant to $N^{-1/3}$, the regret increases progressively up to the $O(T^{1/2})$ rate encountered in continuum-armed bandits."}}
