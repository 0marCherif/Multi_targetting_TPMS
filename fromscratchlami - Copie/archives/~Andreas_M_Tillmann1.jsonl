Although minimizing boarding time therefore is the most important goal from an economic perspective, previous efforts to design efficient boarding strategies apparently never tackled this task directly. In this paper, we first rigorously define the problem and prove its NP-hardness. Although this generally justifies the development of inexact solution methods, we show that all commonly discussed boarding strategies may in fact give solutions that are far from optimal. We complement these theoretical findings by a simple time-aware boarding strategy with guaranteed approximation quality (under reasonable assumptions) as well as a local improvement heuristic and an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation. Our numerical experiments with simulation data show that for several airplane cabin layouts, provably high-quality or even optimal solutions can be obtained within reasonable time in practice by means of our MIP approach. We also empirically assess the sensitivity of boarding strategies with respect to disruptions of the prescribed boarding sequences and identify robustness against such disruptions as a bottleneck for further improvements."}}

The natural homotopy parameter is the value of the bound for the constraints and we show that there exists a piecewise linear solution path with finitely many break points for the primal problem and a respective piecewise constant path for the dual problem. We show that by solving a small linear program, one can jump to the next primal break point and then, solving another small linear program, a new optimal dual solution is calculated which enables the next such jump in the subsequent iteration. Using a theorem of the alternative, we show that the method never gets stuck and indeed calculates the whole path in a finite number of steps. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. In many cases, our method significantly outperforms commercial LP solvers; this is possible since our approach employs a sequence of considerably simpler auxiliary linear programs that can be solved efficiently with specialized active-set strategies."}}

Two aspects in particular have been demonstrated to improve the performance of IP solvers as well as adaptive linear programming decoders: the dynamic generation of forbidden-set (FS) inequalities, a family of valid cutting planes, and the utilization of so-called redundant parity-checks (RPCs). However, to date, it had remained unclear how to solve the exact RPC separation problem (i.e., to determine whether or not there exists any violated FS inequality w.r.t. any known or unknown parity-check). In this note, we prove NP-hardness of this problem. Moreover, we formulate an IP model that combines the search for most violated FS cuts with the generation of RPCs, and report on computational experiments. Empirically, for various instances of the minimum distance problem, it turns out that while utilizing the exact separation IP does not appear to provide a computational advantage, it can apparently be avoided altogether by combining heuristics to generate RPC-based cuts."}}

We show that already deciding feasibility of such approximation problems is NP-hard, and remains intractable even for very simple setups. We then devise an algorithmic framework that combines shape sampling with exact cardinality-minimization to obtain good approximations using few components. As a particular application and showcase example, we discuss approximating shape contours using the classical Zometool construction kit and provide promising computational results, demonstrating that our algorithm is capable of obtaining good shape representations within reasonable time, in spite of the problem's general intractability. We conclude the paper with an outlook on possible extensions of the developed methodology, in particular regarding 3D shape approximation tasks."}}

To that end, we identify polynomially solvable special cases, gather upper and lower bounding procedures, and propose several exact (mixed-)integer programming models and linear programming heuristics. In particular, we develop a branch and cut scheme to determine the girth of a matroid, focussing on the vector matroid case, for which the girth is precisely the spark of the representation matrix. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our specialized algorithms compared to general-purpose black-box solvers applied to several mixed-integer programming models."}}

Specifically, we consider the task of estimating a two-dimensional image from squared-magnitude measurements of a complex-valued linear transformation of the original image. Several recent phase retrieval algorithms exploit underlying sparsity of the unknown signal in order to improve recovery performance. In this work, we consider such a sparse signal prior in the context of phase retrieval, when the sparsifying dictionary is not known in advance. Our algorithm jointly reconstructs the unknown signal-possibly corrupted by noise-and learns a dictionary such that each patch of the estimated image can be sparsely represented. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach can obtain significantly better reconstructions for phase retrieval problems with noise than methods that cannot exploit such \u201chidden\u201d sparsity. Moreover, on the theoretical side, we provide a convergence result for our method."}}
