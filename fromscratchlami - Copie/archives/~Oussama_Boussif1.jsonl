Different environments or tasks may require varying\ndegrees of coordination among agents in order to achieve the goal in an optimal\nway. The nature of coordination will depend on properties of the environment\u2014its\nspatial layout, distribution of obstacles, dynamics, etc. We term this variation\nof properties within an environment as heterogeneity. Existing literature has not\nsufficiently addressed the fact that different environments may have different levels\nof heterogeneity. We formalize the notions of coordination level and heterogeneity\nlevel of an environment and present HECOGrid, a suite of multi-agent RL\nenvironments that facilitates empirical evaluation of different MARL approaches\nacross different levels of coordination and environmental heterogeneity by providing\na quantitative control over coordination and heterogeneity levels of the\nenvironment. Further, we propose a Centralized Training Decentralized Execution\nlearning approach called Stateful Active Facilitator (SAF) that enables agents to\nwork efficiently in high-coordination and high-heterogeneity environments through\na differentiable and shared knowledge source used during training and dynamic\nselection from a shared pool of policies. We evaluate SAF and compare its performance\nagainst baselines IPPO and MAPPO on HECOGrid. Our results show\nthat SAF consistently outperforms the baselines across different tasks and different\nheterogeneity and coordination levels."}}

When it comes to climate predictions, fine spatio-temporal resolutions are required to resolve all turbulent scales in the fluid simulations. This makes the task of accurately resolving these scales computationally out of reach even with modern supercomputers. As a result, climate modelers solve these PDEs on grids that are too coarse (3km to 200km on each side), which hinders the accuracy and usefulness of the predictions. In this paper, we leverage the recent advances in Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to design a novel architecture that predicts the spatially continuous solution of a PDE given a spatial position query. By augmenting coordinate-based architectures with Graph Neural Networks (GNN), we enable zero-shot generalization to new non-uniform meshes and long-term predictions up to 250 frames ahead that are physically consistent. Our Mesh Agnostic Neural PDE Solver (MAgNet) is able to make accurate predictions across a variety of PDE simulation datasets and compares favorably with existing baselines. Moreover, our model generalizes well to different meshes and resolutions up to four times those trained on."}}
