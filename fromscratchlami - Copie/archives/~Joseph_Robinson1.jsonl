Despite the difficulty of detecting kinship, annual data challenges using still-images have consistently improved performances and attracted new researchers. Now, systems reach performance levels unforeseeable a decade ago, closing in on performances acceptable to deploy in practice. Like other biometric tasks, we expect systems can receive help from other modalities. We hypothesize that adding modalities to <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Families In the Wild</i> (FIW), which has only still-images, will improve performance. Thus, to narrow the gap between research and reality and enhance the power of kinship recognition systems, we extend FIW with multimedia (MM) data ( <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</i> . <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e</i> ., video, audio, and text captions). Specifically, we introduce the first publicly available multi-task MM kinship dataset. To build <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FIW in Multimedia</i> (FIW MM), we developed machinery to automatically collect, annotate, and prepare the data, requiring minimal human input and no financial cost. The proposed MM corpus allows the problem statements to be more realistic template-based protocols. We show significant improvements in all benchmarks with the added modalities. The results highlight edge cases to inspire future research with different areas of improvement. FIW MM supplies the data needed to increase the potential of automated systems to detect kinship in MM. It also allows experts from diverse fields to collaborate in novel ways."}}

However, keen challenges arise from our tendency to rest under blankets. We present a multimodal approach to uncover the subjects and view bodies at rest without the blankets obscuring the view. For this, we introduce a channel-based fusion scheme to effectively fuse different modalities in a way that best leverages the knowledge captured by the multimodal sensors, including visual- and non-visual-based. The channel-based fusion scheme enhances the model's flexibility in the input at inference: one-to-many input modalities required at test time. Nonetheless, multimodal data or not, detecting humans at rest in bed is still a challenge due to the extreme occlusion when covered by a blanket. To mitigate the negative effects of blanket occlusion, we use an attention-based reconstruction module to explicitly reduce the uncertainty of occluded parts by generating uncovered modalities, which further update the current estimation via a cyclic fashion. Extensive experiments validate the proposed model's superiority over others."}}

With much progress and milestones having been reached after ten years, we are now able to survey the research and create new milestones. We review the public resources and data challenges that enabled and inspired many to hone-in on the views of automatic kinship recognition in the visual domain. The different tasks are described in technical terms and syntax consistent across the problem domain and the practical value of each discussed and measured. State-of-the-art methods for visual kinship recognition problems, whether to discriminate between or generate from, are examined. As part of such, we review systems proposed as part of a recent data challenge held in conjunction with the 2020 IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition. We establish a stronghold for the state of progress for the different problems in a consistent manner. This survey will serve as the central resource for the work of the next decade to build upon. For the tenth anniversary, the demo code is provided for the various kin-based tasks. Detecting relatives with visual recognition and classifying the relationship is an area with high potential for impact in research and practice."}}

Different from kinship verification, which tells two persons have certain kinship relation or not, kinship classification aims to identify the family that a person belongs to. Beyond age and appearance gap across parents and children, the difficulties of kinship classification lie in that any data of the children to be classified are unavailable in advance to help training. To handle this challenge, an auxiliary database with complete parents and children modalities is employed to uncover the parent-children latent knowledge. Specifically, we propose a Latent Adaptive Subspace learning (LAS) to uncover the shared knowledge between two modalities so that the unseen test children are implicitly modeled as latent factors for kinship classification. Moreover, person-wise and family-wise constraints are designed to enhance the individual similarity and couple the parents and children within families for discriminative features. Comprehensive experiments on two large kinship datasets show that the proposed algorithm can effectively inherit knowledge from different databases and modalities and achieve the state-of-the-art performance."}}

For starters, aiding forensic investigations, as kinship is a powerful cue that could narrow the search space (e.g., knowledge that the 'Boston Bombers' were brothers could have helped identify the suspects sooner). In short, there are many beneficiaries that could result from such technologies: whether the consumer (e.g., automatic photo library management), scholar (e.g., historic lineage & genealogical studies), data analyzer (e.g., social-media- based analysis), investigator (e.g., cases of missing children and human trafficking. For instance, it is unlikely that a missing child found online would be in any database, however, more than likely a family member would be), or even refugees. Besides application- based problems, and as already hinted, kinship is a powerful cue that could serve as a face attribute capable of greatly reducing the search space in more general face-recognition problems. In this tutorial, we will introduce the background information, progress leading us up to these points, several current state-of-the-art algorithms spanning various views of the kinship recognition problem (e.g., verification, classification, tri-subject). We will then cover our large-scale Families In the Wild (FIW) image collection, several challenge competitions it as been used in, along with the top per- forming deep learning approaches. The tutorial will end with a discussion about future research directions and practical use-cases."}}

Despite recent advances in deep learning-based face synthesis approaches, this problem is still challenging due to significant pose and illumination discrepancy. In this paper, we present a novel Dual-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (DA-GAN) for photo-realistic face frontalization by capturing both contextual dependencies and local consistency during GAN training. Specifically, a self-attention-based generator is introduced to integrate local features with their long-range dependencies yielding better feature representations, and hence generate faces that preserves identities better, especially for larger pose angles. Moreover, a novel face-attention-based discriminator is applied to emphasize local features of face regions, and hence reinforce the realism of synthetic frontal faces. Guided by semantic segmentation, four independent discriminators are used to distinguish between different aspects of a face (i.e., skin, keypoints, hairline, and frontalized face). By introducing these two complementary attention mechanisms in generator and discriminator separately, we can learn a richer feature representation and generate identity preserving inference of frontal views with much finer details (i.e., more accurate facial appearance and textures) comparing to the state-of-the-art. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our DA-GAN approach."}}

We include several benchmarks for two image-based tasks, kinship verification and family recognition. For this, we incorporate several visual features and metric learning methods as baselines. Also, we demonstrate that a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as an off-the-shelf feature extractor outperforms the other feature types. Then, results were further boosted by fine-tuning two deep CNNs on FIW data: (1) for kinship verification, a triplet loss function was learned on top of the network of pre-train weights; (2) for family recognition, a family-specific softmax classifier was added to the network."}}

By learning subgroup-specific thresholds, we reduce performance gaps, and also show a notable boost in overall performance.
