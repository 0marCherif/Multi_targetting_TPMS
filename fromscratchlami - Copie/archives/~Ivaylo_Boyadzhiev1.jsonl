LASER introduces the concept of latent space rendering, where 2D pose hypotheses on the floor map are directly rendered into a geometrically-structured latent space by aggregating viewing ray features. Through a tightly coupled rendering codebook scheme, the viewing ray features are dynamically determined at rendering-time based on their geometries (i.e. length, incident-angle), endowing our representation with view-dependent fine-grain variability. Our codebook scheme effectively disentangles feature encoding from rendering, allowing the latent space rendering to run at speeds above 10KHz. Moreover, through metric learning, our geometrically-structured latent space is common to both pose hypotheses and query images with arbitrary field of views. As a result, LASER achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale indoor localization datasets (i.e. ZInD and Structured3D) for both panorama and perspective image queries, while significantly outperforming existing learning-based methods in speed."}}

Once the room poses are computed, room layouts are inferred using HorizonNet\u00a0[50], and the floorplan is constructed by stitching the most confident layout boundaries. We validate our system qualitatively and quantitatively as well as through ablation studies, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art SfM systems in completeness by over 200%, without sacrificing accuracy. Our results point to the significance of our work: poses of 81% of panoramas are localized in the first 2 connected components (CCs), and 89% in the first 3 CCs."}}

Our system is weakly supervised by automatically generated semantic maps (with floor, wall, ceiling, lamp, window and door labels) that have shown success on perspective views and are trained for panoramas using transfer learning without any further annotations. A GAN-based approach supervised by coarse information obtained from the semantic map extracts specular reflection and direct sunlight regions on the floor and walls. These lighting effects are removed via a similar GAN-based approach and a semantic-aware inpainting step. The appearance decomposition enables multiple applications including sun direction estimation, virtual furniture insertion, floor material replacement, and sun direction change, providing an effective tool for virtual home staging. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large and recently released dataset of panoramas of empty homes."}}

ZInD provides annotations of 3D room layouts, 2D and 3D floor plans, panorama location in the floor plan, and locations of windows and doors. The ground truth construction took over 1,500 hours of annotation work. To the best of our knowledge, ZInD is the largest real dataset with layout annotations. A unique property is the room layout data, which follows a real world distribution (cuboid, more general Manhattan, and non-Manhattan layouts) as opposed to the mostly cuboid or Manhattan layouts in current publicly available datasets. Also, the scale and annotations provided are valuable for effective research related to room layout and floor plan analysis. To demonstrate ZInD's benefits, we benchmark on room layout estimation from single panoramas and multi-view registration."}}
