In this paper, we re-evaluate such methods through the lens of different metrics that characterize the augmented manifold, finding contradictory evidence. Our extensive empirical analysis involving 5 data augmentation methods, all tested with an increasing probability of augmentation, shows that: (i) novel data augmentation methods proposed to improve adversarial robustness only improve it when combined with classical augmentations (like image flipping and rotation), and even worsen adversarial robustness if used in isolation; and (ii) adversarial robustness is significantly affected by the augmentation probability, conversely to what is claimed in recent work. We conclude by discussing how to rethink the development and evaluation of novel data augmentation methods for adversarial robustness."}}

Their superiority is based on the ability to scale up and exploit large-scale datasets such as AudioSet. However, Transformers are demanding in terms of model size and computational requirements compared to CNNs. We propose a training procedure for efficient CNNs based on offline Knowledge Distillation (KD) from high-performing yet complex transformers. The proposed training schema and the efficient CNN design based on MobileNetV3 results in models outperforming previous solutions in terms of parameter and computational efficiency and prediction performance. We provide models of different complexity levels, scaling from low-complexity models up to a new state-of-the-art performance of .483 mAP on AudioSet.

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) trained on large-scale datasets are capable of capturing a diverse set of features, and learning a representation that can generalize onto unseen tasks and datasets that are from the same domain. Hence, these models can be used as powerful feature extractors, in combination with shallower models as classifiers, for smaller tasks and datasets where the amount of training data is insufficient for learning an end-to-end model from scratch. During the past years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have largely been the method of choice for audio processing. However, recently attention-based transformer models have demonstrated great potential in supervised settings, outperforming CNNs. In this work, we investigate the use of audio transformers trained on large-scale datasets to learn general-purpose representations. We study how the different setups in these audio transformers affect the quality of their embeddings. We experiment with the models' time resolution, extracted embedding level, and receptive fields in order to see how they affect performance on a variety of tasks and datasets, following the HEAR 2021 NeurIPS challenge evaluation setup. Our results show that representations extracted by audio transformers outperform CNN representations. Furthermore, we will show that transformers trained on Audioset can be extremely effective representation extractors for a wide range of downstream tasks."}}

These techniques rely on different ideas such as invariance-preserving transformations (e.g, expert-defined augmentation), statistical heuristics (e.g, Mixup), and learning the data distribution (e.g, GANs). However, in the adversarial settings it remains unclear under what conditions such data augmentation methods reduce or even worsen the misclassification risk. In this paper, we therefore analyse the effect of different data augmentation techniques on the adversarial risk by three measures: (a) the well-known risk under adversarial attacks, (b) a new measure of prediction-change stress based on the Laplacian operator, and (c) the influence of training examples on prediction. The results of our empirical analysis disprove the hypothesis that an improvement in the classification performance induced by a data augmentation is always accompanied by an improvement in the risk under adversarial attack. Further, our results reveal that the augmented data has more influence than the non-augmented data, on the resulting models. Taken together, our results suggest that general-purpose data augmentations that do not take into the account the characteristics of the data and the task, must be applied with care."}}

In contrast, CNNs with an excessive RF tend to over-fit the training data and fail to generalize to unseen testing data.

In this study, we investigate the relationship between over-parameterization of acoustic scene classification models, and their resulting generalization abilities. Specifically, we test scaling CNNs in width and depth, under different conditions. Our results indicate that increasing width improves generalization to unseen devices, even without an increase in the number of parameters."}}
