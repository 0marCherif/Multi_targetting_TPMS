In the literature, to adopt GNNs for the graph classification task, there are two groups of methods: global pooling and hierarchical pooling. The global pooling methods obtain the graph representation vectors by globally pooling all the node embeddings together at the end of several GNN layers, while the hierarchical pooling methods provide one extra pooling operation between the GNN layers to extract the hierarchical information and improve the graph representations. Both global and hierarchical pooling methods are effective in different scenarios. Due to highly diverse applications, it is challenging to design data-specific pooling methods with human expertise. To address this problem, we propose PAS (Pooling Architecture Search) to design adaptive pooling architectures by using the neural architecture search (NAS). To enable the search space design, we propose a unified pooling framework consisting of four modules: Aggregation, Pooling, Readout, and Merge. Two variants PAS-G and PAS-NE are provided to design the pooling operations in different scales. A set of candidate operations are designed in the search space on top of this framework, and then existing human-designed pooling methods, including global and hierarchical ones, can be incorporated. To enable efficient search, a coarsening strategy is developed to continuously relax the search space, and then a differentiable search method can be adopted. We conduct extensive experiments on six real-world datasets, including the large-scale datasets MR and ogbg-molhiv. Experimental results in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PAS in designing the pooling architectures for graph classification. Besides, the Top-1 performance on two Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets further indicates the utility of PAS when facing diverse realistic data. The implementation of PAS is available at: https://github.com/AutoML-Research/PAS."}}

Currently, shallow GNNs are more common due to the well-known over-smoothing problem facing deeper GNNs. However, they are sub-optimal without utilizing the information from distant nodes, i.e., the long-range dependencies. The mainstream methods in the graph classification task can extract the long-range dependencies either by designing the pooling operations or incorporating the higher-order neighbors, while they have evident drawbacks by modifying the original graph structure, which may result in information loss in graph structure learning. In this paper, by justifying the smaller influence of the over-smoothing problem in the graph classification task, we evoke the importance of stacking-based GNNs and then employ them to capture the long-range dependencies without modifying the original graph structure. To achieve this, two design needs are given for stacking-based GNNs, i.e., sufficient model depth and adaptive skip-connection schemes. By transforming the two design needs into designing data-specific inter-layer connections, we propose a novel approach with the help of neural architecture search (NAS), which is dubbed LRGNN (Long-Range Graph Neural Networks).

To improve the model capacity, besides designing aggregation operations, GNN topology design is also very important. In general, there are two mainstream GNN topology design manners. The first one is to stack aggregation operations to obtain the higher-level features but easily got performance drop as the network goes deeper. Secondly, the multiple aggregation operations are utilized in each layer which provides adequate and independent feature extraction stage on local neighbors while are costly to obtain the higher-level information. To enjoy the benefits while alleviating the corresponding deficiencies of these two manners, we learn to design the topology of GNNs in a novel feature fusion perspective which is dubbed F2GNN. To be specific, we provide a feature fusion perspective in designing GNN topology and propose a novel framework to unify the existing topology designs with feature selection and fusion strategies. Then we develop a neural architecture search method on top of the unified framework which contains a set of selection and fusion operations in the search space and an improved differentiable search algorithm. The performance gains on diverse datasets, five homophily and three heterophily ones, demonstrate the effectiveness of F2GNN. We further conduct experiments to show that F2GNN can improve the model capacity while alleviating the deficiencies of existing GNN topology design manners, especially alleviating the over-smoothing problem, by utilizing different levels of features adaptively.\u00a01"}}
