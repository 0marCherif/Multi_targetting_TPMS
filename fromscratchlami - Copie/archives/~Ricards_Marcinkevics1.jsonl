Remote patient monitoring has shown great promise in the efficient management of patients with chronic diseases. This work presents the analysis of the data from a monitoring system developed to track COPD symptoms alongside patients\u2019 self-reports. In particular, we investigate the assessment of COPD severity using multisensory home-monitoring device data acquired from 30 patients over a period of three months. We describe a comprehensive data pre-processing and feature engineering pipeline for multimodal data from the remote home-monitoring of COPD patients. We develop and validate predictive models forecasting i) the absolute and ii) differenced COPD Assessment Test (CAT) scores based on the multisensory data. The best obtained models achieve Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient of 0.93 and 0.37 for absolute and differenced CAT scores. In addition, we investigate the importance of individual sensor modalities for predicting CAT scores using group sparse regularization techniques. Our results suggest that feature groups indicative of the patient\u2019s general condition, such as static medical and physiological information, date, spirometer, and air quality, are crucial for predicting the absolute CAT score. For predicting changes in CAT scores, sleep and physical activity features are most important, alongside the previous CAT score value. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of remote patient monitoring for COPD management and investigates which sensor modalities are most indicative of COPD severity as assessed by the CAT score. Our findings contribute to the development of effective and data-driven COPD management strategies."}}

Recently, several works have indicated that these state-of-the-art classifiers can be biased with respect to sensitive patient attributes, such as race or gender, leading to growing concerns about demographic disparities and discrimination resulting from algorithmic and model-based decision-making in healthcare. Fair machine learning has focused on mitigating such biases against disadvantaged or marginalised groups, mainly concentrating on tabular data or natural images. This work presents two novel intra-processing techniques based on fine-tuning and pruning an already-trained neural network. These methods are simple yet effective and can be readily applied post hoc in a setting where the protected attribute is unknown during the model development and test time. In addition, we compare several intra- and post-processing approaches applied to debiasing deep chest X-ray classifiers. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first efforts studying debiasing methods on chest radiographs. Our results suggest that the considered approaches successfully mitigate biases in fully connected and convolutional neural networks offering stable performance under various settings. The discussed methods can help achieve group fairness of deep medical image classifiers when deploying them in domains with different fairness considerations and constraints."}}

Granger causality is a practical framework for analysing interactions in sequential data, applied in a wide range of domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for inferring multivariate Granger causality under nonlinear dynamics based on an extension of self-explaining neural networks. This framework is more interpretable than other neural-network-based techniques for inferring Granger causality, since in addition to relational inference, it also allows detecting signs of Granger-causal effects and inspecting their variability over time. In comprehensive experiments on simulated data, we show that our framework performs on par with several powerful baseline methods at inferring Granger causality and that it achieves better performance at inferring interaction signs. The results suggest that our framework is a viable and more interpretable alternative to sparse-input neural networks for inferring Granger causality."}}
