On the other hand, developing effective event-based vision algorithms that fully exploit the beneficial properties of event cameras remains work in progress. In this paper, we focus on event-based visual odometry (VO). While existing event-driven VO pipelines have adopted continuous-time representations to asynchronously process event data, they either assume a known map, restrict the camera to planar trajectories, or integrate other sensors into the system. Towards map-free event-only monocular VO in SE(3), we propose an asynchronous structure-from-motion optimisation back-end. Our formulation is underpinned by a principled joint optimisation problem involving non-parametric Gaussian Process motion modelling and incremental maximum a posteriori inference. A high-performance incremental computation engine is employed to reason about the camera trajectory with every incoming event. We demonstrate the robustness of our asynchronous back-end in comparison to frame-based methods which depend on accurate temporal accumulation of measurements."}}

The state-of-the-art method of contrast maximisation recovers the motion from a batch of events by maximising the contrast of the image of warped events. However, the cost scales with image resolution and the temporal resolution can be limited by the need for large batch sizes to yield sufficient structure in the contrast image (see supplementary material for demonstration program). In this work, we propose spatiotemporal registration as a compelling technique for event-based rotational motion estimation. We theoretically justify the approach and establish its fundamental and practical advantages over contrast maximisation. In particular, spatiotemporal registration also produces feature tracks as a by-product, which directly supports an efficient visual odometry pipeline with graph-based optimisation for motion averaging. The simplicity of our visual odometry pipeline allows it to process more than 1 M events/second. We also contribute a new event dataset for visual odometry, where motion sequences with large velocity variations were acquired using a high-precision robot arm. Our dataset will be published after the reviewing period."}}

To carry out contrast maximisation, many previous works employ iterative optimisation algorithms, such as conjugate gradient, which require good initialisation to avoid converging to bad local minima. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a new globally optimal event-based motion estimation algorithm. Based on branch-and-bound (BnB), our method solves rotational (3DoF) motion estimation on event streams, which supports practical applications such as video stabilisation and attitude estimation. Underpinning our method are novel bounding functions for contrast maximisation, whose theoretical validity is rigorously established. We show concrete examples from public datasets where globally optimal solutions are vital to the success of contrast maximisation. Despite its exact nature, our algorithm is currently able to process a 50,000-event input in approx 300 seconds (a locally optimal solver takes approx 30 seconds on the same input), and has the potential to be further speeded-up using GPUs.\n"}}

Such a capability is crucial to the surveying and planning operations in mining. Often, the point clouds only partially overlap and initial alignment is unavailable. Here, we propose an interactive user-assisted point cloud registration system. Guided by the system, the user\u2019s role is simply to identify and search for overlapping regions across the point clouds. Specifically, given two point sets, the user clicks on a point in one set, then simply hovers the mouse on the other set to find a matching point. Each mouse position gives rise to a translation, and our system instantly optimises the rotation that aligns the point clouds. Assuming that each individual point set is horizontally levelled with the ground by the level compensator on the LIDAR device, given a candidate 3D translation only one angular parameter needs to be estimated to rotationally align two 3D point sets. We propose a fast rotation search algorithm that delivers globally optimal results in real time. Our method conducts branch-and-bound optimisation with a novel bounding function whose evaluation amounts to simple sorted array operations. This provides smooth and accurate feedback to the user\u2019s search for overlapping regions. Our system is intuitive and helps to accelerate the registration of multiple scans."}}

Underpinning our bounding function is the usage of stereographic projections to precompute and spatially index all possible point matches. This yields a robust and global algorithm that is significantly faster than previous methods. To conduct full 3D registration, the translation can be supplied by 3D feature matching, or by another optimisation framework that provides the translation.

In this paper, we address the frequent special case of registering terrestrial LiDAR scans (or, more generally, levelled point clouds). Many current solutions still rely on the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method or other heuristic procedures, which require good initializations to succeed and/or provide no guarantees of success. On the other hand, exact or optimal registration algorithms can compute the best possible solution without requiring initializations; however, they are currently too slow to be practical in realistic applications. \nExisting optimal approaches ignore the fact that in routine use the relative rotations between scans are constrained to the azimuth, via the built-in level compensation in LiDAR scanners. We propose a novel, optimal and computationally efficient registration method for this 4DOF scenario. Our approach operates on candidate 3D keypoint correspondences, and contains two main steps: (1) a deterministic selection scheme that significantly reduces the candidate correspondence set in a way that is guaranteed to preserve the optimal solution; and (2) a fast branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm with a novel polynomial-time subroutine for 1D rotation search, that quickly finds the optimal alignment for the reduced set.

{"id": "kG8CmTDSHG", "cdate": 1580441052365, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Guaranteed outlier removal for point cloud registration with correspondences", "abstract": "An established approach for 3D point cloud registration is to estimate the registration function from 3D keypoint correspondences. Typically, a robust technique is required to conduct the estimation, since there are false correspondences or outliers. Current 3D keypoint techniques are much less accurate than their 2D counterparts, thus they tend to produce extremely high outlier rates. A large number of putative correspondences must thus be extracted to ensure that sufficient good correspondences are available. Both factors (high outlier rates, large data sizes) however cause existing robust techniques to require very high computational cost. In this paper, we present a novel preprocessing method called guaranteed outlier removal for point cloud registration. Our method reduces the input to a smaller set, in a way that any rejected correspondence is guaranteed to not exist in the globally optimal solution. The reduction is performed using purely geometric operations which are deterministic and fast. Our method significantly reduces the population of outliers, such that further optimization can be performed quickly. Further, since only true outliers are removed, the globally optimal solution is preserved. On various synthetic and real data experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our preprocessing method. Demo code is available as supplementary material."}}
