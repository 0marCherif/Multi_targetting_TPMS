In an effort to assist architects in such a complex endeavour, we propose IDOME, an interactive system for computer-aided design optimization. Our approach balances automation and control by efficiently exploring, analyzing, and filtering space layouts to inform architects' decision-making better. At each design iteration, IDOME provides a set of alternative building layouts which satisfy user-defined constraints and optimality criteria concerning a user-defined space parametrization. When the user selects a design generated by IDOME, the system performs a similar optimization process with the same (or different) parameters and objectives. A user may iterate this exploration process as many times as needed. In this work, we focus on optimizing built environments using architectural metrics by improving the degree of visibility, accessibility, and information gaining for navigating a proposed space. This approach, however, can be extended to support other kinds of analysis as well. We demonstrate the capabilities of IDOME through a series of examples, performance analysis, user studies, and a usability test. The results indicate that IDOME successfully optimizes the proposed designs concerning the chosen metrics and offers a satisfactory experience for users with minimal training."}}

Specifically, understanding GANs' capability across the full spectrum of spatial frequencies, i.e. beyond the low-frequency dominant spectrum of natural images, is critical for assessing the reliability of GAN generated data in any detail-sensitive application (e.g. denoising, filling and super-resolution in medical and satellite images). In this paper, we show that the ability of convolutional GANs to learn a distribution is significantly affected by the spatial frequency of the underlying carrier signal, that is, GANs have a bias against learning high spatial frequencies. Crucially, we show that this bias is not merely a result of the scarcity of high frequencies in natural images, rather, it is a systemic bias hindering the learning of high frequencies regardless of their prominence in a dataset. Furthermore, we explain why large-scale GANs' ability to generate fine details on natural images does not exclude them from the adverse effects of this bias. Finally, we propose a method for manipulating this bias with minimal computational overhead. This method can be used to explicitly direct computational resources towards any specific spatial frequency of interest in a dataset, extending the flexibility of GANs."}}

In this work, we first show that single generator GANs are unable to correctly model a distribution supported on a disconnected manifold, and investigate how sample quality, mode dropping and local convergence are affected by this. Next, we show how using a collection of generators can address this problem, providing new insights into the success of such multi-generator GANs. Finally, we explain the serious issues caused by considering a fixed prior over the collection of generators and propose a novel approach for learning the prior and inferring the necessary number of generators without any supervision. Our proposed modifications can be applied on top of any other GAN model to enable learning of distributions supported on disconnected manifolds. We conduct several experiments to illustrate the aforementioned shortcoming of GANs, its consequences in practice, and the effectiveness of our proposed modifications in alleviating these issues."}}

Architects must use their skills and artistic vision to explore these rich but highly constrained design spaces. A number of computer-aided design tools use automation to provide useful analytical data and optimal designs with respect to certain fitness criteria. However, this automation can come at the expense of a designer's creative control. We propose uDOME, a user-in-the-loop system for computer-aided design exploration that balances automation and control by efficiently exploring, analyzing, and filtering the space of environment layouts to better inform an architect's decision-making. At each design iteration, uDOME provides a set of diverse designs which satisfy user-defined constraints and optimality criteria within a user defined parameterization of the design space. The user then selects a design and performs a similar optimization with the same or different parameters and objectives. This exploration process can be repeated as many times as the designer wishes. Our user studies indicates that \\DOME, with its diversity-based approach, improves the efficiency and effectiveness of even novice users with minimal training, without compromising the quality of their designs."}}

Using dynamic crowd simulators we derive the fitness of architectural layouts. The results of the simulation are used to provide feedback to a user in terms of crowd animation, aggregate statistics, and heat maps. Our approach automatically optimizes the placement of environment elements to maximize the flow of the crowd, while satisfying constraints that are imposed by the user (e.g., immovable walls or support bearing structures). We take steps towards user-in-the-loop optimization and design of an environment by applying an adaptive refinement approach to reduce the search space of the optimization. We perform a small scale user study to obtain early feedback on the performance and quality of our method in contrast with a manual approach."}}
