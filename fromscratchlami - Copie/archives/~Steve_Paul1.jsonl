While this is akin to the relationship between general aviation aircraft and airports, the conceived location of vertiports within dense urban environments presents unique challenges in managing the air traffic served by a vertiport. This challenge becomes pronounced within increasing frequency of scheduled landings and take-offs. This paper assumes a centralized air traffic controller (ATC) to explore the performance of a new AI driven ATC approach to manage the eVTOLs served by the vertiport. Minimum separation-driven safety and delays are the two important considerations in this case. The ATC problem is modeled as a task allocation problem, and uncertainties due to communication disruptions (e.g., poor link quality) and inclement weather (e.g., high gust effects) are added as a small probability of action failures. To learn the vertiport ATC policy, a novel graph-based reinforcement learning (RL) solution called \"Urban Air Mobility- Vertiport Schedule Management (UAM-VSM)\" is developed. This approach uses graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to abstract the vertiport space and eVTOL space as graphs, and aggregate information for a centralized ATC agent to help generalize the environment. Unreal Engine combined with Airsim is used as the simulation environment over which training and testing occurs. Uncertainties are considered only during testing, due to the high cost of Mc sampling over such realistic simulations. The proposed graph RL method demonstrates significantly better performance on the test scenarios when compared against a feasible random decision-making baseline and a first come first serve (FCFS) baseline, including the ability to generalize to unseen scenarios and with uncertainties."}}

This paper tackles a particular class of these problems that we call MRTA-collective transport or MRTA-CT -- here tasks present varying workloads and deadlines, and robots are subject to flight range, communication range, and payload constraints. For large instances of these problems involving 100s-1000's of tasks and 10s-100s of robots, traditional non-learning solvers are often time-inefficient, and emerging learning-based policies do not scale well to larger-sized problems without costly retraining. To address this gap, we use a recently proposed encoder-decoder graph neural network involving Capsule networks and multi-head attention mechanism, and innovatively add topological descriptors (TD) as new features to improve transferability to unseen problems of similar and larger size. Persistent homology is used to derive the TD, and proximal policy optimization is used to train our TD-augmented graph neural network. The resulting policy model compares favorably to state-of-the-art non-learning baselines while being much faster. The benefit of using TD is readily evident when scaling to test problems of size larger than those used in training."}}

The generalizability and scalability needs of the complex CO problem presented by MRTA are addressed by innovatively using the concept of Covariant Compositional Networks (CCN) to learn the local structures of graphs. The resulting learning architecture is called Covariant Attention-based Mechanism or CAM, which comprises: 1) an encoder: CCN-based embedding model to represent the task space as learnable feature vectors, 2) a decoder: an attention-based model to facilitate sequential decision outputs, and 3) context: to represent the state of the mission and the robots. To learn the feature vectors, a policy-gradient method is used. The CAM architecture is found to generally outperform a state-of-the-art encoder-decoder method that is purely based on Multi-head Attention (MHA) mechanism in terms of task completion and cost function, when applied to a class of MRTA problems with time deadlines, robot ferry range constraints, and multi-tour allowance. CAM also demonstrated significantly better scalability in terms of cost function over unseen scenarios with larger task/robot spaces than those used for training. Lastly, evidence regarding the unique potential of learning-based approaches in delivering highly time-efficient solutions is provided for a benchmark vehicle routing problem -- where solutions are achieved 100-1000 times faster compared to a non-learning baseline, and for a benchmark MRTA problem with time and capacity constraints -- where solutions for larger problems are achieved 10 times faster compared to non-learning baselines."}}

The proposed neural architecture, called Covariant Attention-based Model or CAM, includes three main components: 1) an encoder: a covariant compositional node-based embedding is used to represent each task as a learnable feature vector in manner that preserves the local structure of the task graph while being invariant to the ordering of graph nodes; 2) context: a vector representation of the mission time and state of the concerned robot and its peers; and 2) a decoder: builds upon the attention mechanism to facilitate a sequential output. In order to train the CAM model, a policy-gradient method based on REINFORCE is used. While the new architecture can solve the broad class of MRTA problems stated above, to demonstrate real-world applicability we use a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle or multi-UAV-based flood response problem for evaluation purposes. For comparison, the well-known attention-based approach (designed to solve mTSP/VRP problems) is extended and applied to the MRTA problem, as a baseline. The results show that the proposed CAM method is not only superior to the baseline AM method in terms of the cost function (over training and unseen test scenarios), but also provide significantly faster convergence and yields learnt policies that can be executed within 2.4ms/robot, thereby allowing real-time application."}}

However, single radio technology can hardly deliver optimal performance across all critical quality of service (QoS) dimensions under the typically varying environmental conditions or under varying distance between communicating nodes. Using a single wireless technology therefore falls short of meeting the demands of varying workloads or changing environmental conditions. Instead of pursuing a one-radio-fits-all approach, we design ARTPoS, an Adaptive Radio and Transmission Power Selection system, which makes available at runtime multiple wireless technologies (e.g., WiFi and ZigBee) and selects the radio(s) and transmission power(s) most suitable for the current conditions and requirements. The principal components of ARTPoS include new empirical models of power consumption and packet reception ratio (the latter can also be refined online) and online optimization schemes. We have implemented our system and evaluate it on the physical testbed consisting of our new embedded platforms with heterogeneous radios. Experimental results show that ARTPoS can significantly reduce the power consumption, while maintaining desired link reliability, compared to standard baselines."}}
