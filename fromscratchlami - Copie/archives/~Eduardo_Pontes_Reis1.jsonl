Inspired by how radiologists assess contrast phase status, this paper presents a simple approach to automatically detect the contrast phase. This method combines features extracted from the segmentation of key anatomical structures with a gradient boosting classifier for this task. The algorithm demonstrates high accuracy in categorizing the images into non-contrast (96.6\\% F1 score), arterial (78.9\\% F1 score), venous (92.2\\% F1 score), and delayed phases (95.0\\% F1 score), making it a valuable tool for enhancing AI applicability in medical imaging."}}

However, manually extracting these measures is a cumbersome and time-consuming task. Proprietary software to automate this process exist, but these software are closed-source, impeding large-scale access to and usage of these tools. To address this, we have built Comp2Comp, an open-source Python package for rapid and automated body composition analysis of CT scans. The primary advantages of Comp2Comp are its open-source nature, the inclusion of multiple tissue analysis capabilities within a single package, and its extensible design. We discuss the architecture of Comp2Comp and report initial validation results. Comp2Comp can be found at https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/Comp2Comp."}}
