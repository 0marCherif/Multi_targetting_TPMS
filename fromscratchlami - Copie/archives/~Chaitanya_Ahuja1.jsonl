The automatic generation of such co-speech gestures is a long-standing problem in computer animation and is considered an enabling technology in film, games, virtual social spaces, and for interaction with social robots. The problem is made challenging by the idiosyncratic and non-periodic nature of human co-speech gesture motion, and by the great diversity of communicative functions that gestures encompass. Gesture generation has seen surging interest recently, owing to the emergence of more and larger datasets of human gesture motion, combined with strides in deep-learning-based generative models, that benefit from the growing availability of data. This review article summarizes co-speech gesture generation research, with a particular focus on deep generative models. First, we articulate the theory describing human gesticulation and how it complements speech. Next, we briefly discuss rule-based and classical statistical gesture synthesis, before delving into deep learning approaches. We employ the choice of input modalities as an organizing principle, examining systems that generate gestures from audio, text, and non-linguistic input. We also chronicle the evolution of the related training data sets in terms of size, diversity, motion quality, and collection method. Finally, we identify key research challenges in gesture generation, including data availability and quality; producing human-like motion; grounding the gesture in the co-occurring speech in interaction with other speakers, and in the environment; performing gesture evaluation; and integration of gesture synthesis into applications. We highlight recent approaches to tackling the various key challenges, as well as the limitations of these approaches, and point toward areas of future development."}}

Often, the same gesture can be accompanied by semantically different spoken language phrases which makes crossmodal grounding especially challenging. For example, a deictic gesture of spanning a region could co-occur with semantically different phrases \"entire bottom row\" (referring to a physical point) and \"molecules expand and decay\" (referring to a scientific phenomena). In this paper, we introduce a self-supervised approach to learn such many-to-one grounding relationships between spoken language and gestures. As part of this approach, we propose a new contrastive loss function, Crossmodal Cluster NCE , that guides the model to learn spoken language representations which are consistent with the similarities in the gesture space. By doing so, we impose a greater level of grounding between spoken language and gestures in the model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a publicly available dataset through quantitative and qualitative studies. Our proposed methodology significantly outperforms prior approaches for grounding gestures to language. Link to code: https://github.com/dondongwon/CC_NCE_GENEA."}}

Since nonverbal behavior varies depending on personality, it is important to generate these nonverbal behaviors to match the expected personality of a virtual agent. In this work, we study how personality traits relate to the process of generating individual nonverbal behaviors from the whole body, including the head, eye gaze, arms, and posture. To study this, we first created a dialogue corpus including transcripts, a broad range of labelled nonverbal behaviors, and the Big Five personality scores of participants in dyad interactions. We constructed models that can predict each nonverbal behavior label given as an input language representation from the participants' spoken sentences. Our experimental results show that personality can help improve the prediction of nonverbal behaviors."}}

First, distributions of text and gestures are inherently skewed making it important to model the long tail. Second, gesture predictions are made at a subword level, making it important to learn relationships between language and acoustic cues. We introduce AISLe, which combines adversarial learning with importance sampling to strike a balance between precision and coverage. We propose the use of a multimodal multiscale attention block to perform subword alignment without the need of explicit alignment between language and acoustic cues. Finally, to empirically study the importance of language in this task, we extend the dataset proposed in Ahuja et al. (2020) with automatically extracted transcripts for audio signals. We substantiate the effectiveness of our approach through large-scale quantitative and user studies, which show that our proposed methodology significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches for gesture generation.

Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field and identify directions for future research."}}

In this paper, we introduce a neural architecture named Dyadic Residual-Attention Model (DRAM), which integrates intrapersonal (monadic) and interpersonal (dyadic) dynamics using selective attention to generate sequences of body pose conditioned on audio and body pose of the interlocutor and audio of the human operating the avatar. We evaluate our proposed model on dyadic conversational data consisting of pose and audio of both participants, confirming the importance of adaptive attention between monadic and dyadic dynamics when predicting avatar pose. We also conduct a user study to analyze judgments of human observers. Our results confirm that the generated body pose is more natural, models intrapersonal dynamics and interpersonal dynamics better than non-adaptive monadic/dyadic models."}}

Spectral Phase is not included in the decomposition process of these methods. However, phase of the speech mixture is generally used in reconstructing the target speech signal. This results in undesired traces of interfering sources in the target signal. In this paper the spectral phase is incorporated in the decomposition process itself. Additionally, the complex matrix factorization problem is reduced to an NMF problem using simple transformations. This results in effective separation of speech mixtures since both magnitude and phase are utilized jointly in the separation process. Improvement in source separation results are demonstrated using objective quality evaluations on the GRID corpus. As a side result, we have also investigated the intelligibility improvement aspect of target speaker in the presence of interfering speaker."}}
