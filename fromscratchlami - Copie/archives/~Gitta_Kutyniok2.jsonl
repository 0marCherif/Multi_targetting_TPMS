Here, we focus on two prevalent methods used to align these models, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). SFT is simple and robust, powering a host of open-source models, while RLHF is a more sophisticated method used in top-tier models like ChatGPT but also suffers from instability and susceptibility to reward hacking. We propose a novel approach, Supervised Iterative Learning from Human Feedback (SuperHF), which seeks to leverage the strengths of both methods. Our hypothesis is two-fold: we posit that the reward model used in RLHF is critical for efficient data use and model generalization and that the use of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in RLHF may not be necessary and could contribute to instability issues. SuperHF replaces PPO with a simple supervised loss and a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence prior. It creates its own training data by repeatedly sampling a batch of model outputs and filtering them through the reward model in an online learning regime. We then break down the reward optimization problem into three components: robustly optimizing the training rewards themselves, preventing reward hacking\u2014or exploitation of the reward model that can degrade model performance\u2014as measured by a novel METEOR similarity metric, and maintaining good performance on downstream evaluations. Our experimental results show SuperHF exceeds PPO-based RLHF on the training objective, easily and favorably trades off high reward with low reward hacking, improves downstream calibration, and performs the same on our GPT-4 based qualitative evaluation scheme all the while being significantly simpler to implement, highlighting SuperHF's potential as a competitive language model alignment technique."}}

In machine learning settings where the data set consists of signals defined on many different graphs, the trained ConvNet should generalize to signals on graphs unseen in the training set. It is thus important to transfer ConvNets between graphs. Transferability, which is a certain type of generalization capability, can be loosely defined as follows: if two graphs describe the same phenomenon, then a single filter or ConvNet should have similar repercussions on both graphs. This paper aims at debunking the common misconception that spectral filters are not transferable. We show that if two graphs discretize the same \u201ccontinuous\u201d space, then a spectral filter or ConvNet has approximately the same repercussion on both graphs. Our analysis is more permissive than the standard analysis. Transferability is typically described as the robustness of the filter to small graph perturbations and re-indexing of the vertices. Our analysis accounts also for large graph perturbations. We prove transferability between graphs that can have completely different dimensions and topologies, only requiring that both graphs discretize the same underlying space in some generic sense.\n\n"}}

Currently, the literature mostly focuses on uniform sampling and constant neighborhood radius. However, real-world graphs are likely to be better represented by a model in which the sampling density and the neighborhood radius can both vary over the latent space. For instance, in a social network communities can be modeled as densely sampled areas, and hubs as nodes with larger neighborhood radius. In this work, we first perform a rigorous mathematical analysis of this (more general) class of models, including derivations of the resulting graph shift operators. The key insight is that graph shift operators should be corrected in order to avoid potential distortions introduced by the non-uniform sampling. Then, we develop methods to estimate the unknown sampling density in a self-supervised fashion.\u00a0 Finally, we present exemplary applications in which the learnt density is used to 1) correct the graph shift operator and improve performance on a variety of tasks, 2) improve pooling, and 3) extract knowledge from networks. Our experimental findings support our theory and provide strong evidence for our model."}}

During the terminal phase of training a deep neural network, the feature embedding of all examples of the same class tend to collapse to a single representation, and the features of different classes tend to separate as much as possible. Neural collapse is often studied through a simplified model, called the layer-peeled model, in which the network is assumed to have ``infinite expressivity'' and can map each data point to any arbitrary representation. In this work we study a more realistic variant of the layer-peeled model, which takes the positivity of the features into account. Furthermore, we extend this model to also incorporate the limited expressivity of the network. Empirical evidence suggests that the memorization of noisy data points leads to a degradation (dilation) of the neural collapse. Using a model of the memorization-dilation (M-D) phenomenon, we show one mechanism by which different losses lead to different performances of the trained network on noisy data. Our proofs reveal why label smoothing, a modification of cross-entropy empirically observed to produce a regularization effect, leads to improved generalization in classification tasks."}}

We first prove non-asymptotic bounds showing that link predictors based on permutation-equivariant (structural) node embeddings obtained by gMPNNs can converge to a random guess as test graphs get larger. We then propose a theoretically-sound gMPNN that outputs structural pairwise (2-node) embeddings and prove non-asymptotic bounds showing that, as test graphs grow, these embeddings converge to embeddings of a continuous function that retains its ability to predict links OOD. Empirical results on random graphs show agreement with our theoretical results."}}

We study the generalization error of MPNNs in graph classification and regression. We assume that graphs of different classes are sampled from different random graph models. We show that, when training a MPNN on a dataset sampled from such a distribution, the generalization gap increases in the complexity of the MPNN, and decreases, not only with respect to the number of training samples, but also with the average number of nodes in the graphs. This shows how a MPNN with high complexity can generalize from a small dataset of graphs, as long as the graphs are large. The generalization bound is derived from a uniform convergence result, that shows that any MPNN, applied on a graph, approximates the MPNN applied on the geometric model that the graph discretizes."}}

Natural images are roughly piece-wise smooth signals---also called cartoon images---and tend to be sparse in the wavelet domain. CartoonX is the first explanation method to exploit this by requiring its explanations to be sparse in the wavelet domain, thus extracting the relevant piece-wise smooth part of an image instead of relevant pixel-sparse regions. We demonstrate experimentally that CartoonX is not only highly interpretable due to its piece-wise smooth nature but also particularly apt at explaining misclassifications."}}

As the underlying model, we study the machine-learning-based solution of parametric partial differential equations. Here, approximation theory predicts that the performance of the model should depend only very mildly on the dimension of the parameter space and is determined by the intrinsic dimension of the solution manifold of the parametric partial differential equation. We use various methods to establish comparability between test-cases by minimizing the effect of the choice of test-cases on the optimization and sampling aspects of the learning problem.

Of most practical relevance are automated approaches to theory building that scale efficiently for complex systems with many degrees of freedom. To date, available scalable methods aim at a data-driven interpolation, without exploiting or offering insight into fundamental underlying physical principles, such as locality of interactions. In this work, we show that various physical constraints can be captured via tensor network based parameterizations for the governing equation, which naturally ensures scalability. In addition to providing analytic results motivating the use of such models for realistic physical systems, we demonstrate that efficient rank-adaptive optimization algorithms can be used to learn optimal tensor network models without requiring a~priori knowledge of the exact tensor ranks. As such, we provide a physics-informed approach to recovering structured dynamical laws from data, which adaptively balances the need for expressivity and scalability."}}
