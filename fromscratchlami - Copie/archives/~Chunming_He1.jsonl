COD is a challenging task due to the intrinsic similarity of camouflaged objects with the background, as well as their ambiguous boundaries. Existing approaches to this problem have developed various techniques to mimic the human visual system. Albeit effective in many cases, these methods still struggle when camouflaged objects are so deceptive to the vision system. In this paper, we propose the FEature Decomposition and Edge Reconstruction (FEDER) model for COD. The FEDER model addresses the intrinsic similarity of foreground and background by decomposing the features into different frequency bands using learnable wavelets. It then focuses on the most informative bands to mine subtle cues that differentiate foreground and background. To achieve this, a frequency attention module and a guidance-based feature aggregation module are developed. To combat the ambiguous boundary problem, we propose to learn an auxiliary edge reconstruction task alongside the COD task. We design an ordinary differential equation-inspired edge reconstruction module that generates exact edges. By learning the auxiliary task in conjunction with the COD task, the FEDER model can generate precise prediction maps with accurate object boundaries. Experiments show that our FEDER model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with cheaper computational and memory costs."}}

Although various deep neural network-based HIF methods have been proposed, the most widely used single data-driven manner of the convolutional neural network always fails to give a guaranteed theoretical architecture and optimal convergence for the HIF problem. In this article, a deep model-driven neural network is designed for this HIF problem, which adaptively integrates the merits of model-based techniques for interpretability and deep learning-based methods for generalizability. Unlike the general network architecture as a black box, the proposed objective function is tailored to several domain knowledge network modules to model the compact and explainable deep model-driven HIF network termed DM-fusion.

In this paper, a new variation model on the basis of local gradient constraint is proposed for texture enhancement. Unlike other methods that only focus on the global constraints to extract texture information in visible image, we focus on the local gradient change to extract detailed texture feature. Experiments compared with SOTA algorithms show the efficiency and priority of our method."}}

The proposed GLLE histogram introduces local entropy, which can effectively describe the spatial information of pixels. Furthermore, we put forward the criterion function for GLLE histogram and calculate the threshold by Renyi entropy, which makes our method more generalized. Experiment results show that our method is effective and robust compared with seven other methods in segmentation accuracy and has the ability to resist the illumination."}}
