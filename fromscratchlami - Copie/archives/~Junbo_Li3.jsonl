After a throughout revisit of the\nexisting \u2018lie\u2019 behavior in pure language models, our work makes an unprecedented\nextension of \u2019lies\u2019 to vision-language models. The results indicate that the lie\nprefixes have a more obvious misleading effect on vision-language models than\non language models. We also propose a novel visual prefix and prove that the\nconsistent vision-language prefix is more threatening to vision-language models.\nTo defend the models from the stated \u2019lies\u2019, we put forward an unsupervised\nframework based on Gaussian mixture modeling and obtain improvement with 3%\nagainst the language prefix and 12% against the vision-language prefix."}}

In this paper, we present a unified framework to analyze certified patch defense tasks, including both \\emph{certified detection} and \\emph{certified recovery}, leveraging the recently emerged Vision Transformers (ViTs). In addition to the existing patch defense setting where only one patch is considered, we provide the very first study on developing certified detection against the \\emph{dual patch attack}, in which the attacker is allowed to adversarially manipulate pixels in two different regions.\n\nBy building upon the latest progress in self-supervised ViTs with masked image modeling (\\ie, masked autoencoder (MAE)), our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both certified detection and certified recovery of adversarial patches. Regarding certified detection, we improve the performance by up to $\\app16\\%$ on ImageNet without training on a single adversarial patch, and for the first time, can also tackle the more challenging dual patch setting. Our method largely \\emph{closes the gap} between detection-based certified robustness and clean image accuracy. Regarding certified recovery, our approach improves certified accuracy by $\\app2\\%$ on ImageNet across all attack sizes, attaining the new state-of-the-art performance."}}
