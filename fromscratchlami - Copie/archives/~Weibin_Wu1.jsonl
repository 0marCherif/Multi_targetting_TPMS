Besides, these examples are often transferable among different models. In other words, the same adversarial example can fool multiple models with different architectures at the same time. Based on this property, many black-box transfer-based attack techniques have been developed. However, current transfer-based attacks generally focus on the cross-architecture setting, where the attacker has access to the training data of the target model, which is not guaranteed in realistic situations. In this paper, we design a Cross-Domain Transfer-Based Attack (CDTA), which works in the cross-domain scenario. In this setting, attackers have no information about the target model, such as its architecture and training data. Specifically, we propose a contrastive spectral training method to train a feature extractor on a source domain (e.g., ImageNet) and use it to craft adversarial examples on target domains (e.g., Oxford 102 Flower). Our method corrupts the semantic information of the benign image by scrambling the outputs of both the intermediate feature layers and the final layer of the feature extractor. We evaluate CDTA with 16 target deep models on four datasets with widely varying styles. The results confirm that, in terms of the attack success rate, our approach can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 11.45% across all target models.

It is thus imperative to devise effective attack algorithms to identify the deficiencies of DNNs before real-world deployment. However, existing word-level attacks have two major deficiencies: (1) They may change the semantics of the original sentence. (2) The generated adversarial sample can appear unnatural to humans due to the introduction of out-of-domain substitute words. In this paper, to address such drawbacks, we propose a semantics- and domain-aware word-level attack method. Specifically, we greedily replace the important words in a sentence with the ones suggested by a language model. The language model is trained to be semantics- and domain-aware via contrastive learning and in-domain pre-training. Furthermore, to balance the quality of adversarial examples and the attack success rate, we propose an iterative updating framework to optimize the contrastive learning loss and the in-domain pre-training loss in circular order. Comprehensive experimental comparisons confirm the superiority of our approach. Notably, compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks, our strategy can achieve over 3\\% improvement in attack success rates and 9.8\\% improvement in the quality of adversarial examples."}}

However, they have been increasingly exploited to propagate toxic content, such as hate speech, malicious advertisement, and pornography, which can lead to highly negative impacts (e.g., harmful effects on teen mental health). Researchers and practitioners have been enthusiastically developing and extensively deploying textual content moderation software to address this problem. However, we find that malicious users can evade moderation by changing only a few words in the toxic content. Moreover, modern content moderation software's performance against malicious inputs remains underexplored. To this end, we propose MTTM, a Metamorphic Testing framework for Textual content Moderation software. Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2, 000 text messages collected from real users and summarize eleven metamorphic relations across three perturbation levels: character, word, and sentence. MTTM employs these metamorphic relations on toxic textual contents to generate test cases, which are still toxic yet likely to evade moderation. In our evaluation, we employ MTTM to test three commercial textual content moderation software and two state-of-the-art moderation algorithms against three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTTM achieves up to 83.9%, 51%, and 82.5% error finding rates (EFR) when testing commercial moderation software provided by Google, Baidu, and Huawei, respectively, and it obtains up to 91.2% EFR when testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy. In addition, we leverage the test cases generated by MTTM to retrain the model we explored, which largely improves model robustness 0% ~ 5.9% EFR) while maintaining the accuracy on the original test set.

Transfer-based attacks use a local model to generate adversarial samples and directly transfer them to attack a target black-box model. The high efficiency of transfer-based attacks makes it a severe security threat to ViT-based applications. Therefore, it is vital to design effective transfer-based attacks to identify the deficiencies of ViTs beforehand in security-sensitive scenarios. Existing efforts generally focus on regularizing the input gradients to stabilize the updated direction of adversarial samples. However, the variance of the back-propagated gradients in intermediate blocks of ViTs may still be large, which may make the generated adversarial samples focus on some model-specific features and get stuck in poor local optima. To overcome the shortcomings of existing approaches, we propose the Token Gradient Regularization (TGR) method. According to the structural characteristics of ViTs, TGR reduces the variance of the back-propagated gradient in each internal block of ViTs in a token-wise manner and utilizes the regularized gradient to generate adversarial samples. Extensive experiments on attacking both ViTs and CNNs confirm the superiority of our approach. Notably, compared to the state-of-the-art transfer-based attacks, our TGR offers a performance improvement of 8.8% on average."}}

Therefore, it popularizes Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS), where general users can access the trained models of MLaaS providers via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) on a pay-per-query basis. Unfortunately, the success of MLaaS is under threat from model extraction attacks, where attackers intend to extract a local model of equivalent functionality to the target MLaaS model. However, existing studies on model extraction of text analytics APIs frequently assume adversaries have strong knowledge about the victim model, like its architecture and parameters, which hardly holds in practice. Besides, since the attacker's and the victim's training data can be considerably discrepant, it is non-trivial to perform efficient model extraction. In this paper, to advance the understanding of such attacks, we propose a framework, PEEP, for practical and efficient model extraction of sentiment analysis APIs with only query access. Specifically, PEEP features a learning-based scheme, which employs out-of-domain public corpora and a novel query strategy to construct proxy training data for model extraction. Besides, PEEP introduces a greedy search algorithm to settle an appropriate architecture for the extracted model. We conducted extensive experiments with two victim models across three datasets and two real-life commercial sentiment analysis APIs. Experimental results corroborate that PEEP can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of effectiveness and efficiency."}}

However, language models may emit the training data verbatim during inference with appropriate prompts. This memorization property raises privacy concerns of commercial NCCTs about the hard-coded credential leakage, leading to unauthorized access to systems. Therefore, to answer whether NCCTs will inadvertently emit the hard-coded credential, we propose an evaluation tool called Hard-coded Credential Revealer (HCR). HCR effectively constructs test prompts from GitHub code files with credentials to trigger memorization phenomenon of commercial NCCTs. Then, HCR extracts credentials with pre-defined format from the responses by four designed filters. We apply HCR to evaluate two representative commercial NCCTs: GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer and successfully extracted 2,702 hard-coded credentials from Copilot and 129 secrets from CodeWhisper under the black-box setting, among which at least 3.6% and 5.4% secrets are real strings from GitHub repositories. Moreover, two operational credentials were identified. The experimental results raise the severe privacy concern of the potential leakage of hard-coded credentials in the training data of commercial NCCTs."}}

However, they are vulnerable to adversarial noise that is imperceptible to humans. This phenomenon negatively affects their deployment in real-world scenarios, especially security-related ones. To evaluate the robustness of a target model in practice, transfer-based attacks craft adversarial samples with a local model and have attracted increasing attention from researchers due to their high efficiency. The state-of-the-art transfer-based attacks are generally based on data augmentation, which typically augments multiple training images from a linear path when learning adversarial samples. However, such methods selected the image augmentation path heuristically and may augment images that are semantics-inconsistent with the target images, which harms the transferability of the generated adversarial samples. To overcome the pitfall, we propose the Path-Augmented Method (PAM). Specifically, PAM first constructs a candidate augmentation path pool. It then settles the employed augmentation paths during adversarial sample generation with greedy search. Furthermore, to avoid augmenting semantics-inconsistent images, we train a Semantics Predictor (SP) to constrain the length of the augmentation path. Extensive experiments confirm that PAM can achieve an improvement of over 4.8% on average compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of the attack success rates."}}

However, the robustness of latent diffusion models is not well studied. Previous works only focus on the adversarial attacks against the encoder or the output image under white-box settings, regardless of the denoising process. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to analyze the robustness of latent diffusion models more thoroughly. We first study the influence of the components inside latent diffusion models on their white-box robustness. In addition to white-box scenarios, we evaluate the black-box robustness of latent diffusion models via transfer attacks, where we consider both prompt-transfer and model-transfer settings and possible defense mechanisms. However, all these explorations need a comprehensive benchmark dataset, which is missing in the literature. Therefore, to facilitate the research of the robustness of latent diffusion models, we propose two automatic dataset construction pipelines for two kinds of image editing models and release the whole dataset.
