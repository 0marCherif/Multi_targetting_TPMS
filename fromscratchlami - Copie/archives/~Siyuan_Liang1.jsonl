However, existing attacking methods for image object detection have two limitations: weak transferability\u2014the generated adversarial examples often have a low success rate to attack other kinds of detection methods, and high computation cost\u2014they need much time to deal with video data,\nwhere many frames need polluting. To address these issues, we present a generative method to obtain adversarial images and videos, thereby significantly reducing the processing time. To enhance transferability, we manipulate the feature maps extracted by a feature network, which usually constitutes the basis of object detectors. Our method is based on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, where we combine a high-level class loss and a low-level feature loss to jointly train the adversarial example generator. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC and ImageNet VID datasets show that our method efficiently generates image and video adversarial examples, and more importantly, these adversarial examples have better transferability, therefore being able to simultaneously attack two kinds of representative object detection models: proposal based models like FasterRCNN and regression based models like SSD."}}

In contrast to the commonly-studied classification model extraction, there exist no studies on the more challenging object detection task due to the sufficiency and efficiency of problem domain data collection. In this paper, we for the first time reveal that black-box victim object detectors can be easily replicated without knowing the model structure and training data. In particular, we treat it as black-box knowledge distillation and propose a teacher-student framework named Imitated Detector to transfer the knowledge of the victim model to the imitated model. To accelerate the problem domain data construction, we extend the problem domain dataset by generating synthetic images, where we apply the text-image generation process and provide short text inputs consisting of object categories and natural scenes; to promote the feedback information, we aim to fully mine the latent knowledge of the victim model by introducing an iterative adversarial attack strategy, where we feed victim models with transferable adversarial examples making victim provide diversified predictions with more information. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets in different settings demonstrate that our approach achieves the highest model extraction accuracy and outperforms other model stealing methods by large margins in the problem domain dataset.

Most detection methods are designed to verify whether a model is infected with presumed types of backdoor attacks, yet the adversary is likely to generate diverse backdoor attacks in practice that are unforeseen to defenders, which challenge current detection strategies. In this paper, we focus on this more challenging scenario and propose a universal backdoor attacks detection method named Adaptive Adversarial Probe (A2P). Specifically, we posit that the challenge of universal backdoor attacks detection lies in the fact that different backdoor attacks often exhibit diverse characteristics in trigger patterns (i.e., sizes and transparencies). Therefore, our A2P adopts a global-to-local probing framework, which adversarially probes images with adaptive regions/budgets to fit various backdoor triggers of different sizes/transparencies. Regarding the probing region, we propose the attention-guided region generation strategy that generates region proposals with different sizes/locations based on the attention of the target model, since trigger regions often manifest higher model activation. Considering the attack budget, we introduce the box-to-sparsity scheduling that iteratively increases the perturbation budget from box to sparse constraint, so that we could better activate different latent backdoors with different transparencies. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, Tiny-ImageNet) demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by large margins (+12%)."}}

Since the teacher model perceives data in a way different from humans, existing KD methods only distill knowledge that is consistent with labels annotated by human expert while neglecting knowledge that is not consistent with human perception, which results in insufficient distillation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose inconsistent knowledge distillation (IKD), which aims to distill knowledge inherent in the teacher model's counter-intuitive perceptions. We start by considering the teacher model's counter-intuitive perceptions of frequency and non-robust features. Unlike previous works that exploit fine-grained features or introduce additional regularizations, we extract inconsistent knowledge by providing diverse input using data augmentation. Specifically, we propose a sample-specific data augmentation to transfer the teacher model's ability in capturing distinct frequency components and suggest an adversarial feature augmentation to extract the teacher model's perceptions of non-robust features in the data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method which outperforms state-of-the-art KD baselines on one-stage, two-stage and anchor-free object detectors (at most +1.0 mAP).

When solving the large-scale PFSS problems, traditional optimization algorithms such as heuristics could hardly meet the demands of both solution accuracy and computational efficiency. Thus learning-based methods have recently garnered more attention. Some work attempts to solve the problems by reinforcement learning methods, which suffer from slow convergence issues during training and are still not accurate enough regarding the solutions. To that end, we train the model via expert-driven imitation learning, which accelerates the convergence more stably and accurately. Moreover, in order to extract better feature representations of input jobs, we incorporate the graph structure as the encoder. The extensive experiments reveal that our proposed model obtains significant promotion and presents excellent generalizability in large-scale problems with up to 1000 jobs.

Previously proposed Fair Robust Learning (FRL) adaptively reweights different classes to improve fairness. However, the performance of the better-performed classes decreases, leading to a strong performance drop. In this paper, we observed two unfair phenomena during adversarial training: different difficulties in generating adversarial examples from each class (source-class fairness) and disparate target class tendencies when generating adversarial examples (target-class fairness). From the observations, we propose Balance Adversarial Training (BAT) to address the robust fairness problem. Regarding source-class fairness, we adjust the attack strength and difficulties of each class to generate samples near the decision boundary for easier and fairer model learning; considering target-class fairness, by introducing a uniform distribution constraint, we encourage the adversarial example generation process for each class with a fair tendency. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNette) demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform other baselines in mitigating the robust fairness problem (+5-10\\% on the worst class accuracy)"}}

Despite the preliminary understandings devoted to adversarially robust generalization, little is known from the architectural perspective. To bridge the gap, this paper for the first time systematically investigated the relationship between adversarially robust generalization and architectural design. Inparticular, we comprehensively evaluated 20 most representative adversarially trained architectures on ImageNette and CIFAR-10 datasets towards multiple `p-norm adversarial attacks. Based on the extensive experiments, we found that, under aligned settings, Vision Transformers (e.g., PVT, CoAtNet) often yield better adversarially robust generalization while CNNs tend to overfit on specific attacks and fail to generalize on multiple adversaries. To better understand the nature behind it, we conduct theoretical analysis via the lens of Rademacher complexity. We revealed the fact that the higher weight sparsity contributes significantly towards the better adversarially robust generalization of Transformers, which can be often achieved by the specially-designed attention blocks. We hope our paper could help to better understand the mechanism for designing robust DNNs. Our model weights can be found at http://robust.art."}}

However, its vulnerability to adversarial examples has not been sufficiently studied, especially under the practical scenario of black-box attacks, where the attacker can only access the query feedback of predicted bounding-boxes and top-1 scores returned by the attacked model. Compared with black-box attack to image classification, there are two main challenges in black-box attack to detection. Firstly, even if one bounding-box is successfully attacked, another sub-optimal bounding-box may be detected near the attacked bounding-box. Secondly, there are multiple bounding-boxes, leading to very high attack cost. To address these challenges, we propose a Parallel Rectangle Flip Attack (PRFA) via random search. We explain the difference between our method with other attacks in Fig.~\\ref{fig1}. Specifically, we generate perturbations in each rectangle patch to avoid sub-optimal detection near the attacked region. Besides, utilizing the observation that adversarial perturbations mainly locate around objects' contours and critical points under white-box attacks, the search space of attacked rectangles is reduced to improve the attack efficiency. Moreover, we develop a parallel mechanism of attacking multiple rectangles simultaneously to further accelerate the attack process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively and efficiently attack various popular object detectors, including anchor-based and anchor-free, and generate transferable adversarial examples."}}
