Conformal prediction is a distribution-free uncertainty quantification algorithm popular for its ease of implementation, statistical coverage guarantees, and versatility for underlying forecasters. However, existing conformal prediction algorithms for time series are limited to single-step prediction without considering the temporal dependency. In this paper we propose a Copula-based Conformal Prediction algorithm for multivariate, multi-step Time Series forecasting, CopulaCPTS. On several synthetic and real-world multivariate time series datasets, we show that CopulaCPTS produces more calibrated and sharp confidence intervals for multi-step prediction tasks than existing techniques."}}

KoD is a multi-dimensional machine learning matrix operating in the aural dimension on harmony, melody, lyrics and style. In the musical dimension it plays 5-track pop songs generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) rendered through a Pure Data patch. In the visual dimension it operates on images tied to words using attention GANs. In the linguistic dimension it is generated by GPT-2 fine-tuned on pop song lyrics. In the spatial dimension it is a 4-fold rotational tesseract, outlining 3D space. The human element is the participant\u2019s voice and performance of the generated concert experience. KoD envelops the singer like an AI womb, a safe, warm, pulsating center allowing the singer to pour their heart out."}}

While most existing works focus on deterministic prediction, producing probabilistic forecasts to quantify uncertainty and assess risks is critical for downstream decision-making tasks such as motion planning and collision avoidance. Multi-agent dynamics often contains internal symmetry. By leveraging symmetry, specifically rotation equivariance, we can improve not only the prediction accuracy but also uncertainty calibration. We introduce Energy Score, a proper scoring rule, to evaluate probabilistic predictions. We propose a novel deep dynamics model, Probabilistic Equivariant Continuous COnvolution (PECCO) for probabilistic prediction of multi-agent trajectories. PECCO extends equivariant continuous convolution to model the joint velocity distribution of multiple agents. It uses dynamics integration to propagate the uncertainty from velocity to position. On both synthetic and real-world datasets, PECCO shows significant improvements in accuracy and calibration compared to non-equivariant baselines."}}

In these settings, it is important that a model produces calibrated uncertainty to reflect its own confidence and avoid failures. In this paper we survey recent works on uncertainty quantification (UQ) for deep learning, in particular distribution-free Conformal Prediction method for its mathematical properties and wide applicability. We will cover the theoretical guarantees of conformal methods, introduce techniques that improve calibration and efficiency for UQ in the context of spatiotemporal data, and discuss the role of UQ in the context of safe decision making."}}

Our concerts begin by invoking one another through internet conferencing software; during the concert, we play skull augmented theremins while reading GPT2 & GPT3 (Machine Learning language models) generated dialogue over pre-generated songs. As a distributed band we designed our performance to take place over video conferencing systems deliberately incorporating the glitch artifacts that they bring. We use one of the oldest forms of generative operations, throwing dice, as well as the latest in ML technology to create our collaborative music over a distance. In this paper, we illustrate how we leverage the multiple novel interfaces that we use to create our unique sound."}}
