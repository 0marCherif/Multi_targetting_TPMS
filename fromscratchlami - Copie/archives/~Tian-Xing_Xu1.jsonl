Motivated by this observation, attention mechanisms were introduced into computer vision with the aim of imitating this aspect of the human visual system. Such an attention mechanism can be regarded as a dynamic weight adjustment process based on features of the input image. Attention mechanisms have achieved great success in many visual tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, video understanding, image generation, 3D vision, multimodal tasks, and self-supervised learning. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of various attention mechanisms in computer vision and categorize them according to approach, such as channel attention, spatial attention, temporal attention, and branch attention; a related repository https://github.com/MenghaoGuo/Awesome-Vision-Attentions is dedicated to collecting related work. We also suggest future directions for attention mechanism research."}}

In this paper, we emphasize the importance of point distribution uniformity to downstream tasks. We demonstrate that point clouds produced by existing gradient-based denoisers lack uniformity despite having achieved promising quantitative results. To this end, we propose GPCD++, a gradient-based denoiser with an ultra-lightweight network named UniNet to address uniformity. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, our approach not only generates competitive or even better denoising results, but also significantly improves uniformity which largely benefits applications such as surface reconstruction."}}

Point cloud based methods mainly focus on extracting global descriptors from local features of point clouds. Despite having achieved promising results, existing solutions neglect the following aspects, which may cause performance degradation: (1) huge size difference between objects in outdoor scenes; (2) moving objects that are unrelated to place recognition; (3) long-range contextual information. We illustrate that the above aspects bring challenges to extracting discriminative global descriptors. To mitigate these problems, we propose a novel method named TransLoc3D, utilizing adaptive receptive fields with a point-wise reweighting scheme to handle objects of different sizes while suppressing noises, and an external transformer to capture long-range feature dependencies. As opposed to existing architectures which adopt fixed and limited receptive fields, our method benefits from size-adaptive receptive fields as well as global contextual information, and outperforms current state-of-the-arts with significant improvements on popular datasets."}}
