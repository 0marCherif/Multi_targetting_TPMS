Given an input multidomain signal, we search for a product\ngraph on which the signal is bandlimited, i.e. have limited spectral\noccupancy. The subsampling procedure described in this article\nis composed of two successive steps. First, we use the input data\nto learn a graph that will be optimized to favor efficient sampling.\nThen, we derive an algorithm for choosing the best nodes and provide a sampling strategy for multidomain signals. Experiments on\nsynthetic data and two real datasets show the efficiency of the proposed method and its relevance for multidomain data compression\nand storing."}}
