The basic idea is to learn the rank of users\u2019 preferred items through separating items into positive samples if user-item interactions exist, and negative samples otherwise. Due to the limited number of observable interactions, pairwise ranking models face serious class-imbalance issues. Our theoretical analysis shows that current sampling-based methods cause the vertex-level imbalance problem, which makes the norm of learned item em- beddings towards infinite after a certain training iterations, and consequently results in vanishing gradient and affects the model in- ference results. We thus propose an efficient Vital Negative Sampler (VINS) to alleviate the class-imbalance issue for pairwise ranking model, in particular for deep learning models optimized by gradient methods. The core of VINS is a bias sampler with reject probability that will tend to accept a negative candidate with a larger degree weight than the given positive item. Evaluation results on sev- eral real datasets demonstrate that the proposed sampling method speeds up the training procedure 30% to 50% for ranking models ranging from shallow to deep, while maintaining and even improv- ing the quality of ranking results in top-N item recommendation."}}

Specifically, we derive a theoretical analysis and provide an empirical demonstration about the non-steady performance of GNNs over different graph datasets, when the supervision signals are not appropriately defined. The performance of GNNs depends on both the node feature smoothness and the locality of graph structure. To smooth the discrepancy of node proximity measured by graph topology and node feature, we proposed SAIL - a novel \\underline{S}elf-\\underline{A}ugmented graph contrast\\underline{i}ve \\underline{L}earning framework, with two complementary self-distilling regularization modules, \\emph{i.e.}, intra- and inter-graph knowledge distillation. We demonstrate the competitive performance of SAIL on a variety of graph applications. Even with a single GNN layer, SAIL has consistently competitive or even better performance on various benchmark datasets, comparing with state-of-the-art baselines."}}

More than 51K artworks have 5 annotations or more in 3 languages. This diversity makes it possible to study similarities and differences across languages and cultures. Further, we investigate captioning tasks, and find diversity improves the performance of baseline models. ArtELingo is publicly available with standard splits and baseline models.

Existing methods attempt to address this scalability issue by training multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) exclusively on node content features using labels derived from trained GNNs. Even though the performance of MLPs can be significantly improved, two issues prevent MLPs from outperforming GNNs and being used in practice: the ignorance of graph structural information and the sensitivity to node feature noises. In this paper, we propose to learn NOise-robust Structure-aware MLPs On Graphs (NOSMOG) to overcome the challenges. Specifically, we first complement node content with position features to help MLPs capture graph structural information. We then design a novel representational similarity distillation strategy to inject structural node similarities into MLPs. Finally, we introduce the adversarial feature augmentation to ensure stable learning against feature noises and further improve performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NOSMOG outperforms GNNs and the state-of-the-art method in both transductive and inductive settings across 7 datasets, while maintaining a competitive inference efficiency."}}

Existing methods attempt to address this scalability issue by training student multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) exclusively on node content features using labels derived from the teacher GNNs. However, the trained MLPs are neither effective nor robust. In this paper, we ascribe the lack of effectiveness and robustness to three significant challenges: 1) the misalignment between content feature and label spaces, 2) the strict hard matching to teacher's output, and 3) the sensitivity to node feature noises. To address the challenges, we propose NOSMOG, a novel method to learn NOise-robust Structure-aware MLPs On Graphs, with remarkable effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Specifically, we first address the misalignment by complementing node content with position features to capture the graph structural information. We then design an innovative representational similarity distillation strategy to inject soft node similarities into MLPs. Finally, we introduce adversarial feature augmentation to ensure stable learning against feature noises. Extensive experiments and theoretical analyses demonstrate the superiority of NOSMOG by comparing it to GNNs and the state-of-the-art method in both transductive and inductive settings across seven datasets.

Our work echoes the challenge by first unveiling the impact factors of adversarial vulnerability of classification models with categorical data based on an information-theoretic adversarial risk analysis about the targeted classifier. Though certifying the robustness of such classification models is intrinsically an NP-hard combinatorial problem, our study shows that the robustness certification can be solved via an efficient greedy exploration of the discrete attack space for any measurable classifiers with a mild smoothness constraint. Our proposed robustness certification framework is instantiated with deep neural network models applied on real-world safety-critic data sources. Our empirical observations confirm the impact of the key adversarial risk factors with categorical input."}}

Given pairs of biomedical terms, we focus on link prediction to explain how the prediction was made. This more transparent process encourages trust in the biomedical community for automatic hypothesis generation systems. We use a reinforcement learning strategy to formulate the HG problem as a guided node-pair embedding-based link prediction problem via a directed graph walk. Given nodes in a node-pair, the model starts a graph walk, simultaneously aggregating information from the visited nodes and their neighbors for an improved node-pair representation. Then at the end of the walk, it infers the probability of a link from the gathered information. This guided walk framework allows for explainability via the walk trajectory information. By evaluating our model on predicting the links between millions of biomedical terms in both transductive and inductive settings,  we verified the effectiveness of our proposed model on obtaining higher prediction accuracy than baselines and understanding the reason for a link prediction.

However, due to the difficulties of mapping genes to pathways and the limited knowledge about pathway interactions, most previous work focus on identifying individual pathways. In practice, two (or even more) pathways interplay and often cooperatively trigger cancer. In this study, we proposed a new approach called CDPathway to discover cooperative driver pathways. First, CDPathway introduces a driver impact quantification function to quantify the driver weight of each gene. CDPathway assumes that genes with larger weights contribute more to the occurrence of the target disease and identifies them as candidate driver genes. Next, it constructs a heterogeneous network composed of genes, miRNAs and pathways nodes based on the known intra(inter)-relations between them and assigns the quantified driver weights to gene\u2013pathway and gene\u2013miRNA relational edges. To transfer driver impacts of genes to pathway interaction pairs, CDPathway collaboratively factorizes the weighted adjacency matrices of the heterogeneous network to explore the latent relations between genes, miRNAs and pathways. After this, it reconstructs the pathway interaction network and identifies the pathway pairs with maximal interactive and driver weights as cooperative driver pathways. Experimental results on the breast, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and ovarian cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas show that CDPathway can effectively identify candidate driver genes [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of |$\\geq $|0.9] and reconstruct the pathway interaction network (AUROC of>0.9), and it uncovers much more known (potential) driver genes than other competitive methods. In addition, CDPathway identifies 150% more driver pathways and 60% more potential cooperative driver pathways than the competing methods. The code of CDPathway is available at http://mlda.swu.edu.cn/codes.php?name=CDPathway."}}
