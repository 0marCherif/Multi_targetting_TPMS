By explicitly incorporating a conditional masking variable, as well as using this mask information to modulate losses during training based on expected exemplar difficulty, SUNMASK models discrete sequences without direct ordering assumptions. The addition of masking terms allows for fine-grained control during generation, starting from random tokens and a mask over subset variables, then predicting tokens which are again combined with a subset mask for subsequent repetitions. This iterative process gradually improves token sequences toward a structured output, while guided by proposal masks. The broad framework for unrolled denoising autoencoders is largely independent of model type, and we utilize both transformer and convolution based architectures in this work. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach both qualitatively and quantitatively, applying SUNMASK to generative modeling of symbolic polyphonic music, and language modeling for English text."}}

However, MIR has long been mired by small datasets and unreliable labels. In this work, we propose to break this bottleneck using generative modeling. By pipelining a generative model of notes (Coconet trained on Bach Chorales) with a structured synthesis model of chamber ensembles (MIDI-DDSP trained on URMP), we demonstrate a system capable of producing unlimited amounts of realistic chorale music with rich annotations including mixes, stems, MIDI, note-level performance attributes (staccato, vibrato, etc.), and even fine-grained synthesis parameters (pitch, amplitude, etc.). We call this system the Chamber Ensemble Generator (CEG), and use it to generate a large dataset of chorales from four different chamber ensembles (CocoChorales). We demonstrate that data generated using our approach improves state-of-the-art models for music transcription and source separation, and we release both the system and the dataset as an open-source foundation for future work in the MIR community."}}

In this paper, we propose a pipeline of contrastive language-audio pretraining to develop an audio representation by combining audio data with natural language descriptions. To accomplish this target, we first release LAION-Audio-630K, a large collection of 633,526 audio-text pairs from different data sources. Second, we construct a contrastive language-audio pretraining model by considering different audio encoders and text encoders. We incorporate the feature fusion mechanism and keyword-to-caption augmentation into the model design to further enable the model to process audio inputs of variable lengths and enhance the performance. Third, we perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate our model across three tasks: text-to-audio retrieval, zero-shot audio classification, and supervised audio classification. The results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance in text-to-audio retrieval task. In audio classification tasks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot setting and is able to obtain performance comparable to models' results in the non-zero-shot setting. LAION-Audio-630K and the proposed model are both available to the public."}}

Conventional audio synthesizers provide detailed expressive controls, but at the cost of realism. Black-box neural audio synthesis and concatenative samplers can produce realistic audio, but have few mechanisms for control. In this work, we introduce MIDI-DDSP a hierarchical model of musical instruments that enables both realistic neural audio synthesis and detailed user control. Starting from interpretable Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) synthesis parameters, we infer musical notes and high-level properties of their expressive performance (such as timbre, vibrato, dynamics, and articulation). This creates a 3-level hierarchy (notes, performance, synthesis) that affords individuals the option to intervene at each level, or utilize trained priors (performance given notes, synthesis given performance) for creative assistance. Through quantitative experiments and listening tests, we demonstrate that this hierarchy can reconstruct high-fidelity audio, accurately predict performance attributes for a note sequence, independently manipulate the attributes of a given performance,  and as a complete system, generate realistic audio from a novel note sequence. By utilizing an interpretable hierarchy, with multiple levels of granularity, MIDI-DDSP opens the door to assistive tools to empower individuals across a diverse range of musical experience."}}

This paper presents an audio captioning system with an encoder-decoder architecture, where the decoder predicts words based on audio features extracted by the encoder. To improve the proposed system, transfer learning from either an upstream audio-related task or a large in-domain dataset is introduced to mitigate the problem induced by data scarcity. Besides, evaluation metrics are incorporated into the optimization of the model with reinforcement learning, which helps address the problem of ``exposure bias'' induced by ``teacher forcing'' training strategy and the mismatch between the evaluation metrics and the loss function. The resulting system was ranked 3rd in DCASE 2021 Task 6. Ablation studies are carried out to investigate how much each element in the proposed system can contribute to final performance. The results show that the proposed techniques significantly improve the scores of the evaluation metrics, however, reinforcement learning may impact adversely on the quality of the generated captions."}}

A Peking Opera singer usually exhibits a very strong personal style via introducing improvisation and expressiveness on stage which leads the actual rhythm and pitch contour to deviate significantly from the original music score. This inconsistency poses a great challenge in Peking Opera singing voice synthesis from a music score. In this work, we propose to deal with this issue and synthesize expressive Peking Opera singing from the music score based on the Duration Informed Attention Network (DurIAN) framework. To tackle the rhythm mismatch, Lagrange multiplier is used to find the optimal output phoneme duration sequence with the constraint of the given note duration from music score. As for the pitch contour mismatch, instead of directly inferring from music score, we adopt a pseudo music score generated from the real singing and feed it as input during training.
