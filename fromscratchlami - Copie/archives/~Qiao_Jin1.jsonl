However, the development of ReCDS systems has been severely obstructed by the lack of diverse patient collections and publicly available large-scale patient-level annotation datasets. In this paper, we aim to define and benchmark two ReCDS tasks: Patient-to-Article Retrieval (ReCDS-PAR) and Patient-to-Patient Retrieval (ReCDS-PPR) using a novel dataset called PMC-Patients. Methods: We extract patient summaries from PubMed Central articles using simple heuristics and utilize the PubMed citation graph to define patient-article relevance and patient-patient similarity. We also implement and evaluate several ReCDS systems on the PMC-Patients benchmarks, including sparse retrievers, dense retrievers, and nearest neighbor retrievers. We conduct several case studies to show the clinical utility of PMC-Patients. Results: PMC-Patients contains 167k patient summaries with 3.1M patient-article relevance annotations and 293k patient-patient similarity annotations, which is the largest-scale resource for ReCDS and also one of the largest patient collections. Human evaluation and analysis show that PMC-Patients is a diverse dataset with high-quality annotations. The evaluation of various ReCDS systems shows that the PMC-Patients benchmark is challenging and calls for further research. Conclusion: We present PMC-Patients, a large-scale, diverse, and publicly available patient summary dataset with the largest-scale patient-level relation annotations. Based on PMC-Patients, we formally define two benchmark tasks for ReCDS systems and evaluate various existing retrieval methods. PMC-Patients can largely facilitate methodology research on ReCDS systems and shows real-world clinical utility."}}

To optimize the design of clinical trials, we introduce a novel Clinical Trial Result Prediction (CTRP) task. In the CTRP framework, a model takes a PICO-formatted clinical trial proposal with its background as input and predicts the result, i.e. how the Intervention group compares with the Comparison group in terms of the measured Outcome in the studied Population. While structured clinical evidence is prohibitively expensive for manual collection, we exploit large-scale unstructured sentences from medical literature that implicitly contain PICOs and results as evidence. Specifically, we pre-train a model to predict the disentangled results from such implicit evidence and fine-tune the model with limited data on the downstream datasets. Experiments on the benchmark Evidence Integration dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines by large margins, e.g., with a 10.7% relative gain over BioBERT in macro-F1. Moreover, the performance improvement is also validated on another dataset composed of clinical trials related to COVID-19."}}

MeSH covers a wide variety of biomedical topics like diseases and drugs, which are used to classify PubMed articles. Human indexers at NLM have been annotating the PubMed articles with MeSH for decades, and have collected millions of MeSH-labeled articles. Recently, many deep learning algorithms have been developed to automatically annotate the MeSH terms, utilizing this large-scale MeSH indexing dataset. However, most of the models are trained on all articles non-discriminatively, ignoring the temporal structure of the dataset. In this paper, we uncover and thoroughly characterize the problem of MeSH indexing dataset shift (MeSHIFT), meaning that the data distribution changes with time. MeSHIFT includes the shift of input articles, output MeSH labels and annotation rules. We found that machine learning models suffer from performance loss for not tackling the problem of MeSHIFT. Towards this end, we present a novel method, time-aware concept embedding learning (TaCEL), as an attempt to solve it. TaCEL is a plug-in module which can be easily incorporated in other automatic MeSH indexing models. Results show that TaCEL improves current state-of-the-art models with only minimum additional costs. We hope this work can facilitate understanding of the MeSH indexing dataset, especially its temporal structure, and provide a solution that can be used to improve current models."}}
