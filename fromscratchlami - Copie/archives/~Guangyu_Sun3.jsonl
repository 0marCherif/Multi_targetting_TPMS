In the typical FL paradigm (e.g., FedAvg), model weights are sent to and from the server each round to participating clients. However, this can quickly put a massive communication burden on the system, especially if more capable models beyond very small MLPs are employed.\nRecently, the use of pre-trained models has been shown effective in federated learning optimization and improving convergence. This opens the door for new research questions. Can we adjust the weight-sharing paradigm in federated learning, leveraging strong and readily-available pre-trained models, to significantly reduce the communication burden while simultaneously achieving excellent performance? To this end, we investigate the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in federated learning. Specifically, we systemically evaluate the performance of several parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods across a variety of client stability, data distribution, and differential privacy settings. By only locally tuning and globally sharing a small portion of the model weights, significant reductions in the total communication overhead can be achieved while maintaining competitive performance in a wide range of federated learning scenarios, providing insight into a new paradigm for practical and effective federated systems."}}
