Recently, researchers extended 1-hop message passing to $K$-hop message passing by aggregating information from $K$-hop neighbors of nodes simultaneously.

Specifically, we first formally differentiate two different kernels of $K$-hop message passing which are often misused in previous works. We then characterize the expressive power of $K$-hop message passing by showing that it is more powerful than 1-WL and can distinguish almost all regular graphs. Despite the higher expressive power, we show that $K$-hop message passing still cannot distinguish some simple regular graphs and its expressive power is bounded by 3-WL. To further enhance its expressive power, we introduce a KP-GNN framework, which improves $K$-hop message passing by leveraging the peripheral subgraph information in each hop. We show that KP-GNN can distinguish many distance regular graphs which could not be distinguished by previous distance encoding or 3-WL methods. Experimental results verify the expressive power and effectiveness of KP-GNN. KP-GNN achieves competitive results across all benchmark datasets."}}

We present novel attacks targeting Q-learning that exploit a vulnerability entailed by this assumption by delaying the reward signal for a limited time period. We consider two types of attack goals: targeted attacks, which aim to cause a target policy to be learned, and untargeted attacks, which simply aim to induce a policy with a low reward. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed attacks through a series of experiments. Our first observation is that reward-delay attacks are extremely effective when the goal is simply to minimize reward. Indeed, we find that even naive baseline reward-delay attacks are also highly successful in minimizing the reward. Targeted attacks, on the other hand, are more challenging, although we nevertheless demonstrate that the proposed approaches remain highly effective at achieving the attacker\u2019s targets. In addition, we introduce a second threat model that captures a minimal mitigation that ensures that rewards cannot be used out of sequence. We find that this mitigation remains insufficient to ensure robustness to attacks that delay, but preserve the order, of rewards."}}

In addition to the existing Cox proportional hazards model, deep learning models have recently been proposed in survival prediction, which directly integrates multi-omics data of a large number of genes using the fully connected dense deep neural network layers, which are hard to interpret. On the other hand, cancer signaling pathways are important and interpretable concepts that define the signaling cascades regulating cancer development and drug resistance. Thus, it is important to investigate potential associations between patient survival and individual signaling pathways, which can help domain experts to understand deep learning models making specific predictions. Results In this exploratory study, we proposed to investigate the relevance and influence of a set of core cancer signaling pathways in the survival analysis of cancer patients. Specifically, we built a simplified and partially biologically meaningful deep neural network, DeepSigSurvNet, for survival prediction. In the model, the gene expression and copy number data of 1967 genes from 46 major signaling pathways were integrated in the model. We applied the model to four types of cancer and investigated the influence of the 46 signaling pathways in the cancers. Interestingly, the interpretable analysis identified the distinct patterns of these signaling pathways, which are helpful in understanding the relevance of signaling pathways in terms of their application to the prediction of cancer patients\u2019 survival time. These highly relevant signaling pathways, when combined with other essential signaling pathways inhibitors, can be novel targets for drug and drug combination prediction to improve cancer patients\u2019 survival time. Conclusion The proposed DeepSigSurvNet model can facilitate the understanding of the implications of signaling pathways on cancer patients\u2019 survival by integrating multi-omics data and clinical factors."}}

Current clinical mortality prediction scores are calculated using a few static variable measurements, such as gestational age, birth weight, temperature, and blood pressure at admission. While these models do provide some insight, numerical and time-series vital sign data are also available for preterm babies admitted to the NICU and may provide greater insight into outcomes. Computational models that predict the mortality risk of preterm birth in the NICU by integrating vital sign data and static clinical variables in real time may be clinically helpful and potentially superior to static prediction models. However, there is a lack of established computational models for this specific task. In this study, we developed a novel deep learning model, DeepPBSMonitor (Deep Preterm Birth Survival Risk Monitor), to predict the mortality risk of preterm infants during initial NICU hospitalization. The proposed deep learning model can effectively integrate time-series vital sign data and fixed variables while resolving the influence of noise and imbalanced data. The proposed model was evaluated and compared with other approaches using data from 285 infants. Results showed that the DeepPBSMonitor model outperforms other approaches, with an accuracy, recall, and AUC score of 0.888, 0.780, and 0.897, respectively. In conclusion, the proposed model has demonstrated efficacy in predicting the real-time mortality risk of preterm infants in initial NICU hospitalization."}}
