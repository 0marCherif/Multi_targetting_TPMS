Typically, the multiband transmitter (Tx) has no prior information about different channel characteristics including their payoffs (achievable data rate) and energy consumption outcome. Practically, Tx has to choose the best reward arm/band with the lowest energy consumption to prolong its limited battery capacity. Hence, we envision a lightweight cost-aware multi-armed bandit (CA-MAB) as a proper realistic solution to the cumbersome and slowly convergent ordinary band assignment methods, where the transmitter/player intends not only to maximize his cumulative payoff (achievable data rate) but also to mitigate his cost (battery consumption due to the utilized band). Therefore, we propose a dual objective MAB scheme to manage such problem intelligently. Numerical simulations indicate that proposed method outperforms naive MAB versions, including Thompson sampling (TS), Upper Confidence bound (UCB), and traditional hybrid band selection (HBA) approaches, correspondingly. Especially, our proposed algorithm delivers 99% of the optimal performance concerning energy consumption, achievable data rate, and convergence speed."}}

Herein, RIS-user association should be considered to maximize the users\u2019 achievable data rate while assuring load balance among the installed RIS panels. However, maximum received power (MRP) based RIS-user association will overload some of the RIS boards while keeping others unloaded, which causes RIS load to unbalance and decreases the users\u2019 achievable data rate. Instead, in this paper, an online learning methodology using centralized multi-player multi-armed bandit (MP-MAB) with arms\u2019 load balancing is proposed. In this formulation, mmWave users, RIS boards, and achievable users\u2019 rates act as the bandit game players, arms, and rewards. During the MAB game, the users learn how to avoid associating with the heavily loaded RIS boards, maximizing their achievable data rates, and balancing the RIS loads. Three centralized MP-MAB algorithms with arms\u2019 load balancing are proposed from the family of upper confidence bound (UCB) MAB algorithms. These algorithms are UCB1, Kullback-Leibler divergence UCB (KLUCB), and Minimax optimal stochastic strategy (MOSS) with arms\u2019 load balancing, i.e., UCB1-LB, KLUCB-LB, and MOSS-LB. Numerical analysis ensures the superior performance of the proposed algorithms over MRP-based RIS-user association and other benchmarks."}}

Our algorithm consists of two phases: first construct a decision diagram $(V,E)$ that somehow represents a given $m \\times n$ constraint matrix, and then build an equivalent set of $|E|$ linear constraints over $n+|V|$ variables. That is, the size of the resultant extended formulation depends not explicitly on the number $m$ of the original constraints, but on its decision diagram representation. Therefore, we may significantly reduce the computation time for optimization problems with integer constraint matrices by solving them under the extended formulations, especially when we obtain concise decision diagram representations for the matrices. We can apply our method to $1$-norm regularized hard margin optimization over the binary instance space $\\{0,1\\}^n$, which can be formulated as a linear programming problem with $m$ constraints with $\\{-1,0,1\\}$-valued coefficients over $n$ variables, where $m$ is the size of the given sample. Furthermore, introducing slack variables over the edges of the decision diagram, we establish a variant formulation of soft margin optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our extended formulations for integer programming and the $1$-norm regularized soft margin optimization tasks over synthetic and real datasets."}}

While the emerging D2D nodes can support heterogeneous frequency bands [radio frequency (RF) including 2.4 GHz/5 GHz wireless local area network (WLAN), 38-GHz millimeter wave (mmWave), and visible light communication (VLC)], the physical constraints (e.g., blocking) require the user devices to dynamically switch between the bands in order to avoid the loss of connectivity and throughput degradation. In this article, we investigate an effective online link selection in hybrid RF-VLC scenarios for direct user data handling. First, we model the multiband selection issue as a multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem. The source/relay node acts as a player who gambles to maximize its long-term feedback/reward via selecting suitable arms, i.e., available bands (WLAN, mmWave, or VLC). Then, we propose an online, energy-aware band selection (EABS) methodology by leveraging three theoretically guaranteed MAB techniques [upper confidence bound (UCB), Thompson sampling (TS), and minimax optimal stochastic strategy (MOSS)] to derive optimal band selection policies. Based on these adopted policies, we propose three algorithms, namely, EABS-UCB, EABS-TS, and EABS-MOSS, to implement the EABS strategy, respectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate our proposed algorithms\u2019 superior performance compared to the traditional link selection schemes regarding energy efficiency, average throughput, and convergence rate. In particular, EABS-MOSS emerges as the best algorithm as it exhibits near-optimal performance due to its flexibility to both stochastic and adversarial environments."}}
