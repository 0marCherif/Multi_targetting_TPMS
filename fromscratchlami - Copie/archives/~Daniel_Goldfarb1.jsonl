In this work, we provide an initial theoretical analysis of its effect on catastrophic forgetting in a continual learning setup. We show experimentally that in Permuted MNIST image classi- fication tasks, the generalization performance of multilayer perceptrons trained by vanilla stochastic gradient descent can be improved by overparameterization, and the extent of the performance increase achieved by overparameterization is comparable to that of state-of-the-art continual learning algorithms. We provide a theoretical explanation of this effect by studying a qualitatively similar two-task linear regression problem, where each task is related by a random orthogonal transformation. We show that when a model is trained on the two tasks in sequence without any additional regularization, the risk gain on the first task is small if the model is sufficiently overparameterized."}}

We present a method for inferring causal direction between continuous variables by using an MDL Binning technique for data discretization and complexity calculation. Our method captures the shape of the data and uses it to determine which variable has more information about the other. Its high predictive performance and robustness is shown on several real world use cases."}}

This research investigates non-cognitive factors in mobile learning in a resource-poor context. We surveyed 1,000 Kenyan high school students who use a popular SMS-based learning platform that provides formative assessments aligned with the national curriculum. Combining survey responses with platform interaction logs, we find growth mindset to be one of the strongest predictors of assessment scores. We investigate theory-based behavioral mechanisms to explain this relationship. Although students who hold a growth mindset are not more likely to persist after facing adversity, they spend more time on each assessment, increasing their likelihood of answering correctly. Results suggest that cultivating a growth mindset can motivate students in a resource-poor context to excel in a mobile learning environment."}}

They are trained using a gradient descent back propagation technique which trains weights in each layer for the sole goal of minimizing training error. Hence, the resulting weights cannot be directly explained. Using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) we can get an insight on how the neural network is thinking, specifically by analyzing the activation values of validation images as they pass through each layer."}}

I will use official game data from the North-American National Hockey League (NHL) 2013-2014 season to discover the correlation between the composition of NHL teams with the currently preferred offensive performance markers. Specifically, I develop and use the program TeamPlex (based on the JavaPlex software library) to generate the persistence bar-codes. TeamPlex is applied to players as data points in a multidimensional (up to 12-D) data space where each coordinate corresponds to a selected performance marker. The conclusion is that team's offensive performance (measured by the popular characteristic used in NHL called the Corsi number) correlates with two bar-code characteristics: greater \\textit{sparsity} reflected in the longer bars in dimension 0 and lower \\textit{tunneling} reflected in the low number/length of the 1-dimensional classes. The methodology can be used by team managers in identifying deficiencies in the present composition of the team and analyzing player trades and acquisitions. We give an example of a proposed trade which should improve the Corsi number of the team."}}
