The reward signal from a poor discriminator can be very sparse and unstable, which may lead the generator to fall into a local optimum or to produce nonsense replies. To alleviate the first problem, we first extend a recently proposed adversarial dialogue generation method to an adversarial imitation learning solution. Then, in the framework of adversarial inverse reinforcement learning, we propose a new reward model for dialogue generation that can provide a more accurate and precise reward signal for generator training. We evaluate the performance of the resulting model with automatic metrics and human evaluations in two annotation settings. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate more high-quality responses and achieve higher overall performance than the state-of-the-art."}}

However, there are many cases where a user may not click on any search result page (SERP) but still be satisfied. This scenario is referred to as good abandonment and presents a challenge for most approaches measuring search satisfaction, which are usually based on clicks and dwell time. The problem is exacerbated further on mobile devices where search providers try to increase the likelihood of users being satisfied directly by the SERP. This paper proposes a solution to this problem using gesture interactions, such as reading times and touch actions, as signals for differentiating between good and bad abandonment. These signals go beyond clicks and characterize user behavior in cases where clicks are not needed to achieve satisfaction. We study different good abandonment scenarios and investigate the different elements on a SERP that may lead to good abandonment. We also present an analysis of the correlation between user gesture features and satisfaction. Finally, we use this analysis to build models to automatically identify good abandonment in mobile search achieving an accuracy of 75%, which is significantly better than considering query and session signals alone. Our findings have implications for the study and application of user satisfaction in search systems."}}

Many different types of answers exist, such as weather, flight and currency answers. Understanding the effect that these different answer types have on mobile user behavior and how they contribute to satisfaction is important for search engine evaluation. We study these two aspects by analyzing the logs of a commercial search engine and through a user study. Our results show that user click, abandonment and engagement behavior differs depending on the answer types present on a page. Furthermore, we find that satisfaction rates differ in the presence of different answer types with simple answer types, such as time zone answers, leading to more satisfaction than more complex answers, such as news answers. Our findings have implications for the study and application of user satisfaction for search systems."}}

They significantly change the way users interact with search systems, not only because of the voice control use and touch gestures, but also due to the dialogue-style nature of the interactions and their ability to preserve context across different queries. Predicting success and failure of such search dialogues is a new problem, and an important one for evaluating and further improving intelligent assistants. While clicks in web search have been extensively used to infer user satisfaction, their significance in search dialogues is lower due to the partial replacement of clicks with voice control, direct and voice answers, and touch gestures. In this paper, we propose an automatic method to predict user satisfaction with intelligent assistants that exploits all the interaction signals, including voice commands and physical touch gestures on the device. First, we conduct an extensive user study to measure user satisfaction with intelligent assistants, and simultaneously record all user interactions. Second, we show that the dialogue style of interaction makes it necessary to evaluate the user experience at the overall task level as opposed to the query level. Third, we train a model to predict user satisfaction, and find that interaction signals that capture the user reading patterns have a high impact: when including all available interaction signals, we are able to improve the prediction accuracy of user satisfaction from 71% to 81% over a baseline that utilizes only click and query features."}}

To address these issues, the TREC Contextual Suggestion Track explored an open test collection, where participants were allowed to submit any web page as a result for a personalized venue recommendation task. This prompts the question on the reusability of the resulting test collection: How does the open nature affect the pooling process? Can participants reliably evaluate variant runs with the resulting qrels? Can other teams evaluate new runs reliably? In short, does the set of pooled and judged documents effectively produce a post hoc test collection? Our main findings are the following: First, while there is a strongly significant rank correlation, the effect of pooling is notable and results in underestimation of performance, implying the evaluation of non-pooled systems should be done with great care. Second, we extensively analyze impacts of open corpus on the fraction of judged documents, explaining how low recall affects the reusability, and how the personalization and low pooling depth aggravate that problem. Third, we outline a potential solution by deriving a fixed corpus from open web submissions."}}

However, sorting purely by the attribute value might lead to poor user experience because the relevance is not taken into account. Hence, at the top of the list the users might see irrelevant results. In this paper we choose a different approach. Rather than just returning the entire list of results sorted by the attribute value, additionally we suggest doing the relevance-aware search results (post-) filtering. Following this approach, we develop a new algorithm based on the dynamic programming that directly optimizes a given search quality metric. It can be seamlessly integrated as the final step of a query processing pipeline and provides a theoretical guarantee on optimality. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our algorithm on synthetic data and real learning to rank data sets. Based on the experimental results, we conclude that the proposed algorithm is superior to typically used heuristics and has a clear practical value for the search and related applications."}}

New recommendation algorithms are often evaluated by offline comparison to baseline algorithms such as recommending random or the most popular items. Here, we investigate how these algorithms themselves perform and compare to the operational production system in large scale online experiments in a real-world application. Specifically, we focus on recommending travel destinations at Booking.com, a major online travel site, to users searching for their preferred vacation activities. To build ranking models we use multi-criteria rating data provided by previous users after their stay at a destination. We implement three methods and compare them to the current baseline in Booking.com: random, most popular, and Naive Bayes. Our general conclusion is that, in an online A/B test with live users, our Naive-Bayes based ranker increased user engagement significantly over the current online system."}}
