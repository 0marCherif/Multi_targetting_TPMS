A common and successful approach for tackling this unsupervised learning problem is minimizing the InfoNCE loss associated with the training samples, where each sample is associated with their augmentations (positive samples such as rotation, crop) and a batch of negative samples (unrelated samples). To the best of our knowledge, it was unanswered if the representation learned by minimizing the InfoNCE loss preserves the underlying data clusters, as it only promotes learning a representation that is faithful to augmentations, i.e., an image and its augmentations have the same representation. Our main result is to show that the representation learned by InfoNCE with a finite number of negative samples is also consistent with respect to clusters in the data, under the condition that the augmentation sets within clusters may be non-overlapping but are close and intertwined, relative to the complexity of the learning function class."}}

Typical approaches to FL aim to learn a single model that simultaneously performs well for all clients. But such an approach may be ineffective when the clients' data distributions are heterogeneous. In these cases, we aim to learn personalized models for each client's data yet still leverage shared information across clients. A critical avenue that may allow for such personalization is the presence of client-specific side information available to each client, such as client embeddings obtained from domain-specific knowledge, pre-trained models, or simply one-hot encodings. In this work, we propose a new FL framework for utilizing a general form of client-specific side information for personalized federated learning. We prove that incorporating side information can improve model performance for simplified multi-task linear regression and matrix completion problems. Further, we validate these results with image classification experiments on Omniglot, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, revealing that proper use of side information can be beneficial for personalization."}}

However, the mechanics of GBML have remained largely mysterious from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we prove that two well-known GBML methods, MAML and ANIL, as well as their first-order approximations, are capable of learning common representation among a set of given tasks. Specifically, in the well-known multi-task linear representation learning setting, they are able to recover the ground-truth representation at an exponentially fast rate. Moreover, our analysis illuminates that the driving force causing MAML and ANIL to recover the underlying representation is that they adapt the final layer of their model, which harnesses the underlying task diversity to improve the representation in all directions of interest. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results to show that MAML and/or ANIL learn expressive representations and to rigorously explain why they do so."}}

However, the MAML objective is significantly more difficult to optimize compared to standard non-adaptive learning (NAL), and little is understood about how much MAML improves over NAL in terms of the fast adaptability of their solutions in various scenarios. We analytically address this issue in a linear regression setting consisting of a mixture of easy and hard tasks, where hardness is related to the rate that gradient descent converges on the task. Specifically, we prove that in order for MAML to achieve substantial gain over NAL, (i) there must be some discrepancy in hardness among the tasks, and (ii) the optimal solutions of the hard tasks must be closely packed with the center far from the center of the easy tasks optimal solutions. We also give numerical and analytical results suggesting that these insights apply to two-layer neural networks. Finally, we provide few-shot image classification experiments that support our insights for when MAML should be used and emphasize the importance of training MAML on hard tasks in practice."}}

However, the fruits of representation learning have yet to be fully-realized in federated settings. Although data in federated settings is often non-i.i.d. across clients, the success of centralized deep learning suggests that data often shares a global feature representation, while the statistical heterogeneity across clients or tasks is concentrated in the labels. Based on this intuition, we propose a novel federated learning framework and algorithm for learning a shared data representation across clients and unique local heads for each client. Our algorithm harnesses the distributed computational power across clients to perform many local-updates with respect to the low-dimensional local parameters for every update of the representation. We prove that this method obtains linear convergence to the ground-truth representation with near-optimal sample complexity in a linear setting, demonstrating that it can efficiently reduce the problem dimension for each client. This result is of interest beyond federated learning to a broad class of problems in which we aim to learn a shared low-dimensional representation among data distributions, for example in meta-learning and multi-task learning. Further, extensive experimental results show the empirical improvement of our method over alternative personalized federated learning approaches in federated environments with heterogeneous data."}}
