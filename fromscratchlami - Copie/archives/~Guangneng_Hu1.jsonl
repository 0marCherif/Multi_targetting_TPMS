System-sided initiative would be necessary to identify certain situations and appropriately interact with users to resolve them. However, most existing task-oriented dialogue systems fail to consider such mixed-initiative interaction strategies, performing low efficiency and poor collaboration ability in human-computer conversation. In this paper, we construct a multi-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset with mixed-initiative strategies TITAN1 from the large-scale dialogue corpus Multi- WOZ 2.1. It contains a total of 1,800 human-human conversations where the system can either ask clarification questions actively or provides relevant information to address failure situations and implicit user requests. We report the results of several baseline models on system response generation and dialogue act prediction to assess the performance of SOTA methods on TITAN. These models can capture mixed-initiative dialogue acts, while remaining the deficiency to actively generate implicit requests and accurately provide alternative information, suggesting ample room for improvement in future studies."}}

It works by learning user preferences on items from their historical interactions. Recent deep learning techniques bring in advancements of recommender models with the ability of learning representations of users and items from the interaction data. In real-world scenarios, however, interactions may well be sparse in a target domain of interest, and thus it hurts the huge success of deep models which are depending on large-scale labeled data. Transfer learning is studied to address the data sparsity by transferring the knowledge from auxiliary source domains. There is a privacy concern when the source domain shares their data with the target domain. This issue gets worse by the ever-increasing abuses of personal data and it is inevitable due to the enforcement of data protection regulations. Existing research work focuses on improving the recommendation performance while ignores the privacy leakage issue. In this thesis, we investigate deep knowledge transfer in recommendation, of that the core idea is to answer what to transfer between domains. Specifically, we propose three models in different transfer learning approaches, i.e., deep model-based transfer (DMT), deep instance-based transfer (DIT), and deep feature-based transfer (DFT). Firstly, in DMT, we transfer parameters in lower layers and learn source and target networks in a multi-task way. The CoNet model is introduced to learn dual knowledge transfer across domains and is capable of selecting knowledge to transfer via the sparsity-induced regularization technique enforced on the transfer matrix. Secondly, in DIT, we transfer certain parts of instances in the source domain by adaptively re-weighting them to be used in the target domain. The TransNet model is introduced to learn an adaptive transfer vector to capture relations between the target item and source items. Next, in DFT, we transfer a \u201cgood\u201d feature representation that captures the invariant while reduces the difference between domains. The TrNews model is introduced to transfer heterogeneous user interests across domains and transfer item representations selectively. The proposed transfer models can be used for modeling both relational data (e.g., clicks), content data (e.g., news), and their combinations (hybrid data). Finally, we investigate the adversarial knowledge transfer in recommendation to protect the private attributes in the source domain. Specifically, we propose the PrivNet model which improves the target performance as well as protects the source privacy, of that the core is to learn a privacy-aware neural representation. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we validate the research on adversarial knowledge transfer. This thesis will also describe the research frontier and point out promising future work for investigation.\n"}}

Social relations among users provide friends\u2019 information for modeling users\u2019 interest in candidate items and help items expose to potential consumers (i.e., item attraction). However, there are two issues haven\u2019t been well-studied: Firstly, for the user interests, existing methods typically aggregate friends\u2019 information contextualized on the candidate item only, and this shallow context-aware aggregation makes them suffer from the limited friends\u2019 information. Secondly, for the item attraction, if the item\u2019s past consumers are the friends of or have a similar consumption habit to the targeted user, the item may be more attractive to the targeted user, but most existing methods neglect the relation enhanced context-aware item attraction. To address the above issues, we proposed DICER (Dual sIde deepContext-awarEmodulation for socialRecommendation). Specifically, we first proposed a novel graph neural network to model the social relation and collaborative relation, and on top of high-order relations, a dual side deep context-aware modulation is introduced to capture the friends\u2019 information and item attraction. Empirical results on two real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed model and further experiments are conducted to help understand how the dual context-aware modulation works."}}

For example, an attacker can accurately infer user demographics from their historical purchase provided by a source domain data owner. This paper addresses the above privacy-preserving issue by learning a privacy-aware neural representation by improving target performance while protecting source privacy. The key idea is to simulate the attacks during the training for protecting unseen users\u2019 privacy in the future, modeled by an adversarial game, so that the transfer learning model becomes robust to attacks.

We develop a Personalized Neural Embedding (PNE) framework to exploit both interactions and words seamlessly. We learn such embeddings of users, items, and words jointly, and predict user preferences on items based on these learned representations. PNE estimates the probability that a user will like an item by two terms\u2014behavior factors and semantic factors.

CF exploits user-item behavior interactions (e.g., clicks) only and hence suffers from the data sparsity issue. One research thread is to integrate auxiliary information such as product reviews and news titles, leading to hybrid filtering methods. Another thread is to transfer knowledge from source domains such as improving the movie recommendation with the knowledge from the book domain, leading to transfer learning methods. In real-world applications, a user registers for multiple services across websites. Thus it motivates us to exploit both auxiliary and source information for recommendation in this paper. To achieve this, we propose a Transfer Meeting Hybrid (TMH) model for cross-domain recommendation with unstructured text. The proposed TMH model attentively extracts useful content from unstructured text via a memory network and selectively transfers knowledge from a source domain via a transfer network. On two real-world datasets, TMH shows better performance in terms of three ranking metrics by comparing with various baselines. We conduct thorough analyses to understand how the text content and transferred knowledge help the proposed model."}}

Transfer learning is a class of algorithms underlying these techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach for cross-domain recommendation by using neural networks as the base model. In contrast to the matrix factorization based cross-domain techniques, our method is deep transfer learning, which can learn complex user-item interaction relationships. We assume that hidden layers in two base networks are connected by cross mappings, leading to the collaborative cross networks (CoNet). CoNet enables dual knowledge transfer across domains by introducing cross connections from one base network to another and vice versa. CoNet is achieved in multi-layer feedforward networks by adding dual connections and joint loss functions, which can be trained efficiently by back-propagation. The proposed model is thoroughly evaluated on two large real-world datasets. It outperforms baselines by relative improvements of 7.84% in NDCG. We demonstrate the necessity of adaptively selecting representations to transfer. Our model can reduce tens of thousands training examples comparing with non-transfer methods and still has the competitive performance with them."}}
