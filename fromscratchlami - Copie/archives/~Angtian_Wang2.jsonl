However, in this work we find the regression-based methods lack robustness under out-of-distribution, i.e. partial occlusion, due to its heavy dependence on the quality of prediction of 2D keypoints which are sensitive to partial occlusions. Inspired by the neural mesh models for object pose estimation, i.e. meshes combined with neural features, we introduce a human pose optimization approach via render-and-compare neural features. On the other hand, the volume rendering technical demonstrate better representation with accurate gradients for reasoning occlusions. In this work, we develop a volumetric human representation and a robust inference pipeline via volume rendering with gradient-based optimizations, which synthesize neural features during inference while gradually updating the human pose via maximizing the feature similarities. Experiments on 3DPW show ours better robustness to partial occlusion with competitive performance on unoccluded cases. "}}

Our approach represents an object category as a cuboid mesh and learns a generative model of the neural feature activations at each mesh vertex to perform pose estimation through differentiable rendering. A common problem of rendering-based approaches is that they rely on bounding box proposals, which do not convey information about the 3D rotation of the object and are not reliable when objects are partially occluded. Instead, we introduce a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy that utilizes the rendering process to estimate a sparse set of 6D object proposals, which are subsequently refined with gradient-based optimization. The key to enabling the convergence of our approach is a neural feature representation that is trained to be scale- and rotation-invariant using contrastive learning. Our experiments demonstrate an enhanced category-level 6D pose estimation performance compared to prior work, particularly under strong partial occlusion."}}

Our model is trained in an EM-type manner alternating between increasing the 3D pose invariance of the feature extractor and annotating unlabelled data through neural view synthesis and matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised learning framework for 3D pose estimation on the PASCAL3D+ and KITTI datasets.

In this work, we show that black-box deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have only limited robustness to partial occlusion. We overcome these limitations by unifying DCNNs with part-based models into Compositional Convolutional Neural Networks (CompositionalNets)\u2014an interpretable deep architecture with innate robustness to partial occlusion. Specifically, we propose to replace the fully connected classification head of DCNNs with a differentiable compositional model that can be trained end-to-end. The structure of the compositional model enables CompositionalNets to decompose images into objects and context, as well as to further decompose object representations in terms of individual parts and the objects\u2019 pose. The generative nature of our compositional model enables it to localize occluders and to recognize objects based on their non-occluded parts. We conduct extensive experiments in terms of image classification and object detection on images of artificially occluded objects from the PASCAL3D+ and ImageNet dataset, and real images of partially occluded vehicles from the MS-COCO dataset. Our experiments show that CompositionalNets made from several popular DCNN backbones (VGG-16, ResNet50, ResNext) improve by a large margin over their non-compositional counterparts at classifying and detecting partially occluded objects. Furthermore, they can localize occluders accurately despite being trained with class-level supervision only. Finally, we demonstrate that CompositionalNets provide human interpretable predictions as their individual components can be understood as detecting parts and estimating an objects\u2019 viewpoint."}}

In this work, we show that standard deep learning approaches to 3D pose estimation are not robust to partial occlusion. Inspired by the robustness of generative vision models to partial occlusion, we propose to integrate deep neural networks with 3D generative representations of objects into a unified neural architecture that we term NeMo. In particular, NeMo learns a generative model of neural feature activations at each vertex on a dense 3D mesh. Using differentiable rendering we estimate the 3D object pose by minimizing the reconstruction error between NeMo and the feature representation of the target image. To avoid local optima in the reconstruction loss, we train the feature extractor to maximize the distance between the individual feature representations on the mesh using contrastive learning. Our extensive experiments on PASCAL3D+, occluded-PASCAL3D+ and ObjectNet3D show that NeMo is much more robust to partial occlusion compared to standard deep networks, while retaining competitive performance on non-occluded data. Interestingly, our experiments also show that NeMo performs reasonably well even when the mesh representation only crudely approximates the true object geometry with a cuboid, hence revealing that the detailed 3D geometry is not needed for accurate 3D pose estimation."}}
