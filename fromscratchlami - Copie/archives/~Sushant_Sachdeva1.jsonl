Short of storing all effective resistances, previous best approaches could achieve \u00d5(n\u03b5-2) size and \u00d5 (\u03b5-2) time per query by storing Johnson-Lindenstrauss vectors for each vertex, or \u00d5 (n\u03b5-1) size and \u00d5 (n\u03b5-1) time per query by storing a spectral sketch. Our construction is based on two key ideas: 1) \u03b5-1-sparse, \u03b5-additive approximations to \u03c3u for all u, vectors similar to DL+ 1u, can be used to recover (1 + \u03b5)-approximations to the effective resistances, 2) In expander graphs, only \u00d5(\u03b5-1) coordinates of \u03c3u are larger than \u03b5. We give an efficient construction for such a data structure in \u00d5(m + n\u03b5-2) time via random walks. This results in an algorithm on expander graphs for computing (1 + \u03b5)-approximate effective resistances for s vertex pairs that runs in \u00d5 (m + n\u03b5-2 + s) time, improving over the previously best known running time of m1+o(1) + (n + s)no(1) \u03b5-1.5 for s = \u03c9(n\u03b5-0.5). We employ the above algorithm to compute a (1 + \u03b4)-approximation to the number of spanning trees in an expander graph, or equivalently, approximating the (pseudo)determinant of its Laplacian in \u00d5(m + n1.5\u03b4-1) time. This improves on the previously best known result of m1+o(1) + n1.875+o(1)\u03b4-1.75 time, and matches the best known size of determinant sparsifiers. * This research is supported by an NSERC Discovery grant awarded to Sushant Sachdeva."}}

Existing oblivious routing schemes with polylogarithmic competitive ratio for general networks are tree-based, in the sense that routing is performed according to a convex combination of trees. However, this restriction to trees leads to a construction that has time quadratic in the size of the network and does not parallelize well.   In this paper we study oblivious routing schemes based on electrical routing. In particular, we show that general networks with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges admit a routing scheme that has competitive ratio $O(\\log^2 n)$ and consists of a convex combination of only $O(\\sqrt{m})$ electrical routings. This immediately leads to an improved construction algorithm with time $\\tilde{O}(m^{3/2})$ that can also be implemented in parallel with $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{m})$ depth."}}

Intuitively, $\\Omega(n^{1.5})$ is a natural runtime barrier for IPM-based methods, since they require $\\sqrt{n}$ iterations, each routing a possibly-dense electrical flow. To break this barrier, we develop a new implicit representation for flows based on generalized nested-dissection [Lipton-Rose-Tarjan, JSTOR'79] and approximate Schur complements [Kyng-Sachdeva, FOCS'16]. This implicit representation permits us to design a data structure to route an electrical flow with sparse demands in roughly $\\sqrt{n}$ update time, resulting in a total running time of $O(n\\cdot\\text{poly}(\\log n))$.

We provide the first $p^{\\textrm{th}}$-order method that achieves a rate of $O(\\epsilon^{-2/(p+1)}).$ Our method does not rely on a line search routine, thereby improving upon previous rates by a logarithmic factor. Building on the Mirror Prox method of Nemirovski (2004), our algorithm works even in the constrained, non-Euclidean setting. Furthermore, we prove the optimality of our algorithm by constructing matching lower bounds. These are the first lower bounds for smooth MVIs beyond convex optimization for $p > 1$. This establishes a separation between solving smooth MVIs and smooth convex optimization, and settles the oracle complexity of solving $p^{\\textrm{th}}$-order smooth MVIs."}}
