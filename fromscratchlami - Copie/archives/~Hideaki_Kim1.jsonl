Recent works have focused on optimizing task allocation and workers' wages, simultaneously. However, existing methods do not provide good solutions for real-world crowd-sourcing platforms due to the low approximation ratio or myopic problem settings. We tackle an optimization problem for wage determination and online task allocation in crowd-sourcing and propose a fast 1-1/(k+3)^(1/2)-approximation algorithm, where k is the minimum of tasks' budgets (numbers of possible assignments). This approximation ratio is greater than or equal to the existing method. The proposed method reduces the tackled problem to a non-convex multi-period continuous optimization problem by approximating the objective function. Then, the method transforms the reduced problem into a minimum convex cost flow problem, which is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem, and solves it by the capacity scaling algorithm. Synthetic experiments and simulation experiments using real crowd-sourcing data show that the proposed method solves the problem faster and outputs higher objective values than existing methods."}}

Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference of unobserved variables under given observations is one of the essential operations in CGM. Because the MAP inference problem is known to be NP-hard in general, the current mainstream approach is to solve an alternative problem obtained by approximating the objective function and applying continuous relaxation. However, this approach has two significant drawbacks. First, the quality of the solution deteriorates when the values in the count data are negligible due to the inaccuracy of Stirling\u2019s approximation. Second, the application of continuous relaxation causes the violation of integrality constraints. This paper proposes novel algorithms for MAP inference in CGMs on path graphs to overcome these problems. Our method is based on the discrete difference of convex algorithm (DCA); DCA is a general framework to minimize the sum of a convex function and a concave function by repeatedly minimizing surrogate functions. Utilizing the particular structure of path graphs, we efficiently solve the surrogate function minimization by minimum convex cost flow algorithms. Furthermore, our approach also leads to a new method of solving another important task; MAP inference of the sample size in CGM on path graphs. Our method is naturally applicable to this task, allowing us to design very efficient algorithms. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."}}

In most online matching problems, the rewards and node arrival probabilities are given in advance and are not controllable. However, many real-world matching services require them to be controllable and the decision-maker faces a non-trivial problem of optimizing them. In this study, we formulate a new optimization problem, Online Matching with Controllable Rewards and Arrival probabilities (OM-CRA), to simultaneously determine not only the matching strategy but also the rewards and arrival probabilities. Even though our problem is more complex than the existing ones, we propose a fast 1/2-approximation algorithm for OM-CRA. The proposed approach transforms OM-CRA to a saddle-point problem by approximating the objective function, and then solves it by the Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) method with acceleration through the use of the problem structure. In simulations on real data from crowdsourcing and ride-sharing platforms, we show that the proposed algorithm can find solutions with high total rewards in practical times."}}
