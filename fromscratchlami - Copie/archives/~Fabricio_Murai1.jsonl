The convenience of forming interest-based groups and seamlessly sharing content has rendered WhatsApp susceptible to the exploitation of misinformation campaigns. While the process of fact-checking remains a potent tool in identifying fabricated news, its efficacy falters in the face of the unprecedented deluge of information generated on the Internet today. In this work, we explore automatic ranking-based strategies to propose a \"fakeness score\" model as a means to help fact-checking agencies identify fake news stories shared through images on WhatsApp. Based on the results, we design a tool and integrate it into a real system that has been used extensively for monitoring content during the 2018 Brazilian general election. Our experimental evaluation shows that this tool can reduce by up to 40% the amount of effort required to identify 80% of the fake news in the data when compared to current mechanisms practiced by the fact-checking agencies for the selection of news stories to be checked."}}

In this context, there is a large number of works that propose solutions for identifying this type of content in these environments. Most efforts to automatically detect hate speech follow the same process of supervised learning, using annotators to label a predefined set of messages, which are, in turn, used to train classifiers. However, annotators can create labels for different classification tasks, with divergent definitions of hate speech, binary or multi-label schemes, and various methodologies for collecting data. In this context, we examine the principal publicly available datasets for hate speech research. We investigate the types of hate speech (e.g., ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation) present in their composition, explore their content beyond the labels, and use cross-dataset classification to examine the use of the labeled data beyond its original work. Our results reveal interesting insights toward a better understanding of the hate speech phenomenon and improving its detection on social platforms. Warning. This paper contains offensive words and tweet examples."}}

As a result, the absence of information about the dynamics in these node representations can harm the accuracy and increase processing time of machine learning tasks related to these applications. We propose a biased random walk method named Evolving Node Embedding (EVNE), which leverages the sequential relationship of graph snapshots by incorporating historic information when generating embeddings for the next snapshot. EVNE\u00a0 learns node representations through a neural network, but differs from existing methods as it: (i) incorporates previously run walks at each step; (ii) starts the optimization of the current embedding from the parameters obtained in the previous iteration; and (iii) uses two time-varying parameters to regulate the behavior of the biased random walks over the process of graph exploration. Through a wide set of experiments we show that our approach generates better embeddings, outperforming baselines in a downstream node classification task."}}

In response, Twitter announced the suspension of thousands of user accounts allegedly involved in such actions. Motivated by these events, we here propose a novel network-based approach to uncover evidence of coordination in a set of user interactions. Our approach is designed to address the challenges incurred by the often sheer volume of noisy edges in the network (i.e., edges that are unrelated to coordination) and the effects of data sampling. To that end, it exploits the joint use of two network backbone extraction techniques, namely Disparity Filter and Neighborhood Overlap, to reveal strongly tied groups of users (here referred to as communities) exhibiting repeatedly common behavior, consistent with coordination. We employ our strategy to a large dataset of tweets related to the aforementioned fraud claims, in which users were labeled as suspended, deleted or active, according to their accounts status after the election. Our findings reveal well-structured communities, with strong evidence of coordination to promote (i.e., retweet) the aforementioned fraud claims. Moreover, many of those communities are formed not only by suspended and deleted users, but also by users who, despite exhibiting very similar sharing patterns, remained active in the platform. This observation suggests that a significant number of users who were potentially involved in the coordination efforts went unnoticed by the platform, and possibly remained actively spreading this content on the system."}}

As a result, a number of works have examined this phenomenon from a variety of perspectives. However, none of them focus on analyzing topics behind the general fraud claims and associating them with user communities. To fill this gap, we propose to uncover and characterize groups of Twitter users engaging in discussions about election fraud claims during the 2020 U.S. election using a large dataset that spans seven weeks during this period. To accomplish this, we model a sequence of co-retweet networks and employ a backbone extraction method that controls for inherent traits of social media applications, particularly, user activity levels and the popularity of tweets (which together generate many spurious edges in the network), thus allowing us to reveal topics of tweets that lead users to retweet them. After extracting the backbones, we identify user groups representative of the communities present in the network backbones and finally analyze the topics behind the retweeted tweets to understand how they contributed to the spread of fraud claims at that time. Our main results show that (i) our approach uncovers better-structured communities than the original network in terms of users spreading discussions about fraud; and (ii) these users discuss 25 topics with specific psycholinguistic and temporal characteristics."}}

This difference in behavior was intensified by the large amount of misinformation shared across social media. This work presents an analysis aimed at understanding the extent to which people perceived risk at different levels, and at uncovering the relationship between these differences and the spread of misinformation. In particular, we focus on Brazil, because it is well-known that its Ministry of Health has sponsored campaigns that raised suspicious regarding the effectiveness of the vaccines. To achieve this goal, we gathered tweets written in Portuguese related to the COVID-19 and analyzed their psycholinguistic traits. Among those traits, we found \u2018Anxiety\u2019 to be a good proxy for risk perception. We validate this choice by showing that, at moments of high (resp. low) infection rates in the world, the Anxiety score was higher (resp. lower). We grouped users into \u201clow\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d risk perception based on the users' anxiety score, and analyzed the relation of each group with the spread of misinformation. Our results show that Twitter users with a lower perceived risk were more inclined to share fake news and harmful information, while the group with a higher level of anxiety tends to share more scientifically-backed information. This is an important step towards helping minimize the spread of false and harmful health information around the internet."}}
