These tasks include classification with label imbalance, domain adaptation, and tabular representation learning. Our re-weighting schemes are simple and can be used in combination with any popular optimization algorithms such as SGD, Adam. \nOur techniques are inspired by max-margin learning, and rely on mirror maps such as log-barrier and negative entropy, which have been shown to perform max-margin classification. Empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach on all of the aforementioned tasks. Our techniques provide state-of-the-art results in tasks involving tabular representation learning and domain adaptation."}}

However, most of these approaches have been trained in a straightforward fashion and are generally not robust to adversity, especially in the meta-RL setting. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to propose an adversarial training regime for Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning, which requires no manual intervention or domain knowledge of the environments. Our experiments on multiple environments in the Multi-Task Reinforcement learning domain demonstrate that the adversarial process leads to a better exploration of numerous solutions and a deeper understanding of the environment. We also adapt existing measures of causal attribution to draw insights from the skills learned, facilitating easier re-purposing of skills for adaptation to unseen environments and tasks."}}

The most popular techniques, such as uniform experience replay(UER) and prioritized experience replay (PER), seem to suffer from sub-optimal convergence and significant bias error, respectively.

Our proposed approach is based on the theoretically rigorous reverse experience replay (RER), which can be shown to remove bias in the linear approximation setting but can be sub-optimal with neural approximation. We show empirically that IER is stable with neural function approximation and has a superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques like uniform experience replay (UER), prioritized experience replay(PER), and hindsight experience replay (HER) on the majority of tasks."}}

Recent studies show that task distribution plays a vital role in the performance of the model. Conventional wisdom is that task diversity should improve the performance of meta-learning. In this work, we find evidence to the contrary; we study different task distributions on a myriad of models and datasets to evaluate the effect of task diversity on meta-learning algorithms. For this experiment, we train on two datasets - Omniglot and miniImageNet and with three broad classes of meta-learning models - Metric-based (i.e., Protonet, Matching Networks), Optimization-based (i.e., MAML, Reptile, and MetaOptNet), and Bayesian meta-learning models (i.e., CNAPs). Our experiments demonstrate that the effect of task diversity on all these algorithms follows a similar trend, and task diversity does not seem to offer any benefits to the learning of the model. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that even a handful of tasks, repeated over multiple batches, would be sufficient to achieve a performance similar to uniform sampling and draws into question the need for additional tasks to create better models."}}
