In our experiment, a teacher must communicate a first order logic formula to a student through a narrow channel deprived of common shared signs: subjects cannot communicate with each other with the sole exception of car motions in a computer game. Subjects spontaneously develop a shared vocabulary of car motions including indices, icons, and symbols, spanning both task-specific and task-agnostic concepts such as \u201csquare\u201d and \u201cunderstand\u201d. We characterize the conditions under which indices, icons, and symbols arise, finding that symbols are harder to establish than icons and indices. We observe the dominant sign category being developed transition from indices to icons to symbols, and identify communicating in ambiguous game environments as a pressure for icon and symbol development."}}

This is mostly a consequence of the fact that tasks such as navigation, command following, and even game playing are well-defined, while social reasoning still mostly remains a pre-theoretic problem. We demonstrate how social interactions can be effectively incorporated into MDPs by reasoning recursively about the goals of other agents. In essence, our method extends the reward function to include a combination of physical goals (something agents want to accomplish in the configuration space, a traditional MDP) and social goals (something agents want to accomplish relative to the goals of other agents). Our Social MDPs allow specifying reward functions in terms of the estimated reward functions of other agents, modeling interactions such as helping or hindering another agent (by maximizing or minimizing the other agent's reward) while balancing this with the actual physical goals of each agent. Our formulation allows for an arbitrary function of another agent's estimated reward structure and physical goals, enabling more complex behaviors such as politely hindering another agent or aggressively helping them. Extending Social MDPs in the same manner as I-POMDPs extension would enable interactions such as convincing another agent that something is true. To what extent the Social MDPs presented here and their potential Social POMDPs variant account for all possible social interactions is unknown, but having a precise mathematical model to guide questions about social interactions has both practical value (we demonstrate how to make zero-shot social inferences and one could imagine chatbots and robots guided by Social MDPs) and theoretical value by bringing the tools of MDP that have so successfully organized research around navigation to hopefully shed light on what social interactions really are given their extreme importance to human well-being and human civilization."}}

We demonstrate that a rich theory of social interactions originating from microsociology and economics can be formalized by extending a nested MDP where agents reason about arbitrary functions of each other's hidden rewards. This extended Social MDP allows us to encode the five basic interactions that underlie microsociology: cooperation, conflict, coercion, competition, and exchange. The result is a robotic agent capable of executing social interactions zero-shot in new environments; like humans it can engage socially in novel ways even without a single example of that social interaction. Moreover, the judgments of these Social MDPs align closely with those of humans when considering which social interaction is taking place in an environment. This method both sheds light on the nature of social interactions, by providing concrete mathematical definitions, and brings rich social interactions into a mathematical framework that has proven to be natural for robotics, MDPs."}}

We present a novel trajectory prediction model that uses linguistic intermediate representations to forecast trajectories, and is trained using trajectory samples with partially-annotated captions. The model learns the meaning of each of the words without direct per-word supervision. At inference time, it generates a linguistic description of trajectories which captures maneuvers and interactions over an extended time interval. This generated description is used to refine predictions of the trajectories of multiple agents. We train and validate our model on the Argoverse dataset, and demonstrate improved accuracy results in trajectory prediction. In addition, our model is more interpretable: it presents part of its reasoning in plain language as captions, which can aid model development and can aid in building confidence in the model before deploying it."}}

Our approach takes as input an LTL formula, structures a deep network according to the parse of the formula, and determines satisfying actions. This compositional structure of the network enables zero-shot generalization to significantly more complex unseen formulas. We demonstrate this ability in multiple problem domains with both discrete and continuous state-action spaces. In a symbolic domain, the agent finds a sequence of letters that satisfy a specification. In a Minecraft-like environment, the agent finds a sequence of actions that conform to a formula. In the Fetch environment, the robot finds a sequence of arm configurations that move blocks on a table to fulfill the commands. While most prior work can learn to execute one formula reliably, we develop a novel form of multi-task learning for RL agents that allows them to learn from a diverse set of tasks and generalize to a new set of diverse tasks without any additional training. The compositional structures presented here are not specific to LTL, thus opening the path to RL agents that perform zero-shot generalization in other compositional domains."}}

Our approach combines a deep network structured according to the parse of a complex command that includes objects, verbs, spatial relations, and attributes, with a sampling-based planner, RRT. A recurrent hierarchical deep network controls how the planner explores the environment, determines when a planned path is likely to achieve a goal, and estimates the confidence of each move to trade off exploitation and exploration between the network and the planner. Planners are designed to have near-optimal behavior when information about the task is missing, while networks learn to exploit observations which are available from the environment, making the two naturally complementary. Combining the two enables generalization to new maps, new kinds of obstacles, and more complex sentences that do not occur in the training set. Little data is required to train the model despite it jointly acquiring a CNN that extracts features from the environment as it learns the meanings of words. The model provides a level of interpretability through the use of attention maps allowing users to see its reasoning steps despite being an end-to-end model. This end-to-end model allows robots to learn to follow natural language commands in challenging continuous environments."}}

The formulation of the network enables this capacity to generalize. We demonstrate this ability in two domains. In a symbolic domain, the agent finds a sequence of letters that is accepted. In a Minecraft-like environment, the agent finds a sequence of actions that conform to the formula.

This could form the basis of new multitask agents that discover sub-tasks and execute them without any additional training, as well as the agents which follow more complex linguistic commands. The structures required for this generalization are specific to LTL formulas, which opens up an interesting theoretical question: what structures are required in neural networks for zero-shot generalization to different logics?"}}
