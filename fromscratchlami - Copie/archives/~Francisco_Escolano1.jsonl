Most GNNs use a message passing framework and hence are called MPNNs. Despite their promising results, MPNNs have been reported to suffer from over-smoothing, over-squashing and under-reaching. Graph rewiring and graph pooling have been proposed in the literature as solutions to address these limitations. However, most state-of-the-art graph rewiring methods fail to preserve the global topology of the graph, are neither differentiable nor inductive, and require the tuning of hyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose DiffWire, a novel framework for graph rewiring in MPNNs that is principled, fully differentiable and parameter-free by leveraging the Lov\u00e1sz bound. The proposed approach provides a unified theory for graph rewiring by proposing two new, complementary layers in MPNNs: CT-Layer, a layer that learns the commute times and uses them as a relevance function for edge re-weighting; and GAP-Layer, a layer to optimize the spectral gap, depending on the nature of the network and the task at hand. We empirically validate the value of each of these layers separately with benchmark datasets for graph classification. We also perform preliminary studies on the use of CT-Layer for homophilic and heterophilic node classification tasks. DiffWire brings together the learnability of commute times to related definitions of curvature, opening the door to creating more expressive MPNNs. "}}

Given the wide adoption of AR face filters and the importance of faces in our social structures and relations, there is increased interest by the scientific community to analyze the impact of such filters from a psychological, artistic and sociological perspective. However, there are few quantitative analyses in this area mainly due to a lack of publicly available datasets of facial images with applied AR filters. The proprietary, close nature of most social media platforms does not allow users, scientists and practitioners to access the code and the details of the available AR face filters. Scraping faces from these platforms to collect data is ethically unacceptable and should, therefore, be avoided in research. In this paper, we present OpenFilter, a flexible framework to apply AR filters available in social media platforms on existing large collections of human faces. Moreover, we share FairBeauty and B-LFW, two beautified versions of the publicly available FairFace and LFW datasets and we outline insights derived from the analysis of these beautified datasets.

The low dimensional manifolds are from the commute time embedding and are matched though coherent point drift. Although there have been a number of attempts to realise graph matching in this way, in this paper we propose a novel information-theoretic measure of alignment, the so-called symmetrized normalized-entropy-square variation. We successfully test this dissimilarity measure between manifolds on a a challenging database. The measure is estimated by means of the bypass Leonenko entropy functional. In addition we prove that the proposed measure induces a positive definite kernel between the probability density functions associated with the manifolds and hence between graphs after deformation. In our experiments we find that the optimal embedding is associated to the commute time distance and we also find that our approach, which is purely topological, outperforms several state-of-the-art graph-based algorithms for point matching."}}

The challenging property of these measures is that they are bypass divergences, that is, do not require the estimation of the probability density function for each shape. After presenting the dissimilarities and proposing some new ones, we analyze their performance in terms of average recall for a very difficult database (GatorBait) with many classes, few examples and high degree of intra-class variability. We also test these measures in a subset of the the well known MPEG7 part B database. Our experiments show that the Henze-Penrose divergence outperforms the other ones in 2D shape retrieval. We uncover also very competitive and more efficient measures in both cases."}}

In order to serve on-line metric (map) and positional (localization) to the blind or visually impaired we introduce three basic elements: (i) a real-time egomotion estimation integrating 3D and 2D (appearance) information; (ii) a randomized algorithm for global rectification by entropy minimization; and (iii) a time-dependent view integration strategy for reducing the number of variables and achieving near real-time performance in global rectification. We show successful experimental results which illustrate the capabilities of both the egomotion and the global-rectification algorithm in terms of supporting 6DOF, yielding statistical robustness and enabling scalable solutions."}}
