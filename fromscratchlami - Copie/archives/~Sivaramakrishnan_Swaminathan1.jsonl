Observations are gathered by an agent traversing the graph. Aliasing means that multiple nodes emit the same observation, so the agent can not know in which node it is located. The agent needs to uncover the hidden topology as accurately as possible and in as few steps as possible. This is equivalent to efficient recovery of the transition probabilities of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) in which the observation probabilities are known. An algorithm for efficiently exploring (and ultimately recovering) the latent graph is provided. Our approach is exponentially faster than naive exploration in a variety of challenging topologies with aliased observations while remaining competitive with existing baselines in the unaliased regime."}}

This corresponds to learning the transition function of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) in which observations are deterministic. This is highly relevant for partially observed reinforcement learning, where the agent needs to swiftly learn how to navigate new environments from sensory observations. The challenge involves solving two related problems: exploring the graph as fast as possible, and learning it from the obtained aliased observations, where the learning helps to explore faster. Our approach leverages a recently proposed model, the Clone Structured Cognitive Graph (CSCG), which can handle aliasing, and guide exploration. We provide empirical evidence that our model-based algorithm can recover graphs from a wide range of challenging topologies, and shows linear scaling with graph size even for severely aliased and loopy graph structures where model-free methods require an exponential number of steps."}}
