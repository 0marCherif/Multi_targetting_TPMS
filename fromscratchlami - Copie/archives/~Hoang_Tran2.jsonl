Their applicability to real-world complex systems is currently limited by the challenges of inferring effective graph representations of the high-dimensional, noisy, nonlinear and transient dynamics from limited time series outputs, as well as of extracting statistical quantifiers that capture the salient structure of the inferred graphs for detecting change. In this article, we present an approach to detecting changes in complex dynamic systems that is based on spectral-graph-theory and uses a single realization of time series data collected under specific, common types of transient conditions, such as intermittency. We introduce a statistic, \u03b3k, based on the spectral content of the inferred graph. We show that the \u03b3k statistic under high-dimensional dynamics converges to a normal distribution, and we employ the parameters of this distribution to construct a procedure to detect qualitative changes in the coupling structure of a dynamical system. Experimental investigations suggest that the \u03b3k statistic by itself is able to detect changes with modified area under curve (mAUC) of about 0.96 (for numerical simulation tests), and can, by itself, achieve a true positive rate of about 40% for detecting seizures from EEG signals. In addition, by incorporating this statistic with random forest, one of the best seizure detection methods, the seizure detection rate of the random forest method improves by 5% in 35% of the subjects. These studies of the network inferred from EEG signals suggest that \u03b3k can capture salient structural changes in the physiology of the process and can therefore serve as an effective feature for detecting seizures from EEG signals."}}

The current approaches are inadequate to discern between direct versus indirect influences (i.e., the presence or absence of a directed arc connecting two nodes) in the presence of noise, sparse interactions, as well as nonlinear and transient dynamics of real world processes. We report a sparse regression (referred to as the -min) approach with theoretical bounds on the constraints on the allowable perturbation to recover the network structure that guarantees sparsity and robustness to noise. We also introduce averaging and perturbation procedures to further enhance prediction scores (i.e., reduce inference errors), and the numerical stability of -min approach. Extensive investigations have been conducted with multiple benchmark simulated genetic regulatory network and Michaelis-Menten dynamics, as well as real world data sets from DREAM5 challenge. These investigations suggest that our approach can significantly improve, oftentimes by 5 orders of magnitude over the methods reported previously for inferring the structure of dynamic networks, such as Bayesian network, network deconvolution, silencing and modular response analysis methods based on optimizing for sparsity, transients, noise and high dimensionality issues."}}
