While this has led to solving many complex phenomena, there are still significant limitations. Conventional approaches such as Finite Element Methods (FEMs) and Finite Differential Methods (FDMs) require considerable time and are computationally expensive. In contrast, machine learning-based methods such as neural networks are faster once trained, but tend to be restricted to a specific discretization. This article aims to provide a comprehensive summary of conventional methods and recent machine learning-based methods to approximate PDEs numerically. Furthermore, we highlight several key architectures centered around the neural operator, a novel and fast approach (1000x) to learning the solution operator of a PDE. We will note how these new computational approaches can bring immense advantages in tackling many problems in fundamental and applied physics."}}

In contrast to the concurrent works, which mainly focus on generating the motion of a single actor from the textual description, we generate the motion of one of the actors from the motion of the other participating actor in the action. This is a particularly challenging, under-explored problem, that requires learning intricate relationships between the motion of two actors participating in an action and also identifying the action from the motion of one actor. To address these, we propose partner conditioned motion operator (PaCMO), a neural operator-based generative model which learns the distribution of human motion conditioned by the partner's motion in function spaces through adversarial training. Our model can handle long unlabeled action sequences at arbitrary time resolution. We also introduce the \"Functional Frechet Inception Distance\" ($F^2ID$) metric for capturing similarity between real and generated data for function spaces. We test PaCMO on NTU RGB+D and DuetDance datasets and our model produces realistic results evidenced by the $F^2ID$ score and the conducted user study."}}

Current deep learning based methods rely on local convolutions for feature learning and suffer from not being scale-invariant, thus requiring training data to be augmented through random flipping and re-scaling. On the other hand, AdaFNIO, learns the features in the frames, independent of input resolution, through token mixing and global convolution in the Fourier space or the spectral domain by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). We show that AdaFNIO can produce visually smooth and accurate results. To evaluate the visual quality of our interpolated frames, we calculate the structural similarity index (SSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) between the generated frame and the ground truth frame. We provide the quantitative performance of our model on Vimeo-90K dataset, DAVIS, UCF101 and DISFA+ dataset."}}

The natural sciences and engineering are known to have many types of data that are sampled from infinite-dimensional function spaces, where classical finite-dimensional deep generative adversarial networks (GANs) may not be directly applicable. GANO generalizes the GAN framework and allows for the sampling of functions by learning push-forward operator maps in infinite-dimensional spaces. GANO consists of two main components, a generator neural operator and a discriminator neural functional. The inputs to the generator are samples of functions from a user-specified probability measure, e.g., Gaussian random field (GRF), and the generator outputs are synthetic data functions. The input to the discriminator is either a real or synthetic data function. In this work, we instantiate GANO using the Wasserstein criterion and show how the Wasserstein loss can be computed in infinite-dimensional spaces. We empirically study GANO in controlled cases where both input and output functions are samples from GRFs and compare its performance to the finite-dimensional counterpart GAN. We empirically study the efficacy of GANO on real-world function data of volcanic activities and show its superior performance over GAN."}}

Prior works on neural operators proposed a series of novel methods to learn such maps and demonstrated unprecedented success in learning solution operators of partial differential equations. Due to their close proximity to fully connected architectures, these models mainly suffer from high memory usage and are generally limited to shallow deep learning models. In this paper, we propose U-shaped Neural Operator (U-NO), a U-shaped memory enhanced architecture that allows for deeper neural operators. U-NOs exploit the problem structures in function predictions and demonstrate fast training, data efficiency, and robustness with respect to hyperparameters choices. We study the performance of U-NO on PDE benchmarks, namely, Darcy's flow law and the Navier-Stokes equations. We show that U-NO results in an average of 26% and 44% prediction improvement on Darcy's flow and turbulent Navier-Stokes equations, respectively, over the state of the art. On Navier-Stokes 3D spatiotemporal operator learning task, we show U-NO provides 37% improvement over the state of art methods."}}

All research efforts in this regard focus on diagnosing in controlled environment such as laboratories. Going beyond this common limitation, in this paper, we exploit the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to effectively come up with a portable Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis system that can go in-the-wild. To do so, we collect EEG signals from both Parkinson\u2019s patients and healthy people in different emotional states. Our statistical analysis finds a substantial differences in the signals in several emotional states for Parkinson\u2019s patients and healthy people. Accordingly, we develop a machine learning based model to diagnose Parkinson\u2019s disease that results in 97% accuracy."}}
