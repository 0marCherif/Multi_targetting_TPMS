Kneip et al. proposed to solve this problem by introducing the normal epipolar constraint (NEC). However, their approach does not take into account uncertainties, so that the accuracy of the estimated relative pose is highly dependent on accurate feature positions in the target frame. In this work, we introduce the probabilistic normal epipolar constraint (PNEC) that overcomes this limitation by accounting for anisotropic and inhomogeneous uncertainties in the feature positions. To this end, we propose a novel objective function, along with an efficient optimization scheme that effectively minimizes our objective while maintaining real-time performance. In experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate that the novel PNEC yields more accurate rotation estimates than the original NEC and several popular relative rotation estimation algorithms. Furthermore, we integrate the proposed method into a state-of-the-art monocular rotation-only odometry system and achieve consistently improved results for the real-world KITTI dataset."}}

One major reason is its ease of integration into deep learning frameworks. To allow for an efficient training of respective neural networks, we propose an algorithm that obtains analytical gradients of a Sinkhorn layer via implicit differentiation. In comparison to prior work, our framework is based on the most general formulation of the Sinkhorn operator. It allows for any type of loss function, while both the target capacities and cost matrices are differentiated jointly. We further construct error bounds of the resulting algorithm for approximate inputs. Finally, we demonstrate that for a number of applications, simply replacing automatic differentiation with our algorithm directly improves the stability and accuracy of the obtained gradients. Moreover, we show that it is computationally more efficient, particularly when resources like GPU memory are scarce."}}

Various learning-based methods were recently proposed for finding correspondences between image key points based on deep graph matching formulations. While these approaches mainly focus on learning node and edge attributes, they completely ignore the 3D geometry of the underlying 3D objects depicted in the 2D images. We fill this gap by proposing a trainable framework that takes advantage of graph neural networks for learning a deformable 3D geometry model from inhomogeneous image collections, i.e. a set of images that depict different instances of objects from the same category. Experimentally we demonstrate that our method outperforms recent learning-based approaches for graph matching considering both accuracy and cycle-consistency error, while we in addition obtain the underlying 3D geometry of the objects depicted in the 2D images."}}

While deep neural networks were shown to lead to state-of-the-art results in shape matching, existing learning-based approaches are limited in the context of multi-shape matching: (i) either they focus on matching pairs of shapes only and thus suffer from cycle-inconsistent multi-matchings, or (ii) they require an explicit template shape to address the matching of a collection of shapes. In this paper, we present a novel approach for deep multi-shape matching that ensures cycle-consistent multi-matchings while not depending on an explicit template shape. To this end, we utilise a shape-to-universe multi-matching representation that we combine with powerful functional map regularisation, so that our multi-shape matching neural network can be trained in a fully unsupervised manner. While the functional map regularisation is only considered during training time, functional maps are not computed for predicting correspondences, thereby allowing for fast inference. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several challenging benchmark datasets, and, most remarkably, that our unsupervised method even outperforms recent supervised methods."}}

To address these shortcomings, we present a comparative study of graph matching algorithms. We create a uniform benchmark where we collect and categorize a large set of existing and publicly available computer vision graph matching problems in a common format.
