However, the field currently lacks a unified, strictly formulated, and comprehensive benchmark, which often results in unfair comparisons and inconclusive results. From the problem setting perspective, OOD detection is closely related to neighboring fields including anomaly detection (AD), open set recognition (OSR), and model uncertainty, since methods developed for one domain are often applicable to each other. To help the community to improve the evaluation and advance, we build a unified, well-structured codebase called OpenOOD, which implements over 30 methods developed in relevant fields and provides a comprehensive benchmark under the recently proposed generalized OOD detection framework. With a comprehensive comparison of these methods, we are gratified that the field has progressed significantly over the past few years, where both preprocessing methods and the orthogonal post-hoc methods show strong potential.

To handle this problem, a natural approach is to increase the data diversity by image based augmentations. However, different with most vision tasks such as classification and detection, RL tasks are not always invariant to spatial based augmentations due to the entanglement of environment dynamics and visual appearance.  In this paper, we argue with two principles for augmentations in RL: First, the augmented observations should facilitate learning a universal policy, which is robust to various distribution shifts. Second, the augmented data should be invariant to the learning signals such as action and reward. Following these rules, we revisit image-based RL tasks from the view of frequency domain and propose a novel augmentation method, namely Spectrum Random Masking (SRM),which is able to help agents to learn the whole frequency spectrum of observation for coping with various distributions and compatible with the pre-collected action and reward corresponding to original observation. Extensive experiments conducted on DMControl Generalization Benchmark   demonstrate the proposed SRM achieves the state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization potentials."}}

Although data-free methods can overcome this problem, they often suffer from a huge loss of accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Anonymous-Model Pruning (AMP), which seeks to compress the network without the source data and the accuracy can be guaranteed without too much loss. AMP compresses deep neural networks via searching pruning rate automatically and fine-tuning the compressed model under the teacher-student diagram. The key innovations are that the pruning rate is automatically determined, and the fine-tuning process is under the guidance of uncompressed network instead of labels. Even without the source dataset, compared with existing pruning methods, our proposed method can still achieve comparable accuracy with similar pruning rate. For example, for ResNet50, our AMP method only incur 0.76% loss in top-1 accuracy with 32.72% pruning rate."}}

The sample can be classified to known or unknown by the otherness with reciprocal points. To tackle the open set problem, we offer a novel open space risk regularization term. Based on the bounded space constructed by reciprocal points, the risk of unknown is reduced through multi-category interaction.
