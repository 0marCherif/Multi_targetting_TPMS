This can be useful in tuning across controllers, learnt possibly in mismatched or simulated environments, to obtain a good controller for a given target environment with relatively few trials. Towards this, we propose two algorithms: (1) a Policy Gradient-based approach; and (2) an algorithm that can switch between a simple Actor-Critic (AC) based scheme and a Natural Actor-Critic (NAC) scheme depending on the available information. Both algorithms operate over a class of improper mixtures of the given controllers. For the first case, we derive convergence rate guarantees assuming access to a gradient oracle. For the AC-based approach we provide convergence rate guarantees to a stationary point in the basic AC case and to a global optimum in the NAC case. Numerical results on (i) the standard control theoretic benchmark of stabilizing an cartpole; and (ii) a constrained queueing task show that our improper policy optimization algorithm can stabilize the system even when the base policies at its disposal are unstable."}}

The design of such MAC protocols must keep in mind the need for contention access at light traffic, and scheduled access in heavy traffic, leading to the long-standing interest in hybrid, adaptive MACs. Working in the discrete time setting, for the distributed MAC design, we consider a practical information structure where each node has local information and some common information obtained from overhearing. In this setting, \"ZMAC\" is an existing protocol that is hybrid and adaptive. We approach the problem via two steps (1) We show that it is sufficient for the policy to be \"greedy\" and \"exhaustive\". Limiting the policy to this class reduces the problem to obtaining a queue switching policy at queue emptiness instants. (2) Formulating the delay optimal scheduling as a POMDP (partially observed Markov decision process), we show that the optimal switching rule is Stochastic Largest Queue (SLQ). Using this theory as the basis, we then develop a practical distributed scheduler, QZMAC, which is also tunable. We implement QZMAC on standard off-the-shelf TelosB motes and also use simulations to compare QZMAC with the full-knowledge centralized scheduler, and with ZMAC. We use our implementation to study the impact of false detection while overhearing the common information, and the efficiency of QZMAC. Our simulation results show that the mean delay with QZMAC is close that of the full-knowledge centralized scheduler."}}

The resource-constrained, ad-hoc nature of wireless networks typical of the IoT also forces the amount of control information exchanged across the network - required to make scheduling decisions - to a minimum. In a previous article we proposed a protocol called QZMAC that (i) provides provably low mean delay, (ii) has distributed control(i.e., there is no central scheduler), and (iii) does not require explicit exchange of state information or control signals. In the present article, we implement and demonstrate the performance of QZMAC on a test bed consisting of CC2420 based Crossbow telosB motes, running the 6TiSCH communication stack on the Contiki operating system over the 2.4GHz ISM band. QZMAC achieves its near-optimal delay performance using a clever combination of polling and contention modes. We demonstrate the polling and the contention modes of QZMAC separately. We use an Adaptive Synchronization Technique in our implementation which we also demonstrate. Our network shows good delay performance even in the presence of heavy interference from ambient WiFi networks."}}

In this article we are concerned with the temporal volatility of the control process of the regulator in discrete time Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQRs). Our investigation in this paper unearths a surprising connection between the cost functional which an LQR is tasked with minimizing and the temporal variations of its control laws. We first show that optimally controlling the system always implies high levels of control volatility, i.e., it is impossible to reduce volatility in the optimal control process without sacrificing cost. We also show that, akin to communication systems, every LQR has a $Capacity~Region$ associated with it, that dictates and quantifies how much cost is achievable at a given level of control volatility. This additionally establishes the fact that no admissible control policy can simultaneously achieve low volatility and low cost. We then employ this analysis to explain the phenomenon of temporal price volatility frequently observed in deregulated electricity markets."}}

Our aim in this paper is to study throughput-optimal, and even delay optimal, scheduling policies that require only the empty-nonempty state of the packet queues associated with these links (Queue Nonemptiness Based, or QNB, policies). We focus on Maximum Size Matching (MSM) policies, and provide an analysis of all the QNB-MSM policies for N = 3, thereby comparing their performance, and revisiting a delay optimal scheduling result. Our study shows that, while scheduling a maximum size matching would seem intuitive, there are important performance differences between different QNB-MSM policies. Further, it is not necessary for a QNB policy to be MSM for it to be throughput optimal. We develop a new Policy Splicing technique to combine scheduling policies for small networks to construct throughput-optimal policies for larger networks, some of which also aim for low delay.

Previous approaches rely on access to minimax optimization oracles. The algorithm, which we call the \\textit{Phased Elimination Linear Exploration Game} (PELEG), maintains a high-probability confidence ellipsoid containing $\\theta^*$ in each round and uses it to eliminate suboptimal arms in phases. PELEG achieves fast shrinkage of this confidence ellipsoid along the most confusing (i.e., close to, but not optimal) directions by interpreting the problem as a two player zero-sum game, and sequentially converging to its saddle point using low-regret learners to compute players' strategies in each round. We analyze the sample complexity of PELEG and show that it matches, up to order, an instance-dependent lower bound on sample complexity in the linear bandit setting. We also provide numerical results for the proposed algorithm consistent with its theoretical guarantees."}}
