Previous approaches either lack uncertainty estimates for the map and agent state, do not run in real-time, do not have a dense scene representation or do not model agent dynamics. Our solution reconciles all of these aspects. We start from a predefined state-space model which combines differentiable rendering and 6-DoF dynamics. Probabilistic inference in this model amounts to simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) and is intractable. We use a series of approximations to Bayesian inference to arrive at probabilistic map and state estimates. We take advantage of well-established methods and closed-form updates, preserving accuracy and enabling real-time capability. The proposed solution runs at 10Hz real-time and is similarly accurate to state-of-the-art SLAM in small to medium-sized indoor environments, with high-speed UAV and handheld camera agents (Blackbird, EuRoC and TUM-RGBD).\n"}}

Learning models for control has led to impressive results in robotics and computer games, but this success has yet to be extended to vision-based navigation. To address this, we transfer advances in the emergent field of differentiable rendering to model-based control. We do this by planning in a learned 3D spatial world model, combined with a pose estimation algorithm previously used in the context of TSDF fusion, but now tailored to our setting and improved to incorporate agent dynamics. We evaluate over six simulated environments based on complex human-designed floor plans and provide quantitative results. We achieve up to 92% navigation success rate at a frequency of 15 Hz using only image and depth observations under stochastic, continuous dynamics. "}}

In the context of spatial environments, different types of problems such as localisation, mapping, navigation or autonomous exploration are typically adressed with specialised methods, often relying on detailed knowledge of the system at hand. We express these tasks as probabilistic inference and planning under the umbrella of deep sequential generative models. Using the frameworks of variational inference and neural networks, our method inherits favourable properties such as flexibility, scalability and the ability to learn from data. The method performs comparably to specialised state-of-the-art methodology in two distinct simulated environments. "}}

In this setting, variational posteriors are often only partially conditioned. While the true posteriors depend, e.g., on the entire sequence of observations, approximate posteriors are only informed by past observations. This mimics the Bayesian filter---a mixture of smoothing posteriors. Yet, we show that the ELBO objective forces partially-conditioned amortised posteriors to approximate products of smoothing posteriors instead. Consequently, the learned generative model is compromised. We demonstrate these theoretical findings in three scenarios: traffic flow, handwritten digits, and aerial vehicle dynamics. Using fully-conditioned approximate posteriors, performance improves in terms of generative modelling and multi-step prediction."}}
