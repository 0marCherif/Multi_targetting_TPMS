One of the key problems of current spatial audio rendering methods is the lack of personalization based on different anatomies of individuals, which is essential to produce accurate sound source positions. In this work, we address this problem from an interdisciplinary perspective. The rendering of spatial audio is strongly correlated with the 3D shape of human bodies, particularly ears. To this end, we propose to achieve personalized spatial audio by reconstructing 3D human ears with single-view images. First, to benchmark the ear reconstruction task, we introduce AudioEar3D, a high-quality 3D ear dataset consisting of 112 point cloud ear scans with RGB images. To self-supervisedly train a reconstruction model, we further collect a 2D ear dataset composed of 2,000 images, each one with manual annotation of occlusion and 55 landmarks, named AudioEar2D. To our knowledge, both datasets have the largest scale and best quality of their kinds for public use. Further, we propose AudioEarM, a reconstruction method guided by a depth estimation network that is trained on synthetic data, with two loss functions tailored for ear data. Lastly, to fill the gap between the vision and acoustics community, we develop a pipeline to integrate the reconstructed ear mesh with an off-the-shelf 3D human body and simulate a personalized Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF), which is the core of spatial audio rendering.

In the heart of our pipeline is an adaptive frequency modulation module called Adaptive Frequency Net (AFNet), which utilizes a hypernetwork to learn the local texture frequency encoding that is consecutively injected into adaptive frequency activation layers to modulate the implicit radiance signal. This mechanism improves the frequency expressive ability of the network with richer frequency basis support, only at a small computational budget. To further boost performance, a preprocessing module is also proposed for point cloud geometry optimization via point opacity estimation. In contrast to implicit rendering, our pipeline supports high-fidelity interactive editing based on point cloud manipulation. Extensive experimental results on NeRF-Synthetic, ScanNet, DTU and Tanks and Temples datasets demonstrate the superior performances achieved by our method in terms of PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS, in comparison to the state-of-the-art."}}

However, point clouds rendering is somehow less explored. Compared to NeRF-based rendering which suffers from dense spatial sampling, point clouds rendering is naturally less computation intensive, which enables its deployment in mobile computing device. In this work, we focus on boosting the image quality of point clouds rendering with a compact model design. We first analyze the adaption of the volume rendering formulation on point clouds. Based on the analysis, we simplify the NeRF representation to a spatial mapping function which only requires single evaluation per pixel. Further, motivated by ray marching, we rectify the the noisy raw point clouds to the estimated intersection between rays and surfaces as queried coordinates, which could avoid \\textit{spatial frequency collapse} and neighbor point disturbance. Composed of rasterization, spatial mapping and the refinement stages, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on point clouds rendering, outperforming prior works by notable margins, with a smaller model size. We obtain a PSNR of 31.74 on NeRF-Synthetic, 25.88 on ScanNet and 30.81 on DTU. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/seanywang0408/RadianceMapping."}}

Even for hybrid (2D + 3D) approaches, the intrinsic disadvantages within the 2D/3D parts still exist. In this study, we bridge the gap between 2D and 3D convolutions by reinventing the 2D convolutions. We propose ACS (axial-coronal-sagittal) convolutions to perform natively 3D representation learning, while utilizing the pretrained weights on 2D datasets. In ACS convolutions, 2D convolution kernels are split by channel into three parts, and convoluted separately on the three views (axial, coronal and sagittal) of 3D representations. Theoretically, ANY 2D CNN (ResNet, DenseNet, or DeepLab) is able to be converted into a 3D ACS CNN, with pretrained weight of a same parameter size. Extensive experiments validate the consistent superiority of the pretrained ACS CNNs, over the 2D/3D CNN counterparts with/without pretraining. Even without pretraining, the ACS convolution can be used as a plug-and-play replacement of standard 3D convolution, with smaller model size and less computation."}}

In this study, we propose a multiple instance learning (MIL) approach and empirically prove the benefit to learn the relations between multiple nodules. By treating the multiple nodules from a same patient as a whole, critical relational information between solitary-nodule voxels is extracted. To our knowledge, it is the first study to learn the relations between multiple pulmonary nodules. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) domain, we introduce a self-attention transformer equipped with 3D CNN, named NoduleSAT, to replace typical pooling-based aggregation in multiple instance learning.

Inspired by consistency of visual saliency between different vision models, a surrogate model is expected to improve the attack performance via transferability. By combining transferability-based and query-based black-box attack, we propose a surprisingly simple baseline approach (named SimBA++) using the surrogate model, which significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, to efficiently utilize the query feedback, we update the surrogate model in a novel learning scheme, named High-Order Gradient Approximation (HOGA). By constructing a high-order gradient computation graph, we update the surrogate model to approximate the victim model in both forward and backward pass. The SimBA++ and HOGA result in Learnable Black-Box Attack (LeBA), which surpasses previous state of the art by considerable margins: the proposed LeBA significantly reduces queries, while keeping higher attack success rates close to 100% in extensive ImageNet experiments, including attacking vision benchmarks and defensive models.
