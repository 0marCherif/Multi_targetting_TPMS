To address it, we present a novel Geometric Multimodal Contrastive (GMC) representation learning method consisting of two main components: i) a two-level architecture consisting of modality-specific base encoders, allowing to process an arbitrary number of modalities to an intermediate representation of fixed dimensionality, and a shared projection head, mapping the intermediate representations to a latent representation space; ii) a multimodal contrastive loss function that encourages the geometric alignment of the learned representations. We experimentally demonstrate that GMC representations are semantically rich and achieve state-of-the-art performance with missing modality information on three different learning problems including prediction and reinforcement learning tasks."}}

Recently, several algorithms based on the common idea of geometric and topological analysis of a manifold approximated from the learned data representations have been proposed. In this work, we introduce Delaunay Component Analysis (DCA) - an evaluation algorithm which approximates the data manifold using a more suitable neighbourhood graph called Delaunay graph. This provides a reliable manifold estimation even for challenging geometric arrangements of representations such as clusters with varying shape and density as well as outliers, which is where existing methods often fail. Furthermore, we exploit the nature of Delaunay graphs and introduce a framework for assessing the quality of individual novel data representations. We experimentally validate the proposed DCA method on representations obtained from neural networks trained with contrastive objective, supervised and generative models, and demonstrate various use cases of our extended single point evaluation framework."}}

Thus, we present GraphDCA - a framework for evaluating similarity between graphs based on the alignment of their respective node representation sets. The sets are compared using a recently proposed method for comparing representation spaces, called Delaunay Component Analysis (DCA), which we extend to graph data. To evaluate our framework, we generate a benchmark dataset of graphs exhibiting different structural patterns and show, using three node structure feature extractors, that GraphDCA recognizes graphs with both similar and dissimilar local structure. We then apply our framework to evaluate three publicly available real-world graph datasets and demonstrate, using gradual edge perturbations, that GraphDCA satisfyingly captures gradually decreasing similarity, unlike global statistics. Finally, we use GraphDCA to evaluate two state-of-the-art graph generative models, NetGAN and CELL, and conclude that further improvements are needed for these models to adequately reproduce local structural features."}}

Even though the field has been significantly accelerated by deep learning techniques, a crucial requirement for their success is the availability of a large amount of data. In this work, we propose the Augment-Connect-Explore (ACE) paradigm to enable visual action planning in cases of data scarcity. We build upon the Latent Space Roadmap (LSR) framework which performs planning with a graph built in a low dimensional latent space. In particular, ACE is used to i) Augment the available training dataset by autonomously creating new pairs of datapoints, ii) create new unobserved Connections among representations of states in the latent graph, and iii) Explore new regions of the latent space in a targeted manner. We validate the proposed approach on both simulated box stacking and real-world folding task showing the applicability for rigid and deformable object manipulation tasks, respectively."}}
