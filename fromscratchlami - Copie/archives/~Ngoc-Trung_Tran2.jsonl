On Compatibility between Label Smoothing and Knowledge Distillation", "abstract": "This work investigates the compatibility between label smoothing (LS) and knowledge distillation (KD). Contemporary findings addressing this thesis statement take dichotomous standpoints. Specifically, Muller et al. [1] claim that LS erases relative information in the logits; therefore a LS-trained teacher can hurt KD. On the contrary, Shen et al. [2] claim that LS enlarges the distance between semantically similar classes; therefore a LS-trained teacher is compatible with KD. Critically, there is no effort to understand and resolve these contradictory findings, leaving the primal question $-$ to smooth or not to smooth a teacher network? $-$ unanswered. \n\nIn this work, we establish a foundational understanding on the compatibility between LS and KD. We begin by meticulously scrutinizing these contradictory findings under a unified empirical consistency. Through our profound investigation, we discover that in the presence of a LS-trained teacher, KD at higher temperatures systematically diffuses penultimate layer representations learnt by the student towards semantically similar classes. This systematic diffusion essentially curtails the benefits of distilling from a LS-trained teacher, thereby rendering KD at increased temperatures ineffective. We show this systematic diffusion qualitatively by visualizing penultimate layer representations, and quantitatively using our proposed relative distance metric called diffusion index ($\\eta$). \n\nImportantly, our discovered systematic diffusion was the missing concept which is instrumental in understanding and resolving these contradictory findings. Our discovery is comprehensively supported by large-scale experiments and analyses including image classification (standard, fine-grained), neural machine translation and compact student network distillation tasks spanning across multiple datasets and teacher-student architectures. Finally, we shed light on the question $-$ to smooth or not to smooth a teacher network? $-$ in order to help practitioners make informed decisions."}}

Recent works have observed that CNN-generated images share a systematic shortcoming in replicating high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes. Furthermore, these works have successfully exploited this systematic shortcoming to detect CNN-generated images reporting up to 99% accuracy across multiple state-of-the-art GAN models. In this work, we investigate the validity of assertions claiming that CNN-generated images are unable to achieve high frequency spectral decay consistency. We meticulously construct a counterexample space of high frequency spectral decay consistent CNN-generated images emerging from our handcrafted experiments using DCGAN, LSGAN, WGAN-GP and StarGAN, where we empirically show that this frequency discrepancy can be avoided by a minor architecture change in the last upsampling operation. We subsequently use images from this counterexample space to successfully bypass the recently proposed forensics detector which leverages on high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes for CNN-generated image detection. Through this study, we show that high frequency Fourier spectrum decay discrepancies are not inherent characteristics for existing CNN-based generative models--contrary to the belief of some existing work--, and such features are not robust to perform synthetic image detection.

In this work, we propose a principled framework to simultaneously mitigate two fundamental issues in GANs: catastrophic forgetting of the discriminator and mode collapse of the generator. We achieve this by employing for GANs a contrastive learning and mutual information maximization approach, and perform extensive analyses to understand sources of improvements. Our approach significantly stabilizes GAN training and improves GAN performance for image synthesis across five datasets under the same training and evaluation conditions against state-of-the-art works. In particular, compared to the state-of-the-art SSGAN, our approach does not suffer from poorer performance on image domains such as faces, and instead improves performance significantly. Our approach is simple to implement and practical: it involves only one auxiliary objective, has low computational cost, and performs robustly across a wide range of training settings and datasets without any hyperparameter tuning. For reproducibility, our code is available in the open-source GAN library, Mimicry [34]."}}
