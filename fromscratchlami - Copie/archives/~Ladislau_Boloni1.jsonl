One of the challenges hindering a wider deployment is that even if a robot can build a map of the environment, for instance through the use of LiDAR sensors, it also needs to calculate, in real time, a smooth trajectory that avoids both static and mobile obstacles. Considering this scenario, in this paper we investigate whether genetic algorithms can play a role in real-time obstacle avoidance. Historically, the typical use of genetic algorithms was in offline optimization. To investigate whether an online, real-time deployment is possible, we create a family of algorithms called GAVO that combines genetic algorithms with the velocity obstacle model. Through a series of experiments, we show that a carefully chosen chromosome representation and parametrization can achieve real-time performance on the obstacle avoidance problem."}}

The newly emergent applications, such as precision agriculture, weather damage assessment, or personal home security often do not satisfy the simplifying assumptions made by previous research: the explored areas have complex shapes and obstacles, multiple phenomena need to be sensed and estimated simultaneously and the measured quantities might change during observations. The future progress of path planning and estimation algorithms requires a new generation of benchmarks that provide representative environments and scoring methods that capture the demands of these applications. This paper describes the Waterberry Farms benchmark (WBF) that models a precision agriculture application at a Florida farm growing multiple crop types. The benchmark captures the dynamic nature of the spread of plant diseases and variations of soil humidity while the scoring system measures the performance of a given combination of a movement policy and an information model estimator. By benchmarking several examples of representative path planning and estimator algorithms, we demonstrate WBF's ability to provide insight into their properties and quantify future progress."}}

Despite the growing prominence of prompt learning-based APIs, their security concerns remain underexplored. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering study on the Trojan susceptibility of prompt-learning PLM APIs. We identified several key challenges, including discrete-prompt, few-shot, and black-box settings, which limit the applicability of existing backdoor attacks. To address these challenges, we propose TrojPrompt, an automatic and black-box framework to effectively generate universal and stealthy triggers and insert Trojans into hard prompts. Specifically, we propose a universal API-driven trigger discovery algorithm for generating universal triggers for various inputs by querying victim PLM APIs using few-shot data samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel progressive trojan poisoning algorithm designed to generate poisoned prompts that retain efficacy and transferability across a diverse range of models. Our experiments and results demonstrate TrojPrompt's capacity to effectively insert Trojans into text prompts in real-world black-box PLM APIs, while maintaining exceptional performance on clean test sets and significantly outperforming baseline models. Our work sheds light on the potential security risks in current models and offers a potential defensive approach."}}

Tradeoffs between availability and security arise at implementation, however, triggered by the additional resources (e.g., memory and computation) required by blockchain-enabled hosts. This paper applies an energy-reducing algorithmic engineering technique for Merkle Tree (MT) root calculations and the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm, two principal elements of blockchain computations, as a means to preserve the promised security benefits but with less compromise to system availability. Using pyRAPL, a python library to measure the energy consumption of a computation, we experiment with both the standard and energy-reduced implementations of both algorithms for different input sizes. Our results show that up to 98% reduction in energy consumption is possible within the blockchain\u2019s MT construction module, with the benefits typically increasing with larger input sizes. For the PoW algorithm, our results show up to 20% reduction in energy consumption, with the benefits being lower for higher difficulty levels. The proposed energy-reducing technique is also applicable to other key elements of blockchain computations, potentially affording even \u201cgreener\u201d blockchain-powered systems than implied by only the results obtained thus far on the MT and PoW algorithms."}}

Furthermore, such robots often operate under conditions of opportunistic, or periodic connectivity and are limited in their energy budget and computational power. In this paper, we propose algorithms that build on blockchain technology to address the data integrity problem, but also take into account the limitations of the robots' resources and communication.

Most of these algorithms use an ensemble of neural networks as their backbone structure and benefit from the diversity among the neural networks to achieve optimal results. Unfortunately, the members of the ensemble can converge to the same point either the parametric space or representation space during the training phase, therefore, losing all the leverage of an ensemble. In this paper, we describe Maximize Ensemble Diversity in Reinforcement Learning (MED-RL), a set of regularization methods inspired from the economics and consensus optimization to improve diversity in the ensemble-based deep reinforcement learning methods by encouraging inequality between the networks during training. We integrated MED-RL in five of the most common ensemble-based deep RL algorithms for both continuous and discrete control tasks and evaluated on six Mujoco environments and six Atari games. Our results show that MED-RL augmented algorithms outperform their un-regularized counterparts significantly and in some cases achieved more than 300$\\%$ in performance gains."}}

HMAC is used to simultaneously verify both integrity and authenticity of messages and, in turn, plays a significant role in secure communication protocols e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS). The high energy consumption of HMAC is well-known as is the trade-off between security, energy consumption, and performance. Previous research in reducing energy consumption in HMAC has approached the problem primarily at the system software level (e.g. scheduling algorithms). This paper attempts to reduce energy consumption in HMAC by applying an energy-reducing algorithmic engineering technique to the underlying hash function of HMAC, as a means to preserve the promised security benefits. Using pyRAPL, a python library to measure computational energy, we experiment with both the standard and energy-reduced implementations of HMAC for different input sizes (in bytes). Our results show up to 17% reduction in energy consumption by HMAC, while preserving function. Such energy savings in HMAC, by virtue of HMAC's prevalent use in existing network protocols, extrapolate to lighter-weight network operations with respect to total energy consumption."}}
