Unrolled differentiation is a popular heuristic that approximates the solution using an iterative solver and differentiates it through the computational path. This work provides a non-asymptotic convergence-rate analysis of this approach on quadratic objectives for gradient descent and the Chebyshev method. We show that to ensure convergence of the Jacobian, we can either 1) choose a large learning rate leading to a fast asymptotic convergence but accept that the algorithm may have an arbitrarily long burn-in phase or 2) choose a smaller learning rate leading to an immediate but slower convergence. We refer to this phenomenon as the curse of unrolling.\nFinally, we discuss open problems relative to this approach, such as deriving a practical update rule for the optimal unrolling strategy and making novel connections with the field of Sobolev orthogonal polynomials."}}

The average-case framework allows a more fine-grained and representative analysis of convergence than usual worst-case results, in exchange for a more precise hypothesis over the data generating process, namely assuming knowledge of the expected spectral distribution (e.s.d) of the random matrix associated with the problem. In this work, we show that a problem's asymptotic average complexity is determined by the concentration of eigenvalues near the edges of the e.s.d. We argue that having \u00e0 priori information on this concentration is a more grounded assumption than complete knowledge of the e.s.d.,  and that basing our analysis on the approximate concentration is effectively a middle ground between the coarseness of the worst-case convergence and this more unrealistic hypothesis. We introduce the Generalized Chebyshev method, asymptotically optimal under a hypothesis on this concentration, and globally optimal when the e.s.d. follows  a Beta distribution. We compare its performance to classical optimization algorithms, such as Gradient Descent or Nesterov's scheme, and we show that, asymptotically, Nesterov's method is universally nearly-optimal in the average-case."}}

We define the spectral shape of a family of games as the set containing all eigenvalues of the Jacobians of standard gradient dynamics in the family. Shapes restricted to the real line represent well-understood classes of problems, like minimization. Shapes spanning the complex plane capture the added numerical challenges in solving smooth games. In this framework, we describe gradient-based methods, such as extragradient, as transformations on the spectral shape. Using this perspective, we propose an optimal algorithm for bilinear games. For smooth and strongly monotone operators, we identify a continuum between convex minimization, where acceleration is possible using Polyak's momentum, and the worst case where gradient descent is optimal. Finally, going beyond first-order methods, we propose an accelerated version of consensus optimization."}}

We force the classifier (hyperplane) of each class to belong to a sphere manifold, whose center is the classifier of its super-class. Then, individual sphere manifolds are connected based on their hierarchical relations. Our technique replaces the last layer of a neural network by combining a spherical fully-connected layer with a hierarchical layer. This regularization is shown to improve the performance of widely used deep neural network architectures (ResNet and DenseNet) on publicly available datasets (CIFAR100, CUB200, Stanford dogs, Stanford cars, and Tiny-ImageNet)."}}

However, the absence of symmetry in the matrix of second derivatives poses challenges that are not present in the classical minimization framework. While a rich theory of average-case analysis has been developed for minimization problems, little is known in the context of smooth games. In this work we take a first step towards closing this gap by developing average-case optimal first-order methods for a subset of smooth games. \nWe make the following three main contributions. First, we show that for zero-sum bilinear games the average-case optimal method is the optimal method for the minimization of the Hamiltonian. Second, we provide an explicit expression for the optimal method corresponding to normal matrices, potentially non-symmetric. Finally, we specialize it to matrices with eigenvalues located in a disk and show a provable speed-up compared to worst-case optimal algorithms. We illustrate our findings through benchmarks with a varying degree of mismatch with our assumptions."}}

Here, we investigate the benefits of nonlinear acceleration when applied to the training of neural networks, in particular for the task of image recognition on the CIFAR10 and ImageNet data sets. In our experiments, with minimal modifications to existing frameworks, RNA speeds up convergence and improves testing error on standard CNNs."}}

They were shown to achieve optimal convergence rates in a deterministic setting using simple gradient iterates.

We first derive convergence bounds for arbitrary, potentially biased perturbations, then produce asymptotic bounds using the ratio between the variance of the noise and the accuracy of the current point. Finally, we apply this acceleration technique to stochastic algorithms such as SGD, SAGA, SVRG and Katyusha in different settings, and show significant performance gains."}}

Multi-step schemes integrate the differential equation using larger step sizes, which intuitively explains the acceleration phenomenon."}}
