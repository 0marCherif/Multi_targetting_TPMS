Differentially private (DP) learning methods provide guarantees against identifying the existence of a training sample from model outputs. PATE is a recent DP learning algorithm that achieves high utility with strong privacy protection on training samples. However, text generation models output tokens sequentially in a large output space; the classic PATE algorithm is not customized for this setting. Furthermore, PATE works well to protect sample-level privacy, but is not designed to protect phrases in samples. In this paper, we propose SeqPATE, an extension of PATE to text generation that protects the privacy of individual training samples and sensitive phrases in training data. To adapt PATE to text generation, we generate pseudo-contexts and reduce the sequence generation problem to a next-word prediction problem. To handle the large output space, we propose a candidate filtering strategy to dynamically reduce the output space, and refine the teacher aggregation of PATE to avoid low agreement due to voting for a large number of candidates. To further reduce privacy losses, we use knowledge distillation to reduce the number of teacher queries. The experiments verify the effectiveness of SeqPATE in protecting both training samples and sensitive phrases."}}

Differentially private (DP) learning algorithms provide guarantees on identifying the existence of a training sample from model outputs. PATE is a DP learning algorithm that fits the large model well, such as GPT. In this paper, we propose SeqPATE that adapts PATE to text generation while satisfying DP. There are two key challenges in adapting PATE to text generation: (i) obtaining sequence-level supervision for text generation, and (ii) reducing noise required to protect privacy given the large output space (i.e. vocabulary size). For (i), we generate pseudo input and reduce the sequence generation problem to the next word prediction. For (ii), we reduce the output space with top-$k$ and top-$p$ selection strategy that dynamically filters the candidate words; and we refine the teacher aggregation mechanism of PATE to avoid the low agreement rates due to voting over the large output space. To limit the privacy loss, we design an efficient knowledge distillation to reduce the time of distilling from the private data. We apply SeqPATE to a simple text generation task (sentence completion) and achieves 39\\% and 28\\% gains in Bleu4 on two datasets."}}
