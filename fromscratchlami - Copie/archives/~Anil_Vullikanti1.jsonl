We also explore a number of variants where additional constraints are imposed on the first-stage decisions, specifically matroid and multi-knapsack constraints. \n\nOur eventual goal is to provide results for supplier problems in the most general distributional setting, where there is only black-box access to the underlying distribution. To that end, we follow a two-step approach. First, we develop algorithms for a restricted version of each problem, in which all possible scenarios are explicitly provided; second, we employ a novel scenario-discarding}variant of the standard Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method, in which we crucially exploit properties of the restricted-case algorithms. We finally note that the scenario-discarding modification to the SAA method is necessary in order to optimize over the radius."}}

In practice, there are numerous sources of uncertainty in the observed data. However, most prior works have overlooked such uncertainty, which can affect the accuracy and inferences of such methods. In this paper, we develop the first systematic approach to incorporating uncertainty in scan statistics. We study two formulations for robust scan statistics, one based on the sample average approximation and the other using a max-min objective. We show that uncertainty significantly increases the computational complexity of these problems. Rigorous algorithms and efficient heuristics for both formulations are developed with justification of theoretical bounds. We evaluate our proposed methods on synthetic and real datasets, and we observe that our methods give significant improvement in the detection power as well as optimization objective, relative to a baseline."}}

In this paper, we study an approach for identifying anomalous subgraphs based on the Heaviest Dynamic Subgraph (HDS) problem. The HDS in a time-evolving edge-weighted graph consists of a pair containing a subgraph and subinterval whose sum of edge weights is maximized. The HDS problem in a static graph is equivalent to the Prize Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) problem with the Net-Worth objective---this is a very challenging problem, in general, and numerous heuristics have been proposed. Prior methods for the HDS problem use the PCST solution as a heuristic, and run in time quadratic in the size of the graph. As a result, they do not scale well to large instances. In this paper, we develop a new approach for the HDS problem, which combines rigorous algorithmic and practical techniques and has much better scalability. Our algorithm is able to extend to other variations of the HDS problem, such as the problem of finding multiple anomalous regions. We evaluate our algorithms in a diverse set of real and synthetic networks, and we find solutions with higher score and better detection power for anomalous events compared to earlier heuristics."}}

Stockpiles of different supplies, e.g., personal protective equipments (PPE) and medical equipment, need to be maintained in order to be able to respond to any future pandemics. Large outbreaks occur with a low probability, and such stockpiles require big investments. Further, hospitals often have mutual sharing agreements, which makes the problem of stockpiling decisions a natural game-theoretical problem. In this paper, we formalize hospital stockpiling as a game-theoretical problem, HSTOCKPILE. We use the notion of pairwise Nash stability as a solution concept for this problem, and characterize its structure. We show that stable strategies can lead to high unsatisfied demands in some scenarios, and stockpiles might not be maintained at all nodes. We show that stable strategies and the social optimum can be computed efficiently."}}

Most of the work on vaccination games has focused on decisions at the start of an epidemic. However, a lot of people defer their vaccination decisions, in practice. For example, in the case of the seasonal flu, vaccination rates gradually increase, as the epidemic rate increases. This motivates the study of temporal vaccination games, in which vaccination decisions can be made more than once. An important issue in the context of temporal decisions is that of resource limitations, which may arise due to production and distribution constraints. While there has been some work on temporal vaccination games, resource constraints have not been considered.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we study temporal vaccination games for epidemics in the SI (susceptible-infectious) model, with resource constraints in the form of a repeated game in complex social networks, with budgets on the number of vaccines that can be taken at any time. We find that the resource constraints and the vaccination and infection costs have a significant impact on the structure of Nash equilibria (NE). In general, the budget constraints can cause NE to become very inefficient, and finding efficient NE as well as the social optimum are NP-hard problems. We develop algorithms for finding NE and approximating the social optimum. We evaluate our results using simulations on different kinds of networks."}}

Some of the basic questions are: How can an outbreak be contained before it becomes an epidemic, and what disease surveillance strategies should be implemented? These problems have been studied traditionally using differential equation methods, which are amenable to analysis and closed form solutions. However, these models are based on complete mixing assumptions, which do not hold for realistic populations, thereby limiting their utility. In this tutorial, we focus on an approach based on diffusion processes on complex networks. This captures more realistic populations, but leads to novel mathematical and computational challenges. The structure of the underlying networks has a significant impact on the dynamical properties, motivating the need for improved network models, and efficient algorithms for computing network and dynamical properties that scale to large networks. We provide an overview of the state of the art in computational epidemiology, which is a multi-disciplinary research area, that overlaps different areas in computer science, including data mining, machine learning, high performance computing and theoretical computer science, as well as mathematics, economics and statistics. Specifically, we will discuss mathematical and computational models, problems of inference, forecasting and state assessment, and epidemic containment."}}

We outline the system architecture of EMBERS, individual models that leverage specific data sources, and a fusion and suppression engine that supports trading off specific evaluation criteria. EMBERS also provides an audit trail interface that enables the investigation of why specific predictions were made along with the data utilized for forecasting. Through numerous evaluations, we demonstrate the superiority of EMBERS over baserate methods and its capability to forecast significant societal happenings."}}

Protective interventions such as vaccinations or installing anti-virus software are used to contain their spread. Typically, each node in the network has to decide its own strategy of securing itself, and its benefit depends on which other nodes are secure, making this a natural game-theoretic setting. There has been a lot of work on network security game models, but most of the focus has been either on simplified epidemic models or homogeneous network structure.\r\n\r\nWe develop a new formulation for an epidemic containment game, which relies on the characterization of the SIS model in terms of the spectral radius of the network. We show in this model that pure Nash equilibria (NE) always exist, and can be found by a best response strategy. We analyze the complexity of finding NE, and derive rigorous bounds on their costs and the Price of Anarchy or PoA (the ratio of the cost of the worst NE to the optimum social cost) in general graphs as well as in random graph models. In particular, for arbitrary power-law graphs with exponent \u03b2 > 2, we show that the PoA is bounded by O(T2(\u03b2 -1))), where T = \u03b3/\u03b1 is the ratio of the recovery rate to the transmission rate in the SIS model. We prove that this bound is tight up to a constant factor for the Chung-Lu random power-law graph model. We study the characteristics of Nash equilibria empirically in different real communication and infrastructure networks, and find that our analytical results can help explain some of the empirical observations."}}
