Based on how these issues were affecting PhD students in our department (the Carnegie Mellon University CS Department), we identified required DEI education for PhD students as a potentially high-impact approach to improving the PhD student experience in our program. Given that no existing curriculum met the desired criteria, we (PhD students)-alongside many members of the CMU community-developed and implemented CS-JEDI: Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in Computer Science. CS-JEDI is a 6-week DEI curriculum that is now taken by all first-year PhD students in our department. This paper covers CS-JEDI's motivation and goals; describes how its evidence-based curriculum is tailored to these goals and to the CS PhD context; and gives a data-driven evaluation of the extent to which CS-JEDI's first offering, in Spring 2022, achieved these goals."}}

One standard method for comparing voting rules is by their satisfaction of axioms - properties that we want a \"reasonable\" rule to satisfy. Unfortunately, this approach leads to several impossibilities: no voting rule can simultaneously satisfy all the properties we want, at least in the worst case over all possible inputs. Motivated by this, we consider a relaxation of these worst case requirements. We do so using a \"smoothed\" model of social choice, where votes are perturbed with small amounts of noise. If, no matter which input profile we start with, the probability (post-noise) of an axiom being satisfied is large, we will consider the axiom as good as satisfied - called \"smoothed-satisfied\" - even if it may be violated in the worst case. Our model is a mild restriction of Lirong Xia's, and corresponds closely to that in Spielman and Teng's original work on smoothed analysis. Much work has been done so far in several papers by Xia on axiom satisfaction under such noise. In our paper, we aim to give a more cohesive overview on when smoothed analysis of social choice is useful. Within our model, we give simple sufficient conditions for smoothed-satisfaction or smoothed-violation of several previously-unstudied axioms and paradoxes, plus many of those studied by Xia. We then observe that, in a practically important subclass of noise models, although convergence eventually occurs, known rates may require an extremely large number of voters. Motivated by this, we prove bounds specifically within a canonical noise model from this subclass - the Mallows model. Here, we present a more nuanced picture on exactly when smoothed analysis can help."}}

One method of subversion that has recently emerged occurs when users form groups, called pods, to facilitate reciprocity abuse, where each member reciprocally interacts with content posted by other members of the group. We collect 1.8 million Instagram posts that were posted in pods hosted on Telegram. We first summarize the properties of these pods and how they are used, uncovering that they are easily discoverable by Google search and have a low barrier to entry. We then create two machine learning models for detecting Instagram posts that have gained interaction through two different kinds of pods, achieving 0.91 and 0.94 AUC, respectively. Finally, we find that pods are effective tools for increasing users\u2019 Instagram popularity, we estimate that pod utilization leads to a significantly increased level of likely organic comment interaction on users\u2019 subsequent posts."}}
