A prominent direction to reduce the cost is to learn with noisy labels, which are ubiquitous in the real-world applications. A critical challenge for such a learning task is to reduce the effect of network memorization on the falsely-labeled data. In this work, we propose an iterative selection approach based on the Weibull mixture model, which identifies clean data by considering the overall learning dynamics of each data instance. In contrast to the previous small-loss heuristics, we leverage the observation that deep network is easy to memorize and hard to forget clean data. In particular, we measure the difficulty of memorization and forgetting for each instance via the transition times between being misclassified and being memorized in training, and integrate them into a novel metric for selection. Based on the proposed metric, we retain a subset of identified clean data and repeat the selection procedure to iteratively refine the clean subset, which is finally used for model training. To validate our method, we perform extensive experiments on synthetic noisy datasets and real-world web data, and our strategy outperforms existing noisy-label learning methods."}}

Existing meta-learning frameworks typically rely on the body-level representations in spatial dimension, which limits the generalisation to capture subtle visual differences in the fine-grained label space. To overcome the above limitation, we propose a part-aware prototypical representation for one-shot skeleton-based action recognition. Our method captures skeleton motion patterns at two distinctive spatial levels, one for global contexts among all body joints, referred to as body level, and the other attends to local spatial regions of body parts, referred to as the part level. We also devise a class-agnostic attention mechanism to highlight important parts for each action class. Specifically, we develop a part-aware prototypical graph network consisting of three modules: a cascaded embedding module for our dual-level modelling, an attention-based part fusion module to fuse parts and generate part-aware prototypes, and a matching module to perform classification with the part-aware representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two public skeleton-based action recognition datasets: NTU RGB+D 120 and NW-UCLA."}}

However, in real-world situations, domain shift often exits and significantly affects the accuracy of existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection models. In this work, we propose a dual-level OOD detection framework to handle domain shift and semantic shift jointly. The first level distinguishes whether domain shift exists in the image by leveraging global low-level features, while the second level identifies pixels with semantic shift by utilizing dense high-level feature maps. In this way, we can selectively adapt the model to unseen domains as well as enhance model's capacity in detecting novel classes. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method on several OOD segmentation benchmarks, including those with significant domain shifts and those without, observing consistent performance improvements across various baseline models."}}

To further improve its downstream accuracy, existing works propose additional learnable modules upon CLIP and fine-tune them by few-shot training sets. However, the resulting extra training cost and data requirement severely hinder the efficiency for model deployment and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we introduce a free-lunch enhancement method, CALIP, to boost CLIP's zero-shot performance via a parameter-free attention module. Specifically, we guide visual and textual representations to interact with each other and explore cross-modal informative features via attention. As the pre-training has largely reduced the embedding distances between two modalities, we discard all learnable parameters in the attention and bidirectionally update the multi-modal features, enabling the whole process to be parameter-free and training-free. In this way, the images are blended with textual-aware signals and the text representations become visual-guided for better adaptive zero-shot alignment. We evaluate CALIP on various benchmarks of 14 datasets for both 2D image and 3D point cloud few-shot classification, showing consistent zero-shot performance improvement over CLIP. Based on that, we further insert a small number of linear layers in CALIP's attention module and verify our robustness under the few-shot settings, which also achieves leading performance compared to existing methods. Those extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach for efficient enhancement of CLIP. Code is available at https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/CALIP."}}

However, in real-world recognition tasks, the class distributions of their corresponding datasets are often imbalanced, which leads to serious performance degeneration of those methods. In this paper, we consider a more realistic setting for novel class discovery where the distributions of novel and known classes are long-tailed. One main challenge of this new problem is to discover imbalanced novel classes with the help of long-tailed known classes. To tackle this problem, we propose an adaptive self-labeling strategy based on an equiangular prototype representation of classes. Our method infers high-quality pseudo-labels for the novel classes by solving a relaxed optimal transport problem and effectively mitigates the class biases in learning the known and novel classes. We perform extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet100, Herbarium19 and large-scale iNaturalist18 datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Previous mainstream VLP approaches typically adopt a two-step strategy relying on external object detectors to encode images in a multi-modal Transformer framework, which suffer from restrictive object concept space, limited image context and inefficient computation. In this paper, we propose an object-aware end-to-end VLP framework, which directly feeds image grid features from CNNs into the Transformer and learns the multi-modal representations jointly. More importantly, we propose to perform object knowledge distillation to facilitate learning cross-modal alignment at different semantic levels. To achieve that, we design two novel pretext tasks by taking object features and their semantic labels from external detectors as supervision: 1.) Object-guided masked vision modeling task focuses on enforcing object-aware representation learning in the multi-modal Transformer; 2.) Phrase-region alignment task aims to improve cross-modal alignment by utilizing the similarities between noun phrases and object labels in the linguistic space. Extensive experiments on a wide range of vision-language tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, and we achieve competitive or superior performances over the existing pretraining strategies.

Most existing methods neglect the pixel correlation and structural prior in segmentation, often producing noisy predictions around object boundaries. To address this, we adopt a superpixel representation and develop a robust iterative learning strategy that combines noise-aware training of segmentation network and noisy label refinement, both guided by the superpixels. This design enables us to exploit the structural constraints in segmentation labels and effectively mitigate the impact of label noise in learning. Experiments on two benchmarks show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches, and achieves superior robustness in a wide range of label noises. "}}
