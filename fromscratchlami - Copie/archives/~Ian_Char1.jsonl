Notably, there has been some recent interest in utilizing gradient information in pretrained models for OOD detection. While these methods are competitive, we argue that previous works conflate their performance with the necessity of gradients. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of gradient-based methods and elucidate the key components that warrant their OOD detection performance. We further demonstrate that a general, non-gradient-based family of OOD detection methods are just as competitive, casting doubt on the usefulness of gradients for OOD detection"}}

In cases where the expensive transition dynamics can be readily evaluated at specified states (e.g., via a simulator), agents can operate in what is often referred to as planning with a \\emph{generative model}. We propose the AE-LSVI algorithm for best policy identification, a novel variant of the kernelized least-squares value iteration (LSVI) algorithm that combines optimism with pessimism for active exploration (AE). AE-LSVI provably identifies a near-optimal policy \\emph{uniformly} over an entire state space and achieves polynomial sample complexity guarantees that are independent of the number of states. When specialized to the recently introduced offline contextual Bayesian optimization setting, our algorithm achieves improved sample complexity bounds. Experimentally, we demonstrate that AE-LSVI outperforms other RL algorithms in a variety of environments when robustness to the initial state is required. "}}

Past efforts for developing algorithms in this area have revolved around introducing constraints to online reinforcement learning algorithms to ensure the actions of the learned policy are constrained to the logged data. In this work, we explore an alternative approach by planning on the fixed dataset directly. Specifically, we introduce an algorithm which forms a tabular Markov Decision Process (MDP) over the logged data by adding new transitions to the dataset. We do this by using learned dynamics models to plan short trajectories between states. Since exact value iteration can be performed on this constructed MDP, it becomes easy to identify which trajectories are advantageous to add to the MDP. Crucially, since most transitions in this MDP come from the logged data, trajectories from the MDP can be rolled out for long periods with confidence. We prove that this property allows one to make upper and lower bounds on the value function up to appropriate distance metrics. Finally, we demonstrate empirically how algorithms that uniformly constrain the learned policy to the entire dataset can result in unwanted behavior, and we show an example in which simply behavior cloning the optimal policy of the MDP created by our algorithm avoids this problem."}}

A model that predicts the true conditional quantiles for each input, at all quantile levels, presents a correct and efficient representation of the underlying uncertainty. To achieve this, many current quantile-based methods focus on optimizing the pinball loss. However, this loss restricts the scope of applicable regression models, limits the ability to target many desirable properties (e.g. calibration, sharpness, centered intervals), and may produce poor conditional quantiles. In this work, we develop new quantile methods that address these shortcomings. In particular, we propose methods that can apply to any class of regression model, select an explicit balance between calibration and sharpness, optimize for calibration of centered intervals, and produce more accurate conditional quantiles. We provide a thorough experimental evaluation of our methods, which includes a high dimensional uncertainty quantification task in nuclear fusion."}}
