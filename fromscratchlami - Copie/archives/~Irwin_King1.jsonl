Every online transaction corresponds to a directed edge from the paying party to the receiving party in this graph. Even though the superior learning capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has led to several successful financial applications like fraud detection and anti-money laundering, most of these existing works do not have fairness considerations. Apparently, the lack of fairness guarantees during the GNN-based decision-making process would cause increasingly serious societal concerns from both buyers and sellers. Furthermore, the time-varying property of the financial networks makes the fairness requirements more challenging, since current fairness measures on graph learning tasks and fairness-aware GNN models are all designed for static graphs only. In this work, we present a new generic definition of individual fairness for dynamic graphs and propose a regularization-based method to debias the GNN model in the temporal setting. We perform some preliminary experimental evaluations on two real-world datasets and demonstrate the potential efficacy of the proposed methods."}}

Generally, most existing GNNs depend on the implicit homophily assumption that nodes belonging to the same class are more likely to be connected. However, GNNs may fail to model heterophilious graphs where nodes with different labels tend to be linked, as shown in recent studies.  To address this issue, we propose a generic GNN applicable to both homophilious and heterophilious graphs, namely Low-Rank Graph Neural Network (LRGNN). In detail, we aim at computing a coefficient matrix such that the sign of each coefficient reveals whether the corresponding two nodes belong to the same class, which is similar to the sign inference problem. In Signed Social Networks (SSNs), the sign inference problem can be modeled as a low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF) problem due to the global low-rank structure described by the weak balance theory. In this paper, we show that signed graphs are naturally generalized weakly-balanced when considering node classification tasks. Motivated by this observation, we propose to leverage LRMF to recover a coefficient matrix from a partially observed signed adjacency matrix. To effectively capture the node similarity, we further incorporate the low-rank representation (LRR) method. Our theoretical result shows that under our update rule of node representations, LRR obtained by solving a subspace clustering problem can recover the subspace structure of node representations. To solve the corresponding optimization problem, we utilize an iterative optimization algorithm with a convergence guarantee and develop a neural-style initialization manner that enables fast convergence. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic graphs has validated the superior performance of LRGNN over various state-of-the-art GNNs. In particular, LRGNN can offer clear performance gains in a scenario when the node features are not informative enough."}}

In spite of the remarkable achievements, the performance of Euclidean models in graph-related learning is still bounded and limited by the representation ability of Euclidean geometry, especially for datasets with highly non-Euclidean latent anatomy. Recently, hyperbolic space has gained increasing popularity in processing graph data with tree-like structure and power-law distribution, owing to its exponential growth property. In this survey, we comprehensively revisit the technical details of the current hyperbolic graph neural networks, unifying them into a general framework and summarizing the variants of each component. More importantly, we present various HGNN-related applications. Last, we also identify several challenges, which potentially serve as guidelines for further flourishing the achievements of graph learning in hyperbolic spaces."}}

The latent features (also known as embeddings) used to describe the user and item are determined by how well the embedding space fits the data distribution. Hyperbolic space offers a spacious room to learn embeddings with its negative curvature and metric properties, which can well fit data with tree-like structures. Recently, several hyperbolic approaches have been proposed to learn high-quality representations for the users and items. However, most of them concentrate on developing the hyperbolic similitude by designing appropriate projection operations, whereas many advantageous and exciting geometric properties of hyperbolic space have not been explicitly explored. For example, one of the most notable properties of hyperbolic space is that its capacity space increases exponentially with the radius, which indicates the area far away from the hyperbolic origin is much more embeddable. Regarding the geometric properties of hyperbolic space, we bring up a Hyperbolic Regularization powered Collaborative Filtering(HRCF) and design a geometric-aware hyperbolic regularizer. Specifically, the proposal boosts optimization procedure via the root alignment and origin-aware penalty, which is simple yet impressively effective. Through theoretical analysis, we further show that our proposal is able to tackle the over-smoothing problem caused by hyperbolic aggregation and also brings the models a better discriminative ability. We conduct extensive empirical analysis, comparing our proposal against a large set of baselines on several public benchmarks. The empirical results show that our approach achieves highly competitive performance and surpasses both the leading Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines by considerable margins."}}

The advantage of hyperbolic recommendation lies in that its exponentially increasing capacity is well-suited to describe the power-law distributed user-item network whereas the Euclidean equivalent is deficient. Nonetheless, it remains unclear which kinds of items can be effectively recommended by the hyperbolic model and which cannot. To address the above concerns, we take the most basic recommendation technique, collaborative filtering, as a medium, to investigate the behaviors of hyperbolic and Euclidean recommendation models. The results reveal that (1) tail items get more emphasis in hyperbolic space than that in Euclidean space, but there is still ample room for improvement; (2) head items receive modest attention in hyperbolic space, which could be considerably improved; (3) and nonetheless, the hyperbolic models show more competitive performance than Euclidean models. Driven by the above observations, we design a novel learning method, named hyperbolic informative collaborative filtering (HICF), aiming to compensate for the recommendation effectiveness of the head item while at the same time improving the performance of the tail item. The main idea is to adapt the hyperbolic margin ranking learning, making its pull and push procedure geometric-aware, and providing informative guidance for the learning of both head and tail items. Extensive experiments back up the analytic findings and also show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The work is valuable for personalized recommendations since it reveals that the hyperbolic space facilitates modeling the tail item, which often represents user-customized preferences or new products."}}

However, most existing quantization methods for PLMs follow quantization-aware training~(QAT) that requires end-to-end training with full access to the entire dataset. Therefore, they suffer from slow training, large memory overhead, and data accessibility issues. In this paper, we study post-training quantization~(PTQ) of PLMs, and propose module-wise quantization error minimization~(MREM), an efficient solution to mitigate these issues. By partitioning the PLM into multiple modules, we minimize the reconstruction error incurred by quantization for each module. In addition, we design a new model parallel training strategy such that each module can be trained locally on separate computing devices without waiting for preceding modules, which brings nearly the theoretical training speed-up (e.g., $4\\times$ on $4$ GPUs). Experiments on GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks show that our proposed PTQ solution not only performs close to QAT, but also enjoys significant reductions in training time, memory overhead, and data consumption."}}

Specifically, we propose the Conversation Completion (ConvCom) task, which attempts to select the correct answer from candidate answers to fill a masked utterance in a conversation. Then, we Pre-train a basic COntext- Dependent Encoder (Pre-CODE) on the ConvCom task. Finally, we fine-tune the Pre-CODE on the datasets of ERC.

However, the complex patterns and potential noises in the large-scale data make training NMT models difficult. In this work, we explore to identify the inactive training examples which contribute less to the model performance, and show that the existence of inactive examples depends on the data distribution. We further introduce data rejuvenation to improve the training of NMT models on large-scale datasets by exploiting inactive examples. The proposed framework consists of three phases. First, we train an identification model on the original training data, and use it to distinguish inactive examples and active examples by their sentence-level output probabilities. Then, we train a rejuvenation model on the active examples, which is used to re-label the inactive examples with forward-translation. Finally, the rejuvenated examples and the active examples are combined to train the final NMT model. Experimental results on WMT14 English-German and English-French datasets show that the proposed data rejuvenation consistently and significantly improves performance for several strong NMT models. Extensive analyses reveal that our approach stabilizes and accelerates the training process of NMT models, resulting in final models with better generalization capability."}}

The common practice is to construct synthetic data based on a randomly sampled subset of large-scale monolingual data, which we empirically show is sub-optimal. In this work, we propose to improve the sampling procedure by selecting the most informative monolingual sentences to complement the parallel data. To this end, we compute the uncertainty of monolingual sentences using the bilingual dictionary extracted from the parallel data. Intuitively, monolingual sentences with lower uncertainty generally correspond to easy-to-translate patterns which may not provide additional gains. Accordingly, we design an uncertainty-based sampling strategy to efficiently exploit the monolingual data for self-training, in which monolingual sentences with higher uncertainty would be sampled with higher probability. Experimental results on large-scale WMT English\u21d2German and English\u21d2Chinese datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Extensive analyses suggest that emphasizing the learning on uncertain monolingual sentences by our approach does improve the translation quality of high-uncertainty sentences and also benefits the prediction of low-frequency words at the target side."}}
