Few-shot learning aims to alleviate this issue by learning effectively from few labelled examples. In previously proposed few-shot visual classifiers, it is assumed that the feature manifold, where classifier decisions are made, has uncorrelated feature dimensions and uniform feature variance. In this work, we focus on addressing the limitations arising from this assumption by proposing a variance-sensitive class of models that operates in a low-label regime. The first method, Simple CNAPS, employs a hierarchically regularized Mahalanobis-distance based classifier combined with a state of the art neural adaptive feature extractor to achieve strong performance on Meta-Dataset, mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet benchmarks. We further extend this approach to a transductive learning setting, proposing Transductive CNAPS. This transductive method combines a soft k-means parameter refinement procedure with a two-step task encoder to achieve improved test-time classification accuracy using unlabelled data. Transductive CNAPS achieves state of the art performance on Meta-Dataset. Finally, we explore the use of our methods (Simple and Transductive) for \"out of the box\" continual and active learning. Extensive experiments on large scale benchmarks illustrate robustness and versatility of this, relatively speaking, simple class of models. All trained model checkpoints and corresponding source codes have been made publicly available."}}

Yet, mobile apps cannot directly evaluate the impact of their content and services on user stress. We introduce the Beam AI SDK to address this issue. Using our SDK, apps can monitor user stress through the selfie camera in real-time. Our technology extracts the user's pulse wave by analyzing subtle color variations across the skin regions of the user's face. The user's pulse wave is then used to determine stress (according to the Baevsky Stress Index), heart rate, and heart rate variability. We evaluate our technology on the UBFC dataset, the MMSE-HR dataset, and Beam AI's internal data. Our technology achieves 99.2%, 97.8% and 98.5% accuracy for heart rate estimation on each benchmark respectively, a nearly twice lower error rate than competing methods. We further demonstrate an average Pearson correlation of 0.801 in determining stress and heart rate variability, thus producing commercially useful readings to derive content decisions in apps. Our SDK is available for use at www.beamhealth.ai."}}

Most few-shot learning approaches to date have focused on progressively more complex neural feature extractors and classifier adaptation strategies, and the refinement of the task definition itself. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that a simple class-covariance-based distance metric, namely the Mahalanobis distance, adopted into a state of the art few-shot learning approach (CNAPS) can, in and of itself, lead to a significant performance improvement. We also discover that it is possible to learn adaptive feature extractors that allow useful estimation of the high dimensional feature covariances required by this metric from surprisingly few samples. The result of our work is a new \"Simple CNAPS\" architecture which has up to 9.2% fewer trainable parameters than CNAPS and performs up to 6.1% better than state of the art on the standard few-shot image classification benchmark dataset."}}

We evaluate our approach on the Grammarly Corpus for Discourse Coherence (GCDC) and show that when ensembled with the current state of the art, we can achieve the new state of the art accuracy on this benchmark. Furthermore, when deployed alone, RST-Recursive achieves competitive accuracy while having 62% fewer parameters."}}
