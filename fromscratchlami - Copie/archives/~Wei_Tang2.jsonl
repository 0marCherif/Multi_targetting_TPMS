Albeit the recent advancement, one of the major challenges still remains: noisy pseudo labels hinder efficient learning on abundant unlabeled videos, embodied as location biases and category errors. In this paper, we dive deep into such an important but understudied dilemma. To this end, we propose a unified framework, termed Noisy Pseudo-Label Learning, to handle both location biases and category errors. Specifically, our method is featured with (1) Noisy Label Ranking to rank pseudo labels based on the semantic confidence and boundary reliability, (2) Noisy Label Filtering to address the class-imbalance problem of pseudo labels caused by category errors, (3) Noisy Label Learning to penalize in\u0002consistent boundary predictions to achieve noise-tolerant learning for heavy location biases. As a result, our method could effectively handle the label noise problem and improve the utilization of a large amount of unlabeled videos. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at github.com/kunnxia/NPL."}}

Despite recent success in 2D HPE, 3D pose regression from 2D detections remains challenging due to the substantial depth ambiguity. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been exploited to model the relationships among body joints and demonstrate promising results. In this paper, we go one step further along this direction and propose a novel framework, termed Compositional GCN, for 3D HPE. It learns compositional relationships among body parts of different semantic levels and then exploits multilevel structural reasoning to reduce the depth uncertainty. Furthermore, we introduce a novel part-aware graph convolution. It not only disentangles self and neighbor transformations but also captures different relational patterns between each part and their respective neighbors. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}

However, since the vanilla graph convolution is performed on the one-hop neighbors of each node, it is unable to capture the long-range dependencies between body joints. They can help reduce the uncertainty caused by occlusion or depth ambiguity. To resolve this issue, we propose a high-order GCN for 3D HPE. Its core building block, termed a high-order graph convolution, aggregates features of nodes at various distances. As a result, the network can model a wide range of interactions among body joints. Furthermore, we investigate different methods to fuse those multi-order features and compare how they affect the performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}

However, most prior GCN approaches suffer from two main drawbacks. First, they share a feature transformation for each node within a graph convolution layer. This prevents them from learning different relations between different body joints. Second, the graph is usually defined according to the human skeleton and is suboptimal because human activities often exhibit motion patterns beyond the natural connections of body joints. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Modulated GCN for 3D HPE. It consists of two main components: weight modulation and affinity modulation. Weight modulation learns different modulation vectors for different nodes so that the feature transformations of different nodes are disentangled while retaining a small model size. Affinity modulation adjusts the graph structure in a GCN so that it can model additional edges beyond the human skeleton. We investigate several affinity modulation methods as well as the impact of regularizations. Rigorous ablation study indicates both types of modulation improve performance with negligible overhead. Compared with state-of-the-art GCNs for 3D HPE, our approach either significantly reduces the estimation errors, e.g., by around 10%, while retaining a small model size or drastically reduces the model size, e.g., from 4.22M to 0.29M (a 14.5 X reduction), while achieving comparable performance. Results on two benchmarks show our Modulated GCN outperforms some recent states of the art. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhimingZo/Modulated-GCN."}}

Recent approaches have achieved high av- erage scores on some popular benchmarks, but fail in detecting rare re- lations, as the highly long-tailed distribution of data biases the learning towards frequent labels. Motivated by the fact that detecting these rare relations can be critical in real-world applications, this paper introduces a novel integrated framework of classification and ranking to resolve the class imbalance problem in scene graph parsing. Specifically, we design a new Contrasting Cross-Entropy loss, which promotes the detection of rare relations by suppressing incorrect frequent ones. Furthermore, we propose a novel scoring module, termed as Scorer, which learns to rank the relations based on the image features and relation features to improve the recall of predictions. Our framework is simple and effective, and can be incorporated into current scene graph models. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves the current state-of-the-art methods, with a clear advantage of detecting rare relations."}}

It is more challenging than its single-label counterpart. On one hand, the un- constrained number of labels assigned to each image makes the model more easily overfit to those seen classes. On the other hand, there is a large semantic gap between seen and unseen classes in the existing multi-label classification datasets. To address these diffi- cult issues, this paper introduces a novel multi-label zero-shot classification framework by learning to transfer from external knowledge. We observe that ImageNet is commonly used to pretrain the feature extractor and has a large and fine-grained label space. This motivates us to exploit it as external knowledge to bridge the seen and unseen classes and promote generalization. Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph including not only classes from the target dataset but also those from ImageNet. Since ImageNet labels are not available in the target dataset, we propose a novel PosVAE module to infer their initial states in the extended knowledge graph. Then we design a relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) to propagate information among classes and achieve knowledge trans- fer. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}
