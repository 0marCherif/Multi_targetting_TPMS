In this task, there are often three types of information  -- graph structure, node features, and node labels. Existing GNNs usually leverage both node features and graph structure by feature transformation and aggregation, following end-to-end training via node labels. In this paper, we change our perspective by considering these three types of information as three views of nodes. This perspective motivates us to design a new GNN framework as multi-view learning which enables alternating optimization training instead of end-to-end training,  resulting in significantly improved computation and memory efficiency. Extensive experiments with different settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. \n"}}
