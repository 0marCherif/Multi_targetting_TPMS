Most prior art utilizes text for rating prediction, but rare work connects it to top-recommendation. Moreover, although advanced recommendation models capable of incorporating auxiliary information have been developed, none of these are specifically designed to model textual information, yielding a limited usage scenario for typical user-to-item recommendation. In this work, we present a framework of text-aware preference ranking (TPR) for top- recommendation, in which we comprehensively model the joint association of user-item interaction and relations between items and associated text. Using the TPR framework, we construct a joint likelihood function that explicitly describes two ranking structures: 1) item preference ranking (IPR) and 2) word relatedness ranking (WRR), where the former captures the item preference of each user and the latter captures the word relatedness of each item. As these two explicit structures are by nature mutually dependent, we propose TPR-OPT, a simple yet effective learning criterion that additionally includes implicit structures, such as relatedness between items and relatedness between words for each user for model optimization. Such a design not only successfully describes the joint association among users, words, and text comprehensively but also naturally yields powerful representations that are suitable for a range of recommendation tasks, including user-to-item, item-to-item, and user-to-word recommendation, as well as item-to-word reconstruction. In this paper, extensive experiments have been conducted on eight recommendation datasets, the results of which demonstrate that by including textual information from item descriptions, the proposed TPR model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various recommendation tasks."}}

The proposed approach first leverages user viewing patterns regarding time and TV channels to identify potential candidates for recommendation and then further leverages user preferences to rank these candidates given textual information about programs. To evaluate the method, we conduct empirical studies on a real-world TV dataset, the results of which demonstrate the superior performance of our model in terms of both recommendation accuracy and time efficiency."}}

Specifically, the developed criterion borrows the concept and the flexibility of the skew normal distribution, based on which three hyperparameters are attached to the optimization criterion. Furthermore, from a theoretical point of view, we not only establish the relation between the maximization of the proposed criterion and the shape parameter in the skew normal distribution, but also provide the analogies and asymptotic analysis of the proposed criterion to maximization of the area under the ROC curve. Experimental results conducted on a range of large-scale real-world datasets show that our model significantly outperforms the state of the art and yields consistently best performance on all tested datasets."}}

Based on the text-to-text transfer transformer (T5) model, this work explores a template-based approach to extract implicit knowledge for commonsense reasoning on multiple-choice (MC) question answering tasks. Experiments on three representative MC datasets show the surprisingly good performance of our simple template, coupled with a logit normalization technique for disambiguation. Furthermore, we verify that our proposed template can be easily extended to other MC tasks with contexts such as supporting facts in open-book question answering settings. Starting from the MC task, this work initiates further research to find generic natural language templates that can effectively leverage stored knowledge in pretrained models."}}

As queries in information seeking dialogues are ambiguous for traditional ad-hoc information retrieval (IR) systems due to the coreference and omission resolution problems inherent in natural language dialogue, resolving these ambiguities is crucial. In this paper, we tackle conversational passage retrieval (ConvPR), an important component of conversational search, by addressing query ambiguities with query reformulation integrated into a multi-stage ad-hoc IR system. Specifically, we propose two conversational query reformulation (CQR) methods: (1) term importance estimation and (2) neural query rewriting. For the former, we expand conversational queries using important terms extracted from the conversational context with frequency-based signals. For the latter, we reformulate conversational queries into natural, standalone, human-understandable queries with a pretrained sequence-tosequence model. Detailed analyses of the two CQR methods are provided quantitatively and qualitatively, explaining their advantages, disadvantages, and distinct behaviors. Moreover, to leverage the strengths of both CQR methods, we propose combining their output with reciprocal rank fusion, yielding state-of-the-art retrieval effectiveness, 30% improvement in terms of NDCG@3 compared to the best submission of TREC CAsT 2019."}}

In CQR benchmarks of task-oriented dialogue systems, we evaluate fine-tuned PLMs on the recently-introduced CANARD dataset as an in-domain task and validate the models using data from the TREC 2019 CAsT Track as an out-domain task. Examining a variety of architectures with different numbers of parameters, we demonstrate that the recent text-to-text transfer transformer (T5) achieves the best results both on CANARD and CAsT with fewer parameters, compared to similar transformer architectures."}}
