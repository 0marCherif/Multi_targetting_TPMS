Traditionally, estimation of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM) is performed in an i.i.d setting. More recently, such models have been extended to allow for changes in the distribution, but primarily where changepoints are known a-priori. In this work, we study the Group-Fused Graphical Lasso (GFGL) which penalises partial-correlations with an L1 penalty while simultaneously inducing block-wise smoothness over time to detect multiple changepoints. We present a proof of consistency for the estimator, both in terms of changepoints, and the structure of the graphical models in each segment. We contrast our results, which are based on a global, i.e. graph wide likelihood, with those previously obtained for performing dynamic graph estimation at a node-wise (or neighbourhood) level."}}

The key objective is to obtain max-\nimum likelihood estimates of the model parameters. For this task, we devise a fast,\nscalable Monte Carlo EM type algorithm based on case-control approximation of the\nlog-likelihood coupled with a subsampling approach. A key feature of the proposed\nalgorithm is its parallelizability, by processing portions of the data on several cores,\nwhile leveraging communication of key statistics across the cores during each itera-\ntion of the algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on synthetic\ndata sets and compared with competing methods for blockmodel parameter estima-\ntion. We also illustrate the model on data from a Facebook derived social network\nenhanced with node covariate information"}}
