However, LLMs are vulnerable to prompt-injection attacks: a class of attacks that hijack the model's instruction-following abilities, changing responses to prompts to undesired, possibly malicious ones. In this work, we introduce Jatmo, a method for generating task-specific models resilient to prompt-injection attacks. Jatmo leverages the fact that LLMs can only follow instructions once they have undergone instruction tuning. It harnesses a teacher instruction-tuned model to generate a task-specific dataset, which is then used to fine-tune a base model (i.e., a non-instruction-tuned model). Jatmo only needs a task prompt and a dataset of inputs for the task: it uses the teacher model to generate outputs. For situations with no pre-existing datasets, Jatmo can use a single example, or in some cases none at all, to produce a fully synthetic dataset. Our experiments on seven tasks show that Jatmo models provide similar quality of outputs on their specific task as standard LLMs, while being resilient to prompt injections. The best attacks succeeded in less than 0.5% of cases against our models, versus 87% success rate against GPT-3.5-Turbo. We release Jatmo at https://github.com/wagner-group/prompt-injection-defense."}}

In this paper, we explore the power of In-Context Learning (ICL) in manipulating the alignment ability of LLMs. We find that by providing just few in-context demonstrations without fine-tuning, LLMs can be manipulated to increase or decrease the probability of jailbreaking, i.e. answering malicious prompts. Based on these observations, we propose In-Context Attack (ICA) and In-Context Defense (ICD) methods for jailbreaking and guarding aligned language model purposes. ICA crafts malicious contexts to guide models in generating harmful outputs, while ICD enhances model robustness by demonstrations of rejecting to answer harmful prompts. Our experiments show the effectiveness of ICA and ICD in increasing or reducing the success rate of adversarial jailbreaking attacks. Overall, we shed light on the potential of ICL to influence LLM behavior and provide a new perspective for enhancing the safety and alignment of LLMs."}}

So far, most existing works focus on enhancing the overall model robustness, treating each class equally in both the training and testing phases. Although revealing the disparity in robustness among classes, few works try to make adversarial training fair at the class level without sacrificing overall robustness. In this paper, we are the first to theoretically and empirically investigate the preference of different classes for adversarial configurations, including perturbation margin, regularization, and weight averaging. Motivated by this, we further propose a \\textbf{C}lass-wise calibrated \\textbf{F}air \\textbf{A}dversarial training framework, named CFA, which customizes specific training configurations for each class automatically. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed CFA can improve both overall robustness and fairness notably over other state-of-the-art methods.

However, it is quite challenging to interpret and verify RNNs\u2019 behaviors directly. To this end, many efforts have been made to extract finite automata from RNNs. Existing approaches such as exact learning are effective in extracting finite-state models to characterize the state dynamics of RNNs for formal languages, but are limited in the scalability to process natural languages. Compositional approaches that are scablable to natural languages fall short in extraction precision. In this paper, we identify the transition sparsity problem that heavily impacts the extraction precision. To address this problem, we propose a transition rule extraction approach, which is scalable to natural language processing models and effective in improving extraction precision. Specifically, we propose an empirical method to complement the missing rules in the transition diagram. In addition, we further adjust the transition matrices to enhance the context-aware ability of the extracted weighted finite automaton (WFA). Finally, we propose two data augmentation tactics to track more dynamic behaviors of the target RNN. Experiments on two popular natural language datasets show that our method can extract WFA from RNN for natural language processing with better precision than existing approaches.
