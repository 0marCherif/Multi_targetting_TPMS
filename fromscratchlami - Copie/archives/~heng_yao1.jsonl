We then provide theoretical insight into why error-based prioritized sampling improves convergence rate upon uniform sampling when minimizing mean squared error during early learning. Based on the insight, we further point out two limitations of the prioritized ER method: 1) outdated priorities and 2) insufficient coverage of the sample space. To mitigate the limitations, we propose our model-based stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics sampling method. We show that our method does provide states distributed close to an ideal prioritized sampling distribution estimated by the brute-force method, which does not suffer from the two limitations. We conduct experiments on both discrete and continuous control problems to show our approach's efficacy and examine the practical implication of our method in an autonomous driving application. "}}

An important technique for acceleration is step-size adaptation. The first part of this paper contains a detailed review of step-size adaptation methods, including Polyak step-size, L4, LossGrad, Adam, IDBD, and Hypergradient descent, and the relation of step-size adaptation to meta-gradient methods. In the second part of this paper, we propose a new class of methods of accelerating gradient descent that have some distinctiveness from existing techniques. The new methods, which we call {\\em step-size planning}, use the {\\em update experience} to learn an improved way of updating the parameters. The methods organize the experience into $K$ steps away from each other to facilitate planning. From the past experience, our planning algorithm, Csawg, learns a step-size model which is a form of multi-step machine that predicts future updates. We extends Csawg to applying step-size planning multiple steps, which leads to further speedup. We discuss and highlight the projection power of the diagonal-matrix step-size for future large scale applications. We show for a convex problem, our methods can surpass the convergence rate of Nesterov's accelerated gradient, $1 - \\sqrt{\\mu/L}$, where $\\mu, L$ are the strongly convex factor of the loss function $F$ and the Lipschitz constant of $F'$, which is the theoretical limit for the convergence rate of first-order methods. On the well-known non-convex Rosenbrock function, our planning methods achieve zero error below 500 gradient evaluations, while gradient descent takes about 10000 gradient evaluations to reach a $10^{-3}$ accuracy. We discuss the connection of step-size planing to planning in reinforcement learning, in particular, Dyna architectures.

In this paper, we study the training robustness of distributional Reinforcement Learning~(RL), a class of state-of-the-art methods that estimate the whole distribution, as opposed to only the expectation, of the total return. Firstly, we propose State-Noisy Markov Decision Process~(SN-MDP) in the tabular case to incorporate both random and adversarial state observation noises, in which the contraction of both expectation-based and distributional Bellman operators is derived. Beyond SN-MDP with the function approximation, we theoretically characterize the bounded gradient norm of histogram-based distributional loss, accounting for the better training robustness of distribution RL. We also provide stricter convergence conditions of the Temporal-Difference~(TD) learning under more flexible state noises, as well as the sensitivity analysis by the leverage of influence function. Finally, extensive experiments on the suite of games show that distributional RL enjoys better training robustness compared with its expectation-based counterpart across various state observation noises."}}
