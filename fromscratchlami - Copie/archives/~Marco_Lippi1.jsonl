To promote their use and diffusion, intuitive and user-friendly interaction means should be adopted. In particular, gestures have become an established way to interact with robots since they allow to command them in an intuitive manner. In this article, we focus on the problem of gesture recognition in human\u2013robot interaction (HRI). While this problem has been largely studied in the literature, it poses specific constraints when applied to HRI. We propose a framework consisting in a pipeline devised to take into account these specific constraints. We implement the proposed pipeline considering, as an example, an evaluation use case. To this end, we consider standard machine learning algorithms for the classification stage and evaluate their performance considering different performance metrics for a thorough assessment."}}

In particular, we address the task of estimating the pose of small metal hydraulic components of the same type, randomly placed in a bin. The system consists of a robot arm and an RGB-D sensor in eye-in-hand configuration. The proposed method works in two main phases. In the first phase a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) extracts the bounding boxes of the objects contained in the bin from a single RGB image of the environment. In the second phase the 6D pose of the objects is estimated using a dense 3D reconstruction of the scene and by applying a template matching algorithm from multiple virtual views of the object CAD model. Experimental results have been carried out on a dataset containing both RGB and depth images. Preliminary experiments are also reported in the real setup."}}

Thus, they will have to be able to dynamically learn how to act, interact, and adapt, with little or no a priori knowledge and without human intervention. That is, such systems should become able to self-develop causal models of themselves and of the environment in which they act (i.e., what their actions imply and what actions induce what effects on the environment), and of their social relationships (i.e., what interactions induce what impact on other systems). In this paper, we introduce key concepts of self-development in intelligent environments, both at the individual and collective level, by framing its key concepts and its relation with causal models. Then, we introduce two case studies, focus of our current (preliminary) experiments. Finally, we discuss related work and some key research challenges."}}

However, a shortcoming of data-driven approaches is poor explainability. We posit that in this domain useful explanations of classifier outcomes can be provided by resorting to legal rationales. We thus consider several configurations of memory-augmented neural networks where rationales are given a special role in the modeling of context knowledge. Our results show that rationales not only contribute to improve the classification accuracy, but are also able to offer meaningful, natural language explanations of otherwise opaque classifier outcomes."}}

However, they can hardly exploit domain knowledge, and like other blackbox models, they lack interpretability. Unfortunately, structured knowledge injection, in the long run, risks to suffer from a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. We thus propose a memory enhancement of transformer models that makes use of unstructured domain knowledge expressed in plain natural language. An experimental evaluation conducted on two challenging NLP tasks demonstrates that our approach yields better performance and model interpretability than baseline transformer-based architectures."}}

The method we propose makes no assumptions on document or argument structure. We propose a residual architecture that exploits attention, multi-task learning, and makes use of ensemble. We evaluate it on a challenging data set consisting of user-generated comments, as well as on two other datasets consisting of scientific publications. On the user-generated content dataset, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods that rely on domain knowledge. On the scientific literature datasets it achieves results comparable to those yielded by BERT-based approaches but with a much smaller model size."}}
