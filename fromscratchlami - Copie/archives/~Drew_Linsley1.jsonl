One hypothesis about how they accomplish this is through a process called visual simulation, in which they imagine future states of their environment using a constructed mental model. Though a growing body of behavioral findings, in both humans and non-human primates, provides credence to this hypothesis, the computational mechanisms underlying this ability remain poorly understood. In this study, we probe the capability of feedforward and recurrent neural network models to solve the Planko task, parameterized to systematically control task variability. We demonstrate that visual simulation emerges as the optimal computational strategy in deep neural networks only when task variability is high. Moreover, we provide some of the first evidence that information about imaginary future states can be decoded from the model latent representations, despite no explicit supervision. Taken together, our work suggests that the optimality of visual simulation is task-specific and provides a framework to test its mechanistic basis."}}

A landmark in artificial intelligence has been the development of deep reinforcement learning (dRL) algorithms capable of doing the same in video games, on par with or better than humans. However, it remains unclear whether the successes of dRL models reflect advances in visual representation learning, the effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms at discovering better policies, or both. To address this question, we introduce the Learning Challenge Diagnosticator (LCD), a tool that separately measures the perceptual and reinforcement learning demands of a task. We use LCD to discover a novel taxonomy of challenges in the Procgen benchmark, and demonstrate that these predictions are both highly reliable and can instruct algorithmic development. More broadly, the LCD reveals multiple failure cases that can occur when optimizing dRL algorithms over entire video game benchmarks like Procgen, and provides a pathway towards more efficient progress."}}

Su et al., 2020 [31] used an auto-encoder architecture and an image reconstruction objective function to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the NTU60 C-View benchmark. Rao et al., 2020 [23] used Contrastive learning in the latent space to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the NTU60 C-Sub benchmark. Here, we reconcile these disparate approaches by developing a taxonomy of self-supervised learning for action recognition. We observe that leading approaches generally use one of two types of objective functions: those that seek to reconstruct the input from a latent representation (\"Attractive\" learning) versus those that also try to maximize the representations distinctiveness (\"Contrastive\" learning). Independently, leading approaches also differ in how they implement these objective functions: there are those that optimize representations in the decoder output space and those which optimize representations in the network\u2019s latent space (encoder output). We find that combining these approaches leads to larger gains in performance and tolerance to transformation than is achievable by any individual method, leading to state-of-the-art performance on three standard action recognition datasets.

Higher biological visual systems have evolved to track moving objects by relying on both their appearance and their motion trajectories. We investigate if state-of-the-art spatiotemporal deep neural networks are capable of the same. For this, we introduce PathTracker, a synthetic visual challenge that asks human observers and machines to track a target object in the midst of identical-looking \"distractor\" objects. While humans effortlessly learn PathTracker and generalize to systematic variations in task design, deep networks struggle. To address this limitation, we identify and model circuit mechanisms in biological brains that are implicated in tracking objects based on motion cues. When instantiated as a recurrent network, our circuit model learns to solve PathTracker with a robust visual strategy that rivals human performance and explains a significant proportion of their decision-making on the challenge. We also show that the success of this circuit model extends to object tracking in natural videos. Adding it to a transformer-based architecture for object tracking builds tolerance to visual nuisances that affect object appearance, establishing the new state of the art on the large-scale TrackingNet challenge. Our work highlights the importance of understanding human vision to improve computer vision.\n\n"}}

Indeed, significant progress on object tracking has been spurred by introducing backbones that are better able to discriminate objects by their appearance. However, extensive neurophysiology and psychophysics evidence suggests that biological visual systems track objects using both appearance and motion features. Here, we introduce $\\textit{PathTracker}$, a visual challenge inspired by cognitive psychology, which tests the ability of observers to learn to track objects solely by their motion. We find that standard 3D-convolutional deep network models struggle to solve this task when clutter is introduced into the generated scenes, or when objects travel long distances. This challenge reveals that tracing the path of object motion is a blind spot of feedforward neural networks. We expect that strategies for appearance-free object tracking from biological vision can inspire solutions these failures of deep neural networks."}}
