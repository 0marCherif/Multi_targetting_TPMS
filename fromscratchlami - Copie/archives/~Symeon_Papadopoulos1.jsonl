It is important to accurately retrieve image memes from social media to better capture the cultural and social aspects of online phenomena and detect potential issues (hate-speech, disinformation). Essentially, the background image of an image macro is a regular image easily recognized as such by humans but cumbersome for the machine to do so due to feature map similarity with the complete image macro. Hence, accumulating suitable feature maps in such cases can lead to deep understanding of the notion of image memes. To this end, we propose a methodology, called visual part utilization, that utilizes the visual part of image memes as instances of the regular image class and the initial image memes as instances of the image meme class to force the model to concentrate on the critical parts that characterize an image meme. Additionally, we employ a trainable attention mechanism on top of a standard ViT architecture to enhance the model\u2019s ability to focus on these critical parts and make the predictions interpretable. Several training and test scenarios involving web-scraped regular images of controlled text presence are considered for evaluating the model in terms of robustness and accuracy. The findings indicate that light visual part utilization combined with sufficient text presence during training provides the best and most robust model, surpassing state of the art.

Cost-sensitive learning tackles this problem by treating the classes differently, formulated typically via a user-defined fixed misclassification cost matrix provided as input to the learner. Such parameter tuning is a challenging task that requires domain knowledge and moreover, wrong adjustments might lead to overall predictive performance deterioration. In this work, we propose a novel cost-sensitive boosting approach for imbalanced data that dynamically adjusts the misclassification costs over the boosting rounds in response to model\u2019s performance instead of using a fixed misclassification cost matrix. Our method, called AdaCC, is parameter-free as it relies on the cumulative behavior of the boosting model in order to adjust the misclassification costs for the next boosting round and comes with theoretical guarantees regarding the training error. Experiments on 27 real-world datasets from different domains with high class imbalance demonstrate the superiority of our method over 12 state-of-the-art cost-sensitive boosting approaches exhibiting consistent improvements in different measures, for instance, in the range of [0.3\u201328.56%] for AUC, [3.4\u201321.4%] for balanced accuracy, [4.8\u201345%] for gmean and [7.4\u201385.5%] for recall."}}

Thus, it is important to make them fair in terms of satisfying statistical parity constraints between groups of nodes (e.g., distribute score mass between genders proportionally to their representation). To achieve this while minimally perturbing the original posteriors, we introduce a filter-aware universal approximation framework for posterior objectives. This defines appropriate graph neural networks trained at runtime to be similar to filters but also locally optimize a large class of objectives, including fairness-aware ones. Experiments on a collection of 8 filters and 5 graphs show that our approach performs equally well or better than alternatives in meeting parity constraints while preserving the AUC of score-based community member recommendation and creating minimal utility loss in prior diffusion."}}

By contrast, we propose an approach based on the premise that the robustness of the detector can be enhanced by training it on realistic synthetic images that are selected based on their quality scores according to a probabilistic quality estimation model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by conducting experiments with generated images from two seminal architectures, StyleGAN2 and Latent Diffusion, and using three different concepts for each, so as to measure the cross-concept generalization ability. Our results show that our quality-based sampling method leads to higher detection performance for nearly all concepts, improving the overall effectiveness of the synthetic image detectors."}}

The benchmark is designed to evaluate methods on these two tasks, and simulates a realistic needle-in-haystack setting, where the majority of both query and reference videos are \"distractors\" containing no copied content. We propose a metric that reflects both detection and localization accuracy. The associated challenge consists of two corresponding tracks, each with restrictions that reflect real-world settings.

In recent years, the challenge of multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) has garnered significant attention by researchers and has mainly involved the creation of annotated, weakly annotated, or synthetically generated training datasets, along with the development of various deep learning MMD models. However, the problem of unimodal bias in MMD benchmarks -- where biased or unimodal methods outperform their multimodal counterparts on an inherently multimodal task -- has been overlooked. In this study, we systematically investigate and identify the presence of unimodal bias in widely-used MMD benchmarks (VMU-Twitter, COSMOS), raising concerns about their suitability for reliable evaluation. To address this issue, we introduce the \"VERification of Image-TExtpairs\" (VERITE) benchmark for MMD which incorporates real-world data, excludes \"asymmetric multimodal misinformation\" and utilizes \"modality balancing\". We conduct an extensive comparative study with a Transformer-based architecture that shows the ability of VERITE to effectively address unimodal bias, rendering it a robust evaluation framework for MMD. Furthermore, we introduce a new method -- termed Crossmodal HArd Synthetic MisAlignment (CHASMA) -- for generating realistic synthetic training data that preserve crossmodal relations between legitimate images and false human-written captions. By leveraging CHASMA in the training process, we observe consistent and notable improvements in predictive performance on VERITE; with a 9.2% increase in accuracy.

New forms of digital content such as image memes have given rise to spread of hate using multimodal means, being far more difficult to analyse and detect compared to the unimodal case. Accurate automatic processing, analysis and understanding of this kind of content will facilitate the endeavor of hindering hate speech proliferation through the digital world. To this end, we propose MemeFier, a deep learning-based architecture for fine-grained classification of Internet image memes, utilizing a dual-stage modality fusion module. The first fusion stage produces feature vectors containing modality alignment information that captures non-trivial connections between the text and image of a meme. The second fusion stage leverages the power of a Transformer encoder to learn inter-modality correlations at the token level and yield an informative representation. Additionally, we consider external knowledge as an additional input, and background image caption supervision as a regularizing component. Extensive experiments on three widely adopted benchmarks, i.e., Facebook Hateful Memes, Memotion7k and MultiOFF, indicate that our approach competes and in some cases surpasses state-of-the-art.
