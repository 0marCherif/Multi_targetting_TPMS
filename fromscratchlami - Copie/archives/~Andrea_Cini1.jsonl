Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often the core component of the forecasting architecture. However, in most spatiotemporal GNNs, the computational complexity scales up to a quadratic factor with the length of the sequence times the number of links in the graph, hence hindering the application of these models to large graphs and long temporal sequences. While methods to improve scalability have been proposed in the context of static graphs, few research efforts have been devoted to the spatiotemporal case. To fill this gap, we propose a scalable architecture that exploits an efficient encoding of both temporal and spatial dynamics. In particular, we use a randomized recurrent neural network to embed the history of the input time series into high-dimensional state representations encompassing multi-scale temporal dynamics. Such representations are then propagated along the spatial dimension using different powers of the graph adjacency matrix to generate node embeddings characterized by a rich pool of spatiotemporal features. The resulting node embeddings can be efficiently pre-computed in an unsupervised manner, before being fed to a feed-forward decoder that learns to map the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations to predictions. The training procedure can then be parallelized node-wise by sampling the node embeddings without breaking any dependency, thus enabling scalability to large networks. Empirical results on relevant datasets show that our approach achieves results competitive with the state of the art, while dramatically reducing the computational burden."}}

Often, however, the relational information characterizing the underlying data generating process is unavailable; the practitioner is then left with the problem of inferring from data which relational graph to use in the subsequent processing stages. We propose novel, principled -- yet practical -- probabilistic methods that learn the relational dependencies by modeling distributions over graphs while maximizing, at the same time, end-to-end the forecasting accuracy. Our novel graph learning approach, based on consolidated variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo score-based gradient estimation, is theoretically grounded and effective. We show that tailoring the gradient estimators to the graph learning problem allows us also for achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance while controlling, at the same time, both the sparsity of the learned graph and the computational burden. We empirically assess the effectiveness of the proposed method on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing that the proposed solution can be used as a stand-alone graph identification procedure as well as a learned component of an end-to-end forecasting architecture."}}

Several approaches exist that tackle this problem by exploiting modern deep learning tools. However, most previous works focus on predicting the total load as a univariate time series forecasting task, ignoring all fine-grained information captured by the smart meters distributed across the power grid. We introduce a methodology to account for this information in the graph neural network framework. In particular, we consider spatio-temporal graphs where each node is associated with the aggregate load of a cluster of smart meters, and a global graph-level attribute indicates the total load on the grid. We propose two novel spatio-temporal graph neural network models to process this representation and take advantage of both the finer-grained information and the relationships existing between the different clusters of meters. We compare these models on a widely used, openly available, benchmark against a competitive baseline which only accounts for the total load profile. Within these settings, we show that the proposed methodology improves forecasting accuracy."}}

Effective spatio-temporal representations would allow imputation methods to reconstruct missing temporal data by exploiting information coming from sensors at different locations. However, standard methods fall short in capturing the nonlinear time and space dependencies existing within networks of interconnected sensors and do not take full advantage of the available - and often strong - relational information. Notably, most state-of-the-art imputation methods based on deep learning do not explicitly model relational aspects and, in any case, do not exploit processing frameworks able to adequately represent structured spatio-temporal data. Conversely, graph neural networks have recently surged in popularity as both expressive and scalable tools for processing sequential data with relational inductive biases. In this work, we present the first assessment of graph neural networks in the context of multivariate time series imputation. In particular, we introduce a novel graph neural network architecture, named GRIN, which aims at reconstructing missing data in the different channels of a multivariate time series by learning spatio-temporal representations through message passing. Empirical results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the imputation task on relevant real-world benchmarks with mean absolute error improvements often higher than 20%."}}
