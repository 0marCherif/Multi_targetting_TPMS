However, such an objective is not adequate in a lot of real-life applications, like finance, where controlling the uncertainty of the outcome is imperative. The mean-volatility objective penalizes, through a tunable parameter, policies with high variance of the per-step reward. An interesting property of this objective is that it admits simple linear Bellman equations that resemble, up to a reward transformation, those of the risk-neutral case. However, the required reward transformation is policy-dependent, and requires the (usually unknown) expected return of the used policy. In this work, we propose two general methods for policy evaluation under the mean-volatility objective: the direct method and the factored method. We then extend recent results for finite sample analysis in the risk-neutral actor-critic setting to the mean-volatility case. Our analysis shows that the sample complexity to attain an \u03f5-accurate stationary point is the same as that of the risk-neutral version, using either policy evaluation method for training the critic. Finally, we carry out experiments to test the proposed methods in a simple environment that exhibits some trade-off between optimality, in expectation, and uncertainty of outcome."}}

In this paper, we introduce the notion of action persistence that consists in the repetition of an action for a fixed number of decision steps, having the effect of modifying the control frequency. We start analyzing how action persistence affects the performance of the optimal policy, and then we present a novel algorithm, Persistent Fitted Q-Iteration (PFQI), that extends FQI, with the goal of learning the optimal value function at a given persistence. After having provided a theoretical study of PFQI and a heuristic approach to identify the optimal persistence, we present an experimental campaign on benchmark domains to show the advantages of action persistence and proving the effectiveness of our persistence selection method."}}

Risk aversion has been addressed in the reinforcement learning literature through risk measures related to the variance of returns. However, in many cases, the risk is measured not only on a long-term perspective, but also on the step-wise rewards (e.g., in trading, to ensure the stability of the investment bank, it is essential to monitor the risk of portfolio positions on a daily basis). In this paper, we define a novel measure of risk, which we call reward volatility, consisting of the variance of the rewards under the state-occupancy measure. We show that the reward volatility bounds the return variance so that reducing the former also constrains the latter. We derive a policy gradient theorem with a new objective function that exploits the mean-volatility relationship, and develop an actor-only algorithm. Furthermore, thanks to the linearity of the Bellman equations defined under the new objective function, it is possible to adapt the well-known policy gradient algorithms with monotonic improvement guarantees such as TRPO in a risk-averse manner. Finally, we test the proposed approach in two simulated financial environments."}}
