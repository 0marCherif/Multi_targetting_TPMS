Previous approaches propose to learn such temporal abstractions in a purely unsupervised fashion through observing state-action trajectories gathered from executing a policy. However, a current limitation is that they process each trajectory in an entirely sequential manner, which prevents them from revising earlier decisions about sub-routine boundary points in light of new incoming information. In this work we propose SloTTAr, a fully parallel approach that integrates sequence processing Transformers with a Slot Attention module and adaptive computation for learning about the number of such sub-routines in an unsupervised fashion. We demonstrate how SloTTAr is capable of outperforming strong baselines in terms of boundary point discovery, even for sequences containing variable amounts of sub-routines, while being up to 7x faster to train on existing benchmarks."}}

Unlike prior approaches, it utilizes predictability to discover object keypoints, an intrinsic property of objects. This ensures that it does not overly bias keypoints to focus on characteristics that are not unique to objects, such as movement, shape, colour etc. We demonstrate the efficacy of PermaKey on Atari where it learns keypoints corresponding to the most salient object parts and is robust to certain visual distractors. Further, on downstream RL tasks in the Atari domain we demonstrate how agents equipped with our keypoints outperform those using competing alternatives, even on challenging environments with moving backgrounds or distractor objects."}}

Key aspects of our proposed system include: 1) a novel, two-level processing architecture that aids in generating planned trajectories, 2) a simple set of easily computable features that integrate derivative information, and 3) a novel multi-objective loss function that helps the model to slowly progress from simple next-step prediction to the harder task of multi-step, closed-loop prediction. Our results demonstrate that these innovations improve the modeling of long-term motion trajectories. Finally, we propose a novel metric, called Normalized Power Spectrum Similarity (NPSS), to evaluate the long-term predictive ability of motion synthesis models, complementing the popular mean-squared error (MSE) measure of Euler joint angles over time. We conduct a user study to determine if the proposed NPSS correlates with human evaluation of long-term motion more strongly than MSE and find that it indeed does.

Bottom-up approaches, such as, hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique are used traditionally for segment clustering. In this paper, we consider the top-down approach to clustering, in which a speaker sensitive, low-dimensional representation of segments (speaker space) is obtained first, followed by Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based clustering. We explore three methods of obtaining the low dimension segment representation: (i) multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) based on segment to segment stochastic distances; (ii) traditional principal component analysis (PCA), and (iii) factor analysis (i-vectors), of GMM mean super-vectors. We found that, MDS based embeddings result in better representation and hence result in better diarization performance compared to PCA and even i-vector embeddings."}}

Based on an initially identified segment of speech of a speaker, an iterative model refinement method is developed along with a latent variable mixture model so that segments of the same speaker are identified in a long speech record. It is found that a GMM with moderate number of mixtures is better suited for the task than a large number mixture model as used in speaker identification. Similarly, a PCA based low-dimensional projection of MFCC based feature vector provides better performance. We show that about 6 seconds of initially identified speaker data is sufficient to achieve > 90% performance of speaker segment identification."}}
