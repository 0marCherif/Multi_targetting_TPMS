Therefore, previously trained predictive models tend to perform worse as time passes since the learning point. Ensuring the long-term validity of predictive models in manufacturing sites has become a crucial issue, and the retraining strategy for predictive models has emerged as a key aspect in maintaining the predictive system. In this study, we proposed a sustainable learning framework that monitors changes in data distribution and incorporates them into retraining decisions. The basic structure of the proposed method involves learning a local predictive model based on a temporal clustering system. By detecting the structural changes in each cluster over time, it determines whether the local predictive models require retraining in real time. This learning framework is more adaptable to changes in the data collection environment and abnormal situations than a static single model, enabling a more accurate prediction performance while using fewer learning resources than the naive retraining method. The validity of the proposed method was proven using real time-series manufacturing data."}}

A major limitation of these methods is that they tend to separate the process of generating synthetic samples from the training process, resulting in synthetic data that lack the necessary informative characteristics for proper model training. We present a new synthetic data generation method that addresses this issue by combining adversarial sample generation with a triplet loss method. This approach focuses on increasing the diversity in the minority class while preserving the integrity of the decision boundary. Furthermore, we show that reducing triplet loss is equivalent to maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve under specific conditions, providing a theoretical basis for the effectiveness of our method. In addition, we present a model training approach to further improve the generalization of the model to small classes by providing a diverse set of synthetic samples optimized using our proposed loss function. We evaluated our method on several imbalanced benchmark tasks and compared it to state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating that our method can deliver even better performance, making it an effective solution to the class imbalance problem."}}

It is generally believed that home teams deprived of enthusiastic support from their home fans experience reduced benefits of playing on their home fields, thus becoming less likely to win. This study attempts to confirm if this belief is true in four major European football leagues through statistical analysis. This study proposes a Bayesian hierarchical Poisson model to estimate parameters reflecting the home advantage and the change in such advantage. These parameters are used to improve the performance of machine-learning-based prediction models for football matches played after the COVID-19 break. The study describes the statistical analysis on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on football match results in terms of the expected score and goal difference. It also shows that estimated parameters from the proposed model reflect the changed home advantage. Finally, the study verifies that these parameters, when included as additional features, enhance the performance of various football match prediction models. The home advantage in European football matches has changed because of the behind-closed-doors policy implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using parameters reflecting the pandemic\u2019s impact, it is possible to predict more precise results of spectator-free matches after the COVID-19 break."}}

This method has an unrealistic assumption in that it views all attributes as equally important. Attribute weighting is one of the methods used to alleviate this assumption and consequently improve the performance of the naive Bayes classification. This study, with a focus on nonlinear optimization problems, proposes four attribute weighting methods by minimizing four different loss functions. The proposed loss functions belong to a family of exponential functions that makes the optimization problems more straightforward to solve, provides analytical properties of the trained classifier, and allows for the simple modification of the loss function such that the naive Bayes classifier becomes robust to noisy instances. This research begins with a typical exponential loss which is sensitive to noise and provides a series of its modifications to make naive Bayes classifiers more robust to noisy instances. Based on numerical experiments conducted using 28 datasets from the UCI machine learning repository, we confirmed that the proposed scheme successfully determines optimal attribute weights and improves the classification performance."}}

However, it often fails to identify true cluster structures from data owing to its intrinsic assumption that a cluster has a unique and high-density center, because a single cluster can contain several peaks. We call this the \u201cmulti-peak problem\u201d. To overcome this, we propose a peak merging method for clustering. In the proposed algorithm, a valley and its local density are defined to identify the intersection between two adjoined peaks. These are used to construct directed and connected subgraphs, using which we merge multiple peaks if needed. Unlike CFSFDP and its variants, the proposed method is capable of identifying highly complex shaped clusters with no interpretation of a decision graph. Numerical experiments based on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the benchmarking methods."}}

Learning classifiers from imbalanced data can be troublesome due to no absolute standard as to how much imbalance can be said to be imbalanced or balanced. To address this issue, this research proposes a new sphere-based classification method named LOCS (learning objective controllable sphere-based classifier), which is designed to maximize AUC (area under ROC curve). The AUC learning objective was adopted from the fact that it approximates the accuracy as class distribution becomes balanced. Therefore, the proposed method properly performs a classification task for both imbalanced and balanced data. It constructs a classification model by a single training, whereas existing cost-sensitive learning and resampling methods usually attempt different parameter settings. In addition, the learning objective can be easily modified within LOCS for each of application domains by setting different importance levels for positive and negative classes, respectively. Numerical experiments based on 25 real datasets with several investigational settings showed the effectiveness and the intended strengths of the proposed method."}}

It implies that our method attempts to maximize the AUC value of a trained decision tree in order to cope with class imbalance in data. An extensive experimental study was performed on 20 real datasets from the machine learning repository at the University of California at Irvine, Irvine.
