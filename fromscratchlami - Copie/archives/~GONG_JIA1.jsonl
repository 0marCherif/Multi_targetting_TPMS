To reduce the human efforts on pose annotations, we propose a novel Meta Agent Teaming Active Learning (MATAL) framework to actively select and label informative images for effective learning. Our MATAL formulates the image selection procedure as a Markov Decision Process and learns an optimal sampling policy that directly maximizes the performance of the pose estimator based on the reward. Our framework consists of a novel state-action representation as well as a multi-agent team to enable batch sampling in the active learning procedure. The framework could be effectively optimized via Meta-Optimization to accelerate the adaptation to the gradually expanded labeled data during deployment. Finally, we show experimental results on both human hand and body pose estimation benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms all baselines continuously under the same amount of annotation budget. Moreover, to obtain similar pose estimation accuracy, our MATAL framework can save around 40% labeling efforts on average compared to state-of-the-art active learning frameworks."}}

Permanent-magnet-array is an option to supply a static magnetic field (B-field) with portability, low cost, and no power consumption. However, it has low field strength. Moreover, it does not have linear gradients, thus the signals and the images are not linked by the Fourier transformation as they are in a conventional system. The B-field generated by an array and called spatial-encoding-magnetic-field (SEM), is spatially non-linear and always on. Such an SEM, in terms of the field strength, direction, homogeneity, pattern and its field pattern variation, is related to the image quality. This relation is crucial because it can be used to guide the magnet and system design for high image quality and portability. However, it has not been systematically studied. In this paper, the characteristics of the SEMs from different magnet array designs are identified. Due to the non-linearity of the SEMs, local structural similarity (SSIM) index is proposed to evaluate the region-dependent image quality, and local k-space is applied to analyze the region-dependent effects of these SEMs on image reconstruction. Moreover, point spread function is applied to analyze the overall effect of the SEMs on the quality of reconstructed images. Besides the intrinsic effects of the SEMs, those of the external factors, e.g. the receive coil sensitivity, are analyzed. This study identifies the unique characteristics of the SEMs in a permanent-magnet-array-based MRI system, and offers methods to analyze the unique relation between the image quality and the field. It can not only guide the magnet designs but also trigger more design ideas, e.g., the design of the mechanical movement of the magnet array, and that of the static magnetic field shimming coils, paving the way towards a low-field MRI system with practical portability."}}

The magnet rings are discretized into fan-shaped ring segments with varying outer radii for the design and optimization. Besides, the inner radii of ring-pairs are tapered from outside in to provide the controlled field inhomogeneity. Genetic algorithm (GA) was used, and a current model for a fan-shaped ring segment was derived to have a fast forward calculation in the optimization. A monotonic field pattern is successfully obtained along the x-direction in a cylindrical field of view (FoV), with a relatively strong magnetic field (132.98 mT) and the homogeneity of 151840 ppm. The proposed array was further evaluated by applying its field as a spatial encoding magnetic field (SEM) for imaging by using simulation. Due to the field monotonicity, the reconstructed image by applying the fields of the proposed array shows clearer features (a higher structural similarity index) with a reduced error rate compared to that using a sparse dipolar Halbach array. The proposed magnet array is a promising alternative to supply SEM for imaging in a permanent-magnet-based low-field portable MRI system."}}
