Since in real-world applications the data may contain bias on fairness-sensitive features (e.g., gender), VFL models may inherit bias from training data and become unfair for some user groups. However, existing fair machine learning methods usually rely on the centralized storage of fairness-sensitive features to achieve model fairness, which are usually inapplicable in federated scenarios. In this paper, we propose a fair vertical federated learning framework (FairVFL), which can improve the fairness of VFL models. The core idea of FairVFL is to learn unified and fair representations of samples based on the decentralized feature fields in a privacy-preserving way. Specifically, each platform with fairness-insensitive features first learns local data representations from local features. Then, these local representations are uploaded to a server and aggregated into a unified representation for the target task. In order to learn a fair unified representation, we send it to each platform storing fairness-sensitive features and apply adversarial learning to remove bias from the unified representation inherited from the biased data. Moreover, for protecting user privacy, we further propose a contrastive adversarial learning method to remove private information from the unified representation in server before sending it to the platforms keeping fairness-sensitive features. Experiments on three real-world datasets validate that our method can effectively improve model fairness with user privacy well-protected."}}

Existing dependency-based models captured long-range syntactic relations, but they usually cannot fully exploit information from sentences. They often used hand-crafted rules to prune redundant edges from dependency trees, but suffer from the imbalance of including and removing contents. When incorporating sequence models, they usually ignored the semantic and syntactic interactions between words. In this paper, we propose to automatically learn relational dependency structures with a fine-grained gating strategy. We decompose the dependency tree into differently informative parts and apply different gating methods to each part. To further capture the word-level interactions, we propose to apply the co-attention mechanism to combine structure and sequence models. We apply a neural network to learn the affinity matrix and derive mutual attention weights between semantic and syntactic representations. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets and the results indicate the effectiveness of our method."}}

Most existing news recommender systems conduct personalized news recall and ranking separately with different models. However, maintaining multiple models leads to high computational cost and poses great challenge to meeting the online latency requirement of news recommender systems. In order to handle this problem, in this paper we propose UniRec, a unified method for recall and ranking in news recommendation. In our method, we first infer user embedding for ranking from the historical news click behaviors of a user using a user encoder model. Then we derive the user embedding for recall from the obtained user embedding for ranking by using it as the attention query to select a set of basis user embeddings which encode different general user interests and synthesize them into a user embedding for recall. The extensive experiments on benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method can improve both efficiency and effectiveness for recall and ranking in news recommendation."}}

Most existing news recommendation methods rely on centralized storage of users' historical news click behavior data, which may lead to privacy concerns and hazards. Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving framework for multiple clients to collaboratively train models without sharing their private data. However, the computation and communication cost of directly learning many existing news recommendation models in a federated way are unacceptable for user clients. In this paper, we propose an efficient federated learning framework for privacy-preserving news recommendation. Instead of training and communicating the whole model, we decompose the news recommendation model into a large news model maintained in the server and a light-weight user model shared on both server and clients, where news representations and user model are communicated between server and clients. More specifically, the clients request the user model and news representations from the server, and send their locally computed gradients to the server for aggregation. The server updates its global user model with the aggregated gradients, and further updates its news model to infer updated news representations. Since the local gradients may contain private information, we propose a secure aggregation method to aggregate gradients in a privacy-preserving way. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our method can reduce the computation and communication cost on clients while keep promising model performance."}}

Precise user interest modeling is critical for personalized news recommendation. Existing news recommendation methods usually rely on the implicit feedback of users like news clicks to model user interest. However, news click may not necessarily reflect user interests because users may click a news due to the attraction of its title but feel disappointed at its content. The dwell time of news reading is an important clue for user interest modeling, since short reading dwell time usually indicates low and even negative interest. Thus, incorporating the negative feedback inferred from the dwell time of news reading can improve the quality of user modeling. In this paper, we propose a neural news recommendation approach which can incorporate the implicit negative user feedback. We propose to distinguish positive and negative news clicks according to their reading dwell time, and respectively learn user representations from positive and negative news clicks via a combination of Transformer and additive attention network. In addition, we propose to compute a positive click score and a negative click score based on the relevance between candidate news representations and the user representations learned from the positive and negative news clicks. The final click score is a combination of positive and negative click scores. Besides, we propose an interactive news modeling method to consider the relatedness between title and body in news modeling.

Most of existing news recommendation methods model candidate news from its textual content and user interest from their clicked news in an independent way. However, a news article may cover multiple aspects and entities, and a user usually has different kinds of interest. Independent modeling of candidate news and user interest may lead to inferior matching between news and users. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-aware interactive matching method for news recommendation. Our method interactively models candidate news and user interest to facilitate their accurate matching. We design a knowledge-aware news co-encoder to interactively learn representations for both clicked news and candidate news by capturing their relatedness in both semantic and entities with the help of knowledge graphs. We also design a user-news co-encoder to learn candidate news-aware user interest representation and user-aware candidate news representation for better interest matching.

Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are powerful for natural language understanding, which has the potential for better news modeling. However, there is no public report that show PLMs have been applied to news recommendation. In this paper, we report our work on exploiting pre-trained language models to empower news recommendation. Offline experimental results on both monolingual and multilingual news recommendation datasets show that leveraging PLMs for news modeling can effectively improve the performance of news recommendation. Our PLM-empowered news recommendation models have been deployed to the Microsoft News platform, and achieved significant gains in terms of both click and pageview in both English-speaking and global markets."}}
