First, the pixel filtering and context filtering are employed to roughly repair defects on the depth map due to information inaccuracy captured by Kinect. Second, a dataset consisting of depth maps with various indoor human poses is constructed as benchmark. Finally, by introducing Kirsch mask and three-value codes to Local Binary Pattern, a novel Local Ternary Direction Pattern (LTDP) feature descriptor is extracted and is used for human detection with SVM as classifier. The performance for the proposed approach is evaluated and compared with other five existing feature descriptors using the same SVM classifier. Experiment results manifest the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}

After the development of the branch and bound (B&B) method called Efficient Subwindow Search (ESS), several algorithms (IESS, AESS, ARCS) have been proposed to improve the performance of ESS. For n\u00d7n images, IESS's time complexity is bounded by O(n <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> ) which is better than ESS, but only applicable to linear score functions. Other work shows that Monge properties can hold in subwindow search and can be used to speed up the search to O(n <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> ), but only applies to certain types of score functions. In this paper we explore the connection between submodular functions and the Monge property, and prove that sub-modular score functions can be used to achieve O(n <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> ) time complexity for object detection. The time complexity can be further improved to be sub-cubic by applying B&B methods on row interval only, when the score function has a multivariate submodular bound function. Conditions for sub-modularity of common non-linear score functions and multivariate submodularity of their bound functions are also provided, and experiments are provided to compare the proposed approach against ESS and ARCS for object detection with some nonlinear score functions."}}

This problem can be formulated as a four dimensional (4D) maximum entry search problem wherein each entry corresponds to the quality score of the subimage contained in a subwindow. For n \u00d7 n images, a naive exhaustive search requires O(n <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup> ) sequential computations of the quality scores for all subwindows.

A major drawback of ESS is that its computational complexity varies widely from O(n <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> ) to O(n <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup> ) for n \u00d7 n matrices. Our experimental experience shows that the ESS's performance is highly related to the optimal confidence levels which indicate the probability of the object's presence. In particular, when the object is not in the image, the optimal subwindow scores low and ESS may take a large amount of iterations to converge to the optimal solution and so perform very slow. Addressing this problem, we present two significantly faster methods based on the linear-time Kadane's Algorithm for 1D maximum subarray search. The first algorithm is a novel, computationally superior branch-and-bound method where the worst case complexity is reduced to O(n <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> ). Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2006 data set demonstrate that this method is significantly and consistently faster (approximately 30 times faster on average) than the original ESS. Our second algorithm is an approximate algorithm based on alternating search, whose computational complexity is typically O(n <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> ). Experiments shows that (on average) it is 30 times faster again than our first algorithm, or 900 times faster than ESS. It is thus well-suited for real time object detection."}}

Different from a recently developed polynomial NMF (PNMF), GNMF finds basis vectors in the kernel-induced feature space and the computational cost is independent of input dimensions. Furthermore, we prove the convergence and nonnegativity of decomposition of our method.

Our algorithms balance these conflicting requirements, and we further improve this technique using kernel methods.

Further, we show that the performance of our algorithm with partial side information (that is, using only small amount of pair-wise similarity/dissimilarity information during training) is comparable with that when using full side information. We conclude that exploiting side information by preserving both similar and dissimilar local structures of the data significantly improves performance."}}

Motivated by the fact that the regular simplex vertices are separate points with highest degree of symmetry, we choose such vertices as the targets for the distinct individuals in recognition and apply RR or KRR to map the training face images into a face subspace where the training images from each individual will locate near their individual targets. We identify the new face image by mapping it into this face subspace and comparing its distance to all individual targets. An efficient cross-validation algorithm is also provided for selecting the regularization and kernel parameters. Experiments were conducted on two face databases and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the three popular linear face recognition techniques (Eigenfaces, Fisher faces and Laplacian faces) and also performs comparably with the recently developed Orthogonal Laplacian faces with the advantage of computational speed. Experimental results also demonstrate that KRR outperforms RR as expected since KRR can utilize the nonlinear structure of the face images. Although we concentrate on face recognition in this paper, the proposed method is general and may be applied for general multi-category classification problems."}}
