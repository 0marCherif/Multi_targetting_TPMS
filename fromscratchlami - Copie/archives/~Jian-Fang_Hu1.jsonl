In this paper, we present two modules that can be plugged into the existing models to enable them to generate non-freezing and high fidelity dances. Since the high-dimensional motion data are easily swamped by noise, we propose to learn a low-dimensional manifold representation by an auto-encoder with a bank of latent codes, which can be used to reduce the noise in the predicted motions, thus preventing from freezing. We further extend the bank to provide explicit priors about the future motions to disambiguate motion prediction, which helps the predictors to generate motions with larger magnitude and higher fidelity than possible before. Extensive experiments on AIST++, a public large-scale 3D dance motion benchmark, demonstrate that our method notably outperforms the baselines in terms of quality, diversity and time length. "}}

In this work, we focus on developing models to predict future human motion from past observed video frames. Motivated by the observation that human motion is closely related to the action being performed, we propose to explore action context to guide motion prediction. Specifically, we construct an action-specific memory bank to store representative motion dynamics for each action category, and design a query-read process to retrieve some motion dynamics from the memory bank. The retrieved dynamics are consistent with the action depicted in the observed video frames and serve as a strong prior knowledge to guide motion prediction. We further formulate an action constraint loss to ensure the global semantic consistency of the predicted motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and we achieve state-of-the-art performance on 3D human motion prediction."}}
