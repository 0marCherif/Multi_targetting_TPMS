In the process of temporal and spatial modeling during dynamic scene graph generation, it is particularly intractable to learn time-variant relations in dynamic scene graphs among frames. In this paper, we propose a Time-variant Relation-aware TRansformer (TR <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> ), which aims to model the temporal change of relations in dynamic scene graphs. Explicitly, we leverage the difference of text embeddings of prompted sentences about relation labels as the supervision signal for relations. In this way, cross-modality feature guidance is realized for the learning of time-variant relations. Implicitly, we design a relation feature fusion module with a transformer and an additional message token that describes the difference between adjacent frames. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset prove that our TR2 can effectively model the time-variant relations. TR2 significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods under two different settings by 2.1 % and 2.6% respectively."}}

To clarify this coarse-grained global interaction and move a step further, we have to encounter challenging shell-breaking interactions for fine-grained cross-modal learning. In this paper, we creatively model video-text as game players with multivariate cooperative game theory to wisely handle the uncertainty during fine-grained semantic interaction with diverse granularity, flexible combination, and vague intensity. Concretely, we propose Hierarchical Banzhaf Interaction (HBI) to value possible correspondence between video frames and text words for sensitive and explainable cross-modal contrast. To efficiently realize the cooperative game of multiple video frames and multiple text words, the proposed method clusters the original video frames (text words) and computes the Banzhaf Interaction between the merged tokens. By stacking token merge modules, we achieve cooperative games at different semantic levels. Extensive experiments on commonly used text-video retrieval and video-question answering benchmarks with superior performances justify the efficacy of our HBI. More encouragingly, it can also serve as a visualization tool to promote the understanding of cross-modal interaction, which have a far-reaching impact on the community.

We argue that an overlooked problem in SGG is the coarse-grained interactions between boxes, which inadequately capture contextual semantics for relationship modeling, practically limiting the development of the field. In this paper, we take the initiative to explore and propose a generic paradigm termed Superpixel-based Interaction Learning (SIL) to remedy coarse-grained interactions at the box level. It allows us to model fine-grained interactions at the superpixel level in SGG. Specifically, (i) we treat a scene as a set of points and cluster them into superpixels representing sub-regions of the scene. (ii) We explore intra-entity and cross-entity interactions among the superpixels to enrich fine-grained interactions between entities at an earlier stage. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks (Visual Genome and Open Image V6) prove that our SIL enables fine-grained interaction at the superpixel level above previous box-level methods, and significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across all metrics. More encouragingly, the proposed method can be applied to boost the performance of existing box-level approaches in a plug-and-play fashion. In particular, SIL brings an average improvement of 2.0% mR (even up to 3.4%) of baselines for the PredCls task on Visual Genome, which facilitates its integration into any existing box-level method."}}

In most cases, the texts naturally attach to the surface of the objects. Therefore, spatial reasoning between texts and objects is crucial in TextVQA. However, existing approaches are constrained within 2D spatial information learned from the input images and rely on transformer-based architectures to reason implicitly during the fusion process. Under this setting, these 2D spatial reasoning approaches cannot distinguish the fine-grained spatial relations between visual objects and scene texts on the same image plane, thereby impairing the interpretability and performance of TextVQA models. In this paper, we introduce 3D geometric information into the spatial reasoning process to capture the contextual knowledge of key objects step-by-step. Specifically, (i) we propose a relation prediction module for accurately locating the region of interest of critical objects; (ii) we design a depth-aware attention calibration module for calibrating the OCR tokens\u2019 attention according to critical objects. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on TextVQA and ST-VQA datasets. More encouragingly, our model surpasses others by clear margins of 5.7% and 12.1% on questions that involve spatial reasoning in TextVQA and ST-VQA valid split. Besides, we also verify the generalizability of our model on the text-based image captioning task."}}

Current methods either fail to leverage the local details or are computationally expensive. What's worse, they fail to leverage the heterogeneous concepts in data. In this paper, we propose the Disentangled Conceptualization and Set-to-set Alignment (DiCoSA) to simulate the conceptualizing and reasoning process of human beings. For disentangled conceptualization, we divide the coarse feature into multiple latent factors related to semantic concepts. For set-to-set alignment, where a set of visual concepts correspond to a set of textual concepts, we propose an adaptive pooling method to aggregate semantic concepts to address the partial matching. In particular, since we encode concepts independently in only a few dimensions, DiCoSA is superior at efficiency and granularity, ensuring fine-grained interactions using a similar computational complexity as coarse-grained alignment. Extensive experiments on five datasets, including MSR-VTT, LSMDC, MSVD, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo, demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods."}}

However, group cohesiveness is a complex concept that is difficult to predict based only on image pixels. Inspired by the fact that humans intuitively associate linguistic knowledge accumulated in the brain with the visual images they see, we propose a linguistic knowledge injectable deep neural network (LDNN) that builds a visual model (visual LDNN) for predicting group cohesiveness that can automatically associate the linguistic knowledge hidden behind images. LDNN consists of a visual encoder and a language encoder, and applies domain adaptation and linguistic knowledge transition mechanisms to transform linguistic knowledge from a language model to the visual LDNN. We train LDNN by adding descriptions to the training and validation sets of the Group AFfect Dataset 3.0 (GAF 3.0), and test the visual LDNN without any description. Comparing visual LDNN with various fine-tuned DNN models and three state-of-the-art models in the test set, the results demonstrate that the visual LDNN not only improves the performance of the fine-tuned DNN model leading to an MSE very similar to the state-of-the-art model, but is also a practical and efficient method that requires relatively little preprocessing. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that LDNN is an effective method to inject linguistic knowledge into visual models."}}
