A minor error in detecting distributions among the material constituents can lead to a high error in the calculated parameters of material properties.\nWe present a novel hierarchical curriculum learning framework to address the complex task of estimating material constituent distribution in battery electrodes. To provide spatially smooth prediction, our framework comprises three modules: (i) an uncertainty-aware model trained to yield inferences conditioned upon global knowledge of material distribution, (ii) a technique to capture relatively more fine-grained (local) distributional signals, (iii) an aggregator to appropriately fuse the local and global effects towards obtaining the final distribution.

Crucial power system components cause the vulnerability in the network. Any minor disturbance on one of few crucial power components can lead to massive outages and hence can cripple the entire nation. Traditional power contingency analysis tools are expensive to identify the crucial components. Also, such analysis are not scalable to measure vulnerability at national-scale. In this paper, we develop a real-time scoring module which provides a metric to represent the cruciality of a power system component. Through a case-study in a disaster impacted regions, we show that our scoring module is better than traditional and popular network-centrality measure techniques."}}

Failures caused by an extreme weather event or a man-made incident can trigger widespread cascading failures, sending ripple effects at regional or even national scales. To minimize such impact, emergency responders must identify crucial components within CIs during such stressor events in a systematic and quantifiable manner and take appropriate mitigating actions. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has developed a graph-based analytic system named URBAN-NET, which estimates cascading impact caused by the disruption of critical infrastructure components by leveraging the topology of a critical infrastructure network. Before and during critical events (e.g., hurricanes), the URBAN-NET system generates reports that contain the ranking of the most crucial energy components that have the most downstream impact across infrastructure layers. The developed system has been integrated with the Environment for Analysis of Geo-Located Energy Information (EAGLE-I\u2122) system, which is a situational-awareness system operated by ORNL for the department of energy of the United States."}}

However, effective influenza forecasting still remains a challenge despite increasing research interest. It is even more challenging amidst the COVID pandemic, when the influenza-like illness (ILI) counts are affected by various factors such as symptomatic similarities with COVID-19 and shift in healthcare seeking patterns of the general population. Under the current pandemic, historical influenza models carry valuable expertise about the disease dynamics but face difficulties adapting. Therefore, we propose CALI-Net, a neural transfer learning architecture which allows us to 'steer' a historical disease forecasting model to new scenarios where flu and COVID co-exist. Our framework enables this adaptation by automatically learning when it should emphasize learning from COVID-related signals and when it should learn from the historical model. Thus, we exploit representations learned from historical ILI data as well as the limited COVID-related signals. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is successful in adapting a historical forecasting model to the current pandemic. In addition, we show that success in our primary goal, adaptation, does not sacrifice overall performance as compared with state-of-the-art influenza forecasting approaches."}}

Critical infrastructures are cyber-physical systems that can be represented as a network consisting of nodes and edges and highly interdependent in nature. Given the interdependent nature of critical infrastuctures, failure in one node may cause failure in many others resulting in a cascade of failures. In this paper, we propose a node criticality metric that uses Google\u2019s PageRank algorithm to identify nodes that are likely to fail (are vulnerable), nodes whose failure may cascade to many other sites in the network (are important), and nodes that are both vulnerable and important (are critical). We then present a series of experiments to understand how protecting certain critical nodes can help mitigate massive cascading failures. Simulating failures in a real-world network with and without critical node protections demonstrates the importance of identifying critical nodes in an infrastructure network."}}
