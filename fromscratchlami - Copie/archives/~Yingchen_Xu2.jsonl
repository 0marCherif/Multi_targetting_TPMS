To approach this challenge practically, we outline two key desiderata: 1) to facilitate generalization, exploration should be task agnostic; 2) to facilitate scalability, exploration policies should collect large quantities of data without costly centralized retraining. Combining these two properties, we introduce the reward-free deployment efficiency setting, a new paradigm for RL research. We then present CASCADE, a novel approach for self-supervised exploration in this new setting. CASCADE seeks to learn a world model by collecting data with a population of agents, using an information theoretic objective inspired by Bayesian Active Learning. CASCADE achieves this by specifically maximizing the diversity of trajectories sampled by the population through a novel cascading objective. We provide theoretical intuition for CASCADE which we show in a tabular setting improves upon na\u00efve approaches that do not account for population diversity. We then demonstrate that CASCADE collects diverse task-agnostic datasets and learns agents that generalize zero-shot to novel, unseen downstream tasks on Atari, MiniGrid, Crafter and the DM Control Suite.

SGD estimates the gradient by uniform sampling with sample size one. There have been several other works that suggest faster epoch-wise convergence by using weighted non-uniform sampling for better gradient estimates. Unfortunately, the per-iteration cost of maintaining this adaptive distribution for gradient estimation is more than calculating the full gradient itself, which we call the chicken-and-the-egg loop. As a result, the false impression of faster convergence in iterations, in reality, leads to slower convergence in time. In this paper, we break this barrier by providing the first demonstration of a scheme, Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) sampled Stochastic Gradient Descent (LGD), which leads to superior gradient estimation while keeping the sampling cost per iteration similar to that of the uniform sampling. Such an algorithm is possible due to the sampling view of LSH, which came to light recently. As a consequence of superior and fast estimation, we reduce the running time of all existing gradient descent algorithms, that relies on gradient estimates including Adam, Ada-grad, etc. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal with experiments on linear models as well as the non-linear BERT, which is a recent popular deep learning based language representation model."}}
