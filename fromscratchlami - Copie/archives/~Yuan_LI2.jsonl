Recently, transformer-based methods have achieved advanced performance in point cloud registration by utilizing the advantages of the transformer in order-invariance and modeling dependencies to aggregate information. However, they still suffer from indistinct feature extraction, sensitivity to noise, and outliers, owing to three major limitations: 1) the adoption of CNNs fails to model global relations due to their local receptive fields, resulting in extracted features susceptible to noise; 2) the shallow-wide architecture of transformers and the lack of positional information lead to indistinct feature extraction due to inefficient information interaction; and 3) the insufficient consideration of geometrical compatibility leads to the ambiguous identification of incorrect correspondences. To address the above-mentioned limitations, a novel full transformer network for point cloud registration is proposed, named the deep interaction transformer (DIT), which incorporates: 1) a point cloud structure extractor (PSE) to retrieve structural information and model global relations with the local feature integrator (LFI) and transformer encoders; 2) a deep-narrow point feature transformer (PFT) to facilitate deep information interaction across a pair of point clouds with positional information, such that transformers establish comprehensive associations and directly learn the relative position between points; and 3) a geometric matching-based correspondence confidence evaluation (GMCCE) method to measure spatial consistency and estimate correspondence confidence by the designed triangulated descriptor. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 3DMatch datasets demonstrate that our method is capable of precisely aligning point clouds, consequently, achieving superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

To obtain low-latency (i.e., a small number of timesteps) SNNs, the surrogate gradients (SG) method has been widely applied. However, SNNs trained by the SG method still have a huge performance gap from artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this paper, we find that the knowledge distillation paradigm can effectively alleviate the performance gap by transferring the knowledge from ANNs (teacher) to SNNs (student), but it remains a problem to find the architecture of teacher-student pairs. We introduce neural architecture search (NAS) and find that the performance is insensitive to the architectures of SNNs. Hence, we choose the same architecture for ANN-teacher and SNN-student since it is easy to implement and the student can initiate the weight from the teacher. We thus propose a Self-Architectural Knowledge Distillation framework (SAKD), which matches the knowledge (i.e., the features and logits) of ANNs to that of SNNs with the same architecture. Although adopting a teacher model in training, SNNs trained via our SAKD still keep ultra-low latency (T=4) compared with other methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and DVS-CIFAR10), and we demonstrate that this simple training strategy can provide a new training paradigm of SNNs.\n"}}

SNN receives arising investigations for its high biological plausibility and efficient inference on neuromorphic chips. However, it is still a challenge to train SNNs with more than 50 layers due to the gradient vanishing problem caused by the spiking neuron layers, which greatly prevents SNNs from going deeper to obtain higher performance. In this paper, we first investigate the variants of spiking residual blocks and find that deep SNNs with binary outputs can not be constructed by simply replacing the activation function in the existing residual structure in ANN with the spiking neuron layer. We thus propose a logic spiking network (LSN) to benefit deep SNN training. Our LSN contains two functionally distinct branches, a structure inspired by excitatory and inhibitory pathways followed by a logical operation for binary spike outputs. We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that LSN can implement identity mapping as well as overcome the vanishing gradient problem. Our LSN can be expanded by more than 100 layers with binary outputs and performs favorably against existing spiking ResNet and its variants. Our proposed LSN achieved 94.68% accuracy on CIFAR10, 71.86% accuracy on ImageNet, and 75.1% accuracy on CIFAR10-DVS."}}

Though effective, translating the full feature map can be costly due to redundant computation on some area like the background. In this work, we encapsulate the idea of reducing spatial redundancy into a novel poll and pool (PnP) sampling module, with which we build an end-to-end PnP-DETR architecture that adaptively allocates its computation spatially to be more efficient. Concretely, the PnP module abstracts the image feature map into fine foreground object feature vectors and a small number of coarse background contextual feature vectors. The transformer models information interaction within the fine-coarse feature space and translates the features into the detection result. Moreover, the PnP-augmented model can instantly achieve various desired trade-offs between performance and computation with a single model by varying the sampled feature length, without requiring to train multiple models as existing methods. Thus it offers greater flexibility for deployment in diverse scenarios with varying computation constraint. We further validate the generalizability of the PnP module on panoptic segmentation and the recent transformer-based image recognition model ViT [7] and show consistent efficiency gain. We believe our method makes a step for efficient visual analysis with transformers, wherein spatial redundancy is commonly observed. Code and models will be available."}}
