One of the fundamental barriers to differential NAS-based image restoration is the optimization gap between the super-network and the sub-architectures, causing instability during the searching process. In this paper, we present a novel approach to fill this gap in image denoising application by connecting model-guided design (MoD) with NAS (MoD-NAS). Specifically, we propose to construct a new search space under a model-guided framework and develop more stable and efficient differential search strategies. MoD-NAS employs a highly reusable width search strategy and a densely connected search block to automatically select the operations of each layer as well as network width and depth via gradient descent. During the search process, the proposed MoD-NAS remains stable because of the smoother search space designed under the model-guided framework. Experimental results on several popular datasets show that our MoD-NAS method has achieved at least comparable even better PSNR performance than current state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters, fewer flops, and less testing time. \u201cThe code associate with this paper is available at: <uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/wsdong/Projects/Mod-NAS.htm</uri> \u201d."}}

The task of the challenge was to super-resolve an input image with a magnification factor of \u00d74 based on pairs of low and corresponding high resolution images. The aim was to design a network for single image super-resolution that achieved improvement of efficiency measured according to several metrics including runtime, parameters, FLOPs, activations, and memory consumption while at least maintaining the PSNR of 29.00dB on DIV2K validation set. IMDN is set as the baseline for efficiency measurement. The challenge had 3 tracks including the main track (runtime), sub-track one (model complexity), and sub-track two (overall performance). In the main track, the practical runtime performance of the submissions was evaluated. The rank of the teams were determined directly by the absolute value of the average runtime on the validation set and test set. In sub-track one, the number of parameters and FLOPs were considered. And the individual rankings of the two metrics were summed up to determine a final ranking in this track. In sub-track two, all of the five metrics mentioned in the description of the challenge including runtime, parameter count, FLOPs, activations, and memory consumption were considered. Similar to sub-track one, the rankings of five metrics were summed up to determine a final ranking. The challenge had 303 registered participants, and 43 teams made valid submissions. They gauge the state-of-the-art in efficient single image super-resolution."}}

By generating realistic low-resolution (LR) images with degradation similar to that in real-world scenarios, simulated paired LR-HR data can be constructed for supervised training. However, most of the existing work ignores the degradation uncertainty of the generated realistic LR images, since only one LR image has been generated given an HR image. To address this weakness, we propose learning the degradation uncertainty of generated LR images and sampling multiple LR images from the learned LR image (mean) and degradation uncertainty (variance) and construct LR-HR pairs to train the super-resolution (SR) networks. Specifically, uncertainty can be learned by minimizing the proposed loss based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Furthermore, the uncertainty in the feature domain is exploited by a novel perceptual loss; and we propose to calculate the adversarial loss from the gradient information in the SR stage for stable training performance and better visual quality. Experimental results on popular real-world datasets show that our proposed method has performed better than other unsupervised approaches."}}

As of today, robust principal component analysis (RPCA) has shown highly promising performance with the assumption that the background is low-rank and the foreground is sparse. However, existing RPCA-based methods have overlooked the uncertainty that some parts of the background (e.g., moving leaves in a dynamic background) or even the whole background (e.g., camera jittering) can be moving, which violates the low-rank assumption. To address this issue, we propose a novel enhanced RPCA framework (called ERPCA) by robustly modeling the dynamic background. Different from traditional RPCA framework, the background is decomposed into a low-rank component and a sparse component in the proposed ERPCA framework. Specifically, the sparse parts including foreground and dynamic parts of the background are modeled by Gaussian scale mixture (GSM) model. Moreover, those sparse components are further constrained by temporal consistency using nonzeromeans Gaussian models; the correspondences between sparse pixels in adjacent frames are explored by optical flow. Experimental results on 40 real videos demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, with better average results than current state-of-the-art foreground estimation methods."}}
