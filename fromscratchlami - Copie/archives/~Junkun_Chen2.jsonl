Despite their impressive results on novel-view synthesis, it remains a fundamental challenge for NeRFs to edit the shape of the scene. Our key insight is to exploit the explicit point cloud representation as the underlying structure to construct NeRFs, inspired by the intuitive interpretation of NeRF rendering as a process that projects or \"plots\" the associated 3D point cloud to a 2D image plane. To this end, NeuralEditor introduces a novel rendering scheme based on deterministic integration within K-D tree-guided density-adaptive voxels, which produces both high-quality rendering results and precise point clouds through optimization. NeuralEditor then performs shape editing via mapping associated points between point clouds. Extensive evaluation shows that NeuralEditor achieves state-of-the-art performance in both mesh deformation and scene morphing tasks. Notably, NeuralEditor supports both zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning over the edited shape. Our code, benchmark, and demo video are available at immortalco.github.io/NeuralEditor."}}

Prior work has primarily focused on evaluating the recognition accuracy of various pre-training algorithms, but has overlooked other behavioral aspects. In addition to accuracy, distributional robustness plays a critical role in the reliability of machine learning models. We design and conduct a series of robustness tests to quantify the behavioral differences between contrastive learning and supervised learning to downstream or pre-training data distribution changes. These tests leverage data corruptions at multiple levels, ranging from pixel-level gamma distortion to patch-level shuffling and to dataset-level distribution shift. Our tests unveil intriguing robustness behaviors of contrastive and supervised learning. On the one hand, under downstream corruptions, we generally observe that contrastive learning is surprisingly more robust than supervised learning. On the other hand, under pre-training corruptions, we find contrastive learning vulnerable to patch shuffling and pixel intensity change, yet less sensitive to dataset-level distribution change. We attempt to explain these results through the role of data augmentation and feature space properties. Our insight has implications in improving the downstream robustness of supervised learning."}}

Our tests unveil intriguing robustness behaviors of contrastive and supervised learning: while we generally observe that contrastive learning is more robust than supervised learning under downstream corruptions, we surprisingly discover the robustness vulnerability of contrastive learning under pixel and patch level corruptions during pre-training. Furthermore, we observe the higher dependence of contrastive learning on spatial image coherence information during pre-training, e.g., it is particularly sensitive to global patch shuffling. We explain these results by connecting to feature space uniformity and data augmentation. Our analysis has implications in improving the downstream robustness of supervised learning, and calls for more studies on understanding contrastive learning."}}

Despite rapid progress, state-of-the-art encoders are restrictive to canonicalized point clouds, and have weaker than necessary performance when encountering geometric transformation distortions. To overcome this challenge, we propose PointTree, a general-purpose point cloud encoder that is robust to transformations based on relaxed K-D trees. Key to our approach is the design of the division rule in K-D trees by using principal component analysis (PCA). We use the structure of the relaxed K-D tree as our computational graph, and model the features as border descriptors which are merged with pointwise-maximum operation. In addition to this novel architecture design, we further improve the robustness by introducing pre-alignment \u2013 a simple yet effective PCA-based normalization scheme. Our PointTree encoder combined with pre-alignment consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins, for applications from object classification to semantic segmentation on various transformed versions of the widely-benchmarked datasets.

Logic rules provide interpretable explanations when used for prediction as well as being able to generalize to other tasks, and hence are critical to learn. Existing methods either suffer from the problem of searching in a large search space (e.g., neural logic programming) or ineffective optimization due to sparse rewards (e.g., techniques based on reinforcement learning). To address these limitations, this paper proposes a probabilistic model called RNNLogic. RNNLogic treats logic rules as a latent variable, and simultaneously trains a rule generator as well as a reasoning predictor with logic rules. We develop an EM-based algorithm for optimization. In each iteration, the reasoning predictor is updated to explore some generated logic rules for reasoning. Then in the E-step, we select a set of high-quality rules from all generated rules with both the rule generator and reasoning predictor via posterior inference; and in the M-step, the rule generator is updated with the rules selected in the E-step. Experiments on four datasets prove the effectiveness of RNNLogic."}}
