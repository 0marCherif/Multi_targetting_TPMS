To this end, we propose a projection based encoder-decoder model referred to as pQRNN-MAtt. Studies based on projection methods were restricted to encoder-only models, and we believe this is the first study extending it to seq2seq architectures. The resulting quantized models are less than 3.5MB in size and are well suited for on-device latency critical applications. We show that on MTOP, a challenging multilingual semantic parsing dataset, the average model performance surpasses LSTM based seq2seq model that uses pre-trained embeddings despite being 85x smaller. Furthermore, the model can be an effective student for distilling large pre-trained models such as T5/BERT."}}
