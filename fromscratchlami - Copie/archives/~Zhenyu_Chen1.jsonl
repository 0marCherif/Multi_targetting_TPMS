It achieves this by leveraging local dataset distillation instead of traditional learning approaches (i) to significantly reduce communication volumes and (ii) to limit transfers to one-shot communication, rather than iterative multiway communication. Instead of sharing model updates, as in other federated learning approaches, FedD3 allows the connected clients to distill the local datasets independently, and then aggregates those decentralized distilled datasets (typically in the form a few unrecognizable images, which are normally smaller than a model) across the network only once to form the final model. Our experimental results show that FedD3 significantly outperforms other federated learning frameworks in terms of needed communication volumes, while it provides the additional benefit to be able to balance the trade-off between accuracy and communication cost, depending on usage scenario or target dataset. For instance, for training an AlexNet model on a Non-IID CIFAR-10 dataset with 10 clients, FedD3 can either increase the accuracy by over 71% with a similar communication volume, or save 98% of communication volume, while reaching the same accuracy, comparing to other one-shot federated learning approaches."}}

As input, we assume a point cloud of a 3D scene; the expected output is the bounding boxes along with the descriptions for the underlying objects. To address the 3D object detecting and describing problem at the same time, we propose Scan2Cap, an end-to-end trained architecture, to detect objects in the input scene and generate the descriptions for all of them in natural language. We apply an attention-based captioning method to generate descriptive tokens while referring to the related components in the local context. To better handle the relative spatial relations between objects, a message passing graph module is applied to learn the relation features, which are later used in the captioning phase. On the recently proposed ScanRefer dataset, we show that our architecture can effectively localize and describe the 3D objects in the scene. It also outperforms the 2D-based methods on the 3D dense captioning task by a big margin."}}

Despite developments in both areas, the limited amount of available 3D vision-language data causes overfitting issues for 3D visual grounding and 3D dense captioning methods. Also, how to discriminatively describe objects in complex 3D environments is not fully studied yet. To address these challenges, we present D3Net, an end-to-end neural speaker-listener architecture that can detect, describe and discriminate. Our D3Net unifies dense captioning and visual grounding in 3D in a self-critical manner. This self-critical property of D3Net also introduces discriminability during object caption generation and enables semi-supervised training on ScanNet data with partially annotated descriptions. Our method outperforms SOTA methods in both tasks on the ScanRefer dataset, surpassing the SOTA 3D dense captioning method by a significant margin."}}
