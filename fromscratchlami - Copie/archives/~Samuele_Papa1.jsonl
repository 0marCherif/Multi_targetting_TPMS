In this paper, we systematically investigate the performance of two models on datasets where neural style transfer was used to obtain objects with complex textures while still retaining ground-truth annotations. We find that by using a single module to reconstruct both the shape and visual appearance of each object, the model learns more useful representations and achieves better object separation. In addition, we observe that adjusting the latent space size is insufficient to improve segmentation performance. Finally, the downstream usefulness of the representations is significantly more strongly correlated with segmentation quality than with reconstruction accuracy."}}
