Team sports represent a particularly interesting real-world proving ground since modeling interacting athletes requires capturing highly dynamic and complex agent-agent dependencies in addition to temporal components. However, existing generative methods in this field either entangle all latent factors into a single variable and are thus constrained in practical applicability, or they focus on uncovering interaction structures, which restricts their generative ability. To address this gap, we propose a framework for multiagent trajectories that augments sequential generative models with latent social structures. First, we derive a novel objective via approximate inference using a disentangled latent space that accurately describes the data generating process in such systems. Based on the proposed training criterion, we then present a model architecture that unifies insights from neural interaction inference and graph-structured variational recurrent neural networks for generating collective movements while allocating latent information. We validate our model on data from professional soccer and basketball. Our framework not only improves upon existing state-of-the-art approaches in forecasting trajectories, but also infers semantically meaningful representations that can be used in downstream tasks."}}

Existing probabilistic models in this realm are formalized either in an unsupervised framework, where the latent space is described by discrete or continuous variables, or in a supervised framework, where weakly preserved labels add explicit information to continuous latent representations. To overcome inherent limitations, we propose a novel objective function for processing multi-agent trajectories based on semi-supervised variational autoencoders, where equivariance and interaction of agents are captured via customized graph networks. The resulting architecture disentangles discrete and continuous latent effects and provides a natural solution for injecting expensive domain knowledge into interactive sequential systems. Empirically, our model not only outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines in trajectory forecasting, but also learns to effectively leverage unsupervised multi-agent sequences for classification tasks on interactive real-world sports datasets."}}

Originally, CVMs have been proposed to facilitate learning with multi-modal and structured data and thus seem to perfectly match the requirements of multi-modal multiagent trajectories with their structured output spaces. Empirical results of VRNNs on trajectory data support this assumption. In this paper, we revisit experiments and proposed architectures with additional rigour, ablation runs and baselines. In contrast to common belief, we show that prior results with CVMs on trajectory data might be misleading. Given a neural network with a graph architecture and/or structured output function, variational autoencoding does not seem to contribute statistically significantly to empirical performance. Instead, we show that well-known emission functions do contribute, while coming with less complexity, engineering and computation time.\n"}}

The underlying problem setting resembles discriminative clustering, however, existing approaches focus on the prediction of univariate cluster labels. By contrast, market segments encode complex (future) behavior of the individuals which cannot be represented by a single variable. In this paper, we generalize discriminative clustering to structured and complex output variables that can be represented as graphical models. We devise two novel methods to jointly learn the classifier and the clustering using alternating optimization and collapsed inference, respectively. The two approaches jointly learn a discriminative segmentation of the input space and a generative output prediction model for each segment. We evaluate our methods on segmenting user navigation sequences from Yahoo! News. The proposed collapsed algorithm is observed to outperform baseline approaches such as mixture of experts. We showcase exemplary projections of the resulting segments to display the interpretability of the solutions."}}

We devise new insights on the connection between several existing MKL formulations and develop two efficient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitrary p&gt;1. Empirically, we demonstrate that the interleaved optimization strategies are much faster compared to the traditionally used wrapper approaches. Finally, we apply Lp-norm MKL to real-world problems from computational biology, showing that non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that go beyond the state-of-the-art."}}
