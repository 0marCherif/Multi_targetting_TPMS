Existing studies on weakly supervised paper classification are less concerned with two challenges: (1) Papers should be classified into not only coarse-grained research topics but also fine-grained themes, and potentially into multiple themes, given a large and fine-grained label space; and (2) full text should be utilized to complement the paper title and abstract for classification. Moreover, instead of viewing the entire paper as a long linear sequence, one should exploit the structural information such as citation links across papers and the hierarchy of sections and paragraphs in each paper. To tackle these challenges, in this study, we propose FUTEX, a framework that uses the cross-paper network structure and the in-paper hierarchy structure to classify full-text scientific papers under weak supervision. A network-aware contrastive fine-tuning module and a hierarchy-aware aggregation module are designed to leverage the two types of structural signals, respectively. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that FUTEX significantly outperforms competitive baselines and is on par with fully supervised classifiers that use 1,000 to 60,000 ground-truth training samples."}}

Any instance of MTS is generated from a hybrid dynamical system and their specific dynamics are usually unknown. The hybrid nature of such a dynamical system is a result of complex external attributes, such as geographic location and time of day, each of which can be categorized into either spatial attributes or temporal attributes. Therefore, there are two fundamental views which can be used to analyze MTS data, namely the spatial view and the temporal view. Moreover, from each of these two views, we can partition the set of data samples of MTS into disjoint forecasting tasks in accordance with their associated attribute values. Then, samples of the same task will manifest similar forthcoming pattern, which is less sophisticated to be predicted in comparison with the original single-view setting. Considering this insight, we propose a novel multi-view multi-task (MVMT) learning framework for MTS forecasting. Instead of being explicitly presented in most scenarios, MVMT information is deeply concealed in the MTS data, which severely hinders the model from capturing it naturally. To this end, we develop two kinds of basic operations, namely task-wise affine transformation and task-wise normalization, respectively. Applying these two operations with prior knowledge on the spatial and temporal view allows the model to adaptively extract MVMT information while predicting. Extensive experiments on three datasets are conducted to illustrate that canonical architectures can be greatly enhanced by the MVMT learning framework in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, we design rich case studies to reveal the properties of representations produced at different phases in the entire prediction procedure."}}

Although existing studies have made some progress and can usually achieve proper results, they suffer from understanding deep semantics for reasoning out the questions. In this paper, we develop Gotta, a Generative prOmpT-based daTa Augmentation framework to mitigate the challenge above. Inspired by the human reasoning process, we propose to integrate the cloze task to enhance few-shot QA learning. Following the recent success of prompt-tuning, we present the cloze task in the same format as the main QA task, allowing the model to learn both tasks seamlessly together to fully take advantage of the power of prompt-tuning. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that Gotta consistently outperforms competitive baselines, validating the effectiveness of our proposed prompt-tuning-based cloze task, which not only fine-tunes language models but also learns to guide reasoning in QA tasks. Further analysis shows that the prompt-based loss incorporates the auxiliary task better than the multi-task loss, highlighting the strength of prompt-tuning on the few-shot QA task."}}

The core issue in MTS forecasting is how to effectively model complex spatial-temporal patterns. In this paper, we develop a modular and interpretable forecasting framework, which seeks to individually model each component of the spatial-temporal patterns. We name this framework SCNN, short for Structured Component-based Neural Network. SCNN works with a pre-defined generative process of MTS, which arithmetically characterizes the latent structure of the spatial-temporal patterns. In line with its reverse process, SCNN decouples MTS data into structured and heterogeneous components and then respectively extrapolates the evolution of these components, the dynamics of which is more traceable and predictable than the original MTS. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that SCNN can achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art models on three real-world datasets. Additionally, we examine SCNN with different configurations and perform in-depth analyses of the properties of SCNN."}}

Professional basketball serves as a compelling example of a dynamic spatio-temporal game, encompassing both concealed strategic policies and decision-making. However, processing the diverse on-court signals and navigating the vast space of potential actions and outcomes makes it difficult for existing approaches to swiftly identify optimal strategies in response to evolving circumstances. In this study, we first formulate the sequential decision-making process as a conditional trajectory generation process. We further introduce PLAYBEST (PLAYer BEhavior SynThesis), a method for enhancing player decision-making. We extend the state-of-the-art generative model, diffusion probabilistic model, to learn challenging multi-agent environmental dynamics from historical National Basketball Association (NBA) player motion tracking data. To incorporate data-driven strategies, an auxiliary value function is trained using the play-by-play data with corresponding rewards acting as the plan guidance. To accomplish reward-guided trajectory generation, conditional sampling is introduced to condition the diffusion model on the value function and conduct classifier-guided sampling. We validate the effectiveness of PLAYBEST via comprehensive simulation studies from real-world data, contrasting the generated trajectories and play strategies with those employed by professional basketball teams. Our results reveal that the model excels at generating high-quality basketball trajectories that yield efficient plays, surpassing conventional planning techniques in terms of adaptability, flexibility, and overall performance. Moreover, the synthesized play strategies exhibit a remarkable alignment with professional tactics, highlighting the model's capacity to capture the intricate dynamics of basketball games."}}

During a game, the coaches and players are assumed to follow a general game plan, but players are also forced to make spur-of-the-moment decisions based on immediate conditions on the court. However, because it is challenging to process heterogeneous signals on the court and the space of potential actions and outcomes is massive, it is hard for players to find an optimal strategy on the fly given a short amount of time to observe conditions and take action. In this work, we present ReLiable (ReinforcemEnt Learning In bAsketBaLl gamEs). Specifically, we investigate the possibility of using reinforcement learning (RL) to guide player decisions. We train an offline deep Q-network (DQN) on historical National Basketball Association (NBA) game data from 2015-2016. The data include play-by-play and player movement sensor data. We apply our trained agent to games that it has not seen. Our method is able to propose potentially smarter tactical strategies, compared with replay gameplay data, producing expected final game scores comparable to elite NBA teams. Our approach can be useful for learning strategy policies from other game-like domains characterized by competing groups and sequential spatio-temporal event data."}}

Most of the existing studies focus on structural properties, such as distances and neighborhood proximity between nodes. However, real-world information networks are dominated by the low-degree nodes because they are not only sparse but also subject to the Power law form. Due to the sparsity, proximity-based methods are incapable of deriving satisfactory representations for these tail nodes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, Content-Preserving Locality-Sensitive Hashing~(CP-LSH), by incorporating the content information for representation learning. Specifically, we aim at preserving LSH-based content similarity between nodes to leverage the knowledge from popular nodes to long-tail nodes. We also propose a novel hashing trick to reduce the redundant space consumption so that CP-LSH is capable of tackling industry-scale data. Extensive offline experiments have been conducted on three large-scale public datasets. We also deploy CP-LSH to real-world recommendation systems in one of the largest e-commerce platforms for online experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that CP-LSH outperforms competitive baseline methods in node classification and link prediction tasks. Besides, the results of online experiments also indicate that CP-LSH is practical and robust for real-world production systems."}}

Most existing classifiers leverage textual information in each document. However, in many domains, documents are accompanied by various types of metadata (e.g., authors, venue, and year of a research paper). These metadata and their combinations may serve as strong category indicators in addition to textual contents. In this paper, we explore the potential of using metadata to help weakly supervised text classification. To be specific, we model the relationships between documents and metadata via a heterogeneous information network. To effectively capture higher-order structures in the network, we use motifs to describe metadata combinations. We propose a novel framework, named MotifClass , which (1) selects category-indicative motif instances, (2) retrieves and generates pseudo-labeled training samples based on category names and indicative motif instances, and (3) trains a text classifier using the pseudo training data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MotifClass to existing weakly supervised text classification approaches. Further analysis shows the benefit of considering higher-order metadata information in our framework."}}
