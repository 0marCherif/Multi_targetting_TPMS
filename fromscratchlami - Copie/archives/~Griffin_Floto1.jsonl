This is an issue because VAEs try to attain both a high likelihood with respect to a prior distribution and at the same time, separation between points for better reconstruction. Therefore, a small volume in the high-density region of the prior is problematic because it restricts the separation of latent points.  To ameliorate this, we propose a simple generalization of the Gaussian distribution, called the tilted Gaussian, which has a maximum probability density occurring on a sphere instead of a single point. The tilted Gaussian has exponentially more volume in high-density regions than the standard Gaussian as a function of the distribution dimension. We empirically demonstrate that this simple change in the prior distribution improves VAE performance on the task of detecting unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also introduce a new OOD testing procedure, called the Will-It-Move test, where the tilted Gaussian achieves remarkable OOD performance."}}
