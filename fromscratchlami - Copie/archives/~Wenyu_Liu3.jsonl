However, we argue that such context is still $\\textit{local}$ since the rich cross-sequence relations have not been explicitly investigated. In this paper, we propose a graph contrastive learning framework for skeleton-based action recognition ($\\textit{SkeletonGCL}$) to explore the $\\textit{global}$ context across all sequences. In specific, SkeletonGCL associates graph learning across sequences by enforcing graphs to be class-discriminative, i.e., intra-class compact and inter-class dispersed, which improves the GCN capacity to distinguish various action patterns. Besides, two memory banks are designed to enrich cross-sequence context from two complementary levels, i.e., instance and semantic levels, enabling graph contrastive learning in multiple context scales. Consequently, SkeletonGCL establishes a new training paradigm, and it can be seamlessly incorporated into current GCNs. Without loss of generality, we combine SkeletonGCL with three GCNs (2S-ACGN, CTR-GCN, and InfoGCN), and achieve consistent improvements on NTU60, NTU120, and NW-UCLA benchmarks. "}}

The study is mainly motivated by that random views, used in contrastive learning, and random masked (visible) patches, used in masked image modeling, are often about object parts.\n\nWe explain that masked image modeling is a part-to-part task: the masked patches of the object are hallucinated from the visible patches, and that contrastive learning is a part-to-whole task: the projection layer hallucinates the whole object representation from the object part representation learned from the encoder. The explanation suggests that the self-supervised pretrained encoder is required to understand the object part. We empirically compare the off-the-shelf encoders pretrained with several representative methods on object-level recognition and part-level recognition. The results show that the fully-supervised model outperforms self-supervised models for object-level recognition, and most self-supervised contrastive learning and masked image modeling methods outperform the fully-supervised method for part-level recognition. It is observed that the combination of contrastive learning and masked image modeling further improves the performance."}}

Most existing methods for weakly supervised instance segmentation focus on designing heuristic losses with priors from bounding boxes. While we find that box-supervised methods can produce some fine segmentation masks and we wonder whether the detectors could learn from these fine masks while ignoring low-quality masks. To answer this question, we present BoxTeacher, an efficient and end-to-end training framework for high-performance weakly supervised instance segmentation, which leverages a sophisticated teacher to generate high-quality masks as pseudo labels. Considering the massive noisy masks hurt the training, we present a mask-aware confidence score to estimate the quality of pseudo masks and propose the noise-aware pixel loss and noise-reduced affinity loss to adaptively optimize the student with pseudo masks. Extensive experiments can demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BoxTeacher. Without bells and whistles, BoxTeacher remarkably achieves $34.4$ mask AP and $35.4$ mask AP with ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 respectively on the challenging MS-COCO dataset, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin. The code and models will be available later."}}

We present MapTR, a structured end-to-end Transformer for efficient online vectorized HD map construction. We propose a unified permutation-equivalent modeling approach, i.e., modeling map element as a point set with a group of equivalent permutations, which accurately describes the shape of map element and stabilizes the learning process. We design a hierarchical query embedding scheme to flexibly encode structured map information and perform hierarchical bipartite matching for map element learning. MapTR achieves the best performance and efficiency with only camera input among existing vectorized map construction approaches on nuScenes dataset. In particular, MapTR-nano runs at real-time inference speed ($25.1$ FPS) on RTX 3090, $8\\times$ faster than the existing state-of-the-art camera-based method while achieving $5.0$ higher mAP. Even compared with the existing state-of-the-art multi-modality method, MapTR-nano achieves $0.7$ higher mAP and $8\\times$ faster inference speed, and MapTR-tiny achieves $13.5$ higher mAP and $3\\times$ faster inference speed. Abundant qualitative results show that MapTR maintains stable and robust map construction quality in complex and various driving scenes. MapTR is of great application value in autonomous driving.

Polar grids are rearranged to an array-like regular representation for efficient processing.

Many existing methods usually require fine-grained supervisions (e.g., bounding-box annotations) to learn patch features, which requires a great effort to label images may limit their potential applications. In this paper, we propose to learn patch features via weak supervisions, i.e., only image-level supervisions. To achieve this goal, we treat images as bags and patches as instances to integrate the weakly supervised multiple instance learning constraints into deep neural networks. Also, our method integrates the traditional multiple stages of weakly supervised object classification and discovery into a unified deep convolutional neural network and optimizes the network in an end-to-end way. The network processes the two tasks object classification and discovery jointly, and shares hierarchical deep features. Through this jointly learning strategy, weakly supervised object classification and discovery are beneficial to each other. We test the proposed method on the challenging PASCAL VOC datasets. The results show that our method can obtain state-of-the-art performance on object classification, and very competitive results on object discovery, with faster testing speed than competitors."}}

An effective way to address this problem is to exploit temporal contexts by linking the same object across video to form tubelets and aggregating classification scores in the tubelets. In this paper, we focus on obtaining high quality object linking results for better classification. Unlike previous methods that link objects by checking boxes between neighboring frames, we propose to link in the same frame. To achieve this goal, we extend prior methods in following aspects: (1) a cuboid proposal network that extracts spatio-temporal candidate cuboids which bound the movement of objects; (2) a short tubelet detection network that detects short tubelets in short video segments; (3) a short tubelet linking algorithm that links temporally-overlapping short tubelets to form long tubelets. Experiments on the ImageNet VID dataset show that our method outperforms both the static image detector and the previous state of the art. In particular, our method improves results by 8.8% over the static image detector for fast moving objects."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel deep network for WSOD. Unlike previous networks that transfer the object detection problem to an image classification problem using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), our strategy generates proposal clusters to learn refined instance classifiers by an iterative process. The proposals in the same cluster are spatially adjacent and associated with the same object. This prevents the network from concentrating too much on parts of objects instead of whole objects. We first show that instances can be assigned object or background labels directly based on proposal clusters for instance classifier refinement, and then show that treating each cluster as a small new bag yields fewer ambiguities than the directly assigning label method. The iterative instance classifier refinement is implemented online using multiple streams in convolutional neural networks, where the first is an MIL network and the others are for instance classifier refinement supervised by the preceding one. Experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC, ImageNet detection, and MS-COCO benchmarks for WSOD. Results show that our method outperforms the previous state of the art significantly."}}

Most state-of-the-art~(SOTA) semantic segmentation and object detection approaches reuse neural network architectures designed for image classification as the backbone, commonly pre-trained on ImageNet. However, performance gains can be achieved by designing network architectures specifically for detection and segmentation, as shown by recent neural architecture search (NAS) research for detection and segmentation. One major challenge though, is that ImageNet pre-training of the search space representation (a.k.a. super network) or the searched networks incurs huge computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Fast Neural Network Adaptation (FNA) method, which can adapt both the architecture and parameters of a seed network (e.g. a high performing manually designed backbone) to become a network with different depth, width, or kernels via a Parameter Remapping technique, making it possible to utilize NAS for detection/segmentation tasks a lot more efficiently. In our experiments, we conduct FNA on MobileNetV2 to obtain new networks for both segmentation and detection that clearly out-perform existing networks designed both manually and by NAS. The total computation cost of FNA is significantly less than SOTA segmentation/detection NAS approaches: 1737$\\times$ less than DPC, 6.8$\\times$ less than Auto-DeepLab and 7.4$\\times$ less than DetNAS.
