One fundamental situation is the \\emph{covariate shift}, where the input distributions of data change from training to testing stages while the input-conditional output distribution remains unchanged. In this paper, we initiate the study of a more challenging scenario -- \\emph{continuous} covariate shift -- in which the test data appear sequentially, and their distributions can shift continuously. Our goal is to adaptively train the predictor such that its prediction risk accumulated over time can be minimized. Starting with the importance-weighted learning, we show the method works effectively if the time-varying density ratios of test and train inputs can be accurately estimated. However, existing density ratio estimation methods would fail due to data scarcity at each time step. To this end, we propose an online method that can appropriately reuse historical information. Our density ratio estimation method is proven to perform well by enjoying a dynamic regret bound, which finally leads to an excess risk guarantee for the predictor. Empirical results also validate the effectiveness."}}

This paper investigates the problem of learning from incomplete and inaccurate supervision, where only a limited subset of training data is labeled but potentially with noise. This setting is challenging and of great importance but rarely studied in the literature. We notice that in many applications, the limited labeled data are with certain structures, which paves us a way to design effective methods. Specifically, we observe that labeled data are usually with one-sided noise such as the bug detection task, where the identified buggy codes are indeed with defects, while codes checked many times or newly fixed may still have other flaws. Furthermore, when there occurs two-sided noise in the labeled data, we exploit the class-prior information of unlabeled data, which is typically available in practical tasks. We propose novel approaches for the incomplete and inaccurate supervision learning tasks and effectively alleviate the negative influence of label noise with the help of a vast number of unlabeled data. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments justify and validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches."}}

For instance, in the environmental monitoring task, sensors are collecting the data all the time. Still, their labels are scarce because the labeling process requires human effort and can conceal annotation errors. This paper investigates the problem of learning with weakly labeled data streams, in which data are continuously collected, and only a limited subset of streaming data is labeled but potentially with noise. This setting is challenging and of great importance but rarely studied in the literature. When the data are constantly gathered with unknown noise on labels, it is quite challenging to design algorithms to obtain a well-generalized classifier. To address this difficulty, we propose a novel noise transition matrix estimation approach for data streams with scarce noisy labels by online anchor points identification. Based on that, we propose an adaptive learning algorithm for weakly labeled data streams via model reuse and effectively alleviate the negative influence of label noise with unlabeled data. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments justify and validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}
