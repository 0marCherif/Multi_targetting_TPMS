We provide a formal framework for examining the fairness of data representations through the lens of their effect on decisions (mainly classification) made based on data represented that way.  Using that framework, we prove that several desiderata for fair representations cannot be achieved. While some of our conclusions are intuitive, we formulate (and prove) crisp statements of such impossibilities, often contrasting impressions conveyed by many recent works on fair representations."}}
