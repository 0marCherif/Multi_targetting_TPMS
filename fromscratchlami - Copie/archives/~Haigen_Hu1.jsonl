In this work, a two-stage hierarchical method is proposed to detect and recognize different life stages of bladder cells by using two cascade Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Initially, a hybrid object proposal algorithm (called EdgeSelective) by combining EdgeBoxes and Selective Search is proposed to generate candidate object proposals instead of a single Selective Search method in Region-CNN (R-CNN), and it can exploit the advantages of different mechanisms for generating proposals so that each cell in the image can be fully contained by at least one proposed region during the detection process. Then, the obtained cells from the previous step are used to train and extract features by employing CNNs for the purpose of cell life stage recognition. Finally, a series of comparison experiments are implemented. The results show that the proposed method can obtain better performance than traditional methods either in the stage of cell detection or cell life stage recognition, and it encourages and suggests the application in the development of new anticancer drug and cytopathology analysis of cancer patients in the near future."}}

Combining GA and derivative-free iterative methods, a multi-root solver is proposed for a class of complex nonlinear functions with discontinuity, non-differentiability and multi-root in this work. Firstly, an improved GA (IGA) is presented by integrating an adaptive crossover operator and three kinds of manual intervention measures into the standard GA to further improve the global searching ability. Then, a global search in the domain is implemented by using the proposed IGA, and the qualified individuals are selected as initial approximations. Finally, based on this, local accurate convergence is achieved by combining the derivative-free iterative method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a series of numerical experiments are conducted, and the results show that the proposed multi-root solver has better performance in efficiency, stability as well as applicability."}}

In this paper, a novel segmentation scheme is proposed for the infections of COVID-19 by enhancing supervised information and fusing multi-scale feature maps of different levels based on the encoder-decoder architecture. To this end, a deep collaborative supervision (Co-supervision) scheme is proposed to guide the network learning the features of edges and semantics. More specifically, an Edge Supervised Module (ESM) is firstly designed to highlight low-level boundary features by incorporating the edge supervised information into the initial stage of down-sampling. Meanwhile, an Auxiliary Semantic Supervised Module (ASSM) is proposed to strengthen high-level semantic information by integrating mask supervised information into the later stage. Then an Attention Fusion Module (AFM) is developed to fuse multiple scale feature maps of different levels by using an attention mechanism to reduce the semantic gaps between high-level and low-level feature maps. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated on four various COVID-19 CT datasets. The results show that the proposed three modules are all promising. Based on the baseline (ResUnet), using ESM, ASSM, or AFM alone can respectively increase Dice metric by 1.12%, 1.95%,1.63% in our dataset, while the integration by incorporating three models together can rise 3.97%. Compared with the existing approaches in various datasets, the proposed method can obtain better segmentation performance in some main metrics, and can achieve the best generalization and comprehensive performance."}}

In this work, a novel methodology is proposed to adaptively customize activation functions only by adding very few parameters to the traditional activation functions such as Sigmoid, Tanh, and rectified linear unit (ReLU). To verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, some theoretical and experimental analysis on accelerating the convergence and improving the performance is presented, and a series of experiments are conducted based on various network models (such as AlexNet, VggNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet and DenseNet), and various datasets (such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, miniImageNet, PASCAL VOC, and COCO). To further verify the validity and suitability in various optimization strategies and usage scenarios, some comparison experiments are also implemented among different optimization strategies (such as SGD, Momentum, AdaGrad, AdaDelta, and ADAM) and different recognition tasks such as classification and detection. The results show that the proposed methodology is very simple but with significant performance in convergence speed, precision, and generalization, and it can surpass other popular methods such as ReLU and adaptive functions such as Swish in almost all experiments in terms of overall performance."}}
