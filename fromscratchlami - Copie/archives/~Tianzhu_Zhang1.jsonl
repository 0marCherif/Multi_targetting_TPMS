Existing methods mainly focus on learning modality-shared representations by embedding images from different modalities into a common feature space, in which some discriminative modality information is discarded. Different from these methods, in this paper, we propose a novel ModalitySpecific Memory Network (MSMNet) to complete the missing modality information and aggregate visible and infrared modality features into a unified feature space for the VI-ReID task. The proposed model enjoys several merits. First, it can exploit the missing modality information to alleviate the modality discrepancy when only the single-modality input is provided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit the missing modality information completion and alleviate the modality discrepancy with the memory network. Second, to guide the learning process of the memory network, we design three effective learning strategies, including feature consistency, memory representativeness and structural alignment. By incorporating these learning strategies in a unified model, the memory network can be well learned to propagate identity-related information between modalities and boost the VI-ReID performance. Extensive experimental results on two standard benchmarks (SYSUMM01 and RegDB) demonstrate that the proposed MSMNet performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods."}}

Existing depth estimation systems, however, suffer inevitably from real-world corruptions and perturbations and are struggled to provide reliable depth predictions under such cases. In this paper, we summarize the winning solutions from the RoboDepth Challenge -- an academic competition designed to facilitate and advance robust OoD depth estimation. This challenge was developed based on the newly established KITTI-C and NYUDepth2-C benchmarks. We hosted two stand-alone tracks, with an emphasis on robust self-supervised and robust fully-supervised depth estimation, respectively. Out of more than two hundred participants, nine unique and top-performing solutions have appeared, with novel designs ranging from the following aspects: spatial- and frequency-domain augmentations, masked image modeling, image restoration and super-resolution, adversarial training, diffusion-based noise suppression, vision-language pre-training, learned model ensembling, and hierarchical feature enhancement. Extensive experimental analyses along with insightful observations are drawn to better understand the rationale behind each design. We hope this challenge could lay a solid foundation for future research on robust and reliable depth estimation and beyond. The datasets, competition toolkit, workshop recordings, and source code from the winning teams are publicly available on the challenge website."}}

Most exist attack methods focus on crafting adversarial examples in the digital domain, while only limited works study physical adversarial attack. However, it is more challenging to generate effective adversarial examples in the physical world due to many uncontrollable physical dynamics. Most current physical attack methods aim to generate robust physical adversarial examples by simulating all possible physical dynamics. When attacking new images or new DNN models, they require expensive manually efforts for simulating physical dynamics and considerable time for iteratively optimizing for each image. To tackle these issues, we propose a class-agnostic and model-agnostic physical adversarial attack model (Meta-Attack), which is able to not only generate robust physical adversarial examples by simulating color and shape distortions, but also generalize to attacking novel images and novel DNN models by accessing a few digital and physical images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formulate the physical attack as a few-shot learning problem. Here, the training task is redefined as the composition of a support set, a query set, and a target DNN model. Under the few- shot setting, we design a novel class-agnostic and model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm to enhance the generalization ability of our method. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets with four challenging experimental settings verify the superior robustness and generalization of our method by comparing to state-of-the-art physical attack methods.

However, most existing methods only exploit the visual cues of these concepts but ignore external knowledge information for modeling explicit relationships between them. In fact, humans have remarkable ability to transfer knowledge learned from familiar classes to recognize unfamiliar classes. To narrow the knowledge gap between existing methods and humans, we propose an end-to-end ZSAR framework based on a structured knowledge graph, which can jointly model the relationships between action-attribute, action-action, and attribute-attribute. To effectively leverage the knowledge graph, we design a novel Two-Stream Graph Convolutional Network (TS-GCN) consisting of a classifier branch and an instance branch. Specifically, the classifier branch takes the semantic-embedding vectors of all the concepts as input, then generates the classifiers for action categories. The instance branch maps the attribute embeddings and scores of each video instance into an attribute-feature space. Finally, the generated classifiers are evaluated on the attribute features of each video, and a classification loss is adopted for optimizing the whole network. In addition, a self-attention module is utilized to model the temporal information of videos. Extensive experimental results on three realistic action benchmarks Olympic Sports, HMDB51 and UCF101 demonstrate the favorable performance of our proposed framework."}}

However, most of existing siamese methods do not take full advantage of spatial-temporal target appearance modeling under different contextual situations. In fact, the spatial-temporal information can provide diverse features to enhance the target representation, and the context information is important for online adaption of target localization. To comprehensively leverage the spatial-temporal structure of historical target exemplars and get benefit from the context information, in this work, we present a novel Graph Convolutional Tracking (GCT) method for high-performance visual tracking. Specifically, the GCT jointly incorporates two types of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) into a siamese framework for target appearance modeling. Here, we adopt a spatial-temporal GCN to model the structured representation of historical target exemplars. Furthermore, a context GCN is designed to utilize the context of the current frame to learn adaptive features for target localization. Extensive results on 4 challenging benchmarks show that our GCT method performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers while running around 50 frames per second."}}

However, most existing sparse trackers only consider holistic or local representations and do not make full use of the intrinsic structure among and inside target candidate regions, thereby making them less effective when similar objects appear at close proximity or under occlusion. In this paper, we propose a novel structural sparse representation, which not only exploits the intrinsic relationships among target candidate regions and local patches to learn their representations jointly, but also preserves the spatial structure among the local patches inside each target candidate region. For robust visual tracking, we take outliers resulting from occlusion and noise into account when searching for the best target region. Constructed within a Bayesian filtering framework, we show that the proposed algorithm accommodates most existing sparse trackers with respective merits. The formulated problem can be efficiently solved using an accelerated proximal gradient method that yields a sequence of closed form updates. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed tracking algorithm performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods."}}

We first present the multi-task correlation filter (MCF) that takes the interdependencies among different object parts and features into account to learn the correlation filters jointly. Next, the proposed MCPF is introduced to exploit and complement the strength of a MCF and a particle filter. Compared with existing tracking methods based on correlation filters and particle filters, the proposed MCPF enjoys several merits. First, it exploits the interdependencies among different features to derive the correlation filters jointly, and makes the learned filters complement and enhance each other to obtain consistent responses. Second, it handles partial occlusion via a part-based representation, and exploits the intrinsic relationship among local parts via spatial constraints to preserve object structure and learn the correlation filters jointly. Third, it effectively handles large scale variation via a sampling scheme by drawing particles at different scales for target object state estimation. Fourth, it shepherds the sampled particles toward the modes of the target state distribution via the MCF, and effectively covers object states well using fewer particles than conventional particle filters, thereby resulting in robust tracking performance and low computational cost. Extensive experimental results on four challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MCPF tracking algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods."}}

A new dataset has been compiled and a performance evaluation methodology that focuses on long-term tracking capabilities has been adopted. The VOT toolkit has been updated to support both standard short-term and the new long-term tracking subchallenges. Performance of the tested trackers typically by far exceeds standard baselines.
