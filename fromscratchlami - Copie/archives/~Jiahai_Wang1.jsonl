Detecting its formation and evaporation helps to monitor the state of a system, allowing to issue a warning signal for harmful emergent phenomena. Since there is no centralized controller of CAS, detecting emergence based on each agent's local observation is desirable but challenging. Existing works are unable to capture emergence-related spatial patterns, and fail to model the nonlinear relationships among agents. This paper proposes a hierarchical framework with spatio-temporal consistency learning to solve these two problems by learning the system representation and agent representations, respectively. Especially, spatio-temporal encoders are tailored to capture agents' nonlinear relationships and the system's complex evolution. Representations of the agents and the system are learned by preserving the intrinsic spatio-temporal consistency in a self-supervised manner. Our method achieves more accurate detection than traditional methods and deep learning methods on three datasets with well-known yet hard-to-detect emergent behaviors. Notably, our hierarchical framework is generic, which can employ other deep learning methods for agent-level and system-level detection."}}

When these problems are extended to multiobjective ones, it becomes difficult for the existing DRL approaches to flexibly and efficiently deal with multiple subproblems determined by the weight decomposition of objectives. This article proposes a concise meta-learning-based DRL approach. It first trains a meta-model by meta-learning. The meta-model is fine-tuned with a few update steps to derive submodels for the corresponding subproblems. The Pareto front is then built accordingly. Compared with other learning-based methods, our method can greatly shorten the training time of multiple submodels. Due to the rapid and excellent adaptability of the meta-model, more submodels can be derived so as to increase the quality and diversity of the found solutions. The computational experiments on multiobjective traveling salesman problems and multiobjective vehicle routing problems with time windows demonstrate the superiority of our method over most of the learning-based and iteration-based approaches."}}

This task aims to identify explicit opinion targets from user-generated documents. Currently, the mainstream methods for aspect extraction are built on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are difficult to parallelize. To accelerate the training/testing process, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods are introduced. However, such models usually utilize the same set of filters to convolve all input documents, and hence, the unique information inherent in each document may not be fully captured. To alleviate this issue, we propose a CNN-based model that employs a set of dynamic filters. Specifically, the proposed model extracts the aspects in a document using the filters generated from the aspect information intrinsic in the document. With the dynamically generated filters, our model is capable of learning more important features concerning aspects, thus promoting the effectiveness of aspect extraction. Furthermore, considering that aspects can be grouped into certain topics that conversely indicate the target words that need to be extracted, we naturally introduce a neural topic model (NTM) and integrate latent topics into the CNN-based module to help identify aspects. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the joint model is able to effectively identify aspects and produce interpretable topics."}}

For incompletely automated job shop, MFFJSSP is more important and conforms to the actual production. To solve the MFFJSSP, an effective multi-objective fuzzy scheduling method was proposed. First, a fuzzy number processing method based on fuzzy clustering that is more in line with the actual production was designed to replace the classic triangular fuzzy number. Second, based on the critical path theory, a more efficient method of critical operation block selection and critical operation movement were designed and applied them to the chemotaxis stage of bacterial foraging optimization algorithm to improve the accuracy of optimization and reduce invalid movement. Third, a novel decision tree-based bacterial reproduction method was designed to prevent the algorithm from falling into a local optimal solution. Finally, some cases were generated to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm from multiple dimensions."}}

A practical extension of VRP is the electric vehicle routing problem with time windows (EVRPTW). In this problem, the realistic traveling distance and time are non-Euclidean and asymmetric, and the constraints are more complex. These characteristics result in a challenge when using the DRL approach to solve it. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end DRL method with a two-stage training strategy. First, a graph attention network with edge features is designed to tackle the graph with the asymmetric traveling distance and time matrix. The node and edge features of the graph are effectively correlated and captured. Then, a two-stage training strategy is proposed to handle the complicated constraints. Some constraints are allowed to be violated to enhance exploration in the first stage, while all the constraints are enforced to be satisfied to guarantee a feasible solution in the second stage. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and can be generalized well to different problem sizes."}}

Modeling the interactions among agents is the key to understanding and predicting the dynamics of the complex system, e.g., predicting the trajectories of traffic participants in the city. Compared with interaction modeling in homogeneous systems such as pedestrians in a crowded scene, heterogeneous interaction modeling is less explored. Worse still, the error accumulation problem becomes more severe since the interactions are more complex. To tackle the two problems, this article proposes heterogeneous interaction modeling with reduced accumulated error (HIMRAE) for multiagent trajectory prediction. Based on the historical trajectories, our method infers the dynamic interaction graphs among agents, featured by directed interacting relations and interacting effects. A heterogeneous attention mechanism (HAM) is defined on the interaction graphs for aggregating the influence from heterogeneous neighbors to the target agent. To alleviate the error accumulation problem, this article analyzes the error sources from the spatial and temporal perspectives, and proposes to introduce the graph entropy and the mixup training strategy for reducing the two types of errors, respectively. Our method is examined on three real-world datasets containing heterogeneous agents, and the experimental results validate the superiority of our method."}}

Traditional TSP presumes that the locations of customers and the traveling time among customers are fixed and constant. In real-life cases, however, the traffic conditions and customer requests may change over time. To find the most economic route, the decisions can be made constantly upon the time-point when the salesman completes his service of each customer. This brings in a dynamic version of the traveling salesman problem (DTSP), which takes into account the information of real-time traffic and customer requests. DTSP can be extended to a dynamic pickup and delivery problem (DPDP). In this article, we ameliorate the attention model to make it possible to perceive environmental changes. A deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to solve DTSP and DPDP instances with a size of up to 40 customers in 100 locations. Experiments show that our method can capture the dynamic changes and produce a highly satisfactory solution within a very short time. Compared with other baseline approaches, more than 5% improvements can be observed in many cases."}}

Yet no complex value representations appear in single neuron architectures. In this article, we first extend DNM from a real-value domain to a complex-valued one. Performance of complex-valued DNM (CDNM) is evaluated through a complex XOR problem, a non-minimum phase equalization problem, and a real-world wind prediction task. Also, a comparative analysis on a set of elementary transcendental functions as an activation function is implemented and preparatory experiments are carried out for determining hyperparameters. The experimental results indicate that the proposed CDNM significantly outperforms real-valued DNM, complex-valued multi-layer perceptron, and other complex-valued neuron models."}}
