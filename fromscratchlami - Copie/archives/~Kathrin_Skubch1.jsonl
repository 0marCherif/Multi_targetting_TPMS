The vulnerability of VAEs has been attributed to the limitations associated with their variational formulation. Deterministic autoencoders could overcome the practical limitations associated with VAEs and offer a promising alternative for image generation applications. In this work, we propose an adversarially robust deterministic autoencoder with superior performance in terms of both generation and robustness of the learned representations. We introduce a regularization scheme to incorporate adversarially perturbed data points to the training pipeline without increasing the computational complexity or compromising the generation fidelity by leveraging a loss based on the two-point Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test between representations. We conduct extensive experimental studies on popular image benchmark datasets to quantify the robustness of the proposed approach based on the adversarial attacks targeted at VAEs. Our empirical findings show that the proposed method achieves significant performance in both robustness and fidelity when compared to the robust VAE models."}}

For applications that depend on uncertainty estimates, e.g., in Bayesian optimization, recent probabilistic approaches have shown good performance at test time, but either scale poorly with the number of data points or under-perform with little data on the test task. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to probabilistic transfer learning that uses a generative model for the underlying data distribution and simultaneously learns a latent feature distribution to represent unknown task properties. To enable fast and accurate inference at test-time, we introduce a novel meta-loss that structures the latent space to match the prior used for inference. Together, these contributions ensure that our probabilistic model exhibits high sample-efficiency and provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. We evaluate the proposed approach and compare its performance to probabilistic models from the literature on a set of Bayesian optimization transfer-learning tasks. "}}
