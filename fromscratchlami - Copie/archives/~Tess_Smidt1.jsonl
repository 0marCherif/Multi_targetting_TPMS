In this paper, we demonstrate that Transformers can generalize well to 3D atomistic graphs and present Equiformer, a graph neural network leveraging the strength of Transformer architectures and incorporating SE(3)/E(3)-equivariant features based on irreducible representations (irreps). First, we propose a simple and effective architecture by only replacing original operations in Transformers with their equivariant counterparts and including tensor products. Using equivariant operations enables encoding equivariant information in channels of irreps features without complicating graph structures. With minimal modifications to Transformers, this architecture has already achieved strong empirical results. Second, we propose a novel attention mechanism called equivariant graph attention, which improves upon typical attention in Transformers through replacing dot product attention with multi-layer perceptron attention and including non-linear message passing. With these two innovations, Equiformer achieves competitive results to previous models on QM9, MD17 and OC20 datasets."}}

Moreover, to better adapt Transformers to 3D graphs, we propose a novel equivariant graph attention, which considers both content and geometric information such as relative position contained in irreps features. To improve expressivity of the attention, we replace dot product attention with multi\u0002-layer perceptron attention and include non-linear message passing. We benchmark Equiformer on two quantum properties prediction datasets, QM9 and OC20. For QM9, among models trained with the same data partition, Equiformer achieves best results on 11 out of 12 regression tasks. For OC20, under the same setting of training with IS2RE data only, Equiformer improves upon state-of-the-art models."}}

Especially valuable are Laplacian eigenvectors, which capture useful structural information about graphs and other geometric objects. However, ambiguities arise when computing eigenvectors: for each eigenvector v, the sign flipped -v is also an eigenvector. More generally, higher dimensional eigenspaces contain infinitely many choices of eigenvector bases. In this work we introduce SignNet and BasisNet --- new neural architectures that are invariant to all requisite symmetries and hence process collections of eigenspaces in a principled manner. Our networks are universal, i.e., they can approximate any continuous function of eigenvectors with the proper invariances. They are also theoretically strong for graph representation learning --- they can provably approximate any spectral graph convolution,  spectral invariants that go beyond message passing neural networks, and other graph positional encodings.

For each node in the graph, the network outputs probabilities for each of the partitions. The graph neural network consists of two modules: an embedding phase and a partitioning phase. The embedding phase is trained first by minimizing a loss function inspired by spectral graph theory. The partitioning module is trained through a loss function that corresponds to the expected value of the normalized cut. Both parts of the neural network rely on SAGE convolutional layers and graph coarsening using heavy edge matching. The multilevel structure of the neural network is inspired by the multigrid algorithm. Our approach generalizes very well to bigger graphs and has partition quality comparable to METIS, Scotch and spectral partitioning, with shorter runtime compared to METIS and spectral partitioning."}}

However, such CG procedure induces information losses, which makes accurate backmapping, i.e., restoring fine-grained (FG) coordinates from CG coordinates, a long-standing challenge. Inspired by the recent progress in generative models and equivariant networks, we propose a novel model that rigorously embeds the vital probabilistic nature and geometric consistency requirements of the backmapping transformation. Our model encodes the FG uncertainties into an invariant latent space and decodes them back to FG geometries via equivariant convolutions. To standardize the evaluation of this domain, we provide three comprehensive benchmarks based on molecular dynamics trajectories. Experiments show that our approach always recovers more realistic structures and outperforms existing data-driven methods with a significant margin."}}

The ENN library e3nn has customizable convolutions, which can be designed to depend only on distances between points, or also on angular features, making them rotationally invariant, or equivariant, respectively. This paper studies the practical value of including angular dependencies for molecular property prediction directly via an ablation study with \\texttt{e3nn} and the QM9 data set. We find that, for fixed network depth and parameter count, adding angular features decreased test error by an average of 23%. Meanwhile, increasing network depth decreased test error by only 4% on average, implying that rotationally equivariant layers are comparatively parameter efficient. We present an explanation of the accuracy improvement on the dipole moment, the target which benefited most from the introduction of angular features."}}

Instead of training on a fixed set of properties, more recent approaches attempt to learn the electronic wavefunction (or density) as a central quantity of atomistic systems, from which all other observables can be derived. This is complicated by the fact that wavefunctions transform non-trivially under molecular rotations, which makes them a challenging prediction target. To solve this issue, we introduce general SE(3)-equivariant operations and building blocks for constructing deep learning architectures for geometric point cloud data and apply them to reconstruct wavefunctions of atomistic systems with unprecedented accuracy. Our model achieves speedups of over three orders of magnitude compared to ab initio methods and reduces prediction errors by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the previous state-of-the-art. This accuracy makes it possible to derive properties such as energies and forces directly from the wavefunction in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in a transfer learning application, where a model trained on low accuracy reference wavefunctions implicitly learns to correct for electronic many-body interactions from observables computed at a higher level of theory. Such machine-learned wavefunction surrogates pave the way towards novel semi-empirical methods, offering resolution at an electronic level while drastically decreasing computational cost. Additionally, the predicted wavefunctions can serve as initial guess in conventional ab initio methods, decreasing the number of iterations required to arrive at a converged solution, thus leading to significant speedups without any loss of accuracy or robustness. While we focus on physics applications in this contribution, the proposed equivariant framework for deep learning on point clouds is promising also beyond, say, in computer vision or graphics. "}}
