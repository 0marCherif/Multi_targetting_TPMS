Comparatively, 3D poses new challenges stemming from occlusions not depicted in the image. Prior works try to overcome these by inferring from multiple views or rely on scarce CAD models and category-specific priors which hinder scaling to novel settings. In this work, we explore single-view 3D reconstruction by learning generalizable representations inspired by advances in self-supervised learning. We introduce a simple framework that operates on 3D points of single objects or whole scenes coupled with category-agnostic large-scale training from diverse RGB-D videos. Our model, Multiview Compressive Coding (MCC), learns to compress the input appearance and geometry to predict the 3D structure by querying a 3D-aware decoder. MCC's generality and efficiency allow it to learn from large-scale and diverse data sources with strong generalization to novel objects imagined by DALL\u22c5E 2 or captured in-the-wild with an iPhone.\n"}}

For 2D recognition, large datasets and scalable solutions have led to unprecedented advances. In 3D, existing benchmarks are small in size and approaches specialize in few object categories and specific domains, e.g. urban driving scenes. Motivated by the success of 2D recognition, we revisit the task of 3D object detection by introducing a large benchmark, called Omni3D. Omni3D re-purposes and combines existing datasets resulting in 234k images annotated with more than 3 million instances and 97 categories.3D detection at such scale is challenging due to variations in camera intrinsics and the rich diversity of scene and object types. We propose a model, called Cube R-CNN, designed to generalize across camera and scene types with a unified approach. We show that Cube R-CNN outperforms prior works on the larger Omni3D and existing benchmarks. Finally, we prove that Omni3D is a powerful dataset for 3D object recognition, show that it improves single-dataset performance and can accelerate learning on new smaller datasets via pre-training."}}

For AI agents, the ability to recognize a scene from any viewpoint given only a few images enables them to efficiently interact with the scene and its objects. In this work, we attempt to endow machines with this ability. We propose a model which takes as input a few RGB images of a new scene and recognizes the scene from novel viewpoints by segmenting it into semantic categories. All this without access to the RGB images from those views. We pair 2D scene recognition with an implicit 3D representation and learn from multi-view 2D annotations of hundreds of scenes without any 3D supervision beyond camera poses. We experiment on challenging datasets and demonstrate our model's ability to jointly capture semantics and geometry of novel scenes with diverse layouts, object types and shapes."}}

However, state-of-the-art models have millions of parameters represented as floats which make them computationally expensive and constrain their deployment on hardware such as mobile phones and IoT nodes. Most commonly, activations of deep neural networks tend to be sparse thus proving that models are over parametrized with redundant neurons. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, have recently shown promising results by improving model complexity with little loss in performance. In this work, we extended pruning, a compression technique that discards unnecessary model connections, and weight sharing techniques for the task of object detection. With our approach, we are able to compress a state-of-the-art object detection model by 30.0% without a loss in performance. We also show that our compressed model can be easily initialized with existing pre-trained weights, and thus is able to fully utilize published state-of-the-art model zoos."}}

Extending into 3D may advance many new applications including autonomous vehicles, virtual and augmented reality, authoring 3D content, and even improving 2D recognition. However despite growing interest, 3D deep learning remains relatively underexplored. We believe that some of this disparity is due to the engineering challenges involved in 3D deep learning, such as efficiently processing heterogeneous data and reframing graphics operations to be differentiable. We address these challenges by introducing PyTorch3D, a library of modular, efficient, and differentiable operators for 3D deep learning. It includes a fast, modular differentiable renderer for meshes and point clouds, enabling analysis-by-synthesis approaches. Compared with other differentiable renderers, PyTorch3D is more modular and efficient, allowing users to more easily extend it while also gracefully scaling to large meshes and images. We compare the PyTorch3D operators and renderer with other implementations and demonstrate significant speed and memory improvements. We also use PyTorch3D to improve the state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D mesh and point cloud prediction from 2D images on ShapeNet. PyTorch3D is open-source and we hope it will help accelerate research in 3D deep learning."}}

This is challenging; it requires comprehensively understanding the 3D scene from images. As a result, current methods typically use multiple images, train on ground-truth depth, or are limited to synthetic data. We propose a novel end-to-end model for this task using a single image at test time; it is trained on real images without any ground-truth 3D information. To this end, we introduce a novel differentiable point cloud renderer that is used to transform a latent 3D point cloud of features into the target view. The projected features are decoded by our refinement network to inpaint missing regions and generate a realistic output image. The 3D component inside of our generative model allows for interpretable manipulation of the latent feature space at test time, e.g. we can animate trajectories from a single image. Additionally, we can generate high resolution images and generalise to other input resolutions. We outperform baselines and prior work on the Matterport, Replica, and RealEstate10K datasets."}}
