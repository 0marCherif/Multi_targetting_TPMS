Unfortunately, as a network becomes deeper, BP becomes inefficient for various reasons. This paper proposes a new methodology for decoupling BP to transform a long gradient flow into multiple short ones in order to address the optimization issues caused by long gradient flows. We report thorough experiments conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our model compared with BP and associated learning (AL), a state-of-the-art methodology for backpropagation decoupling. We will release the source code for the experiments after acceptance.\n"}}
