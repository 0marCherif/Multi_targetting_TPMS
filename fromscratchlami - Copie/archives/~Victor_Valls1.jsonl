The nodes host VNFs offering different and possibly time-varying gains for each stage of the chain, and our goal is to maximize the analytics performance while minimizing the data transfer and processing costs. The VNFs' performance is revealed only after their execution, since it is data-dependent or controlled by third-parties, while the service requests and network costs might also vary with time. We devise an operation algorithm that learns, on the fly, the optimal routing policy and the composition and length of each chain. Our algorithm combines a lightweight sampling technique and a Lagrange-based primal-dual iteration, allowing it to be scalable and attain provable optimality guarantees. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm using a video analytics service, and explore how it is affected by different system parameters. Our model and optimization framework is readily extensible to different types of networks and services."}}

One of the fundamental tasks of circuit switches is to compute a sparse collection of switching configurations to support a traffic demand matrix. Such a problem has been addressed in the literature with variations of the approach proposed by Birkhoff in 1946 to decompose a doubly stochastic matrix exactly. However, the existing methods are heuristic and do not have theoretical guarantees on how well a collection of switching configurations (i.e., permutations) can approximate a traffic matrix (i.e., a scaled doubly stochastic matrix). In this paper, we revisit Birkhoff's approach and make three contributions. First, we establish the first theoretical bound on the sparsity of Birkhoff's algorithm (i.e., the number of switching configurations necessary to approximate a traffic matrix). In particular, we show that by using a subset of the admissible permutation matrices, Birkhoff's algorithm obtains an $\\epsilon$-approximate decomposition with at most $O( \\log(1 / \\epsilon))$ permutations. Second, we propose a new algorithm, Birkhoff+, which combines the wealth of Frank-Wolfe with Birkhoff's approach to obtain sparse decompositions in a fast manner. And third, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm numerically and study how this affects the performance of a circuit switch. Our results show that Birkhoff+ is superior to previous algorithms in terms of throughput, running time, and number of switching configurations."}}

Myopic actions are important in control because decisions need to be made in an online manner and without knowledge of future events and discrete actions, because many systems have a finite (so nonconvex) number of control decisions. For example, whether to transmit a packet or not in communication networks. Our results show that these two features can be encompassed in the subgradient method for the Lagrange dual problem by the use of stochastic and \u03b5-subgradients. One of the appealing features of our approach is that it decouples the choice of a control action from a specific choice of subgradient, which allows us to design control policies without changing the underlying convex updates. Two classes of discrete control policies are presented: one that can make discrete actions by looking only at the system's current state, and another that selects actions using blocks. The latter class is useful for handling systems that have constraints on the order in which actions are selected."}}

IoT nodes are powered by batteries, can process (some of) the data locally, and the quality grade or performance of how data analytics tasks are carried out depends on where these are executed. The goal is to design a resource allocation algorithm that jointly maximizes the network lifetime and the performance of the data analytics tasks subject to energy constraints. This joint maximization problem is challenging with coupled resource constraints that induce non-convexity. We first show that the problem can be mapped to an equivalent convex problem, and then propose an online algorithm that provably solves the problem and does not require any a priori knowledge of the time-varying wireless link capacities and data analytics arrival process statistics. The algorithm's optimality properties are derived using an analysis which, to the best of our knowledge, proves for the first time the convergence of the dual subgradient method with time-varying sets. Our simulations seeded by real IoT device energy measurements, show that the network connectivity plays a crucial role in network lifetime maximization, that the algorithm can obtain both maximum network lifetime and maximum data analytics performance in addition to maximizing the joint objective, and that the algorithm increases the network lifetime by approximately 50% compared to an algorithm that minimizes the total energy consumption."}}
