However, existing sample-based or one-shot NAS approaches require excessive time or computational cost to be used in multiple practical scenarios. Recently, to alleviate such issues, zero-cost NAS methods that are efficient proxies have been proposed, yet their performance is rather poor due to the strong assumption that they predict the final performance of a given architecture with random initialization. In this work, we propose a novel NAS based on block-wise parameter remapping (PR) and knowledge distillation (KD), which shows high predictive performance while being fast and lightweight enough to be used iteratively to support multiple real-world scenarios. PR significantly shortens training steps and accordingly we can reduce the required time/data for KD to work as an accurate proxy to just few batches, which is largely practical in real-world. In the experiments, we validate the proposed method for its accuracy estimation performance on CIFAR-10 from the MobileNetV3 search space. It outperforms all relevant baselines in terms of performance estimation with only 20 batches."}}

Previous DaNAS methods have mostly tackled the search for the neural architecture for fixed datasets and the teacher, which are not generalized well on a new task consisting of an unseen dataset and an unseen teacher, thus need to perform a costly search for any new combination of the datasets and the teachers. For standard NAS tasks without KD, meta-learning-based computationally efficient NAS methods have been proposed, which learn the generalized search process over multiple tasks (datasets) and transfer the knowledge obtained over those tasks to a new task. However, since they assume learning from scratch without KD from a teacher, they might not be ideal for DaNAS scenarios. To eliminate the excessive computational cost of DaNAS methods and the sub-optimality of rapid NAS methods, we propose a distillation-aware meta-accuracy prediction model, DaSS (Distillation-aware Student Search), which can predict a given architecture's final performances on a dataset when performing KD with a given teacher, without having actually to train it on the target task. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed meta-prediction model successfully generalizes to multiple unseen datasets for DaNAS tasks, largely outperforming existing meta-NAS methods and rapid NAS baselines.
