One class of causal discovery techniques are founded based on the argument that there are inherent structural asymmetries between the causal and anti-causal direction which could be leveraged in determining the direction of causation. To go about capturing these discrepancies between cause and effect remains to be a challenge and many current state-of-the-art algorithms propose to compare the norms of the kernel mean embeddings of the conditional distributions. In this work, we argue that such approaches based on RKHS embeddings are insufficient in capturing principal markers of cause-effect asymmetry involving higher-order structural variabilities of the conditional distributions. We propose Kernel Intrinsic Invariance Measure with Heterogeneous Transform (KIIM-HT) which introduces a novel score measure based on heterogeneous transformation of RKHS embeddings to extract relevant higher-order moments of the conditional densities for causal discovery. Inference is made via comparing the score of each hypothetical cause-effect direction. Tests and comparisons on a synthetic dataset, a two-dimensional synthetic dataset and the real-world benchmark dataset T\\\"ubingen Cause-Effect Pairs verify our approach. In addition, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to the regularization parameter to faithfully compare previous work to our method and an experiment with trials on varied hyperparameter values to showcase the robustness of our algorithm."}}

Therefore, identifying the root cause layout patterns of failures becomes increasingly crucial for yield improvement. In this article, a novel layout-aware diagnosis-based layout pattern analysis framework is proposed to identify the root cause efficiently. At the first stage of the framework, an encoder network trained using contrastive learning is used to extract representations of layout snippets that are invariant to trivial transformations, including shift, rotation, and mirroring, which are then clustered to form layout patterns. At the second stage, we model the causal relationship between any potential root cause layout patterns and the systematic defects by a structural causal model, which is then used to estimate the average causal effect (ACE) of candidate layout patterns on the systematic defect to identify the true root cause. Experimental results on real industrial cases demonstrate that our framework outperforms a commercial tool with higher accuracies and around <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\times 8.4$ </tex-math></inline-formula> speedup on average."}}

Available methods, mostly in Bayesian or causal inference literature, suffer from two main drawbacks: 1) cannot attributing for individuals, (2) attributing one single cause at a time and cannot deal with the interaction effect among multiple causes. In this paper, based on our proposed new measurement, called conditional counterfactual causality effect (CCCE), we introduce an individual causal attribution method, which is able to utilize the individual observation as the evidence and consider common influence and interaction effect of multiple causes simultaneously. We discuss the identifiability of CCCE and also give the identification formulas under proper assumptions. Finally, we conduct experiments on simulated and real data to illustrate the effectiveness of CCCE and the results show that our proposed method outperforms significantly over state-of-the-art methods."}}

Specifically, we derive that a composition of affine coupling layers and invertible linear transforms achieves this universality. Furthermore, in parametric cases where the diffeomorphism depends on some extra parameters, we prove the corresponding approximation theorems for parametric coupling flows named Para-CFlows. In practice, we apply Para-CFlows as a neural surrogate model in contextual Bayesian optimization tasks, to demonstrate its superiority over other neural surrogate models in terms of optimization performance and gradient approximations."}}

When data are divided into distinct environments according to the heterogeneity, recent invariant learning methods have proposed to learn robust and invariant models using this environment partition. It is hence tempting to utilize the inherent heterogeneity even when environment partition is not provided. Unfortunately, in this work, we show that learning invariant features under this circumstance is fundamentally impossible without further inductive biases or additional information. Then, we propose a framework to jointly learn environment partition and invariant representation, assisted by additional auxiliary information. We derive sufficient and necessary conditions for our framework to provably identify invariant features under a fairly general setting. Experimental results on both synthetic and real world datasets validate our analysis and demonstrate an improved performance of the proposed framework. Our findings also raise the need of making the role of  inductive biases more explicit when learning invariant models without environment partition in future works.

In this paper, we revisit the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm, which is widely cited as a score-based algorithm for learning the MEC of the underlying causal structure. We observe that in order to make the GES algorithm consistent in a nonparametric setting, it is not necessary to design a scoring metric that evaluates graphs. Instead, it suffices to plug in a consistent estimator of a measure of conditional dependence to guide the search. We therefore present a reframing of the GES algorithm, which is more flexible than the standard score-based version and readily lends itself to the nonparametric setting with a general measure of conditional dependence. In addition, we propose a neural conditional dependence (NCD) measure, which utilizes the expressive power of deep neural networks to characterize conditional independence in a nonparametric manner. We establish the optimality of the reframed GES algorithm under standard assumptions and the consistency of using our NCD estimator to decide conditional independence. Together these results justify the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in causal discovery, as well as the advantages of using our NCD measure over kernel-based measures."}}

Recently, causality has become a powerful tool to tackle the OOD generalization problem, with the idea resting on the causal mechanism that is invariant across domains of interest. To leverage the generally unknown causal mechanism, existing works assume a linear form of causal feature or require sufficiently many and diverse training domains, which are usually restrictive in practice. In this work, we obviate these assumptions and tackle the OOD problem without explicitly recovering the causal feature. Our approach is based on transformations that modify the non-causal feature but leave the causal part unchanged, which can be either obtained from prior knowledge or learned from the training data in the multi-domain scenario. Under the setting of invariant causal mechanism, we theoretically show that if all such transformations are available, then we can learn a minimax optimal model across the domains using only single domain data. Noticing that knowing a complete set of these causal invariant transformations may be impractical, we further show that it suffices to know only a subset of these transformations. Based on the theoretical findings, a regularized training procedure is proposed to improve the OOD generalization capability. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, even with only a few causal invariant transformations."}}
