Our goal was to study whether machine-learning can be trained to predict stroke recurrence and identify key clinical variables and assess whether performance metrics can be optimized. Methods: We used patient-level data from electronic health records, six interpretable algorithms (Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree), four feature selection strategies, five prediction windows, and two sampling strategies to develop 288 models for up to 5-year stroke recurrence prediction. We further identified important clinical features and different optimization strategies. Results: We included 2091 ischemic stroke patients. Model area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was stable for prediction windows of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, with the highest score for the 1-year (0.79) and the lowest score for the 5-year prediction window (0.69). A total of 21 (7%) models reached an AUROC above 0.73 while 110 (38%) models reached an AUROC greater than 0.7. Among the 53 features analyzed, age, body mass index, and laboratory-based features (such as high-density lipoprotein, hemoglobin A1c, and creatinine) had the highest overall importance scores. The balance between specificity and sensitivity improved through sampling strategies. Conclusion: All of the selected six algorithms could be trained to predict the long-term stroke recurrence and laboratory-based variables were highly associated with stroke recurrence. The latter could be targeted for personalized interventions. Model performance metrics could be optimized, and models can be implemented in the same healthcare system as intelligent decision support for targeted intervention."}}

Yet, recognizing the signs of stroke in an acute setting is still challenging and leads to loss of opportunity to intervene, given the narrow therapeutic window. A decision support system using artificial intelligence (AI) and clinical data from electronic health records combined with patients\u2019 presenting symptoms can be designed to support emergency department providers in stroke diagnosis and subsequently reduce the treatment delay. In this article, we present a practical framework to develop a decision support system using AI by reflecting on the various stages, which could eventually improve patient care and outcome. We also discuss the technical, operational, and ethical challenges of the process.\n"}}

The imputation of missingness is a key step in Electronic Health Records (EHR) mining, as it can significantly affect the conclusions derived from the downstream analysis in translational medicine. The missingness of laboratory values in EHR is not at random, yet imputation techniques tend to disregard this key distinction. Consequently, the development of an adaptive imputation strategy designed specifically for EHR is an important step in improving the data imbalance and enhancing the predictive power of modeling tools for healthcare applications. Method. We analyzed the laboratory measures derived from Geisinger\u2019s EHR on patients in three distinct cohorts\u2014patients tested for Clostridioides difficile (Cdiff) infection, patients with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and patients with a diagnosis of hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA). We extracted Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) from which we excluded those with 75% or more missingness. The comorbidities, primary or secondary diagnosis, as well as active problem lists, were also extracted. The adaptive imputation strategy was designed based on a hybrid approach. The comorbidity patterns of patients were transformed into latent patterns and then clustered. Imputation was performed on a cluster of patients for each cohort independently to show the generalizability of the method. The results were compared with imputation applied to the complete dataset without incorporating the information from comorbidity patterns. Results. We analyzed a total of 67,445 patients (11,230 IBD patients, 10,000 OA patients, and 46,215 patients tested for C. difficile infection). We extracted 495 LOINC and 11,230 diagnosis codes for the IBD cohort, 8160 diagnosis codes for the Cdiff cohort, and 2042 diagnosis codes for the OA cohort based on the primary/secondary diagnosis and active problem list in the EHR. Overall, the most improvement from this strategy was observed when the laboratory measures had a higher level of missingness. The best root mean square error (RMSE) difference for each dataset was recorded as \u221235.5 for the Cdiff, \u22128.3 for the IBD, and \u221211.3 for the OA dataset. Conclusions. An adaptive imputation strategy designed specifically for EHR that uses complementary information from the clinical profile of the patient can be used to improve the imputation of missing laboratory values, especially when laboratory codes with high levels of missingness are included in the analysis."}}

Predicting a patient\u2019s progression to septic shock is an active field of translational research. The goal of this study was to develop a working model of a clinical decision support system for predicting septic shock in an acute care setting for up to 6 h from the time of admission in an integrated healthcare setting. Method: Clinical data from Electronic Health Record (EHR), at encounter level, were used to build a predictive model for progression from sepsis to septic shock up to 6 h from the time of admission; that is, T = 1, 3, and 6 h from admission. Eight different machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, C5.0, Decision Trees, Boosted Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Regularized Logistic, and Bayes Generalized Linear Model) were used for model development. Two adaptive sampling strategies were used to address the class imbalance. Data from two sources (clinical and billing codes) were used to define the case definition (septic shock) using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Sepsis criteria. The model assessment was performed using Area under Receiving Operator Characteristics (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity. Model predictions for each feature window (1, 3 and 6 h from admission) were consolidated. Results: Retrospective data from April 2005 to September 2018 were extracted from the EHR, Insurance Claims, Billing, and Laboratory Systems to create a dataset for septic shock detection. The clinical criteria and billing information were used to label patients into two classes-septic shock patients and sepsis patients at three different time points from admission, creating two different case-control cohorts. Data from 45,425 unique in-patient visits were used to build 96 prediction models comparing clinical-based definition versus billing-based information as the gold standard. Of the 24 consolidated models (based on eight machine learning algorithms and three feature windows), four models reached an AUROC greater than 0.9. Overall, all the consolidated models reached an AUROC of at least 0.8820 or higher. Based on the AUROC of 0.9483, the best model was based on Random Forest, with a sensitivity of 83.9% and specificity of 88.1%. The sepsis detection window at 6 h outperformed the 1 and 3-h windows. The sepsis definition based on clinical variables had improved performance when compared to the sepsis definition based on only billing information. Conclusion: This study corroborated that machine learning models can be developed to predict septic shock using clinical and administrative data. However, the use of clinical information to define septic shock outperformed models developed based on only administrative data. Intelligent decision support tools can be developed and integrated into the EHR and improve clinical outcomes and facilitate the optimization of resources in real-time."}}
