Assessing the credibility of scientific findings and claims in research publications has long been a time-consuming and challenging task for researchers and decision-makers. In this paper, we introduce RES - an intelligent system that assists humans in analyzing the credibility of scientific findings and claims in research publications in the field of social and behavioral sciences by estimating their replicability. The pipeline of RES consists of four major modules that perform feature extraction, replicability estimation, result explanation, and sentiment analysis respectively.

Learning representations that disentangle these latent factors can bring semantic-rich representations of time series and further enhance interpretability. However, directly adopting the sequential models, such as Long Short-Term Memory Variational AutoEncoder (LSTM-VAE), would encounter a Kullback?Leibler (KL) vanishing problem: the LSTM decoder often generates sequential data without efficiently using latent representations, and the latent spaces sometimes could even be independent of the observation space. And traditional disentanglement methods may intensify the trend of KL vanishing along with the disentanglement process, because they tend to penalize the mutual information between the latent space and the observations. In this paper, we propose Disentangle Time-Series, a novel disentanglement enhancement framework for time series data. Our framework achieves multi-level disentanglement by covering both individual latent factors and group semantic segments. We propose augmenting the original VAE objective by decomposing the evidence lower-bound and extracting evidence linking factorial representations to disentanglement. Additionally, we introduce a mutual information maximization term between the observation space to the latent space to alleviate the KL vanishing problem while preserving the disentanglement property. Experimental results on five real-world IoT datasets demonstrate that the representations learned by DTS achieve superior performance in various tasks with better interpretability."}}

To encourage models to learn correct gender features, we reorganize the COCO dataset and present two new splits COCO-GB V1 and V2 datasets where the train and test sets have different gender-context joint distribution.

While significant progress has been made to achieve accurate representations for downstream applications, the learned representations often lack interpretability and do not expose semantic meanings. Different from previous efforts on the entangled feature space, we aim to extract the semantic-rich temporal correlations in the latent interpretable factorized representation of the data. Motivated by the success of disentangled representation learning in computer vision, we study the possibility of learning semantic-rich time-series representations, which remains unexplored due to three main challenges: 1) sequential data structure introduces complex temporal correlations and makes the latent representations hard to interpret, 2) sequential models suffer from KL vanishing problem, and 3) interpretable semantic concepts for time-series often rely on multiple factors instead of individuals. To bridge the gap, we propose Disentangle Time Series (DTS), a novel disentanglement enhancement framework for sequential data. Specifically, to generate hierarchical semantic concepts as the interpretable and disentangled representation of time-series, DTS introduces multi-level disentanglement strategies by covering both individual latent factors and group semantic segments. We further theoretically show how to alleviate the KL vanishing problem: DTS introduces a mutual information maximization term, while preserving a heavier penalty on the total correlation and the dimension-wise KL to keep the disentanglement property. Experimental results on various real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the representations learned by DTS achieve superior performance in downstream applications, with high interpretability of semantic concepts."}}

This teacher-student framework requires a well-trained teacher model which is computationally expensive. Moreover, the performance of the student model could be limited by the teacher model if the teacher model is not optimal. In the light of collaborative learning, we study the feasibility of involving joint intellectual efforts from diverse perspectives of student models. In this work, we introduce dual policy distillation (DPD), a student-student framework in which two learners operate on the same environment to explore different perspectives of the environment and extract knowledge from each other to enhance their learning. The key challenge in developing this dual learning framework is to identify the beneficial knowledge from the peer learner for contemporary learning-based reinforcement learning algorithms, since it is unclear whether the knowledge distilled from an imperfect and noisy peer learner would be helpful. To address the challenge, we theoretically justify that distilling knowledge from a peer learner will lead to policy improvement and propose a disadvantageous distillation strategy based on the theoretical results. The conducted experiments on several continuous control tasks show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance with a learning-based agent and function approximation without the use of expensive teacher models."}}
