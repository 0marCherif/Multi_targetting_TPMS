Even though curriculum RL, a framework that solves complex tasks by proposing a sequence of surrogate tasks, shows reasonable results, most of the previous works still have difficulty in proposing curriculum due to the absence of a mechanism for obtaining calibrated guidance to the desired outcome state without any prior domain knowledge. To alleviate it, we propose an uncertainty & temporal distance-aware curriculum goal generation method for the outcome-directed RL via solving a bipartite matching problem. It could not only provide precisely calibrated guidance of the curriculum to the desired outcome states but also bring much better sample efficiency and geometry-agnostic curriculum goal proposal capability compared to previous curriculum RL methods. We demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms these prior methods in a variety of challenging navigation tasks and robotic manipulation tasks in a quantitative and qualitative way."}}

To alleviate such limitation, state-based offline RL leverages a learned dynamics model from the logged experience and augments the predicted state transition to extend the data distribution. For exploiting such benefit also on the image-based RL, we firstly propose a generative model, S2P (State2Pixel), which synthesizes the raw pixel of the agent from its corresponding state. It enables bridging the gap between the state and the image domain in RL algorithms, and virtually exploring unseen image distribution via model-based transition in the state space. Through experiments, we confirm that our S2P-based image synthesis not only improves the image-based offline RL performance but also shows powerful generalization capability on unseen tasks."}}

However, existing reinforcement learning algorithms assume an episodic setting, in which the agent resets to a fixed initial state distribution at the end of each episode, to successfully train the agents from repeated trials. Such reset mechanism, while trivial for simulated tasks, can be challenging to provide for real-world robotics tasks. Resets in robotic systems often require extensive human supervision and task-specific workarounds, which contradicts the goal of autonomous robot learning. In this paper, we propose an extension to conventional reinforcement learning towards greater autonomy by introducing an additional agent that learns to reset in a self-supervised manner. The reset agent preemptively triggers a reset to prevent manual resets and implicitly imposes a curriculum for the forward agent. We apply our method to learn from scratch on a suite of simulated and real-world continuous control tasks and demonstrate that the reset agent successfully learns to reduce manual resets whilst also allowing the forward policy to improve gradually over time."}}

To alleviate it, unsupervised RL, a framework that pre-trains the agent in a task-agnostic manner without access to the task-specific reward, leverages active exploration for distilling diverse experience into essential skills or reusable knowledge. For exploiting such benefits also in robotic manipulation, we propose an unsupervised method for transferable manipulation skill discovery that ties structured exploration toward interacting behavior and transferable skill learning. It not only enables the agent to learn interaction behavior, the key aspect of the robotic manipulation learning, without access to the environment reward, but also to generalize to arbitrary downstream manipulation tasks with the learned task-agnostic skills.
