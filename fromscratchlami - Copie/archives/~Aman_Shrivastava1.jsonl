Nuclei segmentation, for instance, is an important task for diagnosing different cancers. However, training deep learning models for nuclei segmentation requires large amounts of annotated data, which is expensive to collect and label. This necessitates explorations into generative modeling of histopathological images. In this work, we use recent advances in conditional diffusion modeling to formulate a first-of-its-kind nuclei-aware semantic tissue generation framework (NASDM) which can synthesize realistic tissue samples given a semantic instance mask of up to six different nuclei types, enabling pixel-perfect nuclei localization in generated samples. These synthetic images are useful in applications in pathology pedagogy, validation of models, and supplementation of existing nuclei segmentation datasets. We demonstrate that NASDM is able to synthesize high-quality histopathology images of the colon with superior quality and semantic controllability over existing generative methods."}}

Along this direction, we propose a trainable neural network layer that learns a global interaction graph between words and then selects more informative words using the learned word interactions. Our layer, we call WIGRAPH, can plug into any neural network-based NLP text classifiers right after its word embedding layer. Across multiple SOTA NLP models and various NLP datasets, we demonstrate that adding the WIGRAPH layer substantially improves NLP models' interpretability and enhances models' prediction performance at the same time."}}

In this work, we propose Mutual Information Maximization Knowledge Distillation (MIMKD). Our method uses a contrastive objective to simultaneously estimate and maximize a lower bound on the mutual information between intermediate and global feature representations from the teacher and the student networks. Our method is flexible, as the proposed mutual information maximization does not impose significant constraints on the structure of the intermediate features of the networks. As such, we can distill knowledge from arbitrary teachers to arbitrary students. Our empirical results show that our method outperforms competing approaches across a wide range of student-teacher pairs with different capacities, with different architectures, and when student networks are with extremely low capacity. We are able to obtain 74.55% accuracy on CIFAR100 with a ShufflenetV2 from a baseline accuracy of 69.8% by distilling knowledge from ResNet50."}}

Compared to the previously proposed CLIP model, CLIP-Lite requires only one negative image-text sample pair for every positive image-text sample during the optimization of its contrastive learning objective. We accomplish this by taking advantage of an information efficient lower-bound to maximize the mutual information between the two input modalities. This allows CLIP-Lite to be trained with significantly reduced amounts of data and batch sizes while obtaining better performance than CLIP. We evaluate CLIP-Lite by pretraining on the COCO-Captions dataset and testing transfer learning to other datasets. CLIP-Lite obtains a +15.4% mAP absolute gain in performance on Pascal VOC classification, and a +22.1% top-1 accuracy gain on ImageNet, while being comparable or superior to other, more complex, text-supervised models. CLIP-Lite is also superior to CLIP on image and text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual grounding. Finally, by performing explicit image-text alignment during representation learning, we show that CLIP-Lite can leverage language semantics to encourage bias-free visual representations that can be used in downstream tasks.

Variation in the H&E staining process across different lab sites can lead to significant variations in biopsy image appearance. These variations introduce an undesirable bias when the slides are examined by pathologists or used for training deep learning models. To reduce this bias, slides need to be translated to a common domain of stain appearance before analysis. We propose a Self-Attentive Adversarial Stain Normalization (SAASN) approach for the normalization of multiple stain appearances to a common domain. This unsupervised generative adversarial approach includes self-attention mechanism for synthesizing images with finer detail while preserving the structural consistency of the biopsy features during translation. SAASN demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to other popular stain normalization techniques on H&E stained duodenal biopsy image data."}}
