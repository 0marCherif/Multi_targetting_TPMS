Unlike typical few-shot learning algorithms, we propose a contrastive learning method which is not trained to solve a set of tasks, but rather attempts to find a good representation of the underlying data-generating processes (\\emph{functions}). This allows for finding representations which are useful for an entire series of tasks sharing the same function. In particular, our training scheme is driven by the self-supervision signal indicating whether two sets of samples stem from the same underlying function. Our experiments on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets show that the representations we obtain can outperform strong baselines in terms of downstream performance and noise robustness, even when these baselines are trained in an end-to-end manner."}}

The mechanism leading to fast adaptation is the conditioning of a downstream predictive model on the inferred representation of the task's underlying data generative process, or \\emph{function}. This \\emph{meta-representation}, which is computed from a few observed examples of the underlying function, is learned jointly with the predictive model. In this work, we study the implications of this joint training on the transferability of the meta-representations. Our goal is to learn meta-representations that are robust to noise in the data and facilitate solving a wide range of downstream tasks that share the same underlying functions. To this end, we propose a decoupled encoder-decoder approach to supervised meta-learning, where the encoder is trained with a contrastive objective to find a good representation of the underlying function. In particular, our training scheme is driven by the self-supervision signal indicating whether two sets of examples stem from the same function.

Across them exist both shared regularities and environment specifics. To learn robust cross-environment descriptions of sequences we introduce disentangled state space models (DSSM). In the latent space of DSSM environment-invariant state dynamics is explicitly disentangled from environment-specific information governing that dynamics. We empirically show that such separation enables robust prediction, sequence manipulation and environment characterization. We also propose an unsupervised VAE-based training procedure to learn DSSM as Bayesian filters. In our experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in controlled generation and prediction of bouncing ball video sequences across varying gravitational influences."}}
