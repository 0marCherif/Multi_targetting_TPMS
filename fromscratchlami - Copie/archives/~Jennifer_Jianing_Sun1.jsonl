Compared to standard time series imputation settings, new challenges for imputing neural recordings include the lack of adjacent timestamps for electrodes missing over days, and generalization across days and participants with different electrode configurations. Due to these challenges, the standard practice in neuroscience is to discard electrodes with missing data, even if only a part of the recording is corrupted, significantly reducing the already limited and difficult-to-obtain data. In this paper, we establish Deep Neural Imputation (DNI), a framework to recover missing electrode recordings by learning across sessions, spatial locations, and participants. We first instantiate DNI with natural linear baselines, then develop encoder-decoder approaches based on masked electrode modeling. We evaluate DNI on 12 multielectrode, human neural datasets with naturalistic behavior. We demonstrate DNI's data imputation ability across a broad range of metrics as well as integrate DNI into an existing neural data analysis pipeline."}}

However, cameras generally capture human poses in 2D as images and videos, which can have significant appearance variations across viewpoints that make the recognition tasks challenging. To address this, we explore recognizing similarity in 3D human body poses from 2D information, which has not been well-studied in existing works. Here, we propose an approach to learning a compact view-invariant embedding space from 2D body joint keypoints, without explicitly predicting 3D poses. Input ambiguities of 2D poses from projection and occlusion are difficult to represent through a deterministic mapping, and therefore we adopt a probabilistic formulation for our embedding space. Experimental results show that our embedding model achieves higher accuracy when retrieving similar poses across different camera views, in comparison with 3D pose estimation models. We also show that by training a simple temporal embedding model, we achieve superior performance on pose sequence retrieval and largely reduce the embedding dimension from stacking frame-based embeddings for efficient large-scale retrieval. Furthermore, in order to enable our embeddings to work with partially visible input, we further investigate different keypoint occlusion augmentation strategies during training. We demonstrate that these occlusion augmentations significantly improve retrieval performance on partial 2D input poses. Results on action recognition and video alignment demonstrate that using our embeddings without any additional training achieves competitive performance relative to other models specifically trained for each task."}}

However, in a typical experiment, many factors corrupt neural recordings from individual electrodes, including electrical noise, movement artifacts, and faulty manufacturing. Currently, common practice is to discard these corrupted recordings, reducing already limited data that is difficult to collect. To address this challenge, we propose Deep Neural Imputation (DNI), a framework to recover missing values from electrodes by learning from data collected across spatial locations, days, and participants. We explore our framework with a linear nearest-neighbor approach and two deep generative autoencoders, demonstrating DNI's flexibility. One deep autoencoder models participants individually, while the other extends this architecture to model many participants jointly. We evaluate our models across 12 human participants implanted with multielectrode intracranial electrocorticography arrays; participants had no explicit task and behaved naturally across hundreds of recording hours. We show that DNI recovers not only time series but also frequency content, and further establish DNI's practical value by recovering significant performance on a scientifically-relevant downstream neural decoding task."}}

Our framework naturally incorporates symbolic expert knowledge into the learning process, which leads to more interpretable and factorized latent representations compared to fully neural encoders. We integrate modern program synthesis techniques with the variational autoencoding (VAE) framework, in order to learn a neurosymbolic encoder in conjunction with a standard decoder. The programmatic descriptions from our encoders can benefit many analysis workflows, such as in behavior modeling where interpreting agent actions and movements is important. We evaluate our method on learning latent representations for real-world trajectory data from animal biology and sports analytics. We show that our approach offers significantly better separation of meaningful categories than standard VAEs and leads to practical gains on downstream analysis tasks, such as for behavior classification."}}

Starting from the observation that behaving agents are generally the main sources of movement in behavioral videos, our method, Behavioral Keypoint Discovery (B-KinD), uses an encoder-decoder architecture with a geometric bottleneck to reconstruct the spatiotemporal difference between video frames. By focusing only on regions of movement, our approach works directly on input videos without requiring manual annotations. Experiments on a variety of agent types (mouse, fly, human, jellyfish, and trees) demonstrate the generality of our approach and reveal that our discovered keypoints represent semantically meaningful body parts, which achieve state-of-the-art performance on key-point regression among self-supervised methods. Additionally, B-KinD achieve comparable performance to supervised keypoints on downstream tasks, such as behavior classification, suggesting that our method can dramatically reduce model training costs vis-a-vis supervised methods."}}

Weak supervision has been studied to reduce annotation costs by using weak labels from task-specific labeling functions (LFs) to augment ground truth labels. However, domain experts still need to hand-craft different LFs for different tasks, limiting scalability. To reduce expert effort, we present AutoSWAP: a framework for automatically synthesizing data-efficient task-level LFs. The key to our approach is to efficiently represent expert knowledge in a reusable domain-specific language and more general domain-level LFs, with which we use state-of-the-art program synthesis techniques and a small labeled dataset to generate task-level LFs. Additionally, we propose a novel structural diversity cost that allows for efficient synthesis of diverse sets of LFs, further improving AutoSWAP's performance. We evaluate AutoSWAP in three behavior analysis domains and demonstrate that AutoSWAP outperforms existing approaches using only afraction of the data. Our results suggest that AutoSWAP is an effective way to automatically generate LFs that can significantly reduce expert effort for behavior analysis."}}

The expansion of open-source tools for video acquisition and analysis has led to new experimental approaches to understand behavior. Here, we review currently available open-source tools for video analysis and discuss how to set up these methods for labs new to video recording. We also discuss best practices for developing and using video analysis methods, including community-wide standards and critical needs for the open sharing of datasets and code, more widespread comparisons of video analysis methods, and better documentation for these methods especially for new users. We encourage broader adoption and continued development of these tools, which have tremendous potential for accelerating scientific progress in understanding the brain and behavior."}}
