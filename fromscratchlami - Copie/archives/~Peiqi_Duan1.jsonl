Worse still, the photometric constancy that enhancement techniques heavily relied on is fragile for frames with short exposure. Event cameras can record brightness changes at an extremely high temporal resolution. For low-light videos, event data are not only suitable to help capture temporal correspondences but also provide alternative observations in the form of intensity ratios between consecutive frames and exposure-invariant information. Motivated by this, we propose a low-light video enhancement method with hybrid inputs of events and frames. Specifically, a neural network is trained to establish spatiotemporal coherence between visual signals with different modalities and resolutions by constructing correlation volume across space and time. Experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}}

In contrast, recent neuromorphic cameras like event camera and spike camera can record high dynamic range scenes in the form of intensity maps, but with much lower spatial resolution and no color information. In this article, we propose a hybrid imaging system (denoted as NeurImg) that captures and fuses the visual information from a neuromorphic camera and ordinary images from an RGB camera to reconstruct high-quality high dynamic range images and videos. The proposed NeurImg-HDR+ network consists of specially designed modules, which bridges the domain gaps on resolution, dynamic range, and color representation between two types of sensors and images to reconstruct high-resolution, high dynamic range images and videos. We capture a test dataset of hybrid signals on various HDR scenes using the hybrid camera, and analyze the advantages of the proposed fusing strategy by comparing it to state-of-the-art inverse tone mapping methods and merging two low dynamic range images approaches. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on both synthetic data and real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid high dynamic range imaging system.

Such stringent requirements, however, cannot be directly satisfied by a single imager or imaging modality, rather by multi-modal sensors with complementary advantages. In this paper, we address high performance imaging by exploring the synergy between traditional frame-based sensors with high spatial resolution and low sensor noise, and emerging event-based sensors with high speed and high dynamic range. We introduce a novel computational framework, termed Guided Event Filtering (GEF), to process these two streams of input data and output a stream of super-resolved yet noise-reduced events. To generate high quality events, GEF first registers the captured noisy events onto the guidance image plane according to our flow model. it then performs joint image filtering that inherits the mutual structure from both inputs. Lastly, GEF re-distributes the filtered event frame in the space-time volume while preserving the statistical characteristics of the original events. When the guidance images under-perform, GEF incorporates an event self-guiding mechanism that resorts to neighbor events for guidance. We demonstrate the benefits of GEF by applying the output high quality events to existing event-based algorithms across diverse application categories, including high speed object tracking, depth estimation, high frame-rate video synthesis, and super resolution/HDR/color image restoration."}}

RS effect introduces edge distortion and region occlusion into images caused by row-wise read-out of CMOS sensors. We introduce a novel computational imaging setup consisting of an RS sensor and an event sensor, and propose a neural network called EvUnroll to solve this problem by exploring the high-temporal-resolution property of events. We use events to bridge a spatio-temporal connection between RS and GS, establish a flow estimation module to correct edge distortions, and design a synthesis-based restoration module to restore occluded regions. The results of two branches are fused through a refining module to generate corrected GS images. We further propose datasets captured by a high-speed camera and an RS-Event hybrid camera system for training and testing our network. Experimental results on both public and proposed datasets show a systematic performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods."}}

The challenge for event signal processing is that they are asynchronously generated, and do not carry absolute intensity but only binary signs informing temporal variations. To study event signal formation and degradation, we implement a display-camera system which enables multi-resolution event recording. We further propose EventZoom, a deep neural framework with a backbone architecture of 3D U-Net. EventZoom is trained in a noise-to-noise fashion where the two ends of the network are unfiltered noisy events, enforcing noise-free event restoration. For resolution enhancement, EventZoom incorporates an event-to-image module supervised by high resolution images. Our results showed that EventZoom achieves at least 40x temporal efficiency compared to state-of-the-art event denoisers. Additionally, we demonstrate that EventZoom enables performance improvements on applications including event-based visual object tracking and image reconstruction. EventZoom achieves state-of-the-art super resolved image reconstruction results while being 10x faster."}}

Our system consists of a traditional video camera which captures high-resolution intensity images, and an event camera which encodes high-speed motion as a stream of asynchronous binary events. To process the hybrid input, we propose a unifying framework that first bridges the two sensing modalities via a noise-robust motion compensation model, and then performs joint image filtering. The filtered output represents the temporal gradient of the captured space-time volume, which can be viewed as motion-compensated event frames with high resolution and low noise. Therefore, the output can be widely applied to many existing event-based algorithms that are highly dependent on spatial resolution and noise robustness. In experimental results performed on both publicly available datasets as well as our contributing RGB-DAVIS dataset, we show systematic performance improvement in applications such as high frame-rate video synthesis, feature/corner detection and tracking, as well as high dynamic range image reconstruction."}}
