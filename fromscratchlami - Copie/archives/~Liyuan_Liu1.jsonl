It has been widely observed that a best-performing teacher does not necessarily yield the best-performing student, suggesting a fundamental discrepancy between the current practice in teacher training and the distillation objective. To fill this gap, we explore the feasibility of training a teacher that is oriented toward student performance with empirical risk minimization. Our analyses are inspired by the recent findings that the effectiveness of knowledge distillation hinges on the teacher\u2019s capability to approximate the true label distribution of training inputs. We theoretically established that (1) the empirical risk minimizer can provably approximate the true label distribution of training data if the loss function is a proper scoring rule and the hypothesis function is locally-Lipschitz continuous around training inputs; and (2) when data augmentation is employed for training, an additional constraint is required that the minimizer has to produce consistent predictions across augmented views of the same training input. In light of our theory, we propose a teacher training method SoTeacher which renovates the empirical risk minimization by incorporating Lipschitz regularization and consistency regularization. Experiments on two benchmark datasets confirm that SoTeacher can improve student performance significantly and consistently across various knowledge distillation algorithms and teacher-student pairs."}}

Recognizing label noise sheds insights on the prevalence of robust overfitting in adversarial training, and explains its intriguing dependence on perturbation radius and data quality. Also, our label noise perspective aligns well with our observations of the epoch-wise double descent in adversarial training. Guided by our analyses, we proposed a method to automatically calibrate the label to address the label noise and robust overfitting. Our method achieves consistent performance improvements across various models and datasets without introducing new hyper-parameters or additional tuning."}}

Inspired by our observations, we further advance the analyses of double descent to understand robust overfitting better. In standard training, double descent has been shown to be a result of label flipping noise. However, this reasoning is not applicable in our setting, since adversarial perturbations are believed not to change the label. Going beyond label flipping noise, we propose to measure the mismatch between the assigned and (unknown) true label distributions, denoted as \\emph{implicit label noise}. We show that the traditional labeling of adversarial examples inherited from their clean counterparts will lead to implicit label noise. Towards better labeling, we show that predicted distribution from a classifier, after scaling and interpolation, can provably reduce the implicit label noise under mild assumptions. In light of our analyses, we tailored the training objective accordingly to effectively mitigate the double descent and verified its effectiveness on three benchmark datasets.\n"}}

These problems pose great challenges to both reliable evaluation and practical deployment. Here, we empirically show that these problems share one common cause --- low-quality samples in the dataset. Specifically, we first propose a strategy to measure the data quality based on the learning behaviors of the data during adversarial training and find that low-quality data may not be useful and even detrimental to the adversarial robustness. We then design controlled experiments to investigate the interconnections between data quality and problems in adversarial training. We find that when low-quality data is removed, robust overfitting and robustness overestimation can be largely alleviated; and robustness-accuracy trade-off becomes less significant. These observations not only verify our intuition about data quality but may also open new opportunities to advance adversarial training. "}}

While this phenomenon is commonly explained as overfitting, we observe that it is a twin process: not only does the model catastrophic overfits to one type of perturbation, but also the perturbation deteriorates into random noise. For example, at the same epoch when the FGSM-trained model catastrophically overfits, its generated perturbations deteriorate into random noise. Intuitively, once the generated perturbations become weak and inadequate, models would be misguided to overfit those weak attacks and fail to defend strong ones. In the light of our analyses, we propose APART, an adaptive adversarial training method, which parameterizes perturbation generation and progressively strengthens them.  In our experiments, APART successfully prevents perturbation deterioration and catastrophic overfitting.  Also, APART significantly improves the model robustness while maintaining the same efficiency as FGSM-style methods, e.g., on the CIFAR-10 dataset, APART achieves 53.89%accuracy under the PGD-20 attack and 49.05% accuracy under the AutoAttack."}}

We provide both empirical and theoretical evidence to verify our hypothesis. We further propose Rectified Adam (RAdam), a novel variant of Adam, by introducing a term to rectify the variance of the adaptive learning rate. Experimental results on image classification, language modeling, and neural machine translation verify our intuition and demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of RAdam. "}}

However, the generated training data typically contain massive noise, and may result in poor performances with the vanilla supervised learning. In this paper, we propose to conduct multi-instance learning with a novel Cross-relation Cross-bag Selective Attention (C2SA), which leads to noise-robust training for distant supervised relation extractor. Specifically, we employ the sentence-level selective attention to reduce the effect of noisy or mismatched sentences, while the correlation among relations were captured to improve the quality of attention weights. Moreover, instead of treating all entity-pairs equally, we try to pay more attention to entity-pairs with a higher quality. Similarly, we adopt the selective attention mechanism to achieve this goal. Experiments with two types of relation extractor demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art, while further ablation studies verify our intuitions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed two techniques."}}

Recent advances in neural networks (NNs) make it possible to build reliable models without handcrafted features. However, in many cases, it is hard to obtain sufficient annotations to train these models. In this study, we develop a novel neural framework to extract abundant knowledge hidden in raw texts to empower the sequence labeling task. Besides word-level knowledge contained in pre-trained word embeddings, character-aware neural language models are incorporated to extract character-level knowledge. Transfer learning techniques are further adopted to mediate different components and guide the language model towards the key knowledge. Comparing to previous methods, these task-specific knowledge allows us to adopt a more concise model and conduct more efficient training. Different from most transfer learning methods, the proposed framework does not rely on any additional supervision. It extracts knowledge from self-contained order information of training sequences. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging character-level knowledge and the efficiency of co-training. For example, on the CoNLL03 NER task, model training completes in about 6 hours on a single GPU, reaching F1 score of 91.71\\pm$0.10 without using any extra annotation."}}

To fully leverage the nearly unlimited corpora and capture linguistic information of multifarious levels, large-size LMs are required; but for a specific task, only parts of these information are useful. Such large models, even in the inference stage, lead to overwhelming computation workloads, thus making them too time-consuming for real-world applications. For a specific task, we aim to keep useful information while compressing bulky PTLM. Since layers of different depths keep different information, we can conduct the compression via layer selection. By introducing the dense connectivity, we can detach any layers without eliminating others, and stretch shallow and wide LMs to be deep and narrow. Moreover, PTLM are trained with layer-wise dropouts for better robustness, and are pruned by a sparse regularization which is customized for our goal. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."}}

Here we propose two neural models to suit noisy distant supervision from the dictionary. First, under the traditional sequence labeling framework, we propose a revised fuzzy CRF layer to handle tokens with multiple possible labels. After identifying the nature of noisy labels in distant supervision, we go beyond the traditional framework and propose a novel, more effective neural model AutoNER with a new Tie or Break scheme. In addition, we discuss how to refine distant supervision for better NER performance. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AutoNER achieves the best performance when only using dictionaries with no additional human effort, and delivers competitive results with state-of-the-art supervised benchmarks."}}
