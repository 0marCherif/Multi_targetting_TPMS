Current deep learning based methods for sign language understanding (SLU) are prone to over-fitting due to insufficient sign data resource and suffer limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose the first self-supervised pre-trainable SignBERT+ framework with model-aware hand prior incorporated. In our framework, the hand pose is regarded as a visual token, which is derived from an off-the-shelf detector. Each visual token is embedded with gesture state and spatial-temporal position encoding. To take full advantage of current sign data resource, we first perform self-supervised learning to model its statistics. To this end, we design multi-level masked modeling strategies (joint, frame and clip) to mimic common failure detection cases. Jointly with these masked modeling strategies, we incorporate model-aware hand prior to better capture hierarchical context over the sequence. After the pre-training, we carefully design simple yet effective prediction heads for downstream tasks. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we perform extensive experiments on three main SLU tasks, involving isolated and continuous sign language recognition (SLR), and sign language translation (SLT). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving new state-of-the-art performance with a notable gain."}}

This task is challenging and research-worthy in many potential application scenarios, such as AR/VR games and online shopping, etc. To address this problem, we propose a novel HOGAN framework, which utilizes the expressive model-aware hand-object representation and leverages its inherent topology to build the unified surface space. In this space, we explicitly consider the complex self- and mutual occlusion during interaction. During final image synthesis, we consider different characteristics of hand and object and generate the target image in a split-and-combine manner. For evaluation, we build a comprehensive protocol to access both the fidelity and structure preservation of the generated image. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, i.e., HO3Dv3 and DexYCB, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework both quantitatively and qualitatively. The code will be available at https://github.com/play-with-HOI-generation/HOIG."}}

Current deep-learning based video sign language recognition (SLR) methods usually follow a data-driven paradigm under the supervision of the category label. However, those methods suffer limited interpretability and may encounter the overfitting issue due to limited sign data sources. In this paper, we introduce the hand prior and propose a new hand-model-aware framework for isolated SLR with the modeling hand as the intermediate representation. We first transform the cropped hand sequence into the latent semantic feature. Then the hand model introduces the hand prior and provides a mapping from the semantic feature to the compact hand pose representation. Finally, the inference module enhances the spatio-temporal pose representation and performs the final recognition. Due to the lack of annotation on the hand pose under current sign language datasets, we further guide its learning by utilizing multiple weakly-supervised losses to constrain its spatial and temporal consistency. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we perform extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, including NMFs-CSL, SLR500, MSASL and WLASL.

This task involves fine-grained structure understanding of the mapping between the source and target gestures. Current works follow a data-driven paradigm based on sparse 2D joint representation. However, given the insufficient representation capability of 2D joints, this paradigm easily leads to blurry generation results with incorrect structure. In this paper, we propose a novel model-aware gesture-to-gesture translation framework, which introduces hand prior with hand meshes as the intermediate representation. To take full advantage of the structured hand model, we first build a dense topology map aligning the image plane with the encoded embedding of the visible hand mesh. Then, a transformation flow is calculated based on the correspondence of the source and target topology map. During the generation stage, we inject the topology information into generation streams by modulating the activations in a spatially-adaptive manner. Further, we incorporate the source local characteristic to enhance the translated gesture image according to the transformation flow. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance."}}

Although manual features are dominant, non-manual features also play an important role in the expression of a sign word. Specifically, many sign words convey different meanings due to non-manual features, even though they share the same hand gestures. This ambiguity introduces great challenges in the recognition of sign words. To tackle the above issue, we propose a simple yet effective architecture called Global-Local Enhancement Network\u00a0(GLE-Net), including two mutually promoted streams toward different crucial aspects of SLR. Of the two streams, one captures the global contextual relationship, while the other stream captures the discriminative fine-grained cues. Moreover, due to the lack of datasets explicitly focusing on this kind of feature, we introduce the first non-manual-feature-aware isolated Chinese sign language dataset\u00a0(NMFs-CSL) with a total vocabulary size of 1,067 sign words in daily life.

Since it is not differentiable, we usually instead optimize the learning model with the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) objective loss, which maximizes the posterior probability over the sequential alignment. Due to the optimization gap, the predicted sentence with the highest decoding probability may not be the best choice under the WER metric. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel architecture with cross modality augmentation. Specifically, we first augment cross-modal data by simulating the calculation procedure of WER, i.e., substitution, deletion and insertion on both text label and its corresponding video. With these real and generated pseudo video-text pairs, we propose multiple loss terms to minimize the cross modality distance between the video and ground truth label, and make the network distinguish the difference between real and pseudo modalities. The proposed framework can be easily extended to other existing CTC based continuous SLR architectures. Extensive experiments on two continuous SLR benchmarks, i.e., RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather and CSL, validate the effectiveness of our proposed method."}}
