We propose a new semi-supervised learning method, Semantic Positives via Pseudo-Labels (SEMPPL), that combines labelled and unlabelled data to learn informative representations. Our method extends self-supervised contrastive learning\u2014where representations are shaped by distinguishing whether two samples represent the same underlying datum (positives) or not (negatives)\u2014with a novel approach to selecting  positives. To enrich the set of positives, we leverage the few existing ground-truth labels to predict the missing  ones through a k-nearest neighbors classifier by using the learned embeddings of the labelled data. We thus extend the set of positives with datapoints having the same pseudo-label and call these semantic positives. We jointly learn the representation and predict bootstrapped pseudo-labels. This creates a reinforcing cycle. Strong initial representations enable better pseudo-label predictions which then improve the selection of semantic positives and lead to even better representations. SEMPPL outperforms competing semi-supervised methods setting new state-of-the-art performance of 76% and 68.5% top-1accuracy when using a ResNet-50 and training on 10% and 1% of labels on ImageNet, respectively. Furthermore, when using selective kernels, SEMPPL significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art achieving 72.3% and 78.3% top-1accuracy on ImageNet with 1% and 10% labels, respectively, which improves absolute +7.8% and +6.2% over previous work. SEMPPL also exhibits state-of-the-art performance over larger ResNet models as well as strong robustness, out-of-distribution and transfer performance. We release the checkpoints and the evaluation code at https://github.com/deepmind/semppl."}}

In these games, two agents must agree on a communication protocol in order to solve a cooperative task. Previous work has shown that agents trained to play this game with reinforcement learning tend to develop languages that display undesirable properties from a linguistic point of view (lack of generalization, lack of compositionality, etc). In this paper, we aim to provide better understanding of this phenomenon by analytically studying the learning problem in Lewis games. As a core contribution, we demonstrate that the standard objective in Lewis games can be decomposed in two components: a co-adaptation loss and an information loss. This decomposition enables us to surface two potential sources of overfitting, which we show may undermine the emergence of a structured communication protocol. In particular, when we control for overfitting on the co-adaptation loss, we recover desired properties in the emergent languages: they are more compositional and  generalize better."}}

The tasks are not temporally interactive and lack time pressures typically present in natural communication and language learning. In these settings, agents can successfully learn to communicate, but they do not learn to exchange information concisely\u2014they tend towards over-communication and an anti-efficient encoding. In our work, we introduce situated communication by imposing an opportunity cost on communication\u2014the acting agent has to forgo an action to solicit information from its advisor. Situated communication mimics the external pressure of passing time in real-world communication. We compare language emergence under this pressure against language learning with an internal cost on articulation, implemented as a per-message penalty. We find that while both pressures can disincentivise over-communication, situated communication does it more effectively and, unlike the internal pressure, does not negatively impact communication emergence. Implementing an opportunity cost on communication might be key to shaping language properties and incentivising concise information sharing between artificial agents."}}

BYOL relies on two neural networks, referred to as online and target networks, that interact and learn from each other. From an augmented view of an image, we train the online network to predict the target network representation of the same image under a different augmented view. At the same time, we update the target network with a slow-moving average of the online network. While state-of-the art methods intrinsically rely on negative pairs, BYOL achieves a new state of the art without them. BYOL reaches 74.3% top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet using the standard linear evaluation protocol with a ResNet-50 architecture and 79.6% with a larger ResNet. We show that BYOL performs on par or better than the current state of the art on both transfer and semi-supervised benchmarks. "}}

Sometimes these problems involve multiple, distinct modalities of information\u2009\u2014\u2009vision, language, audio, etc.\u2009\u2014\u2009as is required to understand a scene in a movie or answer a question about an image. Other times, these problems involve multiple sources of the same kind of input, i.e. when summarizing several documents or drawing one image in the style of another. When approaching such problems, it often makes sense to process one source of information in the context of another; for instance, in the right example above, one can extract meaning from the image in the context of the question. In machine learning, we often refer to this context-based processing as conditioning: the computation carried out by a model is conditioned or modulated by information extracted from an auxiliary input.\n\nFinding an effective way to condition on or fuse sources of information is an open research problem, and in this article, we concentrate on a specific family of approaches we call feature-wise transformations. We will examine the use of feature-wise transformations in many neural network architectures to solve a surprisingly large and diverse set of problems; their success, we will argue, is due to being flexible enough to learn an effective representation of the conditioning input in varied settings. In the language of multi-task learning, where the conditioning signal is taken to be a task description, feature-wise transformations learn a task representation which allows them to capture and leverage the relationship between multiple sources of information, even in remarkably different problem settings."}}

These properties make it a natural fit to guide the training of interactive agents as it could ease recurrent challenges in Reinforcement Learning such as sample complexity, generalization, or multi-tasking. Yet, it remains an open-problem to relate language and RL in even simple instruction following scenarios. Current methods rely on expert demonstrations, auxiliary losses, or inductive biases in neural architectures. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal approach called Textual Hindsight Experience Replay (THER) that extends the Hindsight Experience Replay approach to the language setting. Whenever the agent does not fulfill its instruction, THER learn to output a new directive that matches the agent trajectory, and it relabels the episode with a positive reward. To do so, THER learns to map a state into an instruction by using past successful trajectories, which removes the need to have external expert interventions to relabel episodes as in vanilla HER. We observe that this simple idea also initiates a learning synergy between language acquisition and policy learning on instruction following tasks in the BabyAI environment. "}}
