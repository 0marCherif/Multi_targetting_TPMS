Previous works showed that handcrafted action abstractions allow planning systems to focus their search on a subset of promising actions. In this paper we show that the problem of generating action abstractions can be cast as a problem of selecting a subset of pure strategies from a pool of options. We model the selection of a subset of pure strategies as a two-player game in which the strategy set of the players is the powerset of the pool of options\u2014 we call this game the subset selection game. We then present an evolutionary algorithm for solving such a game. Empirical results on small matches of \u00b5RTS show that our evolutionary approach is able to converge to a Nash equilibrium for the subset selection game. Also, results on larger matches show that search algorithms using action abstractions derived by our evolutionary approach are able to substantially outperform all state-of-the-art planning systems tested."}}

Although accuracy is known to be important, little is known about the role of the system\u2019s error distribution in user experience. In this paper we study, in the context of background music selection for tabletop games, how the error distribution of an intelligent system affects the user\u2019s perceived experience. In particular, we show that supervised learning algorithms that solely optimize for prediction accuracy can make the system \u201cindecisive\u201d. That is, it can make the system\u2019s errors sparsely distributed throughout the game session. We hypothesize that sparsely distributed errors can harm the users\u2019 perceived experience and it is preferable to use a model that is somewhat inaccurate but decisive, than a model that is accurate but often indecisive. In order to test our hypothesis we introduce an ensemble approach with a restrictive voting rule that instead of erring sparsely through time, it errs consistently for a period of time. A user study in which people watched videos of Dungeons and Dragons sessions supports our hypothesis."}}

Optimal strategies derived from un-abstracted spaces are guaranteed to be no worse than optimal strategies derived from action-abstracted spaces. In practice, however, due to real-time constraints and the state space size, one is only able to derive good strategies in un-abstracted spaces in small-scale games. In this paper we introduce search algorithms that use an action abstraction scheme we call asymmetric abstraction. Asymmetric abstractions retain the un-abstracted spaces' theoretical advantage over regularly abstracted spaces while still allowing the search algorithms to derive effective strategies, even in large-scale games. Empirical results on combat scenarios that arise in a real-time strategy game show that our search algorithms are able to substantially outperform state-of-the-art approaches."}}

The first algorithm is a best-first enumeration that uses a cost function that allows us to provide an upper bound on the number of nodes to be expanded before reaching a goal state. We show that this best-first algorithm is particularly well suited for ``needle-in-a-haystack'' problems. The second algorithm, which is based on sampling, provides an upper bound on the expected number of nodes to be expanded before reaching a set of goal states. We show that this algorithm is better suited for problems where many paths lead to a goal. We validate these tree search algorithms on 1,000 computer-generated levels of Sokoban, where the policy used to guide search comes from a neural network trained using A3C. Our results show that the policy tree search algorithms we introduce are competitive with a state-of-the-art domain-independent planner that uses heuristic search."}}

At a given iteration, our method uses estimates of the A* running time to create a PDB that complements the strengths of the PDBs created in previous iterations. We evaluate our algorithm using explicit and symbolic PDBs. Our results show that the heuristics produced by our approach are able to outperform existing schemes, and that our method is able to create PDBs that complement the strengths of other existing heuristics such as a symbolic perimeter heuristic."}}

SSS uses a type system to partition the player's units into types and assumes that units of the same type must follow the same strategy. SSS searches in the state space induced by the type system to select, from a pool of options, a strategy for each unit. Empirical results on a simulator of an RTS game shows that SSS employing either fixed or adaptive type systems is able to substantially outperform state-of-the-art search-based algorithms in combat scenarios with up to 100 units."}}

There is now a growing and active community devoted to the empirical and theoretical study of heuristic search algorithms, thanks to the successful application of search-based algorithms to areas such as robotics, domain-independent planning, optimization, and computer games. In this extended abstract we highlight recent efforts in understanding suboptimal search algorithms, as well as ensembles of heuristics and algorithms. The result of these efforts are meta-reasoning methods which are applied to orchestrate the different components of modern search algorithms. Finally, we mention recent innovative applications of search that demonstrate the relevance of the field to general AI."}}

Independent of that, Chen developed a method (SS) that can also be used to predict the number of nodes expanded by IDA*. In this paper we advance these prediction methods. First, we develop a variant of CDP that can be orders of magnitude faster than CDP while producing exactly the same predictions. Second, we show how ideas developed in the KRE line of research can be used to substantially improve the predictions produced by SS. Third, we make an empirical comparison between our new enhanced versions of CDP and SS. Our experimental results point out that CDP is suitable for applications that require less accurate but very fast predictions, while SS is suitable for applications that require more accurate predictions but allow more computation time."}}
