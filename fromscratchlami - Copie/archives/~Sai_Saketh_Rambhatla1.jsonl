Contemporary methods focus on proxies for missing ground-truth annotations either in the form of pseudo-labels or by re-weighing gradients for unlabeled boxes during training. In this work, we revisit the formulation of sparsely annotated object detection. We observe that sparsely annotated object detection can be considered a semi-supervised object detection problem at a region level. Building on this insight, we propose a region-based semi-supervised algorithm, that automatically identifies regions containing unlabeled foreground objects. Our algorithm then processes the labeled and un-labeled foreground regions differently, a common practice in semi-supervised methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct exhaustive experiments on five splits commonly used by sparsely annotated approaches on the PASCAL-VOC and COCO datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance. In addition to this, we show that our approach achieves competitive performance on standard semi-supervised setups demonstrating the strength and broad applicability of our approach."}}

We propose a computational framework that uses only two object states, start and end, and learns to recognize the under-lying actions.  Our approach has two modules that learn subtle changes induced by the action and suppress spurious correlations.  We demonstrate that only two object states are sufficient to recognize object-centric actions. Our framework per-forms better than approaches that use multiple frames and a relatively large model.Moreover, our method generalizes to unseen objects and unseen video datasets"}}

Existing works have shown to attribute images to their corresponding GAN sources with high accuracy. However, these works are limited to a closed set scenario, failing to generalize to GANs unseen during train time and are therefore, not scalable with a steady influx of new GANs. We present an iterative algorithm for discovering images generated from previously unseen GANs by exploiting the fact that all GANs leave distinct fingerprints on their generated images. Our algorithm consists of multiple components including network training, out-of-distribution detection, clustering, merge and refine steps. Through extensive experiments, we show that our algorithm discovers unseen GANs with high accuracy and also generalizes to GANs trained on unseen real datasets. We additionally apply our algorithm to attribution and discovery of GANs in an online fashion as well as to the more standard task of real/fake detection. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to discover new GANs and can be used in an open-world setup."}}

The proposed model is simple and efficiently uses the data, visual features of the human, relative spatial orientation of the human and the object, and the knowledge that functionally similar objects take part in similar interactions with humans. We provide extensive experimental validation for our approach and demonstrate state-of-the-art results for HOI detection. On the HICO-Det dataset our method achieves a gain of over 2.5% absolute points in mean average precision (mAP) over state-of-the-art. We also show that our approach leads to significant performance gains for zero-shot HOI detection in the seen object setting. We further demonstrate that using a generic object detector, our model can generalize to interactions involving previously unseen objects. "}}
