One such change is the pace with which new words enter the mass vocabulary and the frequency at which meanings, perceptions, and interpretations of existing expressions change. The current state-of-the-art algorithms do not allow for an intuitive and rigorous detection of these changes in word meanings over time. We propose a dynamic graph-theoretic approach to inferring the semantics of words and phrases (\u201cterms\u201d) and detecting temporal shifts. Our approach represents each term as a stochastic time-evolving set of contextual words and is a count-based distributional semantic model in nature. We use local clustering techniques to assess the structural changes in a given word\u2019s contextual words. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by investigating the changes in the semantics of the phrase \u201cChinavirus\u201d. We conclude that the term took on a much more pejorative meaning when the White House used the term in the second half of March 2020, although the effect appears to have been temporary. We make both the dataset and the code used to generate this paper\u2019s results available."}}

In this research, we developed a flexible class of phenomenological spatio-temporal models that extend a modeling framework used in plant pathology applications to account for the presence of multiple sources and anisotropy of biological species that can govern disease gradients and spatial spread in time. We use the cucurbit downy mildew pathosystem (caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis) to formulate a data-driven procedure based on the 2008 to 2010 historical occurrence of the disease in the U.S. available from standardized sentinel plots deployed as part of the Cucurbit Downy Mildew ipmPIPE program. This pathosystem is characterized by annual recolonization and extinction cycles, generating annual disease invasions at the continental scale. This data-driven procedure is amenable to fitting models of disease spread from one or multiple sources of primary inoculum and can be specified to provide estimates of the parameters by regression methods conditional on a function that can accommodate anisotropy in disease occurrence data. Applying this modeling framework to the cucurbit downy mildew data sets, we found a small but consistent reduction in temporal prediction errors by incorporating anisotropy in disease spread. Further, we did not find evidence of an annually occu..."}}

Among various approaches that have been proposed to estimate $K$, the non-parametric methods based on the spectral properties of the Bethe Hessian matrices have garnered much popularity for their simplicity, computational efficiency, and robust performance irrespective of the sparsity of the input data. Recently, one such method has been shown to estimate $K$ consistently if the input network is generated from the (semi-dense) stochastic block model, when the average of the expected degrees ($\\tilde{d}$) of all the nodes in the network satisfies $\\tilde{d} \\gg \\log(N)$  ($N$ being the number of nodes in the network). In this paper, we prove some finite sample results that hold for $\\tilde{d} = o(\\log(N))$, which in turn show that the estimation of $K$ based on the spectra of the Bethe Hessian matrices is consistent not only for the semi-dense regime, but also for the sub-logarithmic sparse regime when $1 \\ll \\tilde{d} \\ll \\log(N)$. Thus, our estimation procedure is a robust method for a wide range of problem settings, regardless of the sparsity of the network input."}}

In the high-dimensional setting, which is increasingly common in fields such as neuroscience and econometrics, model parameters are inferred by $L_1$-regularized maximum likelihood (RML). A well-known feature of RML inference is that in general the technique produces a trade-off between sparsity and bias that depends on the choice of the regularization hyperparameter. In the context of multivariate time series analysis, sparse estimates are favorable for causal discovery and low-bias estimates are favorable for forecasting. However, owing to a paucity of research on hyperparameter selection methods, practitioners must rely on \\textit{ad-hoc} methods such as cross-validation (or manual tuning). The particular balance that such approaches achieve between the two goals --- causal discovery and forecasting --- is poorly understood. Our paper investigates this behavior and proposes a method ($UoI_{VAR}$) that achieves a better balance between sparsity and bias when the underlying causal influences are in fact sparse. We demonstrate through simulation that RML with a hyperparameter selected by cross-validation tends to overfit, producing relatively dense estimates. We further demonstrate that $UoI_{VAR}$ much more effectively approximates the correct sparsity pattern with only a minor compromise in model fit, particularly so for larger data dimensions, and that the estimates produced by $UoI_{VAR}$ exhibit less bias. We conclude that our method achieves improved performance especially well-suited to applications involving simultaneous causal discovery and forecasting in high-dimensional settings."}}

We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and finite sample estimates evaluating the performance of the proposed methods when the input (finite sequence of networks) is generated from an inhomogeneous random graph model, where the change points are characterized by the change in the mean adjacency matrix. We show that the proposed algorithms can detect (resp. localize) all change points, where the change in the expected adjacency matrix is above the minimax detectability (resp. localizability) threshold, consistently without any a priori assumption about (a) a lower bound for the sparsity of the underlying networks, (b) an upper bound for the number of change points, and (c) a lower bound for the separation between successive change points, provided either the minimum separation between successive pairs of change points or the average degree of the underlying networks goes to infinity arbitrarily slowly.

Vector autoregressive (VAR) models are well suited for inferring Granger-causal networks from high dimensional time series data sets, but accurate inference at scale remains a central challenge. We have recently introduced a flexible and scalable statistical machine learning framework, Union of Intersections (UoI), which enables low false-positive and low false-negative feature selection along with low bias and low variance estimation, enhancing interpretation and predictive accuracy. In this paper, we scale the UoI framework for VAR models (algorithm UoI <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V AR</inf> ) to infer network connectivity from large time series data sets (TBs). To achieve this, we optimize distributed convex optimization and introduce novel strategies for improved data read and data distribution times. We study the strong and weak scaling of the algorithm on a Xeon-phi based supercomputer (100,000 cores). These advances enable us to estimate the largest VAR model as known (1000 nodes, corresponding to 1M parameters) and apply it to large time series data from neurophysiology (192 neurons) and finance (470 companies)."}}

Functional networks, after downstream analysis, can provide key insights into the nature of neurobiological structure and computation.

To address these issues, we developed Union of Intersections (UoI), a flexible, modular, and scalable framework for enhanced statistical feature selection and estimation. Methods based on UoI perform feature selection and feature estimation through intersection and union operations, respectively.
