However, these data biases frequently do not become apparent until after the models are deployed. Our work tackles this issue and enables the preemptive analysis of large-scale datasets. REvealing VIsual biaSEs (REVISE) is a tool that assists in the investigation of a visual dataset, surfacing potential biases along three dimensions: (1) object-based, (2) person-based, and (3) geography-based. Object-based biases relate to the size, context, or diversity of the depicted objects. Person-based metrics focus on analyzing the portrayal of people within the dataset. Geography-based analyses consider the representation of different geographic locations. These three dimensions are deeply intertwined in how they interact to bias a dataset, and REVISE sheds light on this; the responsibility then lies with the user to consider the cultural and historical context, and to determine which of the revealed biases may be problematic. The tool further assists the user by suggesting actionable steps that may be taken to mitigate the revealed biases. Overall, the key aim of our work is to tackle the machine learning bias problem early in the pipeline. REVISE is available at https://github.com/princetonvisualai/revise-tool ."}}

Our goal was not to audit this image captioning system, but rather to develop normatively grounded measurement techniques, in turn providing an opportunity to reflect on the many challenges involved. We propose multiple measurement techniques for each type of harm. We argue that by doing so, we are better able to capture the multi-faceted nature of each type of harm, in turn improving the (collective) validity of the resulting measurements. Throughout, we discuss the assumptions underlying our measurement approach and point out when they do not hold."}}

In this work, we grapple with questions that arise along three stages of the machine learning pipeline when incorporating intersectionality as multiple demographic attributes: (1) which demographic attributes to include as dataset labels, (2) how to handle the progressively smaller size of subgroups during model training, and (3) how to move beyond existing evaluation metrics when benchmarking model fairness for more subgroups. For each question, we provide thorough empirical evaluation on tabular datasets derived from the US Census, and present constructive recommendations for the machine learning community. First, we advocate for supplementing domain knowledge with empirical validation when choosing which demographic attribute labels to train on, while always evaluating on the full set of demographic attributes. Second, we warn against using data imbalance techniques without considering their normative implications and suggest an alternative using the structure in the data. Third, we introduce new evaluation metrics which are more appropriate for the intersectional setting. Overall, we provide substantive suggestions on three necessary (albeit not sufficient!) considerations when incorporating intersectionality into machine learning."}}

However, as in many machine learning settings, social biases can influence image captioning in undesirable ways. In this work, we study bias propagation pathways within image captioning, focusing specifically on the COCO dataset. Prior work has analyzed gender bias in captions using automatically-derived gender labels; here we examine racial and intersectional biases using manual annotations. Our first contribution is in annotating the perceived gender and skin color of 28,315 of the depicted people after obtaining IRB approval. Using these annotations, we compare racial biases present in both manual and automatically-generated image captions. We demonstrate differences in caption performance, sentiment, and word choice between images of lighter versus darker-skinned people. Further, we find the magnitude of these differences to be greater in modern captioning systems compared to older ones, thus leading to concerns that without proper consideration and mitigation these differences will only become increasingly prevalent.

In this work, we focus on the issue of bias amplification: the tendency of models trained from data containing social biases to further amplify these biases. This problem is brought about by the algorithm, on top of the level of bias already present in the data. We make two main contributions regarding its measurement. First, building off of Zhao et al. (2017), we introduce and analyze a new, decoupled metric for measuring bias amplification, $\\text{BiasAmp}_{\\rightarrow}, which possesses a number of attractive properties, including the ability to pinpoint the cause of bias amplification. Second, we thoroughly analyze and discuss the normative implications of this metric. We provide suggestions about its measurement by cautioning against predicting sensitive attributes, encouraging the use of confidence intervals due to fluctuations in the fairness of models across runs, and discussing what bias amplification means in the context of domains where labels either don't exist at test time or correspond to uncertain future events. Throughout this paper, we work to provide a deeply interrogative look at the technical measurement of bias amplification, guided by our normative ideas of what we want it to encompass."}}
