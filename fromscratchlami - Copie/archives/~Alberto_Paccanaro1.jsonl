However, newly sequenced organisms continue to represent a difficult challenge, because only their protein sequences are available and they lack data derived from large-scale experiments. Here we introduce S2F (Sequence to Function), a network propagation approach for the functional annotation of newly sequenced organisms. Our main idea is to systematically transfer functionally relevant data from model organisms to newly sequenced ones, thus allowing us to use a label propagation approach. S2F introduces a novel label diffusion algorithm that can account for the presence of overlapping communities of proteins with related functions. As most newly sequenced organisms are bacteria, we tested our approach in the context of bacterial genomes. Our extensive evaluation shows a great improvement over existing sequence-based methods, as well as four state-of-the-art general-purpose protein function prediction methods. Our work demonstrates that employing a diffusion process over networks of transferred functional data is an effective way to improve predictions over simple homology. S2F is applicable to any type of newly sequenced organism as well as to those for which experimental evidence is available. A free, easy to run version of S2F is available at https://www.paccanarolab.org/s2f."}}

Results of a typical Hi-C experiment are often summarized in a chromosomal contact map, a matrix whose elements reflect the co-location frequencies of genomic loci. To elucidate the complex structural and functional interactions between those genomic loci, networks offer a natural and powerful framework. Results We propose a novel graph-theoretical framework, the Corrected Gene Proximity (CGP) map to study the effect of the 3D spatial organization of genes in transcriptional regulation. The starting point of the CGP map is a weighted network, the gene proximity map, whose weights are based on the contact frequencies between genes extracted from genome-wide Hi-C data. We derive a null model for the network based on the signal contributed by the 1D genomic distance and use it to \u201ccorrect\u201d the gene proximity for cell type 3D specific arrangements. The CGP map, therefore, provides a network framework for the 3D structure of the genome on a global scale. On human cell lines, we show that the CGP map can detect and quantify gene co-regulation and co-localization more effectively than the map obtained by raw contact frequencies. Analyzing the expression pattern of metabolic pathways of two hematopoietic cell lines, we find that the relative positioning of the genes, as captured and quantified by the CGP, is highly correlated with their expression change. We further show that the CGP map can be used to form an inter-chromosomal proximity map that allows large-scale abnormalities, such as chromosomal translocations, to be identified. Conclusions The Corrected Gene Proximity map is a map of the 3D structure of the genome on a global scale. It allows the simultaneous analysis of intra- and inter- chromosomal interactions and of gene co-regulation and co-localization more effectively than the map obtained by raw contact frequencies, thus revealing hidden associations between global spatial positioning and gene expression. The flexible graph-based formalism of the CGP map can be easily generalized to study any existing Hi-C datasets."}}

Disease gene prediction methods streamline the discovery of the molecular basis for a disease by prioritizing genes for experimental validation. Although some methods use disease phenotype to aid the prioritization, the great majority use outdated static matrices which limits their disease coverage. Our approach uses an updatable disease phenotype similarity, and employs a non-linear transformation to define a prior probability distribution over the genes that mimics the distribution of disease genes in the interactome. Subsequently, a semi-supervised learning method establishes a prioritization ordering for all genes in the interactome, even for diseases with no known molecular basis. Our method can be used not only to obtain a better prioritization for disease-gene associations, but also for retrieving disease modules."}}
