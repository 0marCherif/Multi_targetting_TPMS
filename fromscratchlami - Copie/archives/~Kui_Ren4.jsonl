However, it is challenging to (1)~stay robust towards real-world scenarios and (2)~provide interpretable explanations for experts to analyse. In this paper, we propose \\textsc{MsDroid}, an An\\underline{droid} malware detection system that makes decisions by identifying \\underline{m}alicious \\underline{s}nippets with interpretable explanations. We mimic a common practice of security analysts, i.e., filtering APIs before looking through each method, to focus on local snippets around sensitive APIs instead of the whole program. Each snippet is represented with a graph encoding both code attributes and domain knowledge and then classified by Graph Neural Network (GNN). The local perspective helps the GNN classifier to concentrate on code highly correlated with malicious behaviors, and the information contained in graphs benefit in better understanding of the behaviors. Hence, \\textsc{MsDroid} is more robust and interpretable in nature. To identify malicious snippets, we present a semi-supervised learning approach that only requires app labeling. The key insight is that malicious snippets only exist in malwares and appear at least once in a malware. To make malicious snippets less opaque, we design an explanation mechanism to show the importance of control flows and to retrieve similarly implemented snippets from known malwares. A comprehensive comparison with 5 baseline methods is conducted on a dataset of more than 81K apps in 3 real-world scenarios, including \\textit{zero-day}, \\textit{evolution}, and \\textit{obfuscation}. The experimental results show that \\textsc{MsDroid} is more robust than state-of-the-art systems in all cases, with 5.37\\% to 49.52\\% advantage in F1-score. Besides, we demonstrate that the provided explanations are effective and illustrate how the explanations facilitate malware analysis."}}

Existing benchmarks often use non-compositional simple questions and suffer from language biases, making it difficult to diagnose model weaknesses incisively. A recent benchmark AGQA [8] poses a promising paradigm to generate QA pairs automatically\nfrom pre-annotated scene graphs, enabling it to measure diverse reasoning abilities with granular control. However, its questions have limitations in reasoning about the fine-grained semantics in videos as such information is absent in its scene graphs. To this end, we present ANetQA, a large-scale benchmark that supports fine-grained compositional reasoning over the challenging untrimmed videos from ActivityNet [4]. Similar to AGQA, the QA pairs in ANetQA are automatically generated from annotated video scene graphs. The fine-grained properties of ANetQA are reflected in the following: (i) untrimmed videos with fine-grained semantics; (ii) spatio-temporal scene graphs with fine-grained taxonomies; and (iii) diverse questions generated from fine-grained templates. ANetQA attains 1.4 billion unbalanced and 13.4 million balanced QA pairs, which is an order of magnitude larger than AGQA with a similar number of videos. Comprehensive experiments are performed for state-of-the-art methods. The best model achieves 44.5% accuracy while human performance tops out at 84.5%, leaving sufficient room for improvement."}}

When the blockchain technology is applied to decentralize traditional applications, blockchain validators may need to take in sensitive  <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">off-chain</i>  data to execute a smart contract. On the one hand, decentralized applications (DApps) require authentic off-chain input data to correctly execute a given business procedure. On the other hand, users are reluctant to expose their sensitive privacy on the blockchain. For example, for a decentralized medical insurance DApp that takes as input personal health data, it is critical to guarantee authenticity and privacy of the data sent to the smart contract, such that the data can be verified by validators without leaking sensitive information. However, no satisfactory solution has been proposed to attain privacy and authenticity at the same time. In this work, we first present a highly efficient authenticated zero knowledge proof protocol called zk-DASNARK by extending the classical zk-SNARK scheme with data authentication. Based on zk-DASNARK, we design zk-AuthFeed, a zero-knowledge authenticated off-chain data feed scheme to achieve both data privacy and authenticity for blockchain-based DApps. Following the strategy of \u201ccompute off-chain and verify on-chain\u201d, zk-AuthFeed can significantly reduce computation cost of blockchain validators. We fully implement a prototype of zk-AuthFeed, and conduct comprehensive experiments on a medical insurance DApp. We consider 4 typical computation models for insurance premium/reimbursement in the experiments. It shows that zk-AuthFeed is highly efficient: key generation takes about 10 seconds only, proof generation takes less than 4 seconds, and proof verification takes less than 40 ms."}}

Meanwhile, there is a pressing need to perform security assessments for these devices. Due to different types of peripherals, emulating the software, i.e., firmware, of these devices in scale is challenging. Therefore, static analysis is still widely used. Existing works usually leverage off-the-shelf tools to disassemble stripped ARM binaries and (implicitly) assume that reliably disassembling binaries is a solved problem. However, whether this assumption really holds is unknown. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on ARM disassembly tools. Specifically, we build 1,896 ARM binaries (including 248 obfuscated ones) with different compilers, compiling options, and obfuscation methods. We then evaluate them using eight state-of-the-art ARM disassembly tools (including both commercial and noncommercial ones) in three different versions on their capabilities to locate instruction boundary, function boundary, and function signature. Instruction and function boundary are two fundamental primitives that the other primitives are built upon while function signature is significant for control flow integrity (CFI) techniques. Our work reveals some observations that have not been systematically summarized and/or confirmed. For instance, we find that the existence of both ARM and Thumb instruction sets, and the reuse of the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BL</i> instruction for both function calls and branches bring serious challenges to disassembly tools. Our evaluation sheds light on the limitations of state-of-the-art disassembly tools and points out potential directions for improvement."}}

Most existing countermeasures either inject probe packets to infer forwarding correctness or collect packet traces to detect forwarding anomalies. They, however, cannot detect or filter forwarding anomalies for production packets in real time. In this paper, we propose RuleOut as the first attempt to automatically throttle SDN forwarding anomalies. It disambiguates dependent rules via augmenting their matching fields with unique tags. Leveraging source routing, we further bind each packet with the tag sequence corresponding to rules the packet should match. RuleOut thus renders each packet to match at most one rule on each switch. This completely addresses the root cause of forwarding ambiguity. To implement RuleOut, we develop a non-overlapping rule dependency graph, a series of algorithms for incremental rule update and tag generation upon it, and various optimization techniques toward scalability and efficiency. We prototype RuleOut on the Ryu controller and Open vSwitch and evaluate its performance over public rule sets such as Stanford, Internet2, and Airtel1. RuleOut can use tags of only several bits long to disambiguate thousands to millions of rules and generate tags fairly fast within a few milliseconds."}}

It secures packet forwarding by enabling end hosts to negotiate specific forwarding paths and enforcing on-path routers to prove their forwarding behaviors along these paths. Most existing path validation solutions target static paths, paying less attention to fully dynamic paths that support flexible routing. In this paper, we present Hummingbird as the first validation solution over fully dynamic paths. It features a hidden equal-probability sampling technique. Gaining efficiency via routers probabilistically sampling packets to validate, we craft the sampling probability such that each router validates a similar amount of packets given an unknown path length. We further hide the state of whether a packet has been sampled and validated using a lightweight, non-cryptographic scheme. This prevents attackers from differentiating and selectively mis-forwarding packets. We validate security and efficiency of Hummingbird through both theoretical proof and experimental evaluation."}}

A prime threat in training phase is called poisoning attack, where adversaries strive to subvert the behavior of machine learning systems by poisoning training data or other means of interference. Although a growing number of relevant studies have been proposed, the research among poisoning attack is still overly scattered, with each paper focusing on a particular task in a specific domain. In this survey, we summarize and categorize existing attack methods and corresponding defenses, as well as demonstrate compelling application scenarios, thus providing a unified framework to analyze poisoning attacks. Besides, we also discuss the main limitations of current works, along with the corresponding future directions to facilitate further researches. Our ultimate motivation is to provide a comprehensive and self-contained survey of this growing field of research and lay the foundation for a more standardized approach to reproducible studies."}}
