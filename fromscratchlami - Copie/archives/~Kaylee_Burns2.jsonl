We find that a Vision Transformer trained with a distillation loss that biases representations towards shape exhibits strong zero-shot transfer performance on the kitchen shift suite, even when compared to baselines trained on larger and more task-relevant datasets. When finetuned, the attention heads of a transformer trained with a shape bias can be visualized as a spatial feature map, which emergently segments manipulation-relevant objects in an image. By leveraging each of these insights, we are able to improve the average zero-shot performance of policies trained on the sliding door task within the FrankaKitchen environment by nearly 2x compared to the next best method. Additionally, we are able to improve maximum success in distribution by 13\\% by masking out attention heads that attend to distractors."}}

Leveraging language interactions effectively requires addressing limitations in the two most common approaches to language grounding: semantic parsers built on top of fixed object categories are precise but inflexible and end-to-end models are maximally expressive, but fickle and opaque. Our goal is to develop a system that balances the strengths of each approach so that users can teach agents new instructions that generalize broadly from a single example. We introduce the idea of neural abstructions: a set of constraints on the inference procedure of a label-conditioned generative model that can affect the meaning of the label in context. Starting from a core programming language that operates over abstructions, users can define increasingly complex mappings from natural language to actions. We show that with this method a user population is able to build a semantic parser for an open-ended house modification task in Minecraft. The semantic parser that results is both flexible and expressive: the percentage of utterances sourced from redefinitions increases steadily over the course of 191 total exchanges, achieving a final value of 28%."}}

We propose a Semantic Pixel-Level Adaptation Transform (SPLAT) approach to detector adaptation that efficiently generates cross-domain image pairs. Our model uses aligned-pair and/or pseudo-label losses to adapt an object detector to the target domain, and can learn transformations with or without densely labeled data in the source (e.g. semantic segmentation annotations). Without dense labels, as is the case when only detection labels are available in the source, transformations are learned using CycleGAN alignment. Otherwise, when dense labels are available we introduce a more efficient cycle-free method, which exploits pixel-level semantic labels to condition the training of the transformation network. The end task is then trained using detection box labels from the source, potentially including labels inferred on unlabeled source data. We show both that pixel-level transforms outperform prior approaches to detector domain adaptation, and that our cycle-free method outperforms prior models for unconstrained cycle-based learning of generic transformations while running 3.8 times faster. Our combined model improves on prior detection baselines by 12.5 mAP adapting from Sim 10K to Cityscapes, recovering over 50% of the missing performance between the unadapted baseline and the labeled-target upper bound."}}

A property that makes these predictive approaches well suited for robotics is that they can be learned online and incrementally through interaction with the environment. However, a remaining challenge for many prediction-learning approaches is an appropriate choice of prediction-learning parameters, especially parameters that control the magnitude of a learning machine's updates to its predictions (the learning rate or step size). To begin to address this challenge, we examine the use of online step-size adaptation using a sensor-rich robotic arm. Our method of choice, Temporal-Difference Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta (TIDBD), learns and adapts step sizes on a feature level; importantly, TIDBD allows step-size tuning and representation learning to occur at the same time. We show that TIDBD is a practical alternative for classic Temporal-Difference (TD) learning via an extensive parameter search. Both approaches perform comparably in terms of predicting future aspects of a robotic data stream. Furthermore, the use of a step-size adaptation method like TIDBD appears to allow a system to automatically detect and characterize common sensor failures in a robotic application. Together, these results promise to improve the ability of robotic devices to learn from interactions with their environments in a robust way, providing key capabilities for autonomous agents and robots."}}

While some biases are beneficial for learning, others are harmful. Specifically, image captioning models tend to exaggerate biases present in training data (e.g., if a word is present in 60% of training sentences, it might be predicted in 70% of sentences at test time). This can lead to incorrect captions in domains where unbiased captions are desired, or required, due to over-reliance on the learned prior and image context. In this work we investigate generation of gender-specific caption words (e.g. man, woman) based on the person\u2019s appearance or the image context. We introduce a new Equalizer model that encourages equal gender probability when gender evidence is occluded in a scene and confident predictions when gender evidence is present. The resulting model is forced to look at a person rather than use contextual cues to make a gender-specific prediction. The losses that comprise our model, the Appearance Confusion Loss and the Confident Loss, are general, and can be added to any description model in order to mitigate impacts of unwanted bias in a description dataset. Our proposed model has lower error than prior work when describing images with people and mentioning their gender and more closely matches the ground truth ratio of sentences including women to sentences including men. Finally, we show that our model more often looks at people when predicting their gender ( https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lisa anne/snowboard.html )."}}

One problem is that standard metrics only measure similarity to ground truth captions and may not fully capture image relevance. In this work, we propose a new image relevance metric to evaluate current models with veridical visual labels and assess their rate of object hallucination. We analyze how captioning model architectures and learning objectives contribute to object hallucination, explore when hallucination is likely due to image misclassification or language priors, and assess how well current sentence metrics capture object hallucination. We investigate these questions on the standard image caption- ing benchmark, MSCOCO, using a diverse set of models. Our analysis yields several interesting findings, including that models which score best on standard sentence metrics do not always have lower hallucination and that models which hallucinate more tend to make errors driven by language priors."}}
