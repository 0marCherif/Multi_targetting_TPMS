This issue is also observed in language modeling for long text generation, and one proposed solution is the use of a latent stochastic process. This approach involves generating a document plan and then producing text that is consistent with it. In this study, we investigate whether this technique can be applied to code generation to improve coherence. We base our proposed encoder and decoder on the pre-trained GPT-2 based CodeParrot model and utilize the APPS dataset for training. We evaluate our results using the HumanEval benchmark and observe that the modified Time Control model performs similarly to CodeParrot on this evaluation."}}

These models are usually trained on unmoderated and unfiltered data from open sources like the Internet. Due to this, biases that we see in platforms online which are a reflection of those in society are in turn captured and learned by these models. These models are deployed in applications that affect millions of people and their inherent biases are harmful to the targeted social groups. In this work, we study the general trend in bias reduction as newer pre-trained models are released. Three recent models ( ELECTRA, DeBERTa, and DistilBERT) are chosen and evaluated against two bias benchmarks, StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs. They are compared to the baseline of BERT using the associated metrics. We explore whether as advancements are made and newer, faster, lighter models are released: are they being developed responsibly such that their inherent social biases have been reduced compared to their older counterparts? The results are compiled and we find that all the models under study do exhibit biases but have generally improved as compared to BERT."}}

Hence the performance of classification pipeline depends on segmentation accuracy. We propose a first-time-right method which is a segmentation-free direct classification of WSI cervical cell clusters (without the extraction of single cell patches). The proposed method is evaluated on SIPaKMeD and Herlev datasets. Our method significantly outperformed previous methods and baselines with an accuracy of 96.37% on WSI patches (cell clusters) and 99.63% on single cell images.We also propose a PCA based feature interpretation method to visualize and understand the model to make its decisions more transparent. Our solution is promising in the development of automatic whole slide pap smear image classification system."}}

However, these systems are inadequate for the monitoring of large crowds due to the limited field of view of cameras. This paper introduces the Aerial Suspicious Analysis (ASANA) System for the Identification and Re-Identification of suspicious Individuals in large public areas using the Bayesian ScatterNet Hybrid (BSH) Network. The BSH network first estimates the human pose in each frame. Next, a batch of frames is used by the Bayesian 3D ResNext to identify individuals with suspicious postures. The system can also re-identify the identified suspicious individuals as they tend to move after committing the suspicious event. The proposed architecture is advantageous as it can learn meaningful representations quickly using the ScatterNet with fewer labelled examples. This is of great importance as real-life annotated training samples are hard to collect, especially for these applications. The pose estimation, suspicious individual identification, and re-identification performance of the proposed framework is compared with the state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed dataset is also made public which may encourage other researchers who are interested in using the deep learning technique for aerial visual crowd monitoring."}}
