The HWN expands the domain of probabilistic modeling from Euclidean to hyperbolic space, where a tree can be embedded with arbitrary low distortion in theory. In this work, we analyze the geometric properties of the diagonal HWN, a standard choice of distribution in probabilistic modeling. The analysis shows that the distribution is inappropriate to represent the data points at the same hierarchy level through their angular distance with the same norm in the Poincar\u00e9 disk model. We then empirically verify the presence of limitations of HWN, and show how RoWN, the proposed distribution, can alleviate the limitations on various hierarchical datasets, including noisy synthetic binary tree, WordNet, and Atari 2600 Breakout.

In this work, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework, dubbed SeLCA, that predicts a canonical axis of point clouds in a probabilistic manner. In essence, we propose to learn rotational-equivariance by predicting the canonical axis of point clouds, and achieve rotational-invariance by aligning the point clouds using their predicted canonical axis. When integrated into a rotation-sensitive pipeline, SeLCA achieves competitive performances on the ModelNet40 classification task under unseen rotations. Our proposed method also shows high robustness to various real-world point cloud corruptions presented by the ModelNet40-C dataset, compared to the state-of-the-art rotation-invariant method."}}

However, existing image completion methods tend to fill in the missing region with the surrounding texture instead of hallucinating a visual instance that is suitable in accordance with the context of the scene. In this work, we propose a novel image completion model, dubbed Refill, that hallucinates the missing instance that harmonizes well with - and thus preserves - the original context. Refill first adopts a transformer architecture that considers the types, locations of the visible instances, and the location of the missing region. Then, Refill completes the missing foreground and background semantic segmentation masks within the missing region, providing pixel-level semantic and structural guidance to generate missing contents with seamless boundaries. Finally, we condition the image synthesis blocks by using the completed segmentation mask to generate photo-realistic contents to fill out the missing region. Experimental results show the superiority of Refill over state-of-the-art image completion approaches on various natural images."}}

The assembly problem is challenging since the number of possible structures increases exponentially with the number of available bricks, complicating the physical constraints to satisfy across bricks. To tackle this problem, our method performs a brick structure assessment to predict the next brick position and its confidence by employing a U-shaped sparse 3D convolutional network. The convolution filter efficiently validates physical constraints in a parallelizable and scalable manner, allowing to process of different brick types. To generate a novel structure, we devise a sampling strategy to determine the next brick position by considering attachable positions under physical constraints. Instead of using handcrafted brick assembly datasets, our model is trained with a large number of 3D objects that allow to create a new high-fidelity structure. We demonstrate that our method successfully generates diverse brick structures while handling two different brick types and outperforms existing methods based on Bayesian optimization, graph generative model, and reinforcement learning, all of which are limited to a single brick type."}}

Despite its practicality, matching the unbalanced pairs in terms of spatial extent and density has been overlooked and rarely studied. We present a novel method, dubbed UPPNet, for Unbalanced Point cloud Pair registration. We propose to incorporate a hierarchical framework that effectively finds inlier correspondences by gradually reducing search space. The proposed method first predicts subregions within target point cloud that are likely to be overlapped with query. Then following super-point matching and fine-grained refinement modules predict accurate inlier correspondences between the target and query. Additional geometric constraints are applied to refine the correspondences that satisfy spatial compatibility. The proposed network can be trained in an end-to-end manner, predicting the accurate rigid transformation with a single forward pass. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, we create a carefully designed benchmark, named KITTI-UPP dataset, by augmenting the KITTI odometry dataset. Extensive experiments reveal that the proposed method not only outperforms state-of-the-art point cloud registration methods by large margins on KITTI-UPP benchmark, but also achieves competitive results on the standard pairwise registration benchmark including 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, ScanNet, and KITTI, thus showing the applicability of our method on various datasets.

The key idea of the method is to employ a committee of classifiers as an auxiliary module that identifies bias-conflicting data and assigns large weights to them when training the main classifier. The committee is learned as a bootstrapped ensemble so that a majority of its classifiers are biased as well as being diverse, and intentionally fail to predict classes of bias-conflicting data accordingly. The consensus within the committee on prediction difficulty provides a reliable cue for identifying and weighting bias-conflicting data. Moreover, the committee is trained also with knowledge transferred from the main classifier so that it gradually becomes debiased and emphasizes more difficult data as training progresses.\nOn five real-world datasets, our method outperforms previous arts using no bias label like ours and even surpasses those relying on bias labels occasionally."}}
