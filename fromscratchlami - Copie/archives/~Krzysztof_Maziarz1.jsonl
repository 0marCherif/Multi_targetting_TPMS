Recently, the combination of ML-based single-step reaction predictors with multi-step planners has led to promising results. However, the single-step predictors are mostly trained offline to optimize the single-step accuracy, without considering complete routes. Here, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the single-step predictor, by using a tree-shaped MDP to optimize complete routes. Specifically, we propose a novel online training algorithm, called Planning with Dual Value Networks (PDVN), which alternates between the planning phase and updating phase. In PDVN, we construct two separate value networks to predict the synthesizability and cost of molecules, respectively. To maintain the single-step accuracy, we design a two-branch network structure for the single-step predictor. On the widely-used USPTO dataset, our PDVN algorithm improves the search success rate of existing multi-step planners (e.g., increasing the success rate from 85.79% to 98.95% for Retro*, and reducing the number of model calls by half while solving 99.47% molecules for RetroGraph). Additionally, PDVN helps find shorter synthesis routes (e.g., reducing the average route length from 5.76 to 4.83 for Retro*, and from 5.63 to 4.78 for RetroGraph)."}}

A widely applied technique in early drug discovery to identify novel active molecules against a protein target is modelling quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). It is known to be extremely challenging, as available measurements of compound activities range in the low dozens or hundreds. However, many such related datasets exist, each with a small number of datapoints, opening up the opportunity for few-shot learning after pre-training on a substantially larger corpus of data. At the same time, many few-shot learning methods are currently evaluated in the computer-vision domain. We propose that expansion into a new application, as well as the possibility to use explicitly graph-structured data, will drive exciting progress in few-shot learning. Here, we provide a few-shot learning dataset (FS-Mol) and complementary benchmarking procedure. We define a set of tasks on which few-shot learning methods can be evaluated, with a separate set of tasks for use in pre-training. In addition, we implement and evaluate a number of existing single-task, multi-task, and meta-learning approaches as baselines for the community. We hope that our dataset, support code release, and baselines will encourage future work on this extremely challenging new domain for few-shot learning."}}

This identification should ideally be robust to alpha-renaming of the program, but no existing technique has been shown to achieve this with good efficiency (better than O(n2) in expression size). We present a new, asymptotically efficient way to hash modulo alpha-equivalence. A key insight of our method is to use a weak (commutative) hash combiner at exactly one point in the construction, which admits an algorithm with O(n (logn)2) time complexity. We prove that the use of the commutative combiner nevertheless yields a strong hash with low collision probability. Numerical benchmarks attest to the asymptotic behaviour of the method."}}

Multi-task neural networks can learn to transfer knowledge across different tasks by using parameter sharing. However, sharing parameters between unrelated tasks can hurt performance. To address this issue, routing networks can be applied to learn to share each group of parameters with a different subset of tasks to better leverage tasks relatedness. However, this use of routing methods requires to address the challenge of learning the routing jointly with the parameters of a modular multi-task neural network. We propose the Gumbel-Matrix routing, a novel multi-task routing method based on the Gumbel-Softmax, that is designed to learn fine-grained parameter sharing. When applied to the Omniglot benchmark, the proposed method improves the state-of-the-art error rate by 17%."}}

In this paper, we introduce a realism index of a point, which can be constructed from an arbitrary prior density, or based on FID score approach in case a prior is not available. We propose a numerically efficient algorithm that directly maximises the realism index of an interpolation which, as we theoretically prove, leads to a search of a geodesic with respect to the corresponding Riemann structure. We show that we obtain better interpolations then the classical linear ones, in particular when either the prior density is not convex shaped, or when the soap bubble effect appears."}}
