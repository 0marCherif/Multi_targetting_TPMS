We consider Bayesian agents who are unaware of ex-post realization of their own arms' mean rewards, which is the first to study Bayesian extension of Shin et al. (2022). This extension presents significant challenges in analyzing equilibrium, in contrast to the fully-informed setting by Shin et al. (2022) under which the problem simply reduces to a case where each agent only has a single arm. With Bayesian agents, even in a single-agent setting, analyzing the replication-proofness of an algorithm becomes complicated. Remarkably, we first show that the algorithm proposed by Shin et al. (2022), defined H-UCB, is no longer replication-proof for any exploration parameters. Then, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for an algorithm to be replication-proof in the single-agent setting. These results centers around several analytical results in comparing the expected regret of multiple bandit instances, which might be of independent interest. We further prove that exploration-then-commit (ETC) algorithm satisfies these properties, whereas UCB does not, which in fact leads to the failure of being replication-proof. We expand this result to multi-agent setting, and provide a replication-proof algorithm for any problem instance. The proof mainly relies on the single-agent result, as well as some structural properties of ETC and the novel introduction of a restarting round, which largely simplifies the analysis while maintaining the regret unchanged (up to polylogarithmic factor). We finalize our result by proving its sublinear regret upper bound, which matches that of H-UCB."}}

Since fairness has become an important consideration that was ignored in the existing algorithms a collection of online matching algorithms have been developed that give a fair treatment guarantee for one side of the market at the expense of a drop in the operator\u2019s profit. In this paper, we generalize the existing work to offer fair treatment guarantees to both sides of the market simultaneously, at a calculated worst case drop to operator profit. We consider group and individual Rawlsian fairness criteria. Moreover, our algorithms have theoretical guarantees and have adjustable parameters that can be tuned as desired to balance the trade-off between the utilities of the three sides. We also derive hardness results that give clear upper bounds over the performance of any algorithm."}}

Specifically, the arms are strategic agents who can improve their rewards or absorb them. The utility of an agent increases if she is pulled more or absorbs more of her rewards but decreases if she spends more effort improving her rewards. Agents have heterogeneous properties, specifically having different means and able to improve their rewards up to different levels. Further, a non-empty subset of agents are ''honest'' and in the worst case always give their rewards without absorbing any part. The principal wishes to obtain a high revenue (cumulative reward) by designing a mechanism that incentives top level performance at equilibrium. At the same time, the principal wishes to be robust and obtain revenue at least at the level of the honest agent with the highest mean in case of non-equilibrium behaviour. We identify a class of MAB algorithms which we call performance incentivizing which satisfy a collection of properties and show that they lead to mechanisms that incentivize top level performance at equilibrium and are robust under any strategy profile. Interestingly, we show that UCB is an example of such a MAB algorithm. Further, in the case where the top performance level is unknown we show that combining second price auction ideas with performance incentivizing algorithms achieves performance at least at the second top level while also being robust."}}

Despite the fact that these notions are well-justified, they are often motivated and studied in a disjoint manner where one fairness desideratum is considered exclusively in isolation from the others. This leaves the understanding of the relations between different fairness notions as an important open problem in fair clustering. In this paper, we take the first step in this direction. Specifically, we consider the two most prominent demographic representation fairness notions in clustering: (1) Group Fairness (GF), where the different demographic groups are supposed to have close to population-level representation in each cluster and (2) Diversity in Center Selection (DS), where the selected centers are supposed to have close to population-level representation of each group. We show that given a constant approximation algorithm for one constraint (GF or DS only) we can obtain a constant approximation solution that satisfies both constraints simultaneously. Interestingly, we prove that any given solution that satisfies the GF constraint can always be post-processed at a bounded degradation to the clustering cost to additionally satisfy the DS constraint while the reverse is not true. Furthermore, we show that both GF and DS are incompatible (having an empty feasibility set in the worst case) with a collection of other distance-based fairness notions. Finally, we carry experiments to validate our theoretical findings."}}

Specifically, we consider a common setting in which a decision-maker runs a clustering algorithm, inspects the center of each cluster, and decides an appropriate outcome (label) for its corresponding cluster. In hiring for example, there could be two outcomes, positive (hire) or negative (reject), and each cluster would be assigned one of these two outcomes.

We provide algorithms for such problems and show that in contrast to their NP-hard counterparts in group fair clustering, they permit efficient solutions. We also consider a well-motivated alternative setting where the decision-maker is free to assign labels to the clusters regardless of the centers' positions in the metric space. We show that this setting exhibits interesting transitions from computationally hard to easy according to additional constraints on the problem.

In this work we introduce a novel definition of individual fairness for clustering problems. Specifically, in our model, each point $j$ has a set of other points $\\mathcal{S}_j$ that it perceives as similar to itself, and it feels that it is being fairly treated if the quality of service it receives in the solution is $\\alpha$-close (in a multiplicative sense, for some given $\\alpha \\geq 1$) to that of the points in $\\mathcal{S}_j$. We begin our study by answering questions regarding the combinatorial structure of the problem, namely for what values of $\\alpha$ the problem is well-defined, and what the behavior of the Price of Fairness (PoF) for it is. For the well-defined region of $\\alpha$, we provide efficient and easily-implementable approximation algorithms for the $k$-center objective, which in certain cases also enjoy bounded-PoF guarantees. We finally complement our analysis by an extensive suite of experiments that validates the effectiveness of our theoretical results."}}

A valid redistricting map must satisfy a collection of constraints such as being compact, contiguous, and of almost equal population. However, these imposed constraints are still loose enough to enable an enormous ensemble of valid redistricting maps. This fact introduces a difficulty in drawing redistricting maps and it also enables a partisan legislature to possibly gerrymander by choosing a map which unfairly favors it. In this paper, we introduce an interpretable and tractable distance measure over redistricting maps which does not use election results and study its implications over the ensemble of redistricting maps. Specifically, we define a central map which may be considered as being \"most typical\" and give a rigorous justification for it by showing that it mirrors the Kemeny ranking in a scenario where we have a committee voting over a collection of redistricting maps to be drawn. We include run-time and sample complexity analysis for our algorithms, including some negative results which hold using any algorithm. We further study outlier detection based on this distance measure. More precisely, we show gerrymandered maps that lie very far away from our central maps in comparison to a large ensemble of valid redistricting maps. Since our distance measure does not rely on election results, this gives a significant advantage in gerrymandering detection which is lacking in all previous methods."}}
