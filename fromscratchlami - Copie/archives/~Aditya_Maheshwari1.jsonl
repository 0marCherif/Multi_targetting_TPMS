(2013) borrow from the non-banking financial sector at a certain interest rate, controlled by the central bank, and invest in risky assets. Each private actor aims to maximize its expected terminal logarithmic wealth. The central bank, in turn, aims to control the overall economy by means of an exponential utility function. We solve all stochastic optimal control problems explicitly. We are able to recreate occasions such as liquidity trap. We study distribution of the number of defaults (net worth of a private actor going below a certain threshold)."}}

In addition to this modification, we find that addressing the methodological and reporting issues in Harvie (2000) leads to remarkably better results, with near perfect agreement between the estimates of equilibrium employment rates and the corresponding empirical averages, as well as significantly improved estimates of equilibrium wage shares. Despite its simplicity and obvious limitations, the performance of the modified Goodwin model implied by our results show that it can be used as a starting point for more sophisticated models for endogenous growth cycles.\n\n"}}

The framework is the multi-period stochastic financial market setting with one tradable stock, stochastic income, and a non-tradable index. The correlation constraint is imposed on the portfolio and the non-tradable index at some benchmark time horizon. The goal is to maximize a portofolio\u2019s expected exponential utility subject to the correlation constraint. Two types of optimal portfolio strategies are considered: the subgame perfect and the precommitment ones. We find analytical expressions for the constrained subgame perfect (CSGP) and the constrained precommitment (CPC) portfolio strategies. Both these portfolio strategies yield significantly lower risk when compared to the unconstrained setting, at the cost of a small utility loss. The performance of the CSGP and CPC portfolio strategies is similar."}}

Our motivation comes from microgrid management, where the controller tries to optimally dispatch a diesel generator while maintaining low probability of blackouts at each step. The key question we investigate are empirical simulation procedures for learning the state-dependent admissible control set that is specified implicitly through a probability constraint on the system state. We propose a variety of relevant statistical tools including logistic regression, Gaussian process regression, quantile regression and support vector machines, which we then incorporate into an overall Regression Monte Carlo (RMC) framework for approximate dynamic programming. Our results indicate that using logistic or Gaussian process regression to estimate the admissibility probability outperforms the other options. Our algorithms offer an efficient and reliable extension of RMC to probability-constrained control. We illustrate our findings with two case studies for the microgrid problem."}}

Taking a statistical learning perspective, we develop the dynamic emulation algorithm (DEA) that unifies the different existing approaches in a single modular template. We then investigate the two central aspects of regression architecture and experimental design that constitute DEA. For the regression piece, we discuss various non-parametric approaches, in particular introducing the use of Gaussian process regression in the context of stochastic storage. For simulation design, we compare the performance of traditional design (grid discretization), against space-filling, and several adaptive alternatives. The overall DEA template is illustrated with multiple examples drawing from natural gas storage valuation and optimal control of back-up generator in a microgrid."}}
