In this paper, we present \\emph{iVoro}, a novel framework derived from computational geometry. We found Voronoi Diagram (VD), a classical model for space subdivision, is especially powerful for solving the CIL problem, because VD itself can be constructed favorably in an incremental manner -- the newly added sites (classes) will only affect the proximate classes, making the non-contiguous classes hardly forgettable. Furthermore, we bridge DNN and VD using Power Diagram Reduction, and show that the VD structure can be progressively refined along the phases using a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Moreover, our VD construction is not restricted to the deep feature space, but is also applicable to multiple intermediate feature spaces, promoting VD to be multilayer VD that efficiently captures multi-grained features from DNN. Importantly, \\emph{iVoro} is also capable of handling uncertainty-aware test-time Voronoi cell assignment and has exhibited high correlations between geometric uncertainty and predictive accuracy (up to ${\\sim}0.9$). Putting everything together, \\emph{iVoro} achieves up to $25.26\\%$, $37.09\\%$, and $33.21\\%$ improvements on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-Subset, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art non-exemplar CIL approaches.

One observation is that the widely embraced ProtoNet model is essentially a Voronoi Diagram (VD) in the feature space. We retrofit it by making use of a recent advance in computational geometry called Cluster-induced Voronoi Diagram (CIVD). Starting from the simplest nearest neighbor model, CIVD gradually incorporates cluster-to-point and then cluster-to-cluster relationships for space subdivision, which is used to improve the accuracy and robustness at multiple stages of FSL. Specifically, we use CIVD (1) to integrate parametric and nonparametric few-shot classifiers; (2) to combine feature representation and surrogate representation; (3) and to leverage feature-level, transformation-level, and geometry-level heterogeneities for a better ensemble.

With the assumption of data distribution that each optimal cluster has \"average\" size of \\Omega(n/k), which is common in many datasets and k-means benchmarks, we prove that our proposed algorithm gives a (100+\\epsilon)-approximate solution in expectation.
