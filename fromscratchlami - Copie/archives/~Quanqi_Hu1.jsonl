Due to the intertwined  multi-block min-max bilevel structure, the computational cost at each iteration could be prohibitively high, especially with a large number of blocks. To tackle this challenge, we present two single-loop randomized stochastic algorithms, which require updates for only a constant number of blocks at each iteration. Under some mild assumptions on the problem, we establish their sample complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^4)$ for finding an $\\epsilon$-stationary point. This matches the optimal complexity order for solving stochastic nonconvex optimization under a general unbiased stochastic oracle model. Moreover, we provide two applications of the proposed method in multi-task deep AUC (area under ROC curve) maximization. Experimental results validate our theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}}
