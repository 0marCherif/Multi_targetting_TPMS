This model allows us to generate new\nmolecules for efficient exploration and optimization through\nopen-ended spaces of chemical compounds. A deep neural\nnetwork was trained on hundreds of thousands of existing\nchemical structures to construct three coupled functions: an\nencoder, a decoder, and a predictor. The encoder converts the\ndiscrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued\ncontinuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous\nvectors back to discrete molecular representations. The predictor\nestimates chemical properties from the latent continuous vector\nrepresentation of the molecule. Continuous representations of molecules allow us to automatically generate novel chemical\nstructures by performing simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random vectors, perturbing known chemical\nstructures, or interpolating between molecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful gradient-based\noptimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized functional compounds. We demonstrate our method in the domain of\ndrug-like molecules and also in a set of molecules with fewer that nine heavy atoms"}}

This problem, termed quantitative structure-odor relationship (QSOR) modeling, is an important challenge in chemistry, impacting human nutrition, manufacture of synthetic fragrance, the environment, and sensory neuroscience. We propose the use of graph neural networks for QSOR, and show they significantly out-perform prior methods on a novel data set labeled by olfactory experts. Additional analysis shows that the learned embeddings from graph neural networks capture a meaningful odor space representation of the underlying relationship between structure and odor, as demonstrated by strong performance on two challenging transfer learning tasks. Machine learning has already had a large impact on the senses of sight and sound. Based on these early results with graph neural networks for molecular properties, we hope machine learning can eventually do for olfaction what it has already done for vision and hearing."}}
