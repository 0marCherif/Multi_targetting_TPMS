Most previous learning-based plane reconstruction methods reconstruct 3D planes from single images, which highly rely on single-view regression and suffer from depth scale ambiguity. In contrast, we reconstruct 3D planes with a multi-view-stereo (MVS) pipeline that takes advantage of multi-view geometry. We decouple plane reconstruction into a semantic plane detection branch and a plane MVS branch. The semantic plane detection branch is based on a single-view plane detection framework but with differences. The plane MVS branch adopts a set of slanted plane hypotheses to replace conventional depth hypotheses to perform plane sweeping strategy and finally learns pixel-level plane parameters and its planar depth map. We present how the two branches are learned in a balanced way, and propose a soft-pooling loss to associate the outputs of the two branches and make them benefit from each other. Extensive experiments on various indoor datasets show that PlaneMVS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-view plane reconstruction methods on both plane detection and 3D geometry metrics. Our method even outperforms a set of SOTA learning-based MVS methods thanks to the learned plane priors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on 3D plane reconstruction within an end-to-end MVS framework."}}

However, the majority of existing methods synthesize floorplans in the format of rasterized images, which are difficult to edit or customize. In this paper, we aim to synthesize floorplans as sequences of 1-D vectors, which eases user interaction and design customization. To generate high fidelity vectorized floorplans, we propose a novel two-stage framework, including a draft stage and a multi-round refining stage. In the first stage, we encode the room connectivity graph input by users with a graph convolutional network\u00a0(GCN), then apply an autoregressive transformer network to generate an initial floorplan sequence. To polish the initial design and generate more visually appealing floorplans, we further propose a novel panoptic refinement network (PRN) composed of a GCN and a transformer network. The PRN takes the initial generated sequence as input and refines the floorplan design while encouraging the correct room connectivity with our proposed geometric loss. We have conducted extensive experiments on a real-world floorplan dataset, and the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under different settings and evaluation metrics."}}
