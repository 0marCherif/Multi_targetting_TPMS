Despite impressive results have been achieved recently, restoring images with both vivid textures and reasonable structures remains a significant challenge. Previous methods have primarily addressed regular textures while disregarding holistic structures due to the limited receptive fields of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To this end, we study learning a Zero-initialized residual addition based Incremental Transformer on Structural priors (ZITS++), an improved model upon our conference work, ZITS (Dong et al. 2022). Specifically, given one corrupt image, we present the Transformer Structure Restorer (TSR) module to restore holistic structural priors at low image resolution, which are further upsampled by Simple Structure Upsampler (SSU) module to higher image resolution. To recover image texture details, we use the Fourier CNN Texture Restoration (FTR) module, which is strengthened by Fourier and large-kernel attention convolutions. Furthermore, to enhance the FTR, the upsampled structural priors from TSR are further processed by Structure Feature Encoder (SFE) and optimized with the Zero-initialized Residual Addition (ZeroRA) incrementally. Besides, a new masking positional encoding is proposed to encode the large irregular masks. Compared with ZITS, ZITS++ improves the FTR's stability and inpainting ability with several techniques. More importantly, we comprehensively explore the effects of various image priors for inpainting and investigate how to utilize them to address high-resolution image inpainting with extensive experiments. This investigation is orthogonal to most inpainting approaches and can thus significantly benefit the community."}}

To address these problems, we first apply one of the state-of-the-art learning-based MVS methods, --MVSFormer, to overcome intractable scenarios such as textureless and reflections regions suffered by traditional PatchMatch methods, but it fails in a few large scenes' reconstructions. Moreover, traditional PatchMatch algorithms such as ACMMP, OpenMVS, and RealityCapture are leveraged to further improve the completeness in large scenes. Furthermore, to unify both advantages of deep learning methods and the traditional PatchMatch, we propose to render depth and color images to further fine-tune the MVSFormer model. Notably, we find that the MVS method could produce much better predictions through rendered images due to the coincident illumination, which we believe is significant for the MVS community. Thus, MVSFormer is capable of generalizing to large-scale scenes and complementarily solves the textureless reconstruction problem. Finally, we have assembled all point clouds mentioned above \\textit{except ones from RealityCapture} and ranked Top-1 on the competitive GigaReconstruction."}}

Recently, detector-free local feature matchers based on transformers have shown promising results, which largely outperform pure Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based ones. But correlations produced by transformer-based methods are spatially limited to the center of source views' coarse patches, because of the costly attention learning. In this work, we rethink this issue and find that such matching formulation degrades pose estimation, especially for low-resolution images. So we propose a transformer-based cascade matching model -- Cascade feature Matching TRansformer (CasMTR), to efficiently learn dense feature correlations, which allows us to choose more reliable matching pairs for the relative pose estimation. Instead of re-training a new detector, we use a simple yet effective Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) post-process to filter keypoints through the confidence map, and largely improve the matching precision. CasMTR achieves state-of-the-art performance in indoor and outdoor pose estimation as well as visual localization. Moreover, thorough ablations show the efficacy of the proposed components and techniques."}}

We improve such a framework from two aspects. First, we propose a Local Feature Consensus (LFC) plugin block to augment the features of existing models. Given a correspondence feature, the block augments its neighboring features with mutual neighborhood consensus and aggregates them to produce an enhanced feature. As inliers obey a uniform cross-view transformation and share more consistent learned features than outliers, feature consensus strengthens inlier correlation and suppresses outlier distraction, which makes output features more discriminative for classifying inliers/outliers. Second, existing approaches supervise network training with the ground truth correspondences and essential matrix projecting one image to the other for an input image pair, without considering the information from the reverse mapping. We extend existing models to a Siamese network with a reciprocal loss that exploits the supervision of mutual projection, which considerably promotes the matching performance without introducing additional model parameters.

Instead of building a direct mapping function from images to 3D shape, our model learns to predict series of deformations to improve a coarse shape iteratively. Inspired by traditional multiple view geometry methods, our network samples nearby area around the initial mesh\u2019s vertex locations and reasons an optimal deformation using perceptual feature statistics built from multiple input images. Extensive experiments show that our model produces accurate 3D shapes that are not only visually plausible from the input perspectives, but also well aligned to arbitrary viewpoints. With the help of physically driven architecture, our model also exhibits generalization capability across different semantic categories, and the number of input images. Model analysis experiments show that our model is robust to the quality of the initial mesh and the error of camera pose, and can be combined with a differentiable renderer for test-time optimization."}}

Recent deep learning based optical flow models have achieved considerable success. However, these models often train networks from the scratch on standard optical flow data, which restricts their ability to robustly and geometrically match image features. In this paper, we propose a rethinking to previous optical flow estimation. We particularly leverage Geometric Image Matching (GIM) as a pre-training task for the optical flow estimation (MatchFlow) with better feature representations, as GIM shares some common challenges as optical flow estimation, and with massive labeled real-world data. Thus, matching static scenes helps to learn more fundamental feature correlations of objects and scenes with consistent displacements. Specifically, the proposed MatchFlow model employs a QuadTree attention-based network pre-trained on MegaDepth to extract coarse features for further flow regression. Extensive experiments show that our model has great cross-dataset generalization. Our method achieves 11.5% and 10.1% error reduction from GMA on Sintel clean pass and KITTI test set. At the time of anonymous submission, our MatchFlow(G) enjoys state-of-the-art performance on Sintel clean and final pass compared to published approaches with comparable computation and memory footprint.

Advanced unconditional generators, such as StyleGAN, can generate a high-quality portrait image with great diversity. In previous researches, StyleGAN has successfully been utilized for color-guided image editing through latent vector optimization. Nonetheless, passing sketch information to the generating model directly is nontrivial. To this end, we present an algorithm that addresses the problem of well controlling the generation process via differentiable guided sketches from latent space. Specifically, we re-purpose the classic operator \u2013 eXtended difference-of-Gaussians (XDoG) that derives differentiable sketches from images. We also propose a multi-scale sketch loss assisted with which can finally guide the model follow the guidance sketch to generate. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our model in sketch-guided editing. We show that the quality of produced images is better than that of competitors."}}

As the common feature extractor of learning-based MVS, vanilla Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs) suffer from discouraged feature representations for reflection and texture-less areas, which limits the generalization of MVS. Even FPNs worked with pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) fail to tackle these issues. On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved prominent success in many 2D vision tasks. Thus we ask whether ViTs can facilitate feature learning in MVS? In this paper, we propose a pre-trained ViT enhanced MVS network called MVSFormer, which can learn more reliable feature representations benefited by informative priors from ViT. The finetuned MVSFormer with hierarchical ViTs of efficient attention mechanisms can achieve prominent improvement based on FPNs. Besides, the alternative MVSFormer with frozen ViT weights is further proposed. This largely alleviates the training cost with competitive performance strengthened by the attention map from the self-distillation pre-training. MVSFormer can be generalized to various input resolutions with efficient multi-scale training strengthened by gradient accumulation. Moreover, we discuss the merits and drawbacks of classification and regression-based MVS methods, and further propose to unify them with a temperature-based strategy. MVSFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU dataset. Particularly, MVSFormer ranks as Top-1 on both intermediate and advanced sets of the highly competitive Tanks-and-Temples leaderboard.
