It plays an important role in solving problems in organic synthesis planning. To automate or assist in the retrosynthesis analysis, various retrosynthesis prediction algorithms have been proposed. However, most of them are cumbersome and lack interpretability about their predictions. In this paper, we devise a novel template-free algorithm for automatic retrosynthetic expansion inspired by how chemists approach retrosynthesis prediction. Our method disassembles retrosynthesis into two steps: i) identify the potential reaction center of the target molecule through a novel graph neural network and generate intermediate synthons, and ii) generate the reactants associated with synthons via a robust reactant generation model. While outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin, our model also provides chemically reasonable interpretation."}}

However, current graph neural networks (GNNs) remain of limited acceptance in drug discovery is limited due to their lack of interpretability. Although this major weakness has been mitigated by the development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, the \"ground truth\" assignment in most explainable tasks ultimately rests with subjective judgments by humans so that the quality of model interpretation is hard to evaluate in quantity. In this work, we first build three levels of benchmark datasets to quantitatively assess the interpretability of the state-of-the-art GNN models. Then we implemented recent XAI methods in combination with different GNN algorithms to highlight the benefits, limitations, and future opportunities for drug discovery. As a result, GradInput and IG generally provide the best model interpretability for GNNs, especially when combined with GraphNet and CMPNN. The integrated and developed XAI package is fully open-sourced and can be used by practitioners to train new models on other drug discovery tasks."}}

Recent researches abstract molecules as attributed graphs and employ graph neural networks (GNN) for molecular representation learning, which have made remarkable achievements in molecular graph modeling. Albeit powerful, current models either are based on local aggregation operations and thus miss higher-order graph properties or focus on only node information without fully using the edge information. For this sake, we propose a Communicative Message Passing Transformer (CoMPT) neural network to improve the molecular graph representation by reinforcing message interactions between nodes and edges based on the Transformer architecture. Unlike the previous transformer-style GNNs that treat molecules as fully connected graphs, we introduce a message diffusion mechanism to leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias and reduce the message enrichment explosion. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed model obtained superior performances (around 4 on average) against state-of-the-art baselines on seven chemical property datasets (graph-level tasks) and two chemical shift datasets (node-level tasks). Further visualization studies also indicated a better representation capacity achieved by our model."}}

Despite the importance of inductive relation prediction, most previous works are limited to a transductive setting and cannot process previously unseen entities. The recent proposed subgraph-based relation reasoning models provided alternatives to predict links from the subgraph structure surrounding a candidate triplet inductively. However, we observe that these methods often neglect the directed nature of the extracted subgraph and weaken the role of relation information in the subgraph modeling. As a result, they fail to effectively handle the asymmetric/anti-symmetric triplets and produce insufficient embeddings for the target triplets. To this end, we introduce a Communicative Message Passing neural network for Inductive reLation rEasoning, CoMPILE, that reasons over local directed subgraph structures and has a vigorous inductive bias to process entity-independent semantic relations. In contrast to existing models, CoMPILE strengthens the message interactions between edges and entitles through a communicative kernel and enables a sufficient flow of relation information. Moreover, we demonstrate that CoMPILE can naturally handle asymmetric/anti-symmetric relations without the need for explosively increasing the number of model parameters by extracting the directed enclosing subgraphs. Extensive experiments show substantial performance gains in comparison to state-of-the-art methods on commonly used benchmark datasets with variant inductive settings."}}

State-of-the-art methods mostly employ graph neural networks (GNNs) with self-supervised learning (SSL) and extra chemical reaction knowledge to empower the learned embeddings. However, prior works ignore three major issues in modeling reaction data, that is abnormal energy flow, ambiguous embeddings, and sparse embedding space problems. To address these problems, we propose ReaKE, a chemical synthetic knowledge graph-driven pre-training framework for molecular representation learning. We first construct a large-scale chemical synthetic knowledge graph comprising reactants, products and reaction rules. We then propose triplet-level and graph-level contrastive learning strategies to jointly optimize the knowledge graph and molecular embeddings. Representations learned by ReaKE can capture intermolecular relationships reflected in the semantic knowledge graph and molecular structures. By comparing with other state-of-the-art methods, we show that ReaKE can achieve competitive performance on the reaction prediction pretext task and the learned representations transfer well to various downstream tasks, including reaction classification, yield prediction, and molecule property prediction. Further visualization shows that the learned representations can capture the fine-grained differences both between reactions and between molecules."}}

State-of-the-art methods employ graph neural networks (GNNs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) to learn the structural representations from unlabeled data, which can then be fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Albeit powerful, these methods that are pre-trained solely on molecular structures cannot generalize well to the tasks involved in intricate biological processes. To cope with this challenge, we propose using high-content cell microscopy images to assist in learning molecular representation. The fundamental rationale of our method is to leverage the correspondence between molecular topological structures and the caused perturbations at the phenotypic level. By including cross-modal pre-training with different types of contrastive loss functions in a unified framework, our model can efficiently learn generic and informative representations from cellular images, which are complementary to molecular structures. Empirical experiments demonstrated that the model transfers non-trivially to a variety of downstream tasks and is often competitive with the existing SSL baselines, e.g., a 15.4\\% absolute Hit@10 gains in graph-image retrieval task and a 4.0\\% absolute AUC improvements in clinical outcome predictions. Further zero-shot case studies show the potential of the approach to be applied to real-world drug discovery. "}}

Currently, computational predictions of drug-gene interactions mainly focus on the binding interactions without considering other relation types like agonist, antagonist, etc. In addition, existing methods either heavily rely on high-quality domain features or are intrinsically transductive, which limits the capacity of models to generalize to drugs/genes that lack external information or are unseen during the training process. To address these problems, we propose a novel Communicative Subgraph representation learning for Multi-relational Inductive drug-Gene interactions prediction (CoSMIG), where the predictions of drug-gene relations are made through subgraph patterns, and thus are naturally inductive for unseen drugs/genes without retraining or utilizing external domain features. Moreover, the model strengthened the relations on the drug-gene graph through a communicative message passing mechanism. To evaluate our method, we compiled two new benchmark datasets from DrugBank and DGIdb. The comprehensive experiments on the two datasets showed that our method outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in the transductive scenarios and achieved superior performance in the inductive ones. Further experimental analysis including LINCS experimental validation and literature verification also demonstrated the value of our model."}}
