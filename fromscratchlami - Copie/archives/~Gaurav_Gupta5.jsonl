STORM compresses a data stream into a tiny array of integer counters. This sketch is sufficient to estimate a variety of surrogate losses over the original dataset. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and show that STORM can estimate a carefully chosen surrogate loss for regularized least-squares regression and a margin loss for classification. \nWe perform an exhaustive experimental comparison for regression and classification training on real-world datasets, achieving an approximate solution with a size even less than a data sample."}}
