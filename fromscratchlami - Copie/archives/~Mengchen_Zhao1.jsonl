OPE is crucial in many applications where online policy evaluation is expensive. However, existing OPE methods are far from reliable. Fortunately, in many real-world scenarios, we care only about the ranking of the evaluating policies, rather than their exact online performance. Existing works on off-policy ranking (OPR) adopt a supervised training paradigm, which assumes that there are plenty of deployed policies and the labels of their performance are available. However, this assumption does not apply to most OPE scenarios because collecting such training data might be highly expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel OPR framework called SOCCER, where the existing OPE methods are modeled as workers in a crowdsourcing system. SOCCER can be trained in a self-supervised way as it does not require any ground-truth labels of policies. Moreover, in order to capture the relative discrepancies between policies, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture to learn effective pairwise policy representations. Experimental results show that SOCCER achieves significantly high accuracy in a variety of OPR tasks. Surprisingly, SOCCER even performs better than baselines trained in a supervised way using additional labeled data, which further demonstrates the superiority of SOCCER in OPR tasks."}}

As the simplest implementation of value factorization, Linear Value Factorization (LVF) attracts wide attention. In this paper, firstly, we investigate the applicable conditions of LVF, which is important but usually neglected by previous works. We prove that due to the representation limitation, LVF is only perfectly applicable to an extremely narrow class of tasks, which we define as the decomposable Markov game. Secondly, to handle the indecomposable Markov game where the LVF is inapplicable, we turn to value factorization with complete representation capability (CRC) and explore the general form of the value factorization function that satisfies both Independent Global Max (IGM) and CRC conditions. A common problem of these value factorization functions is the representation interference among true Q values with shared local Q value functions. As a result, the policy could be trapped in local optimums due to the representation interference on the optimal true Q values. Thirdly, to address the problem, we propose a novel value factorization method, namely Q Factorization with Representation Interference Suppression (QFRIS).  QFRIS adaptively reduces the gradients of the local Q value functions contributed by the non-optimal true Q values. Our method is evaluated on various benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate the good convergence of QFIRS."}}

Instead of limiting teammates into a finite set of predefined types, ODITS automatically learns latent variables of teammates' behaviors to infer how to cooperate with new teammates effectively.

Via unifying the KG with user-item interactions into a tripartite graph, recent works explore the graph topologies to learn the low-dimensional representations of users and items with rich semantics. These real-world tripartite graphs are usually scale-free, however, the intrinsic hierarchical graph structures of which are underemphasized in existing works, consequently, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. To address this issue and provide more accurate recommendation, we propose a knowledge-aware recommendation method with Lorentz model of the hyperbolic geometry, namely Lorentzian Knowledge-enhanced Graph convolutional networks for Recommendation (LKGR). LKGR facilitates better modeling of scale-free tripartite graphs after the data unification. Specifically, we employ different information propagation strategies in the hyperbolic space to explicitly encode heterogeneous information from historical interactions and KGs. Additionally, our proposed knowledge-aware attention mechanism enables the model to automatically measure the information contribution, producing the coherent information aggregation in the hyperbolic space. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LKGR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.6-15.3% of [email\u00a0protected] on Top-K recommendation."}}
