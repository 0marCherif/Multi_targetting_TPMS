Recent works in this domain have increasingly focused on the problem setting with short-text input data, and labels endowed with short textual descriptions called label features. Short-text XMC with label features has found numerous applications in areas such as prediction of related searches, title-based product recommendation, bid-phrase suggestion, amongst others. In this paper, we propose Gandalf, a graph induced data augmentation based on label features, such that the generated data-points can supplement the training distribution. By exploiting the characteristics of the short-text XMC problem, it leverages the label features to construct valid training instances, and uses the label graph for generating the corresponding soft-label targets, hence effectively capturing the label-label correlations. While most recent advances (such as SiameseXML and ECLARE) in XMC have been algorithmic, mainly aimed towards developing novel deep-learning architectures, our data-centric augmentation approach is orthogonal to these methodologies. We demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of Gandalf by showing up to 30% relative improvements for 5 state-of-the-art algorithms across 4 benchmark datasets consisting of up to 1.3 million labels.

The goal in XMC often is to maximize either precision or recall of the top-ranked\npredictions, which can be achieved by reducing the multilabel problem into a series of binary (One-vs-All) or multiclass\n(Pick-all-Labels) problems. Missing labels are a ubiquitous phenomenon in XMC tasks, yet the interaction between missing\nlabels and multilabel reductions has hitherto only been investigated for the case of One-vs-All reduction. In this\npaper, we close this gap by providing unbiased estimates for general (non-decomposable) multilabel losses, which enables\nunbiased estimates of the Pick-all-Labels reduction, as well as the normalized reductions which are required for\nconsistency with the recall metric. We show that these estimators suffer from increased variance and may lead to\nill-posed optimization problems. To address this issue, we propose to use convex upper bounds which trade off an\nincrease in bias against a strong decrease in variance."}}

The framework of XC has been widely employed in web applications such as automatic labeling of web-encyclopedia, prediction of related searches, and recommendation systems. While most state-of-the-art models in XC achieve high overall accuracy by performing well on the frequently occurring labels, they perform poorly on a large number of infrequent (tail) labels. This arises from two statistical challenges, (i) missing labels, as it is virtually impossible to manually assign every relevant label to an instance, and (ii) highly imbalanced data distribution where a large fraction of labels are tail labels. In this work, we consider common loss functions that decompose over labels, and calculate unbiased estimates that compensate missing labels according to Natarajan et\u00a0al. [26]. This turns out to be disadvantageous from an optimization perspective, as important properties such as convexity and lower-boundedness are lost. To circumvent this problem, we use the fact that typical loss functions in XC are convex surrogates of the 0-1 loss, and thus propose to switch to convex surrogates of its unbiased version. These surrogates are further adapted to the label imbalance by combining with label-frequency-based rebalancing. We show that the proposed loss functions can be easily incorporated into various different frameworks for extreme classification. This includes (i) linear classifiers, such as DiSMEC, on sparse input data representation, (ii) attention-based deep architecture, AttentionXML, learnt on dense Glove embeddings, and (iii) XLNet-based transformer model for extreme classification, APLC-XLNet. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements over the respective vanilla baseline models, on the propensity-scored metrics for precision and nDCG."}}

Missing labels are a ubiquitous phenomenon in extreme multi-label classification (XMC) tasks, such as matching Wikipedia articles to a small subset out of the hundreds of thousands of possible tags, where no human annotator can possibly check the validity of all the negative samples. For this reason, propensity-scored precision -- an unbiased estimate for precision-at-k under a known noise model -- has become one of the standard metrics in XMC. Few methods take this problem into account already during the training phase, and all are limited to loss functions that can be decomposed into a sum of contributions from each individual label. A typical approach to training is to reduce the multilabel problem into a series of binary or multiclass problems, and it has been shown that if the surrogate task should be consistent for optimizing recall, the resulting loss function is not decomposable over labels. Therefore, this paper derives the unique unbiased estimators for the different multilabel reductions, including the non-decomposable ones. These estimators suffer from increased variance and may lead to ill-posed optimization problems, which we address by switching to convex upper-bounds. The theoretical considerations are further supplemented by an experimental study showing that the switch to unbiased estimators significantly alters the bias-variance trade-off and may thus require stronger regularization, which in some cases can negate the benefits of unbiased estimation."}}
