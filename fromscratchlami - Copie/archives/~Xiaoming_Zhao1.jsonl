Specifically, a set of 3D locations within the view-frustum of the camera are first projected independently onto the image and a corresponding feature is subsequently extracted for each 3D location. The feature of each 3D location is then used to classify independently whether the corresponding 3D point is inside or outside the observed object. This procedure leads to sub-optimal results because correlations between predictions for neighboring locations are only taken into account implicitly via the extracted features. For more accurate results we propose the occupancy planes (OPlanes) representation, which enables to formulate single-view RGB-D human reconstruction as occupancy prediction on planes which slice through the camera's view frustum. Such a representation provides more flexibility than voxel grids and enables to better leverage correlations than per-point classification. On the challenging S3D data we observe a simple classifier based on the OPlanes representation to yield compelling results, especially in difficult situations with partial occlusions due to other objects and partial visibility, which haven't been addressed by prior work."}}

Specifically, classical methods for texture generation often assume clean geometry and reasonably well-aligned image data. While very recent methods, e.g., adversarial texture optimization, better handle lower-quality data obtained from hand-held devices, we find them to still struggle frequently. To improve robustness, particularly of recent adversarial texture optimization, we develop an explicit initialization and an alignment procedure. It deals with complex geometry due to a robust mapping of the geometry to the texture map and a hard-assignment-based initialization. It deals with misalignment of geometry and images by integrating fast image-alignment into the texture refinement optimization. We demonstrate efficacy of our texture generation on a dataset of 11 scenes with a total of 2807 frames, observing 7.8% and 11.1% relative improvements regarding perceptual and sharpness measurements."}}

To answer this question, we modify a classical GAN,\u00a0i.e.,\u00a0StyleGANv2, as little as possible. We find that only two modifications are absolutely necessary: 1) a multiplane image style generator branch which produces a set of alpha maps conditioned on their depth; 2) a pose-conditioned discriminator. We refer to the generated output as a \u2018generative multiplane image\u2019 (GMPI) and emphasize that its renderings are not only high-quality but also guaranteed to be view-consistent, which makes GMPIs different from many prior works. Importantly, the number of alpha maps can be dynamically adjusted and can differ between training and inference, alleviating memory concerns and enabling fast training of GMPIs in less than half a day at a resolution of $$1024^2$$ . Our findings are consistent across three challenging and common high-resolution datasets, including FFHQ, AFHQv2\u00a0and MetFaces."}}
