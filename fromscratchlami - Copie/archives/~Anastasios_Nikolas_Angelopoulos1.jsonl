Our analysis tackles both regression and classification problems, characterizing when and how it is possible to construct uncertainty sets that correctly cover the unobserved noiseless ground truth labels. Through stylized theoretical examples and practical experiments, we argue that na\u00efve conformal prediction covers the noiseless ground truth label unless the noise distribution is adversarially designed. This leads us to believe that correcting for label noise is unnecessary except for pathological data distributions or noise sources. In such cases, we can also correct for noise of bounded size in the conformal prediction algorithm in order to ensure correct coverage of the ground truth labels without score or data regularity."}}

For example, in the protein design problem, we have a regression model that predicts some real-valued property of a protein sequence, which we use to propose new sequences believed to exhibit higher property values than observed in the training data. Since validating designed sequences in the wet lab is typically costly, it is important to know how much we can trust the model's predictions. In such settings, however, there is a distinct type of distribution shift between the training and test data: one where the training and test data are statistically dependent, as the latter is chosen based on the former. Consequently, the model's error on the test data -- that is, the designed sequences -- has some non-trivial relationship with its error on the training data. Herein, we introduce a method to quantify predictive uncertainty in such settings. We do so by constructing confidence sets for predictions that account for the dependence between the training and test data. The confidence sets we construct have finite-sample guarantees that hold for any prediction algorithm, even when a trained model chooses the test-time input distribution. As a motivating use case, we demonstrate how our method quantifies uncertainty for the predicted fitness of designed protein using several real data sets."}}

We present a framework that treats these two desiderata jointly. Our framework is based on conformal prediction, a methodology that augments predictive models to return prediction sets that provide uncertainty quantification -- they provably cover the true response with a user-specified probability, such as 90%. One might hope that when used with privately-trained models, conformal prediction would yield privacy guarantees for the resulting prediction sets; unfortunately this is not the case. To remedy this key problem, we develop a method that takes any pre-trained predictive model and outputs differentially private prediction sets. Our method follows the general approach of split conformal prediction; we use holdout data to calibrate the size of the prediction sets but preserve privacy by using a privatized quantile subroutine. This subroutine compensates for the noise introduced to preserve privacy in order to guarantee correct coverage. We evaluate the method on large-scale computer vision datasets."}}

Distribution-free uncertainty quantification (distribution-free UQ) is a user-friendly paradigm for creating statistically rigorous confidence intervals/sets for such predictions. Critically, the intervals/sets are valid without distributional assumptions or model assumptions, with explicit guarantees with finitely many datapoints. Moreover, they adapt to the difficulty of the input; when the input example is difficult, the uncertainty intervals/sets are large, signaling that the model might be wrong. Without much work, one can use distribution-free methods on any underlying algorithm, such as a neural network, to produce confidence sets guaranteed to contain the ground truth with a user-specified probability, such as 90%. Indeed, the methods are easy-to-understand and general, applying to many modern prediction problems arising in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, and so on. This hands-on introduction is aimed at a reader interested in the practical implementation of distribution-free UQ, including conformal prediction and related methods, who is not necessarily a statistician. We will include many explanatory illustrations, examples, and code samples in Python, with PyTorch syntax. The goal is to provide the reader a working understanding of distribution-free UQ, allowing them to put confidence intervals on their algorithms, with one self-contained document."}}

The framework addresses, among other examples, false discovery rate control in multi-label classification, intersection-over-union control in instance segmentation, and the simultaneous control of the type-1 error of outlier detection and confidence set coverage in classification or regression. To accomplish this, we solve a key technical challenge: the control of arbitrary risks that are not necessarily monotonic. Our main insight is to reframe the risk-control problem as multiple hypothesis testing, enabling techniques and mathematical arguments different from those in the previous literature. We use our framework to provide new calibration methods for several core machine learning tasks with detailed worked examples in computer vision."}}

Deploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating and communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise uncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued predictions from a black-box predictor that controls the expected loss on future test points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit finite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate the size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple, distribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it in five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems where some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label classification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3) classification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4) image segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an object of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Last, we discuss extensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning, and distributionally robust learning."}}
