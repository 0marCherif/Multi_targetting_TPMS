However, for ease of annotation, several long documents in Ontonotes were split into smaller parts. In this work, we build a corpus of coreference-annotated documents of significantly longer length than what is currently available. We do so by providing an accurate, manually-curated, merging of annotations from documents that were split into multiple parts in the original Ontonotes annotation process. The resulting corpus, which we call LongtoNotes contains documents in multiple genres of the English language with varying lengths, the longest of which are up to 8x the length of documents in Ontonotes, and 2x those in Litbank. We evaluate state-of-the-art neural coreference systems on this new corpus, analyze the relationships between model architectures/hyperparameters and document length on performance and efficiency of the models, and demonstrate areas of improvement in long-document coreference modeling revealed by our new corpus. Our data and code is available at: https://github.com/kumar-shridhar/LongtoNotes."}}

This is especially true of news stories shared on social media since they don't undergo any stringent journalistic checking associated with main stream media. Given the inherent human tendency to share information with their social connections at a mouse-click, fake news articles masquerading as real ones, tend to spread widely and virally. The presence of echo chambers (people sharing same beliefs) in social networks, only adds to this problem of wide-spread existence of fake news on social media. In this paper, we tackle the problem of fake news detection from social media by exploiting the very presence of echo chambers that exist within the social network of users to obtain an efficient and informative latent representation of the news article. By modeling the echo-chambers as closely-connected communities within the social network, we represent a news article as a 3-mode tensor of the structure - <News, User, Community> and propose a tensor factorization based method to encode the news article in a latent embedding space preserving the community structure. We also propose an extension of the above method, which jointly models the community and content information of the news article through a coupled matrix-tensor factorization framework. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our method for the task of Fake News Detection over two real-world datasets. Further, we validate the generalization of the resulting embeddings over two other auxiliary tasks, namely: \\textbf{1)} News Cohort Analysis and \\textbf{2)} Collaborative News Recommendation. Our proposed method outperforms appropriate baselines for both the tasks, establishing its generalization."}}

While many strategies already exist for CBM, this paper presents a novel pattern analysis framework, which focuses on improving reliability of real-time fault detection. The introduced framework is based upon a novel feature selection method, which selects good, reliable, and consistent features. Graphical indices are proposed in this paper which try and quantify the goodness of features and accordingly rank them for the feature selection procedure. The presented algorithm also takes into account the possibility of corrupt data creeping in during data collection, and takes necessary steps to discard them. Additionally, novel methods for organizing training data and a method for sensitive position identification for placing sensor(s) have also been introduced, for further improving the quality of selected features. To validate the framework, experiments have been performed on an air compressor for real-time detection of leakage inlet valve fault and leakage outlet valve fault, and also on an induction motor for detecting presence of faulty bearings. The findings clearly show substantial improvement in fault detection performance and confirm the effectiveness of proposed framework."}}

The performance of such systems immensely relies upon the quality of features extracted and the classifier model learned. Traditionally features were handcrafted, where engineers would manually design them with statistical parameters and signal transforms based energy distribution analysis. Recently, deep learning techniques have shown new ways of obtaining useful feature representation that provide state of the art results in image and speech processing applications. This paper first presents a brief survey of traditional handcrafted features and later presents a short analysis of handcrafted features v/s features learned by deep neural networks (DNN), for doing fault diagnosis. The DNN based features in this paper were generated in 3 phases: 1) extracted handcrafted features using traditional techniques 2) initialized the weights of DNN by learning de-noising sparse auto-encoders with the handcrafted features in unsupervised fashion and 3) applied two generic fine tuning heuristics that tailor DNN's weights to give good classification performance. The experimentation and analysis were performed on 5 datasets: one each on Air compressor monitoring, Drill bit monitoring and Steel plate monitoring, and two on bearing fault monitoring data. The results clearly show the prospects of DNN obtaining good feature representations and good classification performance. Further, it also finds that Fast Fourier Transform based features with DNN are more suited for Support Vector Machine as classifier than Random Forest."}}
