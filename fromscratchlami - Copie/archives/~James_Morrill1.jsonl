However just like RNNs, training Neural CDEs can be difficult for long time series. Here, we propose to apply a technique drawn from stochastic analysis, namely the log-ODE method. Instead of using the original input sequence, our procedure summarises the information over local time intervals via the log-signature map, and uses the resulting shorter stream of log-signatures as the new input. This represents a length/channel trade-off. In doing so we demonstrate efficacy on problems of length up to 17k observations and observe significant training speed-ups, improvements in model performance, and reduced memory requirements compared to the existing algorithm."}}

However it has previously suffered from a number of limitations, such as being limited to regularly-spaced fully-observed time series, and having to choose between efficient training and interpretability. Here, we extend the method to continuous time, and in doing so handle the general case of irregularly-sampled partially-observed multivariate time series. Furthermore, we show that a simple regularisation penalty may be used to train efficiently without sacrificing interpretability. The continuous-time formulation additionally allows for learning the length of each shapelet (previously a discrete object) in a differentiable manner. Finally, we demonstrate that the measure of similarity between time series may be generalised to a learnt pseudometric. We validate our method by demonstrating its performance and interpretability on several datasets; for example we discover (purely from data) that the digits 5 and 6 may be distinguished by the chirality of their bottom loop, and that a kind of spectral gap exists in spoken audio classification."}}

However, a fundamental issue is that the solution to an ordinary differential equation is determined by its initial condition, and there is no mechanism for adjusting the trajectory based on subsequent observations. Here, we demonstrate how this may be resolved through the well-understood mathematics of \\emph{controlled differential equations}. The resulting \\emph{neural controlled differential equation} model is directly applicable to the general setting of partially-observed irregularly-sampled multivariate time series, and (unlike previous work on this problem) it may utilise memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation even across observations. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance against similar (ODE or RNN based) models in empirical studies on a range of datasets. Finally we provide theoretical results demonstrating universal approximation, and that our model subsumes alternative ODE models."}}
{"id": "B0cpfK8cD3f", "cdate": 1577836800000, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "A Generalised Signature Method for Time Series", "abstract": "The 'signature method' refers to a collection of feature extraction techniques for multivariate time series, derived from the theory of controlled differential equations. There is a great deal of flexibility as to how this method can be applied. On the one hand, this flexibility allows the method to be tailored to specific problems, but on the other hand, can make precise application challenging. This paper makes two contributions. First, the variations on the signature method are unified into a general approach, the \\emph{generalised signature method}, of which previous variations are special cases. A primary aim of this unifying framework is to make the signature method more accessible to any machine learning practitioner, whereas it is now mostly used by specialists. Second, and within this framework, we derive a canonical collection of choices that provide a domain-agnostic starting point. We derive these choices as a result of an extensive empirical study on 26 datasets and go on to show competitive performance against current benchmarks for multivariate time series classification. Finally, to ease practical application, we make our techniques available as part of the open-source [redacted] project."}}
