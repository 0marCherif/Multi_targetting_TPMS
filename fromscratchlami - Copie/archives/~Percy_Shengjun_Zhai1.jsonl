However, in many modern applications, e.g., those involving EEG and fMRI data, the observations are more appropriately modeled as multivariate random functions rather than vectors. Functional graphical models have been proposed to model the conditional independence structure of such functional data. We propose a neighborhood selection approach to estimate the structure of Gaussian functional graphical models, where we first estimate the neighborhood of each node via a function-on-function regression, and subsequently recover the entire graph structure by combining the estimated neighborhoods. Our approach only requires assumptions on the conditional distributions of random functions and we estimate the conditional independence structure directly. We thus circumvent the need for a well-defined precision operator that may not exist when the functions are infinite dimensional. In addition, the neighborhood selection approach is computationally efficient and can be easily parallelized. The statistical consistency of our proposed method in the high-dimensional setting is supported by both theory and experimental results. In addition, we study the effect of the choice of the function basis used for dimensionality reduction in an intermediate step. We give a criterion for choosing a function basis and motivate two practically useful choices, which we justify by both theory and experiments."}}
