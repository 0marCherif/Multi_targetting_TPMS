However, many existing methods are training-required. They need to train a time-dependent classifier or a condition-dependent score estimator, which increases the cost of constructing conditional diffusion models and is inconvenient to transfer across different conditions. Some current works aim to overcome this limitation by proposing training-free solutions, but most can only be applied to a specific category of tasks and not to more general conditions. In this work, we propose a training-Free conditional Diffusion Model (FreeDoM) used for various conditions. Specifically, we leverage off-the-shelf pre-trained networks, such as a face detection model, to construct time-independent energy functions, which guide the generation process without requiring training. Furthermore, because the construction of the energy function is very flexible and adaptable to various conditions, our proposed FreeDoM has a broader range of applications than existing training-free methods. FreeDoM is advantageous in its simplicity, effectiveness, and low cost. Experiments demonstrate that FreeDoM is effective for various conditions and suitable for diffusion models of diverse data domains, including image and latent code domains."}}

In this work, we propose the Denoising Diffusion Null-Space Model (DDNM), a novel zero-shot framework for arbitrary linear IR problems, including but not limited to image super-resolution, colorization, inpainting, compressed sensing, and deblurring. DDNM only needs a pre-trained off-the-shelf diffusion model as the generative prior, without any extra training or network modifications. By refining only the null-space contents during the reverse diffusion process, we can yield diverse results satisfying both data consistency and realness. We further propose an enhanced and robust version, dubbed DDNM+, to support noisy restoration and improve restoration quality for hard tasks. Our experiments on several IR tasks reveal that DDNM outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot IR methods. We also demonstrate that DDNM+ can solve complex real-world applications, e.g., old photo restoration. "}}

While the realness has been dramatically improved with the use of GAN prior, the state-of-the-art methods still suffer inconsistencies in local structures and colors (e.g., tooth and eyes). In this paper, we show that these inconsistencies can be analytically eliminated by learning only the null-space component while fixing the range-space part. Further, we design a pooling-based decomposition (PD), a universal range-null space decomposition for super-resolution tasks, which is concise, fast, and parameter-free. PD can be easily applied to state-of-the-art GAN Prior based SR methods to eliminate their inconsistencies, neither compromising the realness nor bringing extra parameters or computational costs. Besides, our ablation studies reveal that PD can replace pixel-wise losses for training and achieve better generalization performance when facing unseen downsamplings or even real-world degradation. Experiments show that the use of PD refreshes state-of-the-art SR performance and speeds up the convergence of training up to 2~10 times."}}

However, these methods usually struggle to balance realness and fidelity when facing various degradation levels. Besides, there is still a noticeable visual quality gap compared with pre-trained GAN models. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN Prior based degradation-aware feature interpolation network, dubbed Panini-Net, for FR tasks by explicitly learning the abstract representations to distinguish various degradations. Specifically, an unsupervised degradation representation learning (UDRL) strategy is first developed to extract degradation representations (DR) of the input degraded images. Then, a degradation-aware feature interpolation (DAFI) module is proposed to dynamically fuse the two types of informative features (i.e., features from input images and features from GAN Prior) with flexible adaption to various degradations based on DR. Ablation studies reveal the working mechanism of DAFI and its potential for editable FR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Panini-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance for multi-degradation face restoration and face super-resolution.

However, as an important part of the immersive experiences, the defocus effects have not been fully explored within NeRF. Some recent NeRF-based methods generate 3D defocus effects in a post-process fashion by utilizing multiplane technology. Still, they are either time-consuming or memory-consuming. This paper proposes a novel thin-lens-imaging-based NeRF framework that can directly render various 3D defocus effects, dubbed NeRFocus. Unlike the pinhole, the thin lens refracts rays of a scene point, so its imaging on the sensor plane is scattered as a circle of confusion (CoC). A direct solution sampling enough rays to approximate this process is computationally expensive. Instead, we propose to inverse the thin lens imaging to explicitly model the beam path for each point on the sensor plane and generalize this paradigm to the beam path of each pixel, then use the frustum-based volume rendering to render each pixel's beam path. We further design an efficient probabilistic training (p-training) strategy to simplify the training process vastly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our NeRFocus can achieve various 3D defocus effects with adjustable camera pose, focus distance, and aperture size. Existing NeRF can be regarded as our special case by setting aperture size as zero to render large depth-of-field images. Despite such merits, NeRFocus does not sacrifice NeRF's original performance (e.g., training and inference time, parameter consumption, rendering quality), which implies its great potential for broader application and further improvement.
