Recent studies have shown that a carefully trained ERM gives good performance in Domain Generalization (DG), with train samples from all domains randomly shuffled in each batch of training. Furthermore, Later studies have shown DG specific methods to boost the test performance of neural networks under distribution shift without training data being explicitly annotated with domain information. This observation is counterintuitive as the studies on the failure cases of OOD has shown that, without being trained with domain knowledge, neural networks will fit domain specific features for reducing train loss. We present a new setting beyond the Traditional DG (TDG) called the Class-wise DG (CWDG), where for each class, we randomly select one of the domains and keep it aside for testing. Despite being exposed to all domains during training, our experiments show that the performance of the neural network drops in this framework compared to TDG. We evaluate popular DG methods and show that the performance of different methods under TDG and CWDG setting are not correlated. Finally, we propose a novel method called Iterative Domain Feature Masking (IDFM) which uses domain annotations in the train data, achieving state-of-the-art results on the proposed benchmark. \n"}}

The idea is to exploit the label hierarchy (e.g., the WordNet ontology) and consider graph distances as a proxy for mistake severity. Surprisingly, on examining mistake-severity distributions of the top-1 prediction, we find that current state-of-the-art hierarchy-aware deep classifiers do not always show practical improvement over the standard cross-entropy baseline in making better mistakes. The reason for the reduction in average mistake-severity can be attributed to the increase in low-severity mistakes, which may also explain the noticeable drop in their accuracy. To this end, we use the classical Conditional Risk Minimization (CRM) framework for hierarchy-aware classification. Given a cost matrix and a reliable estimate of likelihoods (obtained from a trained network), CRM simply amends mistakes at inference time; it needs no extra hyperparameters and requires adding just a few lines of code to the standard cross-entropy baseline. It significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art and consistently obtains large reductions in the average hierarchical distance of top-$k$ predictions across datasets, with very little loss in accuracy. CRM, because of its simplicity, can be used with any off-the-shelf trained model that provides reliable likelihood estimates."}}

Addressing RIS efficiently requires considering the interactions happening across visual and linguistic modalities and the interactions within each modality. Existing methods are limited because they either compute different forms of interactions sequentially (leading to error propagation) or ignore intramodal interactions. We address this limitation by performing all three interactions simultaneously through a Synchronous Multi-Modal Fusion Module (SFM). Moreover, to produce refined segmentation masks, we propose a novel Hierarchical Cross-Modal Aggregation Module (HCAM), where linguistic features facilitate the exchange of contextual information across the visual hierarchy. We present thorough ablation studies and validate our approach's performance on four benchmark datasets, showing considerable performance gains over the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automatic colorization of graphic arts like graphic patterns, info-graphics and cartoons. Our approach uses the artist's colored graphics as a reference to color a template image. We also propose a retrieval system for selecting a relevant reference image corresponding to the given template from a dataset of reference images colored by different artists. Finally, we formulate the problem of colorization as a optimal graph matching problem over color groups in the reference and the template image. We demonstrate results on a variety of coloring tasks and evaluate our model through multiple perceptual studies. The studies show that the results generated through our model are significantly preferred by the participants over other automatic colorization methods."}}

Data-driven efforts have dominated the landscape since the introduction of deep neural network architectures. In deep learning research, the choices in architecture design are often empirical and frequently lead to more complex models than necessary. The complexity, in turn, hinders the application requirements. In this paper, we identify four key components of saliency models, i.e., input features, multi-level integration, readout architecture, and loss functions. We review the existing state of the art models on these four components and propose novel and simpler alternatives. As a result, we propose two novel end-to-end architectures called SimpleNet and MDNSal, which are neater, minimal, more interpretable and achieve state of the art performance on public saliency benchmarks. SimpleNet is an optimized encoder-decoder architecture and brings notable performance gains on the SALICON dataset (the largest saliency benchmark). MDNSal is a parametric model that directly predicts parameters of a GMM distribution and is aimed to bring more interpretability to the prediction maps. The proposed saliency models can be inferred at 25fps, making them suitable for real-time applications. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/samyak0210/saliency."}}

In this work, we remove the need for annotated datasets by proposing an unsupervised re-identification network, thus sidestepping the labeling costs entirely, required for training. Given unlabeled videos, our proposed method (SimpleReID) first generates tracking labels using SORT and trains a ReID network to predict the generated labels using crossentropy loss. We demonstrate that SimpleReID performs substantially better than simpler alternatives, and we recover the full performance of its supervised counterpart consistently across diverse tracking frameworks. The observations are unusual because unsupervised ReID is not expected to excel in crowded scenarios with occlusions, and drastic viewpoint changes. By incorporating our unsupervised SimpleReID with CenterTrack trained on augmented still images, we establish a new state-of-the-art performance on popular datasets like MOT16/17 without using tracking supervision, beating current best (CenterTrack) by 0.2-0.3 MOTA and 4.4-4.8 IDF1 scores. We further provide evidence for limited scope for improvement in IDF1 scores beyond our unsupervised ReID in the studied settings. Our investigation suggests reconsideration towards more sophisticated, supervised, end-to-end trackers by showing promise in simpler unsupervised alternatives."}}

Eye-gaze has been effectively employed in computational applications as a cue to capture interesting scene content; we employ gaze as a proxy to select shots for inclusion in the edited video. Given the original video, scene content and user eye-gaze tracks are combined to generate an edited video comprising cinematically valid actor shots and shot transitions to generate an aesthetic and vivid representation of the original narrative. We model cinematic video editing as an energy minimization problem over shot selection, whose constraints capture cinematographic editing conventions. Gazed scene locations primarily determine the shots constituting the edited video. Effectiveness of GAZED against multiple competing methods is demonstrated via a psychophysical study involving 12 users and twelve performance videos."}}

Most common filtering techniques do reduce the irregularities in data; however, they fail to mimic the behavior of a human cameraman. Global filtering methods modeling human camera operators have been successful; however, they are limited to offline settings. In this paper, we propose two online filtering methods called Cinefilters, which produce smooth camera trajectories that are motivated by cinematographic principles. The first filter (CineConvex) uses a sliding windowbased convex optimization formulation, and the second (CineCNN) is a CNN based encoder-decoder model. We evaluate the proposed filters in two different settings, namely a basketball dataset and a stage performance dataset. Our models outperform previous methods and baselines on quantitative metrics. The CineConvex and CineCNN filters operate at about 250fps and 1000fps, respectively, with a minor latency (half a second), making them apt for a variety of real-time applications."}}

In this paper, we present a method to reliably detect such obstacles through a multi-modal framework of sparse LiDAR(VLP-16) and Monocular vision. LiDAR is employed to provide additional context in the form of confidence maps to monocular segmentation networks. We show significant performance gains when the context is fed as an additional input to monocular semantic segmentation frameworks. We further present a new semantic segmentation dataset to the community, comprising of over 3000 image frames with corresponding LiDAR observations. The images come with pixel-wise annotations of three classes off-road, road, and small obstacle. We stress that precise calibration between LiDAR and camera is crucial for this task and thus propose a novel Hausdorff distance based calibration refinement method over extrinsic parameters. As a first benchmark over this dataset, we report our results with 73% instance detection up to a distance of 50 meters on challenging scenarios. Qualitatively by showcasing accurate segmentation of obstacles less than 15 cms at 50m depth and quantitatively through favourable comparisons vis a vis prior art, we vindicate the method's efficacy.
