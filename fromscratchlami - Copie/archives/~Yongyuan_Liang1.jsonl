However, when deploying trained communicative agents in a real-world application where noise and potential attackers exist, the safety of communication-based policies becomes a severe issue that is underexplored. Specifically, if communication messages are manipulated by malicious attackers, agents relying on untrustworthy communication may take unsafe actions that lead to catastrophic consequences. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that agents will not be misled by corrupted communication, while still benefiting from benign communication. In this work, we consider an environment with $N$ agents, where the attacker may arbitrarily change the communication from any $C<\\frac{N-1}{2}$ agents to a victim agent. For this strong threat model, we propose a certifiable defense by constructing a message-ensemble policy that aggregates multiple randomly ablated message sets. Theoretical analysis shows that this message-ensemble policy can utilize benign communication while being certifiably robust to adversarial communication, regardless of the attacking algorithm. Experiments in multiple environments verify that our defense significantly improves the robustness of trained policies against various types of attacks."}}

Inspired by experience sharing in human groups, learning knowledge parallel reusing between agents can potentially promote team learning performance, especially in multi-task environments. When all agents interact with the environment and learn simultaneously, how each independent agent selectively learns from other agents' behavior knowledge is a problem that we need to solve. This paper proposes a novel knowledge transfer framework in MARL, PAT (Parallel Attentional Transfer). We design two acting modes in PAT, student mode and self-learning mode. Each agent in our approach trains a decentralized student actor-critic to determine its acting mode at each time step. When agents are unfamiliar with the environment, the shared attention mechanism in student mode effectively selects learning knowledge from other agents to decide agents' actions. PAT outperforms state-of-the-art empirical evaluation results against the prior advising approaches. Our approach not only significantly improves team learning rate and global performance, but also is flexible and transferable to be applied in various multi-agent systems."}}
