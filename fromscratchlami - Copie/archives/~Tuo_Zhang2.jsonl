In this paper,  we observe that the cosine similarity of the last layer's weight between the global model and each local update could be used effectively as an indicator of malicious model updates. Therefore, we propose CosDefense, a cosine-similarity-based attacker detection algorithm. Specifically, under CosDefense, the server calculates the cosine similarity score of the last layer's weight between the global model and each client update, labels malicious clients whose score is much higher than the average, and filters them out of the model aggregation in each round. Compared to existing defense schemes, CosDefense does not require any extra information besides the received model updates to operate and is compatible with client sampling. Experiment results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CosDefense could provide robust performance under the state-of-the-art FL poisoning attack."}}

Moreover, the availability of each client to join the training is highly variable over time due to system heterogeneities and intermittent connectivity. Recent asynchronous FL methods (e.g., FedBuff [22]) have been proposed to overcome these issues by allowing slower users to continue their work on local training based on stale models and to contribute to aggregation when ready. However, we show empirically that this method can lead to a substantial drop in training accuracy as well as a slower convergence rate. The primary reason is that fast-speed devices contribute to many more rounds of aggregation while others join more intermittently or not at all, and with stale model updates. To overcome this barrier, we propose TimelyFL, a heterogeneity-aware asynchronous FL framework with adaptive partial training. During the training, TimelyFL adjusts the local training workload based on the real-time resource capabilities of each client, aiming to allow more available clients to join in the global update without staleness. We demonstrate the performance benefits of TimelyFL by conducting extensive experiments on various datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, Google Speech, and Reddit) and models (e.g., ResNet20, VGG11, and ALBERT). In comparison with the state-of-the-art (i.e., FedBuff), our evaluations reveal that TimelyFL improves participation rate by 21.13%, harvests 1.28\u00d7 - 2.89\u00d7 more efficiency on convergence rate, and provides a 6.25% increment on test accuracy."}}

It is, however, known that different layers of neural networks can have a different degree of model discrepancy across the clients. The conventional full aggregation scheme does not consider such a difference and synchronizes the whole model parameters at once, resulting in inefficient network bandwidth consumption. Aggregating the parameters that are similar across the clients does not make meaningful training progress while increasing the communication cost. We propose FedLAMA, a layer-wise adaptive model aggregation scheme for scalable FL. FedLAMA adjusts the aggregation interval in a layer-wise manner, jointly considering the model discrepancy and the communication cost. This fine-grained aggregation strategy enables to reduce the communication cost without significantly harming the model accuracy. Our extensive empirical study shows that, as the aggregation interval increases, FedLAMA shows a remarkably smaller accuracy drop than the periodic full aggregation, while achieving comparable communication efficiency."}}

At its core, GPT-FL leverages generative pre-trained models to generate diversified synthetic data. These generated data are used to train a downstream model on the server, which is then fine-tuned with private client data under the standard FL framework. We show that GPT-FL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in terms of model test accuracy, communication efficiency, and client sampling efficiency. Through comprehensive ablation analysis, we discover that the downstream model generated by synthetic data plays a crucial role in controlling the direction of gradient diversity during FL training, which enhances convergence speed and contributes to the notable accuracy boost observed with GPT-FL. Also, regardless of whether the target data falls within or outside the domain of the pre-trained generative model, GPT-FL consistently achieves significant performance gains, surpassing the results obtained by models trained solely with FL or synthetic data."}}

With the growth of IoT devices, vast quantities of data that may contain users' private information will be generated. The high communication and storage costs, mixed with privacy concerns, will increasingly challenge the traditional eco-system of centralized over-the-cloud learning and processing for IoT platforms. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as the most promising alternative approach to this problem. In FL, training data-driven machine learning models is an act of collaboration between multiple clients without requiring the data to be brought to a central point, hence alleviating communication and storage costs and providing a great degree of user-level privacy. However, there are still some challenges existing in the real FL system implementation on IoT networks. In this article, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of FL in IoT platforms, as well as how it can enable diverse IoT applications. In particular, we identify and discuss seven critical challenges of FL in IoT platforms and highlight some recent promising approaches toward addressing them."}}
