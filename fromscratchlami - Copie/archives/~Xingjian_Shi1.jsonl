Theoretically, we show that attention models in different domains are equivalent under linear conditions (i.e., linear kernel to attention scores). Empirically, we analyze how attention models of different domains show different behaviors through various synthetic experiments with seasonality, trend and noise, with emphasis on the role of softmax operation therein. Both these theoretical and empirical analyses motivate us to propose a new method: TDformer (Trend Decomposition Transformer), that first applies seasonal-trend decomposition, and then additively combines an MLP which predicts the trend component with Fourier attention which predicts the seasonal component to obtain the final prediction.

In this paper, we propose LayoutDiffuse that adapts a foundational diffusion model pretrained on large-scale image or text-image datasets for layout-to-image generation. By adopting a novel neural adaptor based on layout attention and task-aware prompts, our method trains efficiently, generates images with both high perceptual quality and layout alignment, and needs less data. Experiments on three datasets show that our method significantly outperforms other 10 generative models based on GANs, VQ-VAE, and diffusion models."}}

Several strategies (e.g., Adapters, prefix tuning, BitFit, and LoRA) have been proposed. However, their designs are hand-crafted separately, and it remains unclear whether certain design patterns exist for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Thus, we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning design paradigm and discover design patterns that are applicable to different experimental settings. Instead of focusing on designing another individual tuning strategy, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning design spaces that parameterize tuning structures and tuning strategies. Specifically, any design space is characterized by four components: layer grouping, trainable parameter allocation, tunable groups, and strategy assignment. Starting from an initial design space, we progressively refine the space based on the model quality of each design choice and make greedy selection at each stage over these four components. We discover the following design patterns: (i) group layers in a spindle pattern; (ii) allocate the number of trainable parameters to layers uniformly; (iii) tune all the groups; (iv) assign proper tuning strategies to different groups. These design patterns result in new parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. We show experimentally that these methods consistently and significantly outperform investigated parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies across different backbone models and different tasks in natural language processing."}}

To help improve the applicability and performance of deep learning models on these geospatial tasks, various works have begun investigating foundation models for this domain. Researchers have explored two prominent approaches for introducing such models in geospatial applications, but both have drawbacks in terms of limited performance benefit or prohibitive training cost. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel paradigm for building highly effective geospatial foundation models with minimal resource cost and carbon impact. We first construct a compact yet diverse dataset from multiple sources to promote feature diversity, which we term GeoPile. Then, we investigate the potential of continual pretraining from large-scale ImageNet-22k models and propose a multi-objective continual pretraining paradigm, which leverages the strong representations of ImageNet while simultaneously providing the freedom to learn valuable in-domain features. Our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art geospatial pretraining methods in an extensive evaluation on seven downstream datasets covering various tasks such as change detection, classification, multi-label classification, semantic segmentation, and super-resolution."}}

However, the robustness of such foundation models against distribution shifts is crucial in downstream applications.  In this paper, we investigate their robustness under image and text perturbations. We first build several multimodal benchmark datasets by applying 17 image perturbation and 16 text perturbation techniques. Then we extensively study the robustness of 6 widely adopted models on 3 downstream tasks (image-text retrieval, visual reasoning, and visual entailment). We observe that these powerful multimodal models are sensitive to image/text perturbations, especially to image perturbations. For text, character-level perturbations have shown higher adversarial impact than word-level and sentence-level perturbations.  We also observe that models trained by generative objectives tend to be more robust. Our findings in terms of robustness study could facilitate the development of large image-text models, as well as their deployment for real-world applications."}}

While there have been promising advances in designing neural networks to harness multimodal data, the enormous success of data augmentation currently remains limited to single-modality tasks like image classification. Indeed, it is particularly difficult to augment each modality while preserving the overall semantic structure of the data; for example, a caption may no longer be a good description of an image after standard augmentations have been applied, such as translation. Moreover, it is challenging to specify reasonable transformations that are not tailored to a particular modality. In this paper, we introduce LeMDA, Learning Multimodal Data Augmentation, an easy-to-use method that automatically learns to jointly augment multimodal data in feature space, with no constraints on the identities of the modalities or the relationship between modalities. We show that LeMDA can (1) profoundly improve the performance of multimodal deep learning architectures, (2) apply to combinations of modalities that have not been previously considered, and (3) achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of applications comprised of image, text, and tabular data."}}

In this work, we tackle the practical yet challenging test-time adaptation (TTA) problem, where a model adapts to the target domain without accessing the source data. We propose a simple recipe called data-efficient prompt tuning (DePT) with two key ingredients. First, DePT plugs visual prompts into the vision Transformer and only tunes these source-initialized prompts during adaptation. We find such parameter-efficient finetuning can efficiently adapt the model representation to the target domain without overfitting to the noise in the learning objective. Second, DePT bootstraps the source representation to the target domain by memory bank-based online pseudo labeling. A hierarchical self-supervised regularization specially designed for prompts is jointly optimized to alleviate error accumulation during self-training. With much fewer tunable parameters, DePT demonstrates not only state-of-the-art performance on major adaptation benchmarks, but also superior data efficiency, i.e., adaptation with only 1\\% or 10\\% data without much performance degradation compared to 100\\% data. In addition, DePT is also versatile to be extended to online or multi-source TTA settings."}}

With the explosive growth of spatiotemporal Earth observation data in the past decade, data-driven models that apply Deep Learning (DL) are demonstrating impressive potential for various Earth system forecasting tasks. The Transformer as an emerging DL architecture, despite its broad success in other domains, has limited adoption in this area. In this paper, we propose Earthformer, a space-time Transformer for Earth system forecasting. Earthformer is based on a generic, flexible and efficient space-time attention block, named Cuboid Attention. The idea is to decompose the data into cuboids and apply cuboid-level self-attention in parallel. These cuboids are further connected with a collection of global vectors. We conduct experiments on the MovingMNIST dataset and a newly proposed chaotic $N$-body MNIST dataset to verify the effectiveness of cuboid attention and figure out the best design of Earthformer. Experiments on two real-world benchmarks about precipitation nowcasting and El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasting show that Earthformer achieves state-of-the-art performance."}}
