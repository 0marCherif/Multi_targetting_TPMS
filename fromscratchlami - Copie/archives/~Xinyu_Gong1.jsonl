MMG aims to study how systems can generalize when data from certain modalities is limited or even completely missing. We thoroughly investigate MMG in the context of standard supervised action recognition and the more challenging few-shot setting for learning new action categories. MMG consists of two novel scenarios, designed to support security, and efficiency considerations in real-world applications: (1) missing modality generalization where some modalities that were present during the train time are missing during the inference time, and (2) cross-modal zero-shot generalization, where the modalities present during the inference time and the training time are disjoint. To enable this investigation, we construct a new dataset MMG-Ego4D containing data points with video, audio, and inertial motion sensor (IMU) modalities. Our dataset is derived from Ego4D dataset, but processed and thoroughly re-annotated by human experts to facilitate research in the MMG problem. We evaluate a diverse array of models on MMG-Ego4D and propose new methods with improved generalization ability. In particular, we introduce a new fusion module with modality dropout training, contrastive-based alignment training, and a novel cross-modal prototypical loss for better few-shot performance. We hope this study will serve as a benchmark and guide future research in multimodal generalization problems. The benchmark and code will be available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/MMG_Ego4D."}}

Its potential for editing/processing given signals remains less explored. This work explores a new intriguing direction: training a stylized implicit representation, using a generalized approach that can apply to various 2D and 3D scenarios. We conduct a pilot study on a variety of INRs, including 2D coordinate-based representation, signed distance function, and neural radiance field. Our solution is a Unified Implicit Neural Stylization framework, dubbed INS. In contrary to vanilla INR, INS decouples the ordinary implicit function into a style implicit module and a content implicit module, in order to separately encode the representations from the style image and input scenes. An amalgamation module is then applied to aggregate these information and synthesize the stylized output. To regularize the geometry in 3D scenes, we propose a novel self-distillation geometry consistency loss which preserves the geometry fidelity of the stylized scenes. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on multiple task settings, including fitting images using MLPs, stylization for implicit surfaces and sylized novel view synthesis using neural radiance. We further demonstrate that the learned representation is continuous not only spatially but also style-wise, leading to effortlessly interpolating between different styles and generating images with new mixed styles.

This paper carries out the exploration of self-supervised learning for object segmentation using NeRF for complex real-world scenes. Our framework, called NeRF with Self-supervised Object Segmentation (NeRF-SOS), couples object segmentation and neural radiance field to segment objects in any view within a scene. By proposing a novel collaborative contrastive loss in both appearance and geometry levels, NeRF-SOS encourages NeRF models to distill compact geometry-aware segmentation clusters from their density fields and the self-supervised pre-trained 2D visual features. The self-supervised object segmentation framework can be applied to various NeRF models that both lead to photo-realistic rendering results and convincing segmentation maps for both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Extensive results on the LLFF, BlendedMVS, CO3Dv2, and Tank & Temples datasets validate the effectiveness of NeRF-SOS.

Unfortunately, existing video architectures are often computationally intensive and not suitable for such applications. The recent X3D work presents a new family of efficient video models by expanding a hand-crafted image architecture along multiple axes, such as space, time, width, and depth. Although operating in a conceptually large space, X3D searches one axis at a time, and merely explored a small set of 30 architectures in total, which does not sufficiently explore the space. This paper bypasses existing 2D architectures, and directly searched for 3D architectures in a fine-grained space, where block type, filter number, expansion ratio and attention block are jointly searched. A probabilistic neural architecture search method is adopted to efficiently search in such a large space. Evaluations on Kinetics and Something-Something-V2 benchmarks confirm our AutoX3D models outperform existing ones in accuracy up to 1.3% under similar FLOPs, and reduce the computational cost up to \u00d71.74 when reaching similar performance."}}

SaBN is motivated by addressing the inherent feature distribution heterogeneity that one can be identified in many tasks, which can arise from data heterogeneity (multiple input domains) or model heterogeneity (dynamic architectures, model conditioning, etc.). Our SaBN factorizes the BN affine layer into one shared sandwich affine layer, cascaded by several parallel independent affine layers. Concrete analysis reveals that, during optimization, SaBN promotes balanced gradient norms while still preserving diverse gradient directions \u2013 a property that many application tasks seem to favor. We demonstrate the prevailing effectiveness of SaBN as a drop-in replacement in four tasks: conditional image generation, neural architecture search (NAS), adversarial training, and arbitrary style transfer. Leveraging SaBN immediately achieves better Inception Score and FID on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet conditional image generation with three state-of-the-art GANs; boosts the performance of a state-of-the-art weight-sharing NAS algorithm significantly on NAS-Bench-201; substantially improves the robust and standard accuracies for adversarial defense; and produces superior arbitrary styl-ized results. We also provide visualizations and analysis to help understand why SaBN works. Codes are available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/Sandwich-Batch-Normalization."}}
