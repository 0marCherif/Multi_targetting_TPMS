Most existing works train a CNN or GCN based backbone to extract spatial-temporal features, and use temporal average/max pooling to aggregate the information. However, these pooling methods fail to capture high-order dynamics information. To address the problem, we propose a plug-and-play module called Koopman pooling, which is a parameterized high-order pooling technique based on Koopman theory. The Koopman operator linearizes a non-linear dynamics system, thus providing a way to represent the complex system through the dynamics matrix, which can be used for classification. We also propose an eigenvalue normalization method to encourage the learned dynamics to be non-decaying and stable. Besides, we also show that our Koopman pooling framework can be easily extended to one-shot action recognition when combined with Dynamic Mode Decomposition. The proposed method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets, namely NTU RGB+D 60, 120 and NW-UCLA. Our experiments clearly demonstrate that Koopman pooling significantly improves the performance under both full-dataset and one-shot settings."}}

The rise of deep learning has led to the gradual incorporation of neural network designs into inverse halftoning methods. Most of existing inverse halftoning approaches adopt the U-net architecture, which uses an encoder to encode halftone prints, followed by a decoder for image reconstruction. However, the mainstream supervised learning paradigm with element-wise regression commonly adopted in U-net based methods has poor generalization ability in practical applications. Specifically, when there is a large gap between the dithering patterns of the training and test halftones, the reconstructed continuous-tone images have obvious artifacts. This is an important issue in practical applications, since the algorithms for generating halftones are ever-evolving. Even for the same algorithm, different parameter choices will result in different halftone dithering patterns. In this paper, we propose the first generative halftoning method in the literature, which regards the black pixels in halftones as physically moving particles, and makes the randomly distributed particles move under some certain guidance through reverse diffusion process, so as to obtain desired halftone patterns. In particular, we propose a Conditional Diffusion model for image Halftoning (CDH), which consists of a halftone dithering process and an inverse halftoning process. By changing the initial state of the diffusion model, our method can generate visually plausible halftones with different dithering patterns under the condition of image gray level and Laplacian prior. To avoid introducing redundant patterns and undesired artifacts, we propose a meta-halftone guided network to incorporate blue noise guidance in the diffusion process. In this way, halftone images subject to more diverse distributions are fed into the inverse halftoning model, which helps the model to learn a more robust mapping from halftone distributions to continuous-tone distributions, thereby improving the generalization ability to unseen samples. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results."}}

However, the scarcity of annotated data has been a key obstacle in this task. To address it, this work explores a new solution for video summarization by transferring samples from a correlated task (i.e., video moment localization) equipped with abundant training data. Our main insight is that the annotated video moments also indicate the semantic highlights of a video, essentially similar to video summary. Approximately, the video summary can be treated as a sparse, redundancy-free version of the video moments. Inspired by this observation, we propose an importance Propagation based collaborative Teaching Network (iPTNet). It consists of two separate modules that conduct video summarization and moment localization, respectively. Each module estimates a frame-wise importance map for indicating keyframes or moments. To perform cross-task sample transfer, we devise an importance propagation module that realizes the conversion between summarization-guided and localization-guided importance maps. This way critically enables optimizing one of the tasks using the data from the other task. Additionally, in order to avoid error amplification caused by batch-wise joint training, we devise a collaborative teaching scheme, which adopts a crosstask mean teaching strategy to realize the joint optimization of the two tasks and provide robust frame-level teaching signals. Extensive experiments on video summarization benchmarks demonstrate that iPTNet significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art video summarization methods, serving as an effective solution that overcomes the data scarcity issue in video summarization."}}

Similar to other lifelong learning tasks, it severely suffers from the so-called catastrophic forgetting problem, which refers to the notable performance degradation on previously-seen data after adapting the model to some newly incoming data. To alleviate it, a few existing methods have utilized knowledge distillation to enforce consistency between the original and adapted models. However, the effectiveness of such a strategy can be largely reduced facing the data distribution discrepancy between seen and new data. The hallmark of our work is using adaptively-chosen patches (rather than whole images as in other works) to pilot the forgetting-resistant distillation. Specifically, the technical contributions of our patch-based new solution are two-fold: first, a novel patch sampler is proposed. It is fully differentiable and trained to select a diverse set of image patches that stay crucial and discriminative under streaming data. Secondly, with those patches we curate a novel knowledge distillation framework. Valuable patch-level knowledge within individual patch features and mutual relations is well preserved by the two newly introduced distillation modules, further mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on twelve person re-identification datasets clearly validate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art competitors by large performance margins."}}

This work addresses this task under a zero-shot setting, where only brief event-specific textural information (such as event names, a few descriptive sentences, etc.) is known yet none positive video example is provided. Mainstream approaches to tackling this task are middle-level semantic concept-based, where meticulously-crafted concept banks (e.g., LSCOM) are adopted. We argue that these concept banks are still inadequate facing video semantic complexity. Existing semantic concepts are essentially first-order, mainly designed for atomic objects, scenes or human actions, etc. This work advocates the utilization of high-order concepts (such as subject-predicate-object triplets or adjective-object). The main contributions are two-fold. First, we harvest a comprehensive albeit compact high-order concept library through distilling information from three large public datasets (MS-COCO, Visual Genome, and Kinetics-600), mainly related to visual relations and human-object interactions. Secondly, zero-shot events are often only briefly and partially described via textual input. The resultant semantic ambiguity makes the pursuit of the most indicative high-order concepts challenging. We thus design a novel query-expanding scheme that enriches ambiguous event-specific keywords by searching over either large common knowledge bases ( <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g.</i> , WikiHow) or top-ranked webpages retrieved from modern search engines. This way sets up a more faithful connection between zero-shot events and high-order concepts. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that strives for concept-based video search beyond first-order concepts. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several large video benchmarks (TRECVID 2013, TRECVID 2014, and ActivityNet-1.3). The evaluations clearly demonstrate the superiority of our constructed high-order concept library and its complementariness to existing concepts."}}

This paper for the first time investigates some superficial biases that are specific to the temporal grounding task, and proposes a novel targeted solution. Most alarmingly, we observe that existing temporal ground models heavily rely on some biases (e.g., high preference on frequent concepts or certain temporal intervals) in the visual modal. This leads to inferior performance when generalizing the model in cross-scenario test setting. To this end, we propose a novel method called Debiased Temporal Language Localizer (DebiasTLL) to prevent the model from naively memorizing the biases and enforce it to ground the query sentence based on true inter-modal relationship. Debias-TLL simultaneously trains two models. By our design, a large discrepancy of these two models' predictions when judging a sample reveals higher probability of being a biased sample. Harnessing the informative discrepancy, we devise a data re-weighing scheme for mitigating the data biases. We evaluate the proposed model in cross-scenario temporal grounding, where the train / test data are heterogeneously sourced. Experiments show large-margin superiority of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art competitors."}}
