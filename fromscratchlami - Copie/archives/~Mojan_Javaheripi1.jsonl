Deep learning-based video compression methods are rapidly replacing traditional algorithms and providing state-of-the-art results on edge devices. However, recently developed adversarial attacks demonstrate that digitally crafted perturbations can break the Rate-Distortion relationship of video compression. In this work, we present a real-world LED attack to target video compression frameworks. Our physically realizable attack, dubbed NetFlick, can degrade the spatio-temporal correlation between successive frames by injecting flickering temporal perturbations. In addition, we propose universal perturbations that can downgrade performance of incoming video without prior knowledge of the contents. Experimental results demonstrate that NetFlick can successfully deteriorate the performance of video compression frameworks in both digital- and physical-settings and can be further extended to attack downstream video classification networks."}}

Recent literature in fault-injection attacks shows the severe DNN accuracy degradation caused by bit flips. In this scenario, the attacker changes a few DNN weight bits during execution by injecting faults to the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). To detect bit flips, AccHashtag extracts a unique signature from the benign DNN prior to deployment. The signature is used to validate the model\u2019s integrity and verify the inference output on the fly. We propose a novel sensitivity analysis that identifies the most vulnerable DNN layers to the fault-injection attack. The DNN signature is constructed by encoding the weights in vulnerable layers using a low-collision hash function. During DNN inference, new hashes are extracted from the target layers and compared against the ground-truth signatures. AccHashtag incorporates a lightweight methodology that allows for real-time fault detection on embedded platforms. We devise a specialized compute core for AccHashtag on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to facilitate online hash generation in parallel to DNN execution. Extensive evaluations with the state-of-the-art bit-flip attack on various DNNs demonstrate the competitive advantage of AccHashtag in terms of both attack detection and execution overhead."}}

The server only learns the final aggregation result, thereby preventing leakage of the users' (private) training data from the individual model updates. However, keeping the individual updates private allows malicious users to perform Byzantine attacks and degrade the model accuracy without being detected. Best existing defenses against Byzantine workers rely on robust rank-based statistics, e.g., the median, to find malicious updates. However, implementing privacy-preserving rank-based statistics is nontrivial and unscalable in the secure domain, as it requires sorting of all individual updates. We establish the first private robustness check that uses high break point rank-based statistics on aggregated model updates. By exploiting randomized clustering, we significantly improve the scalability of our defense without compromising privacy. We leverage the derived statistical bounds in zero-knowledge proofs to detect and remove malicious updates without revealing the private user updates. Our novel framework, zPROBE, enables Byzantine resilient and secure federated learning.

In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study for adversarial attacks on deep learning-based video compression and downstream classification systems. Our attack framework, dubbed RoVISQ, manipulates the Rate-Distortion ($\\textit{R}$-$\\textit{D}$) relationship of a video compression model to achieve one or both of the following goals: (1) increasing the network bandwidth, (2) degrading the video quality for end-users. We further devise new objectives for targeted and untargeted attacks to a downstream video classification service. Finally, we design an input-invariant perturbation that universally disrupts video compression and classification systems in real time. Unlike previously proposed attacks on video classification, our adversarial perturbations are the first to withstand compression. We empirically show the resilience of RoVISQ attacks against various defenses, i.e., adversarial training, video denoising, and JPEG compression. Our extensive experimental results on various video datasets show RoVISQ attacks deteriorate peak signal-to-noise ratio by up to 5.6dB and the bit-rate by up to $\\sim$ 2.4$\\times$ while achieving over 90$\\%$ attack success rate on a downstream classifier. Our user study further demonstrates the effect of RoVISQ attacks on users' QoE."}}
