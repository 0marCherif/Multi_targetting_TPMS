Recent studies followed a non-adaptive setting, where the seed nodes are selected before the start of the diffusion process and network parameters are updated when the diffusion stops. We consider an adaptive version of content-dependent online influence maximization problem where the seed nodes are sequentially activated based on real-time feedback. In this paper, we formulate the problem as an infinite-horizon discounted MDP under a linear diffusion process and present a model-based reinforcement learning solution. Our algorithm maintains a network model estimate and selects seed users adaptively, exploring the social network while improving the optimal policy optimistically. We establish $\\widetilde O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for our algorithm. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm. "}}

Our approach demonstrates robust performance for tuning both tree-based models and deep neural networks on a large AutoML benchmark, as well as superior performance in model quality, time, and resource consumption for a production transformer-based NLP model fine-tuning task."}}

Traditional solutions have to periodically rebuild their models, despite high computational cost. But this still cannot empower them to automatically adjust to abrupt changes in trends caused by timely information. It is important to note that the changes of reward distributions caused by a non-stationary environment can also be context dependent. When the change is orthogonal to the given context, previously maintained models should be reused for better recommendation prediction. In this work, we focus on contextual bandit algorithms for making adaptive recommendations. We capitalize on the unique context-dependent property of reward changes to conquer the challenging non-stationary environment for model update. In particular, we maintain a dynamic ensemble of contextual bandit models, where each bandit model's reward estimation quality is monitored regarding given context and possible environment changes. Only the admissible models to the current environment will be used for recommendation. We provide a rigorous upper regret bound analysis of our proposed algorithm. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and three real-world datasets confirmed the algorithm's advantage against existing non-stationary solutions that simply create new models whenever an environment change is detected."}}

However, such algorithms usually assume a stationary reward distribution, which hardly holds in practice as users' preferences are dynamic. This inevitably costs a recommender system consistent suboptimal performance. In this paper, we consider the situation where the underlying distribution of reward remains unchanged over (possibly short) epochs and shifts at unknown time instants. In accordance, we propose a contextual bandit algorithm that detects possible changes of environment based on its reward estimation confidence and updates its arm selection strategy respectively. Rigorous upper regret bound analysis of the proposed algorithm demonstrates its learning effectiveness in such a non-trivial environment. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets for recommendation confirm its practical utility in a changing environment."}}

Without proper modeling, such incomplete supervision inevitably misleads model estimation, especially in a bandit learning setting where the feedback is acquired on the fly. In this work, we perform contextual bandit learning with implicit feedback by modeling the feedback as a composition of user result examination and relevance judgment. Since users' examination behavior is unobserved, we introduce latent variables to model it. We perform Thompson sampling on top of variational Bayesian inference for arm selection and model update. Our upper regret bound analysis of the proposed algorithm proves its feasibility of learning from implicit feedback in a bandit setting; and extensive empirical evaluations on click logs collected from a major MOOC platform further demonstrate its learning effectiveness in practice."}}

Low-rank matrix completion is performed over an incrementally constructed user-item preference matrix, where an upper confidence bound based item selection strategy is developed to balance the exploit/explore trade-off during online learning. Observable contextual features and dependency among users (e.g., social influence) are leveraged to improve the algorithm's convergence rate and help conquer cold-start in recommendation. A high probability sublinear upper regret bound is proved for the developed algorithm, where considerable regret reduction is achieved on both user and item sides.

They have been extensively used in many important practical scenarios, such as display advertising and content recommendation. A common practice estimates the unknown bandit parameters pertaining to each user independently. This unfortunately ignores dependency among users and thus leads to suboptimal solutions, especially for the applications that have strong social components. In this paper, we develop a collaborative contextual bandit algorithm, in which the adjacency graph among users is leveraged to share context and payoffs among neighboring users while online updating. We rigorously prove an improved upper regret bound of the proposed collaborative bandit algorithm comparing to conventional independent bandit algorithms. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and three large-scale real-world datasets verified the improvement of our proposed algorithm against several state-of-the-art contextual bandit algorithms."}}
