Despite decades of research on automation and proof assistants, writing formal proofs remains arduous and only accessible to a few experts. While previous studies to automate formalization focused on powerful search algorithms, no attempts were made to take advantage of available informal proofs. In this work, we introduce Draft, Sketch, and Prove (DSP), a method that maps informal proofs to formal proof sketches, and uses the sketches to guide an automated prover by directing its search to easier sub-problems. We investigate two relevant setups where informal proofs are either written by humans or generated by a language model. Our experiments and ablation studies show that large language models are able to produce well-structured formal sketches that follow the same reasoning steps as the informal proofs. Guiding an automated prover with these sketches enhances its performance from $20.9\\%$ to $39.3\\%$ on a collection of mathematical competition problems."}}

Our approach leverages a new search algorithm, HyperTree Proof Search (HTPS), that learns from previous proof searches through online training, allowing it to generalize to domains far from the training distribution. We report detailed ablations of our pipeline\u2019s main components by studying performance on three environments of increasing complexity. In particular, we show that with HTPS alone, a model trained on annotated proofs manages to prove 65.4% of a held-out set of Metamath theorems, significantly outperforming the previous state of the art of 56.5% by GPT-f. Online training on these unproved theorems increases accuracy to 82.6%. With a similar computational budget, we improve the state of the art on the Lean-based miniF2F-curriculum dataset from 31% to 42% proving accuracy."}}

While these approaches were originally motivated by low rank approximations, the best performances are usually obtained for ranks as high as permitted by computation constraints. For large scale factorization problems where the factor dimensions have to be kept small, the performances of these approaches tend to drop drastically. The other main tensor factorization model, Tucker decomposition, is more flexible than CP for fixed factor dimensions, so we expect Tucker-based approaches to yield better performance under strong constraints on the number of parameters. However, as we show in this paper through experiments on standard benchmarks of link prediction in knowledge bases, ComplEx, a variant of CP, achieves similar performances to recent approaches based on Tucker decomposition on all operating points in terms of number of parameters. In a control experiment, we show that one problem in the practical application of Tucker decomposition to large-scale tensor completion comes from the adaptive optimization algorithms based on diagonal rescaling, such as Adagrad. We present a new algorithm for a constrained version of Tucker which implicitly applies Adagrad to a CP-based model with an additional projection of the embeddings onto a fixed lower dimensional subspace. The resulting Tucker-style extension of ComplEx obtains similar best performances as ComplEx, with substantial gains on some datasets under constraints on the number of parameters."}}

However, the data they are applied to usually evolves with time, such as friend graphs in social networks or user interactions with items in recommender systems. This is also the case for knowledge bases, which contain facts such as (US, has president, B. Obama, [2009-2017]) that are valid only at certain points in time. For the problem of link prediction under temporal constraints, i.e., answering queries of the form (US, has president, ?, 2012), we propose a solution inspired by the canonical decomposition of tensors of order 4.\nWe introduce new regularization schemes and present an extension of ComplEx that achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we propose a new dataset for knowledge base completion constructed from Wikidata, larger than previous benchmarks by an order of magnitude, as a new reference for evaluating temporal and non-temporal link prediction methods.
