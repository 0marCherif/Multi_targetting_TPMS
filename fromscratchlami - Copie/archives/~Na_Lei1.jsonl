Many geometric processing tasks heavily depend on the qualities of the meshes, especially the convergence in terms of topology, position, Riemannian metric, differential operators and curvature measures.\n\nNormal cycle theory points out that in order to guarantee the convergence of curvature measures, the discrete meshes are required to approximate not only the smooth surface itself, but also the normal cycle of the surface. This theory inspires the development of the remeshing method based on conformal parameterization and planar Delaunay refinement, which uniformly samples the smooth surface, and produces Delaunay triangulations with bounded minimal corner angles. This method ensures the Hausdorff distances between the normal cycles of the resulting meshes and the smooth normal cycle converges to 0, the discrete Gaussian curvature and mean curvature measures of the resulting meshes converge to their counter parts on the smooth surface.\n\nIn the current work, the conformal parameterization based remeshing algorithm is further improved to speed up the curvature convergence. Instead of uniformly sampling the surface itself, the novel algorithm samples the normal cycle of the surface. The algorithm pipeline is as follows: first, two parameterizations are constructed, one is the surface conformal parameterization based on dynamic Ricci flow, the other is the normal cycle area-preserving parameterization based on optimal mass transportation; second, the normal cycle parameterization is uniformly sampled; third, the Delaunay refinement mesh generation is carried out on the surface conformal parameterization. The produced meshes can be proven to converge to the smooth surface in terms of curvature measures.\n\nExperimental results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of proposed algorithm, the convergence speeds of the curvatures are prominently faster than those of conventional methods."}}

One of the most challenging problems in surface registration, however, is to obtain a unique bijective registration for surfaces with large deformations and landmarks constraints. In this work, a novel surface registration framework is proposed to tackle this problem using optimal mass transport mapping (OMT-Map) and Teichm\u00fcller mapping (T-Map). All metric surfaces with the disk topology are mapped to the planar disk using OMT-Map, which avoids huge area distortion, thus rendering our method more robust. A landmark-constrained T-Map is then computed between two planar disks such that the maximal conformality distortion is minimized while the landmarks are matched. Compared with existing surface registration methods, our method is more advantageous in enforcing the robustness by avoiding large area distortion, and producing diffeomorphisms with all landmarks matched consistently. Numerical experiments on various surfaces demonstrate the efficiency, robustness of our method."}}

Therefore, the computation of optimal transportation maps is intrinsically challenging.\n\nIn this work, we propose a novel and powerful method, the FFT-OT (fast Fourier transform-optimal transport), to compute the 3-dimensional OT problems. The method is based on several key ideas: first, the Monge-Amp\\`ere equation is linearized to a sequence of linear elliptic PDEs with spacial and temporal variant coefficients; second, the obliqueness property of optimal transportation maps is reformulated as a Neumann boundary condition; and third, the variant coefficient elliptic PDEs are approximated by constant coefficient elliptic PDEs and solved by FFT on GPUs. We also prove that the algorithm converges linearly, namely the approximation error decreases exponentially fast. Experimental results show that the FFT-OT algorithm is more than a hundred times faster than the conventional methods based on the convex geometry. Furthermore, the method can be directly applied for sampling from complex 3D density functions in machine learning and magnifying the volumetric data in medical imaging. "}}

In this paper, we propose a novel automatic method for non-rigid 3D dynamic surface tracking with surface Ricci flow and Teichmiiller map methods. According to quasi-conformal Teichmiiller theory, the Techm\u00fcller map minimizes the maximal dilation so that our method is able to automatically register surfaces with large deformations. Besides, the adoption of Delaunay triangulation and quadrilateral meshes makes our method applicable to low quality meshes. In our work, the 3D dynamic surfaces are acquired by a high speed 3D scanner. We first identified sparse surface features using machine learning methods in the texture space. Then we assign landmark features with different curvature settings and the Riemannian metric of the surface is computed by the dynamic Ricci flow method, such that all the curvatures are concentrated on the feature points and the surface is flat everywhere else. The registration among frames is computed by the Teichmiiller mappings, which aligns the feature points with least angle distortions. We apply our new method to multiple sequences of 3D facial surfaces with large expression deformations and compare them with two other state-of-the-art tracking methods. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by the clearly improved accuracy and efficiency."}}
