Although massive healthcare data are available across medical institutions, they are prohibited from sharing due to privacy constraints. Besides, heterogeneity exists in different sites. As a result, federated offline RL algorithms are necessary and promising to deal with the problems. In this paper, we propose a multi-site Markov decision process model which allows both homogeneous and heterogeneous effects across sites. The proposed model makes the analysis of the site-level features possible. We design the first federated policy optimization algorithm for offline RL with sample complexity. The proposed algorithm is communication-efficient and privacy-preserving, which requires only a single round of communication interaction by exchanging summary statistics. We give a theoretical guarantee for the proposed algorithm without the assumption of sufficient action coverage, where the suboptimality for the learned policies is comparable to the rate as if data is not distributed. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The method is applied to a sepsis data set in multiple sites to illustrate its use in clinical settings."}}

Yet its effectiveness in accurately identifying important node-node interactions is challenged by the rapidly growing network size, with data being collected at an unprecedented granularity and scale. Common wisdom to overcome such high dimensionality is collapsing nodes into smaller groups and conducting connectivity analysis on the group level. Dividing efforts into two phases inevitably opens a gap in consistency and drives down efficiency. Consensus learning emerges as a new normal for common knowledge discovery with multiple data sources available. To this end, this paper features developing a unified framework of simultaneous grouping and connectivity analysis by combining multiple data sources. The algorithm also guarantees a statistically optimal estimator."}}

However, it is difficult to know all the relevant codes related to a phenotype due to the large number of codes available. Traditional data mining approaches often require the use of patient-level data, which hinders the ability to share data across institutions. In this project, we demonstrate that multi-center large-scale code embeddings can be used to efficiently identify relevant features related to a disease of interest. We constructed large-scale code embeddings for a wide range of codified concepts from EHRs from two large medical centers. We developed knowledge extraction via sparse embedding regression (KESER) for feature selection and integrative network analysis. We evaluated the quality of the code embeddings and assessed the performance of KESER in feature selection for eight diseases. Besides, we developed an integrated clinical knowledge map combining embedding data from both institutions. The features selected by KESER were comprehensive compared to lists of codified data generated by domain experts. Features identified via KESER resulted in comparable performance to those built upon features selected manually or with patient-level data. The knowledge map created using an integrative analysis identified disease-disease and disease-drug pairs more accurately compared to those identified using single institution data. Analysis of code embeddings via KESER can effectively reveal clinical knowledge and infer relatedness among codified concepts. KESER bypasses the need for patient-level data in individual analyses providing a significant advance in enabling multi-center studies using EHR data."}}

Most of the works focus on the independent sampling models under which the observed entries are sampled independently. Motivated by applications in the integration of knowledge graphs derived from multi-source biomedical data such as those from Electronic Health Records (EHR) and biomedical text, we propose the {\\bf B}lock-wise {\\bf O}verlapping {\\bf N}oisy {\\bf M}atrix {\\bf I}ntegration (BONMI) to treat blockwise missingness of symmetric matrices representing relatedness between entity pairs. Our idea is to exploit the orthogonal Procrustes problem to align the eigenspace of the two sub-matrices, then complete the missing blocks by the inner product of the two low-rank components. Besides, we prove the statistical rate for the eigenspace of the underlying matrix, which is comparable to the rate under the independently missing assumption. Simulation studies show that the method performs well under a variety of configurations. In the real data analysis, the method is applied to two tasks: (i) the integrating of several point-wise mutual information matrices built by English EHR and Chinese medical text data, and (ii) the machine translation between English and Chinese medical concepts. Our method shows an advantage over existing methods."}}

Chart review as well as rule-based and supervised phenotyping approaches require laborious expert input, hampering applicability to studies that require many phenotypes to be defined and labeled de novo. Though International Classification of Diseases codes are often used as surrogates for true labels in this setting, these sometimes suffer from poor specificity. We propose a fully automated topic modeling algorithm to simultaneously annotate multiple phenotypes."}}
