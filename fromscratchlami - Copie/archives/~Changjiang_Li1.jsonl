Specifically, we present EVAS, a new attack that leverages NAS to find neural architectures with inherent backdoors and exploits such vulnerability using input-aware triggers. Compared with existing attacks, EVAS demonstrates many interesting properties: (i) it does not require polluting training data or perturbing model parameters; (ii) it is agnostic to downstream fine-tuning or even re-training from scratch; (iii) it naturally evades defenses that rely on inspecting model parameters or training data. With extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets, we show that EVAS features high evasiveness, transferability, and robustness, thereby expanding the adversary's design spectrum. We further characterize the mechanisms underlying EVAS, which are possibly explainable by architecture-level ``shortcuts'' that recognize trigger patterns. This work showcases that NAS can be exploited in a harmful way to find architectures with inherent backdoor vulnerability. The code is available at https://github.com/ain-soph/nas_backdoor."}}

Yet, despite the intensive research on KRL, most existing studies either focus on homogenous KGs or assume KG completion tasks (i.e., inference of missing facts), while answering complex logical queries over KGs with multiple aspects (multi-view KGs) remains an open challenge. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we present ROMA, a novel KRL framework for answering logical queries over multi-view KGs. Compared with the prior work, ROMA departs in major aspects. (i) It models a multi-view KG as a set of overlaying sub-KGs, each corresponding to one view, which subsumes many types of KGs studied in the literature (e.g., temporal KGs). (ii) It supports complex logical queries with varying relation and view constraints (e.g., with complex topology and/or from multiple views); (iii) It scales up to KGs of large sizes (e.g., millions of facts) and fine-granular views (e.g., dozens of views); (iv) It generalizes to query structures and KG views that are unobserved during training. Extensive empirical evaluation on real-world KGs shows that \\system significantly outperforms alternative methods."}}
