Here, an optimal intervention in $\\cal{A}$ is one that maximizes the expected value for a designated reward variable in the graph, and we use the standard notion of simple regret to quantify near optimality. \nConsidering Bernoulli random variables and for causal graphs on $N$ vertices with constant in-degree, prior work has achieved a worst case guarantee of $\\widetilde{O} (N/\\sqrt{T})$ for simple regret. The current work utilizes the idea of covering interventions (which are not necessarily contained within $\\cal{A}$) and establishes a simple regret guarantee of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{N/T})$. Notably, and in contrast to prior work, our simple regret bound depends only on explicit parameters of the problem instance. We also go beyond prior work and achieve a simple regret guarantee for causal graphs with unobserved variables. Further, we perform experiments to show improvements over baselines in this setting."}}

The aggregation stage can be posed as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem, with the additional structure that the arms are grouped into categories (disjoint sets of items) and the ranking of arms within each category is known. We propose algorithms for selecting top $K$ items in this setting under two learning objectives, namely minimizing regret over rounds and identifying the top $K$ items within a fixed number of rounds. For each of the objectives, we provide sharp regret/error analysis using carefully defined notion of ``gap'' that exploits our problem structure. The resulting regret/error bounds strictly improve over prior work in combinatorial bandits literature. We also provide supporting evidence from simulations on synthetic and semi-synthetic problems."}}

Knowledge of such distribution shifts is helpful for two main reasons: (i) it helps retain classifier performance across time by telling us when to retrain it; and (ii) understanding the nature of shift in the relationship between input features and output labels, which can be of value for business analytics (e.g., understanding change in demand helps manage inventory) or scientific study (e.g., understanding virus behavior across changing demographics helps distribute drugs better). An interpretable real concept drift detection method is ideal for achieving this knowledge. Existing interpretable methods in this space only track covariate shifts, thus, are insensitive to the optimal decision boundary (true posterior distribution) and vulnerable to benign drifts in streaming data. Our work addresses this issue by proposing an interpretable method that leverages gradients of a classifier in a feature-wise hypothesis-testing framework to detect real concept drift. We also extend our method to a more realistic unsupervised setting where labels are not available to detect drift. Our experiments on various datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing interpretable methods and performs at par with state-of-the-art supervised drift detection methods w.r.t the average model classification accuracy metric. Qualitatively, our method identifies features that are relevant to the drift in the USENET2 dataset, thus providing interpretability and accurate drift detection. "}}

We model this as a stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with side-information, where interventions on CBN correspond to arms of the bandit instance. First, we propose a simple regret minimization algorithm that takes as input a causal graph with observable and unobservable nodes and in $T$ exploration rounds achieves $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{m(\\mathcal{C})/T})$ expected simple regret. Here $m(\\mathcal{C})$ is a parameter dependent on the input CBN $\\mathcal{C}$ and could be much smaller than the number of arms. We also show that this is almost optimal for CBNs whose causal graphs have an $n$-ary tree structure. Next, we propose a cumulative regret minimization algorithm that takes as input a causal graph with observable nodes and performs better than the optimal MAB algorithms that do not use causal side-information. We experimentally compare both our algorithms with the best known algorithms in the literature."}}

The remaining undirected edges have to be oriented using interventions, which can be very expensive to perform in applications. Thus, the problem of minimizing the number of interventions needed to fully orient the MEC has received a lot of recent attention, and is also the focus of this work. We prove two main results. The first is a new universal lower bound on the number of atomic interventions that any algorithm (whether active or passive) would need to perform in order to orient a given MEC. Our second result shows that this bound is, in fact, within a factor of two of the size of the smallest set of atomic interventions that can orient the MEC. Our lower bound is provably better than previously known lower bounds. The proof of our lower bound is based on the new notion of clique-block shared-parents (CBSP) orderings, which are topological orderings of DAGs without v-structures and satisfy certain special properties. Further, using simulations on synthetic graphs and by giving examples of special graph families, we show that our bound is often significantly better."}}
