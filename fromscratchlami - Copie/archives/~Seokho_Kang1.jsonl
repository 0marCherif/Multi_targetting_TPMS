Conventional conformation generation methods minimize hand-designed molecular force field energy functions that are often not well correlated with the true energy function of a molecule observed in nature. They generate geometrically diverse sets of conformations, some of which are very similar to the lowest-energy conformations and others of which are very different. In this paper, we propose a conditional deep generative graph neural network that learns an energy function by directly learning to generate molecular conformations that are energetically favorable and more likely to be observed experimentally in data-driven manner. On three large-scale datasets containing small molecules, we show that our method generates a set of conformations that on average is far more likely to be close to the corresponding reference conformations than are those obtained from conventional force field methods. Our method maintains geometrical diversity by generating conformations that are not too similar to each other, and is also computationally faster. We also show that our method can be used to provide initial coordinates for conventional force field methods. On one of the evaluated datasets we show that this combination allows us to combine the best of both methods, yielding generated conformations that are on average close to reference conformations with some very similar to reference conformations."}}

Abstract The class imbalance problem, which has been recognized in many real-world applications, negatively affects the performance of neural networks. To address the class imbalance problem, resampling and cost-sensitive learning have been commonly applied. In this study, we propose a novel training method for neural networks based on adaptive noise, named ADANOISE. This method incorporates the ideas of both resampling and cost-sensitive learning to improve the training of a neural network under class imbalance. For the neural network, random noise is added to the input when it learns from the minority class. To make the learning objective cost-sensitive, each minority class instance is oversampled by adding different noise vectors randomly sampled from a noise distribution. The neural network and the parameter of the noise distribution are simultaneously trained. By doing so, the noise distribution adapts to the training data in a data-driven fashion toward improving the performance of the neural network.

Abstract In this paper, we propose a binary classifier ensemble-based one-class classifier (BCE-OC) for one-class classification. Given a training set comprising of only target class instances, it is partitioned into several clusters. Multiple binary classifiers are then trained with the clusters in a one-against-rest fashion, in which each classifier treats one cluster as a pseudo non-target class and is responsible for distinguishing the cluster from the other clusters. The binary classifiers are finally combined to constitute a one-class classifier, which is used to classify unknown instances. BCE-OC allows the use of any supervised classification algorithms for one-class classification. Accordingly, it allows extensive comparison of various learning algorithms to obtain a more competent one-class classifier for the problem.

Abstract Virtual metrology (VM) is a promising solution for wafer-to-wafer quality monitoring in the semiconductor manufacturing process. VM alternates physical metrology with a prediction model trained using previous metrology data. Active learning can be used to build a VM model for new equipment efficiently with reduced metrology costs. However, conventional active learning is limited by a low prediction accuracy at its initial stage, which is referred to as the cold-start problem. In this study, we propose a domain-adaptive active learning method to address this issue. Using existing equipment as the source domain, the proposed method initializes the VM model through unsupervised domain adaptation from the source domain to the target domain. Active learning is then performed to iteratively update the VM model toward improving the prediction accuracy. Thus, the metrology cost required to obtain a VM model that satisfies the desired prediction accuracy for the target metrology task can be reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated experimentally using real-world data from a semiconductor manufacturer."}}

Abstract In semiconductor manufacturing, the defect patterns of wafer maps provide crucial information to identify the root causes of wafer defects. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been actively applied to automatic wafer map pattern classification. As a requirement for real-world application, a CNN must be as accurate as a process engineer. Existing studies have attempted to improve the training phase of a CNN to make it more accurate. However, they often fail to achieve the near-perfect accuracy requirement in practice. To sidestep the difficulty, we focus on improving the inference phase of an imperfect CNN with the aid of a process engineer. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic wafer map pattern classification method that selectively utilizes the CNN for classifying new wafer maps. Given a query wafer map, we decide whether to use the CNN by quantifying its predictive uncertainty on the wafer map. If the predictive uncertainty is sufficiently low, the wafer map is classified using the CNN. Otherwise, the wafer map is subject to manual classification by a process engineer. In the experiments using the WM-811k dataset, the proposed method attains an accuracy of over 99% with a CNN coverage of 93%."}}

Abstract To train a neural network with an incomplete dataset containing missing values, the dataset is required to be completed in advance. The conventional approach applies missing value imputation before training, and consistently uses the same imputations to update the neural network. However, some inaccurate imputations would negatively affect the generalization performance of the neural network. In this study, we propose a dynamic imputation method to improve the training of a neural network in the presence of missing values. We use a dynamic imputer that can provide different imputations for the same missing value. At each training epoch, imputations for all missing values are newly obtained using the dynamic imputer, and are then used to update the neural network. By diversifying the imputations with the dynamic imputer during the training, the neural network is expected to exhibit more robustness to imputation inaccuracies, thereby improving the generalization performance.

Existing post-processing methods generally require additional training of a post-processing model using training data or designing a post-processing procedure based on a high level of domain knowledge. Their application is limited in many real-world situations due to the lack of prerequisites. In this study, we present a post-processing method that can be applied to any existing segmentation model without requiring the use of training data or domain knowledge. Given a segmentation model of any type, the proposed method improves its prediction based on the recursive feedback mechanism. For a query image, we first obtain its prediction mask by using the segmentation model. Based on the prediction mask, we modify the original image by selectively blurring the area in which the target object is expected to be absent. Subsequently, the modified image is fed again into the model to acquire a refined prediction mask. We repeat this process to obtain multiple prediction masks, which are then combined to yield the final prediction.

Abstract Recently, machine learning has been effectively applied in the automation of wafer map pattern classification in semiconductor manufacturing. One conventional approach is to extract handcrafted features from a wafer map and build an off-the-shelf classifier on top of the features. Another approach is to use a convolutional neural network that operates directly on a wafer map. These two approaches have different strengths for different classes of wafer map defect patterns. In this study, we present a hybrid method that leverages the advantages of both approaches to improve the classification accuracy. First, we build two base classifiers using each of the approaches. Then, we build a stacking ensemble that combines the outputs of these base classifiers for the final prediction. The stacking ensemble classifies a wafer map by assigning a larger weight to the output of the superior base classifier with respect to each defect class.

In this study, we propose a novel query selection method that considers the imputation uncertainty for active learning with missing values. We quantify the imputation uncertainty of each instance using multiple imputation. For query selection, the acquisition function is penalized by the imputation uncertainty. Consequently, inaccurately imputed instances are less likely to be selected for labeling, thereby avoiding superfluous labeling costs.
