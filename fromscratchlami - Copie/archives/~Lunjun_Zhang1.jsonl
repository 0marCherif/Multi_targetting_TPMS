We present a simple yet effective method that exploits (i) point clustering in near-range areas where the point clouds are dense, (ii) temporal consistency to filter out noisy unsupervised detections, (iii) translation equivariance of CNNs to extend the auto-labels to long range, and (iv) self-supervision for improving on its own. Our approach, OYSTER (Object Discovery via Spatio-Temporal Refinement), does not impose constraints on data collection (such as repeated traversals of the same location), is able to detect objects in a zero-shot manner without supervised finetuning (even in sparse, distant regions), and continues to self-improve given more rounds of iterative self-training. To better measure model performance in self-driving scenarios, we propose a new planning-centric perception metric based on distance-to-collision. We demonstrate that our unsupervised object detector significantly outperforms unsupervised baselines on PandaSet and Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset, showing promise that self-supervision combined with object priors can enable object discovery in the wild.

Typically, imitation learning (IL) is used to learn human-like traffic agents directly from real-world observations collected offline, but without explicit specification of traffic rules, agents trained from IL alone frequently display unrealistic infractions like collisions and driving off the road. This problem is exacerbated in out-of-distribution and long-tail scenarios. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) can train traffic agents to avoid infractions, but using RL alone results in unhuman-like driving behaviors. We propose Reinforcing Traffic Rules (RTR), a holistic closed-loop learning objective to match expert demonstrations under a traffic compliance constraint, which naturally gives rise to a joint IL + RL approach, obtaining the best of both worlds. Our method learns in closed-loop simulations of both nominal scenarios from real-world datasets as well as procedurally generated long-tail scenarios. Our experiments show that RTR learns more realistic and generalizable traffic simulation policies, achieving significantly better tradeoffs between human-like driving and traffic compliance in both nominal and long-tail scenarios. Moreover, when used as a data generation tool for training prediction models, our learned traffic policy leads to considerably improved downstream prediction metrics compared to baseline traffic agents."}}

While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise for solving relatively straightforward control tasks, it remains an open problem how to best incorporate planning into existing deep RL paradigms to handle increasingly complex environments. One prominent framework, Model-Based RL, learns a world model and plans using step-by-step virtual rollouts. This type of world model quickly diverges from reality when the planning horizon increases, thus struggling at long-horizon planning. How can we learn world models that endow agents with the ability to do temporally extended reasoning? In this work, we propose to learn graph-structured world models composed of sparse, multi-step transitions. We devise a novel algorithm to learn latent landmarks that are scattered (in terms of reachability) across the goal space as the nodes on the graph. In this same graph, the edges are the reachability estimates distilled from Q-functions. On a variety of high-dimensional continuous control tasks ranging from robotic manipulation to navigation, we demonstrate that our method, named L^{3}P, significantly outperforms prior work, and is oftentimes the only method capable of leveraging both the robustness of model-free RL and generalization of graph-search algorithms. We believe our work is an important step towards scalable planning in reinforcement learning. "}}

In contrast to many previous one-shot imitation learning approaches, our algorithm does not assume access to more than one expert demonstration during the training phase. Instead, we leverage an exploration policy to acquire unsupervised trajectories, which are then used to train both an encoder and a context-aware imitation policy. The optimization procedures for the encoder, imitation learner, and exploration policy are all tightly linked. This linking creates a feedback loop wherein the exploration policy collects new demonstrations that challenge the imitation learner, while the encoder attempts to help the imitation policy to the best of its abilities. We evaluate our algorithm on 6 MujoCo robotics tasks."}}
