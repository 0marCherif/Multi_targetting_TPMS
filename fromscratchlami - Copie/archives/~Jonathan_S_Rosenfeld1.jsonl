We functionally approximate the error of the pruned networks, showing that it is predictable in terms of an invariant tying width, depth, and pruning level, such that networks of vastly different sparsities are freely interchangeable. We demonstrate the accuracy of this functional approximation over scales spanning orders of magnitude in depth, width, dataset size, and sparsity. We show that the scaling law functional form holds (generalizes) for large scale data (CIFAR-10, ImageNet), architectures (ResNets, VGGs) and iterative pruning algorithms (IMP, SynFlow). As neural networks become ever larger and more expensive to train, our findings suggest a framework for reasoning conceptually and analytically about pruning."}}

Nevertheless, the functional form of this dependency remains elusive. In this work, we present a functional form which approximates well the generalization error in practice. Capitalizing on the successful concept of model scaling (e.g., width, depth), we are able to simultaneously construct such a form and specify the exact models which can attain it across model/data scales. Our construction follows insights obtained from observations conducted over a range of model/data scales, in various model types and datasets, in vision and language tasks. We show that the form both fits the observations well across scales, and provides accurate predictions from small- to large-scale models and data."}}
