Indeed, subspaces defined by its eigenfunctions have been utilized for shape compression, treating the coordinates as smooth functions defined on the given surface. However, surfaces of shapes in nature often contain geometric structures for which the general smoothness assumption may fail to hold. At the other end, some explicit mesh compression algorithms utilize the order by which vertices that represent the surface are traversed, a property which has been ignored in spectral approaches. Here, we incorporate the order of vertices into an operator that defines a novel spectral domain. We propose a method for representing 3D meshes using the spectral geometry of the Hamiltonian operator, integrated within a sparse approximation framework. We adapt the concept of a potential function from quantum physics and incorporate vertex ordering information into the potential, yielding a novel data-dependent operator. The potential function modifies the spectral geometry of the Laplacian to focus on regions with finer details of the given\nsurface. By sparsely encoding the geometry of the shape using the proposed data-dependent basis, we improve compression performance compared to previous results that use the standard Laplacian basis and spectral graph wavelets."}}

In this work, we introduce a Transformer-based architecture for molecule property prediction, which is able to capture the geometry of the molecule. We modify the classical positional encoder by an initial encoding of the molecule geometry, as well as a learned gated self-attention mechanism. We further suggest an augmentation scheme for molecular data capable of avoiding the overfitting induced by the overparameterized architecture. The proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods while being based on pure machine learning solely, i.e. the method does not incorporate domain knowledge from quantum chemistry and does not use extended geometric inputs besides the pairwise atomic distances."}}
