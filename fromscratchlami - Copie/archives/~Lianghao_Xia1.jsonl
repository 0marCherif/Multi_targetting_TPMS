To offer better recommendations, this work proposes Evolving Graph Contrastive Memory Network (EGCM) to model dynamic interaction heterogeneity for multi-behavior sequential recommendation. Specifically, we first develop a multi-behavior graph encoder to capture the short-term preference heterogeneity, and preserve the dedicated relation semantics for different types of user-item interactions. In addition, we design a dynamic cross-relational memory network, empowering EGCM to distill the long-term multi-behavior preference of users and the underlying evolving cross-type behavior dependencies over time. To enhance the user representation with multi-behavior commonality and diversity, we design a multi-behavior contrastive learning paradigm with heterogeneous short- and long-term interest modeling. Experiments on several real-world datasets show the superiority of our recommender system over various state-of-the-art baselines."}}

Recently, GNNs integrated with contrastive learning have shown superior performance in recommendation with their data augmentation schemes, aiming at dealing with highly sparse data. Despite their success, most existing graph contrastive learning methods either perform stochastic augmentation (e.g., node/edge perturbation) on the user-item interaction graph, or rely on the heuristic-based augmentation techniques (e.g., user clustering) for generating contrastive views. We argue that these methods cannot well preserve the intrinsic semantic structures and are easily biased by the noise perturbation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective graph contrastive learning paradigm LightGCL that mitigates these issues impairing the generality and robustness of CL-based recommenders. Our model exclusively utilizes singular value decomposition for contrastive augmentation, which enables the unconstrained structural refinement with global collaborative relation modeling. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant improvement in performance of our model over the state-of-the-arts. Further analyses demonstrate the superiority of LightGCL's robustness against data sparsity and popularity bias. The source code of our model is available at https://github.com/HKUDS/LightGCL."}}

However, the majority of existing collaborative filtering systems are not well designed to handle missing data. Particularly, in order to inject the negative signals in the training phase, these solutions largely rely on negative sampling from unobserved user-item interactions and simply treating them as negative instances, which brings the recommendation performance degradation. To address the issues, we develop a Collaborative Reflection-Augmented Autoencoder Network (CRANet), that is capable of exploring transferable knowledge from observed and unobserved user-item interactions. The network architecture of CRANet is formed of an integrative structure with a reflective receptor network and an information fusion autoencoder module, which endows our recommendation framework with the ability of encoding implicit user\u2019s pairwise preference on both interacted and non-interacted items. Additionally, a parametric regularization-based tied-weight scheme is designed to perform robust joint training of the two-stage CRANetmodel.

In those recommender systems, knowledge graph information often contains fruitful facts and inherent semantic relatedness among items. However, the success of such methods relies on the high quality knowledge graphs, and may not learn quality representations with two challenges: i) The long-tail distribution of entities results in sparse supervision signals for KG-enhanced item representation; ii) Real-world knowledge graphs are often noisy and contain topic-irrelevant connections between items and entities. Such KG sparsity and noise make the item-entity dependent relations deviate from reflecting their true characteristics, which significantly amplifies the noise effect and hinders the accurate representation of user's preference. To fill this research gap, we design a general Knowledge Graph Contrastive Learning framework (KGCL) that alleviates the information noise for knowledge graph-enhanced recommender systems. Specifically, we propose a knowledge graph augmentation schema to suppress KG noise in information aggregation, and derive more robust knowledge-aware representations for items. In addition, we exploit additional supervision signals from the KG augmentation process to guide a cross-view contrastive learning paradigm, giving a greater role to unbiased user-item interactions in gradient descent and further suppressing the noise. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of our KGCL over state-of-the-art techniques. KGCL also achieves strong performance in recommendation scenarios with sparse user-item interactions, long-tail and noisy KG entities.

However, two key challenges have not been well explored in existing solutions: i) The over-smoothing effect with deeper graph-based CF architecture, may cause the indistinguishable user representations and degradation of recommendation results. ii) The supervision signals (i.e., user-item interactions) are usually scarce and skewed distributed in reality, which limits the representation power of CF paradigms.

In particular, the designed hypergraph structure learning enhances the discrimination ability of GNN-based CF paradigm, in comprehensively capturing the complex high-order dependencies among users. Additionally, our HCCF model effectively integrates the hypergraph structure encoding with self-supervised learning to reinforce the representation quality of recommender systems, based on the hypergraph self-discrimination.

Despite their effectiveness, however, most of the current recommendation models rely on sufficient and high-quality training data, such that the learned representations can well capture accurate user preference. User behavior data in many practical recommendation scenarios is often noisy and exhibits skewed distribution, which may result in suboptimal representation performance in GNN-based models. In this paper, we propose SHT, a novel Self-Supervised Hypergraph Transformer framework (SHT) which augments user representations by exploring the global collaborative relationships in an explicit way. Specifically, we first empower the graph neural CF paradigm to maintain global collaborative effects among users and items with a hypergraph transformer network. With the distilled global context, a cross-view generative self-supervised learning component is proposed for data augmentation over the user-item interaction graph, so as to enhance the robustness of recommender systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHT can significantly improve the performance over various state-of-the-art baselines.

Previous works have made many efforts to model item-item transitions over user interaction sequences, based on various architectures, e.g., recurrent neural networks and self-attention mechanism. Recently emerged graph neural networks also serve as useful backbone models to capture item dependencies in sequential recommendation scenarios. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods have far focused on item sequence representation with singular type of interactions, and thus are limited to capture dynamic heterogeneous relational structures between users and items (e.g., page view, add-to-favorite, purchase). To tackle this challenge, we design a Multi-Behavior Hypergraph-enhanced T ransformer framework (MBHT) to capture both short-term and long-term cross-type behavior dependencies. Specifically, a multi-scale Transformer is equipped with low-rank self-attention to jointly encode behavior-aware sequential patterns from fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. Additionally,we incorporate the global multi-behavior dependency into the hypergraph neural architecture to capture the hierarchical long-range item correlations in a customized manner. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our MBHT over various state-of- the-art recommendation solutions across different settings.

Hence, sequential recommender systems have been developed to learn the dynamic user interests from the historical interactions for suggesting items.

In many real-life online platforms, user-item interactive behaviors are often multi-typed (e.g., click, add-to-favorite, purchase) with complex cross-type behavior inter-dependencies.

While some recent studies propose to capture the dependencies across different types of behaviors, two important challenges have been less explored: i) Dealing with the sparse supervision signal under target behaviors (e.g., purchase). ii) Capturing the personalized multi-behavior patterns with customized dependency modeling. To tackle the above challenges, we devise a new model CML, Contrastive Meta Learning (CML), to maintain dedicated cross-type behavior dependency for different users. In particular, we propose a multi-behavior contrastive learning framework to distill transferable knowledge across different types of behaviors via the constructed contrastive loss. In addition, to capture the diverse multi-behavior patterns, we design a contrastive meta network to encode the customized behavior heterogeneity for different users. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.
