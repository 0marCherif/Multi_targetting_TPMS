Still, decision-making systems that are based on such predictors need not only benefit from good predictions, but should also achieve a decent performance when the predictions are inadequate. In this article, we propose a prediction setup for arbitrary metrical task systems (MTS) (e.g.,\u00a0caching, k-server, and convex body chasing) and online matching on the line. We utilize results from the theory of online algorithms to show how to make the setup robust. Specifically, for caching, we present an algorithm whose performance, as a function of the prediction error, is exponentially better than what is achievable for general MTS. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation of our methods on real-world datasets, which suggests practicality."}}

Since the performance of each predictor may vary over time, it is desirable to use not the single best predictor as a benchmark, but rather a dynamic combination which follows different predictors at different times. We design algorithms that combine predictions and are competitive against such dynamic combinations for a wide class of online problems, namely, metrical task systems. Against the best (in hindsight) unconstrained combination of $\\ell$ predictors, we obtain a competitive ratio of $O(\\ell^2)$, and show that this is best possible. However, for a benchmark with slightly constrained number of switches between different predictors, we can get a $(1+\\epsilon)$-competitive algorithm. Moreover, our algorithms can be adapted to access predictors in a bandit-like fashion, querying only one predictor at a time. An unexpected implication of one of our lower bounds is a new structural insight about covering formulations for the $k$-server problem."}}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm solves this problem in O(hm) time, where m is the number of edges. We show that this running time is optimal, up to subpolynomial factors, under popular fine-grained complexity assumptions. More specifically, we show that under the APSP Hypothesis the problem cannot be solved faster already in undirected graphs with nonnegative edge weights. This lower bound holds even restricted to graphs of arbitrary density and for arbitrary h \u2208 O(\u221am). Moreover, under a stronger assumption, namely the Min-Plus Convolution Hypothesis, we can eliminate the restriction h \u2208 O(\u221am). In other words, the O(hm) bound is tight for the entire space of parameters h, m, and n, where n is the number of nodes. Our lower bounds can be contrasted with the recent near-linear time algorithm for the negative-weight Single-Source Shortest Paths problem, which is the textbook application of the Bellman-Ford algorithm."}}

We assume the algorithm is given imperfect predictions regarding future updates, and we ask how such predictions can be used to improve the running time. This can be seen as a model interpolating between classic online and offline dynamic algorithms. Our results give smooth tradeoffs between these two extreme settings. First, we give algorithms for incremental and decremental transitive closure and approximate APSP that take as an additional input a predicted sequence of updates (edge insertions, or edge deletions, respectively). They preprocess it in $\\tilde{O}(n^{(3+\\omega)/2})$ time, and then handle updates in $\\tilde{O}(1)$ worst-case time and queries in $\\tilde{O}(\\eta^2)$ worst-case time. Here $\\eta$ is an error measure that can be bounded by the maximum difference between the predicted and actual insertion (deletion) time of an edge, i.e., by the $\\ell_\\infty$-error of the predictions. The second group of results concerns fully dynamic problems with vertex updates, where the algorithm has access to a predicted sequence of the next $n$ updates. We show how to solve fully dynamic triangle detection, maximum matching, single-source reachability, and more, in $O(n^{\\omega-1}+n\\eta_i)$ worst-case update time. Here $\\eta_i$ denotes how much earlier the $i$-th update occurs than predicted. Our last result is a reduction that transforms a worst-case incremental algorithm without predictions into a fully dynamic algorithm which is given a predicted deletion time for each element at the time of its insertion. As a consequence we can, e.g., maintain fully dynamic exact APSP with such predictions in $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$ worst-case vertex insertion time and $\\tilde{O}(n^2 (1+\\eta_i))$ worst-case vertex deletion time (for the prediction error $\\eta_i$ defined as above)."}}
