However, while several efforts have been devoted to the design of new convolutional architectures, pooling or positional encoding schemes, relatively little focus has been spent on modeling pairwise problems such as signal transfer, graph isomorphism and subgraph correspondence tasks. With this paper, we anticipate the need for a convenient framework to deal with problems that revolve around the notion of a map among graphs, and focus in particular on the challenging subgraph alignment scenario. We claim that, first and foremost, the representation of a map plays a central role in how these problems should be modeled -- be it a map inference problem or a simpler signal transport task. Taking the hint from recent work in geometry processing, we propose the adoption of a spectral representation for maps that is compact, easy to compute, permutation-equivariant, easy to plug into learning pipelines, and especially effective for a wide range of situations, most notably when dealing with subgraph alignment problems. We further report for the first time a surprising phenomenon where the partiality arising in subgraph alignment is manifested in the structure of the map coefficients, even in the absence of exact isomorphism, and which is consistently observed over different families of graphs."}}

With this analysis in hand, we develop a novel spectral registration technique: Fast Sinkhorn Filters, which allows for the recovery of accurate and bijective pointwise correspondences with a superior time and memory complexity in comparison to existing approaches. Our method combines the simple and concise representation of correspondence using functional maps with the matrix scaling schemes from computational optimal transport. By exploiting the sparse structure of the kernel matrices involved in the transport map computation, we provide an efficient trade-off between acceptable accuracy and complexity for the problem of dense shape correspondence, while promoting bijectivity."}}

In EL, the burden of interpreting explanations is not left to humans or human-coded compilers, as done in Program Synthesis. Rather, EL calls for a learned interpreter, built upon existing explanations paired with observations of several phenomena. This interpreter can then be used to make predictions on novel phenomena, and even find an explanation for them. We formulate the EL problem as a simple binary classification task, so that common end-to-end approaches aligned with the dominant empiricist view of machine learning could, in principle, solve it. To these models, we oppose Critical Rationalist Networks (CRNs), which instead embrace a rationalist view on the acquisition of knowledge. CRNs express several desired properties by construction, they are truly explainable, can adjust their processing at test-time for harder inferences, and can offer strong confidence guarantees on their predictions."}}

The proposed approach is data-driven and adopts for the first time the transformers architecture in the registration task. \nOur method is general and applies to different settings. Given a fixed template with some desired properties (e.g. skinning weights or other animation cues), we can register raw acquired data to it, thereby transferring all the template properties to the input geometry. \nAlternatively, given a pair of shapes, our method can register the first onto the second (or vice-versa), obtaining a high-quality dense correspondence between the two.\nIn both contexts, the quality of our results enables us to target real applications such as texture transfer and shape interpolation.\nFurthermore, we also show that including an estimation of the underlying density of the surface eases the learning process. By exploiting the potential of this architecture, we can train our model requiring only a sparse set of ground truth correspondences ($10\\sim20\\%$ of the total points). \nThe proposed model and the analysis that we perform pave the way for future exploration of transformer-based architectures for registration and matching applications. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art methods for deformable and unordered 3D data registration on different datasets and scenarios."}}

GFrames are based on the computation of the intrinsic gradient of a scalar field defined on top of the input shape. The resulting tangent vector field defines a repeatable tangent direction of the local frame at each point; importantly, it directly inherits the properties and invariance classes of the underlying scalar function, making it remarkably robust under strong sampling artifacts, vertex noise, as well as non-rigid deformations. Existing local descriptors can directly benefit from our repeatable frames, as we showcase in a selection of 3D vision and shape analysis applications where we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in a variety of challenging settings."}}

Given two 3D shapes, RBC seeks segments/regions on these shapes that can be reliably put in correspondence. The problem thus consists both in finding the regions and determining the correspondences between them. This problem statement is similar to that of \u201cbiclustering \u201d, implying that RBC can be cast as a biclustering problem. Here, we exploit this implication by tackling RBC via a novel biclustering approach, called S4B (spatially smooth spike and slab biclustering), which: (i) casts the problem in a probabilistic low-rank matrix factorization perspective; (ii) uses a spike and slab prior to induce sparsity; (iii) is enriched with a spatial smoothness prior, based on geodesic distances, encouraging nearby vertices to belong to the same bicluster. This type of spatial prior cannot be used in classical biclustering techniques. We test the proposed approach on the FAUST dataset, outperforming both state-of-the-art RBC techniques and classical biclustering methods."}}

However, most of the recent solutions in feature selection are not robust across different and heterogeneous set of data. In this paper, we address this issue proposing a robust probabilistic latent graph-based feature selection algorithm that performs the ranking step while considering all the possible subsets of features, as paths on a graph, bypassing the combinatorial problem analytically. An appealing characteristic of the approach is that it aims to discover an abstraction behind low-level sensory data, that is, relevancy. Relevancy is modelled as a latent variable in a PLSA-inspired generative process that allows the investigation of the importance of a feature when injected into an arbitrary set of cues. The proposed method has been tested on ten diverse benchmarks, and compared against eleven state of the art feature selection methods. Results show that the proposed approach attains the highest performance levels across many different scenarios and difficulties, thereby confirming its strong robustness while setting a new state of the art in feature selection domain."}}

In this paper, we propose a feature selection method exploiting the convergence properties of power series of matrices, and introducing the concept of infinite feature selection (Inf-FS). Considering a selection of features as a path among feature distributions and letting these paths tend to an infinite number permits the investigation of the importance (relevance and redundancy) of a feature when injected into an arbitrary set of cues. Ranking the importance individuates candidate features, which turn out to be effective from a classification point of view, as proved by a thoroughly experimental section. The Inf-FS has been tested on thirteen diverse benchmarks, comparing against filters, embedded methods, and wrappers, in all the cases we achieve top performances, notably on the classification tasks of PASCAL VOC 2007-2012."}}

The key idea is to transform the shape into a biological sequence and take advantage of bioinformatics tools for sequence alignment to improve shape matching. In order to extract a reliable ordering of mesh vertices we employ the spectral-based sequencing method derived from the well known Fiedler Vector. Local geometric features are then collected and quantized into a finite set of discrete values in analogy with nucleotide or aminoacid sequence. Two standard biological sequence matching strategies are employed aiming at evaluating both local and global alignment methods. Preliminary experiments are performed on standard non-rigid shape datasets by showing promising results in comparison with other methods."}}
