In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution to improve seasonal relevance in product search by incorporating seasonality into language models for semantic matching. We first identify seasonal queries and products by analyzing implicit seasonal contexts through time-series analysis over the past year. Then we introduce explicit seasonal contexts by enhancing the query representation with a season token according to when the query is issued. A new season-enhanced BERT model (SE-BERT) is also proposed to learn the semantic similarity between the resulting seasonal queries and products. SE-BERT utilizes Multi-modal Adaption Gate (MAG) to augment the season-enhanced semantic embedding with other contextual information such as product price and review counts for robust relevance prediction. To better align with the ranking objective, a listwise loss function (neural NDCG) is used to regularize learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms existing solutions for query-product relevance prediction in terms of NDCG and Price Weighted Purchases (PWP)."}}

In this work, we present a deep learning based online clustering method to jointly learn fine-grained fashion representations for all attributes at both instance and cluster level, where the attribute-specific cluster centers are online estimated. Based on the similarity between fine-grained representations and cluster centers, attribute-specific embedding spaces are further segmented into class-specific embedding spaces for fine-grained fashion retrieval. To better regulate the learning process, we design a three-stage learning scheme, to progressively incorporate different supervisions at both instance and cluster level, from both original and augmented data, and with ground-truth and pseudo labels. Experiments on FashionAI and DARN datasets in the retrieval task demonstrated the efficacy of our method compared with competing baselines."}}

Such subcellular localizations can change in response to intracellular and extracellular cues, which is an important way to regulate the behavior and morphology of the cell. Therefore, segmentation and tracking of these supramolecular complexes are critical in understanding gene functions and regulations. Proteins that form discrete puncta or clusters can be tracked for a long period of time. However, segmentation and tracking become challenging when protein complexes undergo quick repositioning and remodeling such as assembly, disassembly, fusion, and split. In this paper, we first use deep learning methods to segment and track protein clusters with changing morphology, size, and intensity in hyperdimensional biological images. Using the segmentation and tracking results, we reconstruct the life paths and family tree of the protein clusters by integrating fusion and split events. Based on the family trees, various quantitative analyses can be performed including temporal correlations between the tracked protein and its interacting protein complexes. The effectiveness of the proposed method for analyzing subcellular proteins is confirmed through the evaluation using the two-channel 3D fluorescent microscopy time-lapse videos (5D images) of developing Drosophila embryos."}}

Exploding amount of imaging data has been collected whereas efficient and effective computational tools to extract information from them are still lagged behind. This largely is due to the challenges in analyzing biological data. Interesting biological structures are not only small but often are morphologically irregular and highly dynamic. Tracking cells in live organisms has been studied for years as a sophisticated mission in bioinformatics. However, existing tracking methods for cells are not effective in tracking subcellular structures, such as protein complexes, which feature in continuous morphological changes, such as split and merge, in addition to fast migration and complex motion. In this paper, we first define the problem of multi-object portion tracking to model protein object tracking process. A multi-object tracking method with portion matching is proposed based on 3D segmentation results. The proposed method distills deep feature maps from deep networks, then recognizes and matches objects' portions using extended search. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method achieves 2.98% higher on consistent tracking accuracy and 35.48% higher on event identification accuracy."}}

To solve this problem, a self error detection and correction based on Error Correcting Output Code (SEDC-ECOC) method is proposed in this paper. The SEDC-ECOC method works in two stages. In the first stage, the distance between each sample and each class is measured using ECOC, which provides the base of error detection and correction. In the second stage, SVM ECOC conducts further correction as well as plays the role of classification layer in deep networks. Having the advantages of simple construction and independence from deep networks, the SEDC-ECOC method can be applied with different convolutional neural networks. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high correction performance for MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Up to 56.09% and 92.11% erroneous sample labels are corrected by applying the proposed method once and twice respectively to noisy labels."}}

In the course of healing, WBCs exhibit dynamic cellular response and undergo multiple protein expression changes. The progress of healing can be analyzed by quantifying the number of WBCs or the amount of specific proteins in light microscopic images obtained at different time points after injury. In this paper, we propose an automated quantifying and analysis framework to analyze WBCs using light microscopic images of uninjured and injured muscles. The proposed framework is based on the Localized Iterative Otsu's threshold method with muscle edge detection and region of interest extraction. Compared with the threshold methods used in ImageJ, the LI Otsu's threshold method has high resistance to no-object area and achieves better accuracy. The CD68-positive cell results are presented for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed work."}}
