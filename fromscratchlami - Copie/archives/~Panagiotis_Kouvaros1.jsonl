Given the safety-critical nature of the applications involved, stringent safety requirements must be met by these networks. In this work we present a formal study of two neural network-based systems developed by Boeing. The Venus verifier is used to analyse the conditions under which these systems can operate safely, or generate counterexamples that show when safety cannot be guaranteed. Our results confirm the applicability of formal verification to the settings considered."}}

We propose OSIP, an abstraction method based on symbolic interval propagation in which the choice of the ReLU relaxation at each node is determined via optimisation. We present an implementation of OSIP on top of Venus, a publicly available toolkit for complete verification of neural networks. In the experiments reported, OSIP calculated bounds that were tighter than the state-of-the-art on ReLU networks from the first competition for neural network verification. As a case study we apply the method for the verification of VGG16, a deep, high-dimensional, 300,000 node-strong model used for object classification in autonomous vehicles against local robustness properties. We demonstrate that OSIP could verify the correctness of the model against perturbations that are larger than what can be analysed with the present state-of-the-art."}}

The improved tightness is the result of the combination between semidefinite relaxations and linear cuts. We obtain a computationally efficient method by decomposing the semidefinite formulation into layerwise constraints. By leveraging on chordal graph decompositions, we show that the formulation here presented is provably tighter than current approaches. Experiments on a set of benchmark networks show that the approach here proposed enables the verification of more instances compared to other relaxation methods. The results also demonstrate that the SDP relaxation here proposed is one order of magnitude faster than previous SDP methods."}}

The method implements branching on the ReLU states on the basis of a notion of dependency between the nodes. This results in dividing the original verification problem into a set of sub-problems whose MILP formulations require fewer integrality constraints. We evaluate the method on all of the ReLU-based fully connected networks from the first competition for neural network verification. The experimental results obtained show 145% performance gains over the present state-of-the-art in complete verification."}}
