Despite many years of progress, it is still a difficult problem due to enormous uncertainties in real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose a robust anchor-free based tracking model with uncertainty estimation. Within the model, a new datadriven uncertainty estimation strategy is proposed to generate uncertainty-aware features with promising discriminative and descriptive power. Then, a simple yet effective pyramid-wise cross correlation operation is constructed to extract multi-scale semantic features that provide rich correlation information for uncertainty-aware estimation and thus enhances the tracking robustness. Finally, a semantic consistency checking branch is designed to further estimate uncertainty of output results from the classification and regression branches by adaptively generating semantically consistent labels. Experiments on six benchmarks (i.e., OTB100, VOT2018, VOT2020, TrackingNet, GOT-10K and LaSOT) show the competing performance of our tracker with 130 FPS."}}

Consequently, the former fails to exploit rich global context information due to the limited receptive field, while the latter suffers from the deficiencies in constructing the local relationship among neighboring regions. To address this issue, we propose the SiamPIN tracker, based on our Parallel Interaction Network. It consists of two effective modules, namely Global Aggregation\nBlock (GAB) and Local Process Block (LPB). GAB perceives the global context to capture the long-range spatial dependency through a transformer-based architecture. Meanwhile, LPB performs local information extraction using a CNN model to retain the detailed appearance information of the target. These two modules are connected consecutively to compose a TransConv unit block, which transmits the global context information to the local feature extraction procedure, hence enables the interaction of global-local information flow. Several such blocks are cascaded so that our model can learn to aggregate local and context information interactively. The proposed tracker achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on six benchmark datasets, while maintaining a real time running speed."}}

To overcome this challenge, most\nexisting methods adopt either multi-scale search or anchor-based schemes, which use a predefined search space in a handcrafted way\nand therefore limit their performance in complicated scenes. To address this problem, recent anchor-free based trackers have been\nproposed without using prior scale or anchor information. However, an inconsistency problem between classification and regression\ndegrades the tracking performance. To address the above issues, we propose a simple yet effective tracker (named Siamese Box\nAdaptive Network, SiamBAN) to learn a target-aware scale handling schema in a data-driven manner. Our basic idea is to predict the\ntarget boxes in a per-pixel fashion through a fully convolutional network, which is anchor-free. Specifically, SiamBAN divides the\ntracking problem into classification and regression tasks, which directly predict objectiveness and regress bounding boxes, respectively.\nA no-prior box design is proposed to avoid tuning hyper-parameters related to candidate boxes, which makes SiamBAN more flexible.\nSiamBAN further uses a target-aware branch to address the inconsistency problem. Experiments on benchmarks including VOT2018,\nVOT2019, OTB100, UAV123, LaSOT and TrackingNet show that SiamBAN achieves promising performance and runs at 35 FPS"}}

In this article, we consider a large-scale subspace clustering (LS\u00b2C) problem, that is, partitioning million data points with a millon dimensions. To address this, we explore an independent distributed and parallel framework by dividing big data/variable matrices and regularization by both columns and rows. Specifically, LS\u00b2C is independently decomposed into many subproblems by distributing those matrices into different machines by columns since the regularization of the code matrix is equal to a sum of that of its submatrices (e.g., square-of-Frobenius/\u2113\u2081-norm). Consensus optimization is designed to solve these subproblems in a parallel way for saving communication costs. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees that LS\u00b2C can recover consensus subspace representations of high-dimensional data points under broad conditions. Compared with the state-of-the-art LS\u00b2C methods, our approach achieves better clustering results in public datasets, including a million images and videos."}}

However, most state-of-the-art long-term trackers (e.g., Pseudo and re-detecting based ones) do not take all three key properties into account and therefore may either be time-consuming or drift to distractors. To ad- dress the issues, we propose a two-task tracking frame- work (named DMTrack), which utilizes two core compo- nents (i.e., one-shot detection and re-identification (re-id) association) to achieve distractor-aware fast tracking via Dynamic convolutions (d-convs) and Multiple object track- ing (MOT) philosophy. To achieve precise and fast global detection, we construct a lightweight one-shot detector us- ing a novel dynamic convolutions generation method, which provides a unified and more flexible way for fusing target information into the search field. To distinguish the tar- get from distractors, we resort to the philosophy of MOT to reason distractors explicitly by maintaining all potential similarities\u2019 tracklets. Benefited from the strength of high recall detection and explicit object association, our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LaSOT, Ox- UvA, TLP, VOT2018LT and VOT2019LT benchmarks and runs in real-time (3x faster than comparisons)."}}

To this end, we propose a novel Siamese relation network, which introduces two efficient modules, i.e. Relation Detector (RD) and Refinement Module (RM). RD performs in a meta- learning way to obtain a learning ability to filter the dis- tractors from the background while RM aims to effectively integrate the proposed RD into the Siamese framework to generate accurate tracking result. Moreover, to further im- prove the discriminability and robustness of the tracker, we introduce a contrastive training strategy that attempts not only to learn matching the same target but also to learn how to distinguish the different objects. Therefore, our tracker can achieve accurate tracking results when fac- ing background clutters, fast motion, and occlusion.

However, most existing methods still retain on exploiting a relatively coarse-grained local information. Such information may include redundant backgrounds that are sensitive to the apparently similar persons when facing challenging scenarios like complex poses, inaccurate detection, occlusion and misalignment. In this paper we propose a novel Fine-Grained Spatial Alignment Model (FGSAM) to mine fine-grained local information to handle the aforementioned challenge effectively. In particular, we first design a pose resolve net with channel parse blocks (CPB) to extract pose information in pixel-level. This network allows the proposed model to be robust to complex pose variations while suppressing the redundant backgrounds caused by inaccurate detection and occlusion. Given the extracted pose information, a locally reinforced alignment mode is further proposed to address the misalignment problem between different local parts by considering different local parts along with attribute infor- mation in a fine-grained way. Finally, a focal triplet loss is designed to effectively train the entire model, which imposes a constraint on the intra-class and an adaptively weight adjustment mechanism to handle the hard sample problem. Extensive evalu- ations and analysis on Market1501, DukeMTMC-reid and PETA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FGSAM in coping with the problems of misalignment, occlusion and complex poses."}}

However, most deep learning-based trackers neglect localization accuracy in the evaluation process of candidates. What\u2019s more, they usually over-rely on the discriminative features in a single frame in the training process. Consequently, they may fail when the discriminative features are occluded or changed in the tracking phase. In this paper, we propose a novel localization-aware meta tracker (LMT) guided with adversarial features to address the above issues. First of all, we design a novel intersection over union guided method to effectively balance the problem of classification and localization accuracy. To further improve the robustness of our classifier, we creatively use adversarial features during offline training phase. Those adversarial features can effectively guide the classifier in learning how to better deal with the situation where the discriminative features are occluded or changed. Finally, benefiting from meta learning, our algorithm only needs to perform one iterative update on the first frame and it can perform well on the tracking sceneries. The extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our LMT compared with the state- of-the-art trackers on three benchmarks: OTB-2015, VOT-2016, and VOT-2018."}}

In particular, existing black-box attacks suffer from the need for excessive queries, as it is non-trivial to \ufb01nd an appropriate direction to optimize in the high-dimensional space. In this paper, we propose Projection & Probability-driven Black-box Attack (PPBA) to tackle this problem by reducing the solution space and providing better optimization. For reducing the solution space, we \ufb01rst model the adversarial perturbation optimization problem as a process of recovering frequency-sparse perturbations with compressed sensing, under the setting that random noise in the low-frequency space is more likely to be adversarial. We then propose a simple method to construct a low-frequency constrained sensing matrix, which works as a plug-and-play projection matrix to reduce the dimensionality. Such a sensing matrix is shown to be \ufb02exible enough to be integrated into existing methods like NES and Bandits$_{TD}$. For better optimization, we perform a random walk with a probability-driven strategy, which utilizes all queries over the whole progress to make full use of the sensing matrix for a less query budget. Extensive experiments show that our method requires at most 24% fewer queries with a higher attack success rate compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, the attack method is evaluated on the real-world online service, i.e., Google Cloud Vision API, which further demonstrates our practical potentials."}}
