The deep neural network models provide the stronger representation ability and faster reconstruction compared with \u201cshallow\u201d optimization-based methods. However, in the existing deep-based CS-MRI models, the high-level semantic supervision information from massive segmentation-labels in MRI dataset is overlooked. In this paper, we proposed a segmentation-aware deep fusion network called SADFN for compressed sensing MRI. The multilayer feature aggregation (MLFA) method is introduced here to fuse all the features from different layers in the segmentation network. Then, the aggregated feature maps containing semantic information are provided to each layer in the reconstruction network with a feature fusion strategy. This guarantees the reconstruction network is aware of the different regions in the image it reconstructs, simplifying the function mapping. We prove the utility of the cross-layer and cross-task information fusion strategy by comparative study. Extensive experiments on brain segmentation benchmark MRBrainS and BratS15 validated that the proposed SADFN model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in compressed sensing MRI. This paper provides a novel approach to guide the low-level visual task using the information from mid- or high-level task."}}

Conventional CS-MRI algorithms usually exploit the sparse nature of MRI in an iterative manner. These optimization-based CS-MRI methods are often time-consuming at test time, and are based on \ufb01xed transform bases or shallow dictionaries, which limits modeling capacity. Recently, deep models have been introduced to the CS-MRI problem. One main challenge for CS-MRI methods based on deep learning is the trade off between model performance and network size. We propose a recursive dilated network (RDN) for CS-MRI that achieves good performance while reducing the number of network parameters. We adopt dilated convolutions in each recursive block to aggregate multi-scale information within the MRI. We also adopt a modi\ufb01ed shortcut strategy to help features \ufb02ow into deeper layers. Experimental results show that the proposed RDN model achieves state-of-the-art performance in CS-MRI while using far fewer parameters than previously required."}}
