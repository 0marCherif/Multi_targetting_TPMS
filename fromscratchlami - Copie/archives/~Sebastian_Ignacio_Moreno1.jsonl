To address this problem, Chile established boat fishing quotas that are inspected on-site but at random, verifying that their cargo corresponds to the tons of fishes indicated in their reports. However, this is inefficient and fraudulent fishermen have not been identified, increasing the necessity of a focused inspection. This paper proposes a flags system based on statistical data analysis, able to find potential fraudulent fishing boats. The flag system is built based on several hypothesis tests that evaluate significant differences in two aspects: fish frequency and cargo container utilization, where any significant difference is considered a new flag. The results show multiple boats with different behaviors for on-site versus documented reports, implying that the proposed flag system can point out fishing vessels with highly suspicious behavior."}}

When the number of tickets and programmers are significant, the assignment becomes a time-consuming task. To handle this issue, companies develop software to manage the generation, the tracking, and the assignment of tickets to employees. Current advances in machine learning can automate the HDTAP, and make it more efficient. In this paper, we propose the use of an ensemble model based on Stacked Generalization that replicates the expert behavior by reducing the classification errors. The model is tested using data of a Chilean company that develops management software for hospitals. The results show that our proposal obtains the best accuracy and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$F_{1}$</tex> score outperforming, consistently, most state-of-the-art models."}}

In this paper, we propose a new clustering model called Origin-Destination-means (OD-means). OD-means is a hierarchical adaptive k-means algorithm based on origin-destination pairs. In the first layer of the hierarchy, the clusters are separated automatically based on the variation of the within-cluster distance of each cluster until convergence. The second layer of the hierarchy corresponds to the sub clustering process of small clusters based on the distance between the origin and destination of each cluster. The algorithm is tested on a large data set of taxi GPS data from Santiago, Chile, and compared to other clustering algorithms. In contrast to them, our proposed model is capable of detecting general and local travel patterns in the city due to its hierarchical structure."}}

From these data, different measures can be computed. In particular, inter-concept similarity is an important variable used in experimental studies. Among possible similarity measures, the cosine of conceptual property frequency vectors seems to be a de facto standard. However, there is a lack of comparative studies that test the merit of different similarity measures when computed from property frequency data. The current work compares four different similarity measures (cosine, correlation, Euclidean and Chebyshev) and five different types of data structures. To that end, we compared the informational content (i.e., entropy) delivered by each of those 4\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009=\u200920 combinations, and used a clustering procedure as a concrete example of how informational content affects statistical analyses. Our results lead us to conclude that similarity measures computed from lower-dimensional data fare better than those calculated from higher-dimensional data, and suggest that researchers should be more aware of data sparseness and dimensionality, and their consequences for statistical analyses."}}

These geographic areas, usually called districts or territories, should comply with operational rules while maximizing potential sales and minimizing incurred costs. Consequently, territorial design can be seen as a clustering problem in which clients are geographically grouped according to certain criteria which usually vary according to specific objectives and requirements (e.g. costs, delivery times, workload, number of clients, etc.). In this work, we provide a novel hybrid approach for territorial design by means of combining a K-means-based approach for clustering construction with an optimization framework. The K-means approach incorporates the novelty of using tour length approximation techniques to satisfy the conditions of a pork and poultry distributor based in the region of Valpara\u00edso in Chile. The resulting method proves to be robust in the experiments performed, and the Valpara\u00edso case study shows significant savings when compared to the original solution used by the company."}}

PGGMs are statistical methods that model the network distribution and match common characteristics of real-world networks. Specifically, we show that most PGGMs cannot reflect the natural variability in graph properties observed across multiple networks because their edge generation process assumes independence among edges.
