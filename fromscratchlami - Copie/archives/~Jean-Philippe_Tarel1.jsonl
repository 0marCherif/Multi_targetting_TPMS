The Naka-Rushton function is used to modulate the atmospheric veil according to empirical observations on synthetic foggy images. The parameters of this function are set from features of the input image. The algorithm is able to take into account different kinds of airborne particles and different illumination conditions. The proposed method is extended to nighttime and underwater images by computing the atmospheric veil on each color channel. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the benefit of the proposed algorithm."}}

In the visible spectrum, fog and haze decrease the visibility of distant objects. Thus, the objective of the visibility restoration is to remove as much as possible the effect of the fog within the image. Infrared sensors are more and more used in automotive and aviation industries but the effect of fog and haze is not restricted to the visible spectrum and also applies in the infrared band. After recalling the effects of fog in the common sub-bands of the infrared spectrum, we tested if the approach used for single image defogging in the visible spectrum might also work for infrared. This led us to propose a new approach of single image defogging for Long-Wavelength Infra-Red (LWIR) or Thermal Infra-Red. Several experiments are presented showing that the proposed algorithm offers interesting results not only for fog and haze but for bad weather conditions in general, during day and night."}}

Moreover, we show that the proposed operator is relatively robust to strong noise on one of the compared images. The new operator can be used for background subtraction which inherits its invariance properties. The useful properties of the proposed operators are illustrated in the experiments."}}

The training data consists from 55 hazy images (with dense haze generated in an indoor or outdoor environment) and their corresponding ground truth (haze-free) images of the same scene. The dense haze has been produced using a professional haze/fog generator that imitates the real conditions of haze scenes. The evaluation consists from the comparison of the dehazed images with the ground truth images. The dehazing process was learnable through provided pairs of haze-free and hazy train images. There were 270 registered participants and 23 teams competed in the final testing phase. They gauge the state-of-the-art in image dehazing."}}

Visibility distance is thus of importance for road engineers and authorities. While visibility distance criteria are routinely taken into account in road design, only a few systems exist for estimating it on existing road networks. Most existing systems comprise a target vehicle followed at a constant distance by an observer vehicle, which only allows to check if a given, fixed visibility distance is available. We propose two new approaches that allow estimating the maximum available visibility distance, involving only one vehicle and based on different sensor technologies, namely binocular stereovision and 3D range sensing (LIDAR). The first approach is based on the processing of two views taken by digital cameras onboard the diagnostic vehicle. The main stages of the process are: road segmentation, edge registration between the two views, road profile 3D reconstruction and finally, maximal road visibility distance estimation. The second approach involves the use of a Terrestrial LIDAR Mobile Mapping System. The triangulated 3D model of the road and its surroundings provided by the system is used to simulate targets at different distances, which allows estimating the maximum geometric visibility distance along the pathway. These approaches were developed in the context of the SARI-VIZIR PREDIT project. Both approaches are described, evaluated and compared. Their pros and cons with respect to vehicle following systems are also discussed."}}
