Over the years, numerous methods have been proposed for time series anomaly and intrusion detection using deep learning-based methods. Many of these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, giving the false impression that these systems are robust and deployable in practical and industrial scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art anomaly and intrusion detection methods can be easily fooled by adding adversarial perturbations to the sensor data. We use different scoring metrics such as prediction errors, anomaly, and classification scores over several public and private datasets belong to aerospace applications, automobiles, server machines, and cyber-physical systems. We evaluate state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) methods, which claim to be robust against anomalies and intrusions, and find their performance can drop to as low as 0\\% under adversarial attacks from Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) methods.  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate the vulnerabilities of anomaly and intrusion detection systems against adversarial attacks.

Deepfakes can cause severe security and privacy issues as they can be used to impersonate a person's identity in a video by replacing his/her face with another person's face. Recently, a new problem of generating synthesized human voice of a person is emerging, where AI-based deep learning models can synthesize any person's voice requiring just a few seconds of audio. With the emerging threat of impersonation attacks using deepfake audios and videos, a new generation of deepfake detectors is needed to focus on both video and audio collectively. To develop a competent deepfake detector, a large amount of high-quality data is typically required to capture real-world (or practical) scenarios.\nExisting deepfake datasets either contain deepfake videos or audios, which are racially biased as well. As a result, it is critical to develop a high-quality video and audio deepfake dataset that can be used to detect both audio and video deepfakes simultaneously. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Audio-Video Deepfake dataset, FakeAVCeleb, which contains not only deepfake videos but also respective synthesized lip-synced fake audios. We generate this dataset using the current most popular deepfake generation methods. We selected real YouTube videos of celebrities with four ethnic backgrounds to develop a more realistic multimodal dataset that addresses racial bias, and further help develop multimodal deepfake detectors. We performed several experiments using state-of-the-art detection methods to evaluate our deepfake dataset and demonstrate the challenges and usefulness of our multimodal Audio-Video deepfake dataset."}}

Measuring Commercial Face Recognition Web APIs under Deepfake Impersonation Attack", "abstract": "Recently, significant advancements have been made in face recognition technologies using Deep Neural Networks. As a result, companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Naver offer highly accurate commercial face recognition web services for diverse applications to meet the end-user needs. Naturally, however, such technologies are threatened persistently, as virtually any individual can quickly implement impersonation attacks. In particular, these attacks can be a significant threat for authentication and identification services, which heavily rely on their underlying face recognition technologies' accuracy and robustness. Despite its gravity, the issue regarding deepfake abuse using commercial web APIs and their robustness has not yet been thoroughly investigated. This work provides a measurement study on the robustness of black-box commercial face recognition APIs against Deepfake Impersonation (DI) attacks using celebrity recognition APIs as an example case study. We use five deepfake datasets, two of which are created by us and planned to be released. More specifically, we measure attack performance based on two scenarios (targeted and non-targeted) and further analyze the differing system behaviors using fidelity, confidence, and similarity metrics. Accordingly, we demonstrate how vulnerable face recognition technologies from popular companies are to DI attack, achieving maximum success rates of 78.0% and 99.9% for targeted (i.e., precise match) and non-targeted (i.e., match with any celebrity) attacks, respectively. Moreover, we propose practical defense strategies to mitigate DI attacks, reducing the attack success rates to as low as 0% and 0.02% for targeted and non-targeted attacks, respectively."}}

This motivates us to develop a generalized model to detect different types of deepfakes. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a practical digital forensic tool to detect different types of deepfakes simultaneously and propose Transfer learning-based Autoencoder with Residuals (TAR). The ultimate goal of our work is to develop a unified model to detect various types of deepfake videos with high accuracy, with only a small number of training samples that can work well in real-world settings.

In addition to image editing tools, creating natural-looking fake human faces can be easily achieved by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, malicious use of these new media generation technologies can lead to severe problems, such as the development of fake pornography, defamation, or fraud. In this paper, we introduce a novel Handcrafted Facial Manipulation (HFM) image dataset and soft computing neural network models (Shallow-FakeFaceNets) with an efficient facial manipulation detection pipeline. Our neural network classifier model, Shallow-FakeFaceNet (SFFN), shows the ability to focus on the manipulated facial landmarks to detect fake images. The detection pipeline only relies on detecting fake facial images based on RGB information, not leveraging any metadata, which can be easily manipulated. Our results show that our method achieves the best performance of 72.52% in Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC), gaining 3.99% F1-score and 2.91% AUROC on detecting handcrafted fake facial images, and 93.99% on detecting small GAN-generated fake images, gaining 1.98% F1-score and 10.44% AUROC compared to the best performing state-of-the-art classifier. This study is targeted for developing an automated defense mechanism to combat fake images used in different online services and applications, leveraging our state-of-the-art hand-crafted fake facial dataset (HFM) and the neural network classifier Shallow-FakeFaceNet (SFFN).

Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines how AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data in the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as deepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current multimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can detect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to their reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in this work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks' learning dynamics, emphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose Continual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the concept of Continual Learning (CL), Representation Learning (RL), and Knowledge Distillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain adaptation tasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets, while effectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student model setting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method is efficient at domain adaptation to detect low-quality deepfakes videos and GAN-generated images from several datasets, outperforming the-state-of-art baseline methods."}}

We use FReTAL to perform domain adaptation tasks on new deepfake datasets while minimizing catastrophic forgetting. Our student model can quickly adapt to new types of deepfake by distilling knowledge from a pre-trained teacher model and applying transfer learning without using source domain data during domain adaptation.
