The exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff strategy is a well-known technique for online learning with incomplete feedback (i.e., bandit setup). Banditron [8], a multi-class online learning algorithm for bandit setting, maximizes the run-time gain by balancing between exploration and exploitation with a fixed tradeoff parameter. The performance of Banditron can be quite sensitive to the choice of the tradeoff parameter and therefore effective algorithms to automatically tune this parameter is desirable. In this paper, we propose three learning strategies to automatically adjust the tradeoff parameter for Banditron. Our extensive empirical study with multiple real-world data sets verifies the efficacy of the proposed approach in learning the exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff parameter."}}

The ranking algorithms are often evaluated using Information Retrieval measures, such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain [1] and Mean Average Precision [2]. Until recently, most learning to rank algorithms were not using a loss function related to the above mentioned evaluation measures. The main difficulty in direct optimization of these measures is that they depend on the ranks of documents, not the numerical values output by the ranking function. We propose a probabilistic framework that addresses this challenge by optimizing the expectation of NDCG over all the possible permutations of documents. A relaxation strategy is used to approximate the average of NDCG over the space of permutation, and a bound optimization approach is proposed to make the computation efficient. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art ranking algorithms on several benchmark data sets."}}

We are, particularly, interested in learning a better ranking function using two complementary sources of information, ranking information given by the existing ranking function (i.e., a base ranker) and that obtained from users' feedbacks. This problem is very important in information retrieval where the feedback is gradually collected. The key challenge in combining the two sources of information arises from the fact that the ranking information presented by the base ranker tends to be imperfect and the ranking information obtained from users' feedbacks tends to be noisy. We present a novel boosting framework for ranking refinement that can effectively leverage the uses of the two sources of information. Our empirical study shows that the proposed algorithm is effective for ranking refinement, and furthermore significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms that incorporate the outputs from the base ranker as an additional feature."}}

It extends the theory of support vector machine to unsupervised learning. Despite its good performance, there are three ma jor problems with maximum margin clustering that question its efficiency for real-world applications. First, it is computationally expensive and difficult to scale to large-scale datasets because the number of parameters in maximum margin clustering is quadratic in the number of examples. Second, it requires data preprocessing to ensure that any clustering boundary will pass through the origins, which makes it unsuitable for clustering unbalanced dataset. Third, it is sensitive to the choice of kernel functions, and requires external procedure to determine the appropriate values for the parameters of kernel functions. In this paper, we propose \"generalized maximum margin clustering\" framework that addresses the above three problems simultaneously. The new framework generalizes the maximum margin clustering algorithm by allowing any clustering boundaries including those not passing through the origins. It significantly improves the computational efficiency by reducing the number of parameters. Furthermore, the new framework is able to automatically determine the appropriate kernel matrix without any labeled data. Finally, we show a formal connection between maximum margin clustering and spectral clustering. We demonstrate the efficiency of the generalized maximum margin clustering algorithm using both synthetic datasets and real datasets from the UCI repository."}}
