The shared directed edges and links of a subclass of Markov equivalent DAGs refined due to background knowledge can be represented by a causal maximally partially directed acyclic graph (MPDAG). In this paper, we first provide a sound and complete graphical characterization of causal MPDAGs and give a minimal representation of a causal MPDAG. Then, we introduce a novel representation called direct causal clause (DCC) to represent all types of causal background knowledge in a unified form. Using DCCs, we study the consistency and equivalency of causal background knowledge and show that any causal background knowledge set can be equivalently decomposed into a causal MPDAG plus a minimal residual set of DCCs. Polynomial-time algorithms are also provided for checking the consistency, equivalency, and finding the decomposed MPDAG and residual DCCs. Finally, with causal background knowledge, we prove a sufficient and necessary condition to identify causal effects and surprisingly find that the identifiability of causal effects only depends on the decomposed MPDAG. We also develop a local IDA-type algorithm to estimate the possible values of an unidentifiable effect. Simulations suggest that causal background knowledge can significantly improve the identifiability of causal effects."}}

We propose a local approach to identify whether a variable is a cause of a given target under the framework of causal graphical models of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In general, the causal relation between two variables may not be identifiable from observational data as many causal DAGs encoding different causal relations are Markov equivalent. In this paper, we first introduce a sufficient and necessary graphical condition to check the existence of a causal path from a variable to a target in every Markov equivalent DAG. Next, we provide local criteria for identifying whether a variable is a cause/non-cause of a target based only on the local structure instead of the entire graph. Finally, we propose a local learning algorithm for this causal query via learning the local structure of the variable and some additional statistical independence tests related to the target. Simulation studies show that our local algorithm is efficient and effective, compared with other state-of-art methods."}}

In this paper, we propose to exploit a low rank assumption regarding the (weighted) adjacency matrix of a DAG causal model to mitigate this problem. We demonstrate how to adapt existing methods for causal structure learning to take advantage of this assumption and establish several useful results relating interpretable graphical conditions to the low rank assumption. In particular, we show that the maximum rank is highly related to hubs, suggesting that scale-free networks which are frequently encountered in real applications tend to be low rank. We also provide empirical evidence for the utility of our low rank adaptations, especially on relatively large and dense graphs. Not only do they outperform existing algorithms when the low rank condition is satisfied, the performance is also  competitive even though the rank of the underlying  DAG may not be as low as is assumed."}}
