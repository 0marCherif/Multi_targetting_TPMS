Few researches about NR-PCQA are carried out due to the lack of a large-scale PCQA\ndataset. In this paper, we first build a large-scale PCQA dataset named LS-PCQA, which includes 104 reference\npoint clouds and more than 22,000 distorted samples. In the dataset, each reference point cloud is augmented\nwith 31 types of impairments (e.g., Gaussian noise, contrast distortion, local missing, and compression loss) at 7\ndistortion levels. Besides, each distorted point cloud is assigned with a pseudo quality score as its substitute\nof Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Inspired by the hierarchical perception system and considering the intrinsic\nattributes of point clouds, we propose a NR metric ResSCNN based on sparse convolutional neural network\n(CNN) to accurately estimate the subjective quality of point clouds. We conduct several experiments to evaluate\nthe performance of the proposed NR metric. The results demonstrate that ResSCNN exhibits the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance among all the existing NR-PCQA metrics and even outperforms some FR metrics. The\ndataset presented in this work will be made publicly accessible at http://smt.sjtu.edu.cn. The source code for the\nproposed ResSCNN can be found at https://github.com/lyp22/ResSCNN."}}
