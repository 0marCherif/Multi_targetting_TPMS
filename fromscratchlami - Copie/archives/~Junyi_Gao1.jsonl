However, factors like sampling distribution imbalance can lead to issues of bias and unfairness in healthcare data. Sensitive attributes, such as race, gender, age, and medical condition, are characteristics of individuals that are commonly associated with discrimination or bias. In healthcare AI, these attributes can play a significant role in determining the quality of care that individuals receive. For example, minority groups often receive fewer procedures and poorer-quality medical care than white individuals in US. Therefore, detecting and mitigating bias in data is crucial to enhancing health equity. Bias mitigation methods include pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. Among them, Reweighting (RW) is a widely used pre-processing method that performs well in balancing machine learning performance and fairness performance. RW adjusts the weights for samples within each (group, label) combination, where these weights are utilized in loss functions. However, RW is limited to considering only a single sensitive attribute when mitigating bias and assumes that each sensitive attribute is equally important. This may result in potential inaccuracies when addressing intersectional bias. To address these limitations, we propose M3Fair, a multi-level and multi-sensitive-attribute reweighting method by extending the RW method to multiple sensitive attributes at multiple levels. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that the approach is effective, straightforward, and generalizable in addressing the healthcare fairness issues."}}

Predicting mortality risk and identifying modifiable risk factors based on the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) collected along with the follow-up visits are of great importance for personalized medicine and early intervention. Here, our objective is to develop a deep learning model for a real-time, individualized, and interpretable mortality prediction model - AICare. Method and Materials: Our proposed model consists of a multi-channel feature extraction module and an adaptive feature importance recalibration module. AICare explicitly identifies the key features that strongly indicate the outcome prediction for each patient to build the health status embedding individually. This study has collected 13,091 clinical follow-up visits and demographic data of 656 PD patients. To verify the application universality, this study has also collected 4,789 visits of 1,363 hemodialysis dialysis (HD) as an additional experiment dataset to test the prediction performance, which will be discussed in the Appendix. Results: 1) Experiment results show that AICare achieves 81.6%/74.3% AUROC and 47.2%/32.5% AUPRC for the 1-year mortality prediction task on PD/HD dataset respectively, which outperforms the state-of-the-art comparative deep learning models. 2) This study first provides a comprehensive elucidation of the relationship between the causes of mortality in patients with PD and clinical features based on an end-to-end deep learning model. 3) This study first reveals the pattern of variation in the importance of each feature in the mortality prediction based on built-in interpretability. 4) We develop a practical AI-Doctor interaction system to visualize the trajectory of patients' health status and risk indicators."}}

In this work, we propose a real-time population-level disease prediction model which captures data latency (PopNet) and incorporates the updated data for improved predictions. To achieve this goal, PopNet models real-time data and updated data using two separate systems, each capturing spatial and temporal effects using hybrid graph attention networks and recurrent neural networks. PopNet then fuses the two systems using both spatial and temporal latency-aware attentions in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate PopNet on real-world disease datasets and show that PopNet consistently outperforms all baseline disease prediction and general spatial-temporal prediction models, achieving up to 47% lower root mean squared error and 24% lower mean absolute error compared with the best baselines."}}

Many deep learning models have been proposed to conduct clinical predictive tasks such as mortality prediction for COVID-19 patients in intensive care units using Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Despite their initial success in certain clinical applications, there is currently a lack of benchmarking results to achieve a fair comparison so that we can select the optimal model for clinical use. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy between the formulation of traditional prediction tasks and real-world clinical practice in intensive care. To fill these gaps, we propose two clinical prediction tasks, Outcome-specific length-of-stay prediction and Early mortality prediction for COVID-19 patients in intensive care units. The two tasks are adapted from the naive length-of-stay and mortality prediction tasks to accommodate the clinical practice for COVID-19 patients. We propose fair, detailed, open-source data-preprocessing pipelines and evaluate 17 state-of-the-art predictive models on two tasks, including 5 machine learning models, 6 basic deep learning models and 6 deep learning predictive models specifically designed for EHR data. We provide benchmarking results using data from two real-world COVID-19 EHR datasets. One dataset is publicly available without needing any inquiry and another dataset can be accessed on request. We provide fair, reproducible benchmarking results for two tasks. We deploy all experiment results and models on an online platform. We also allow clinicians and researchers to upload their data to the platform and get quick prediction results using our trained models. We hope our efforts can further facilitate deep learning and machine learning research for COVID-19 predictive modeling."}}

Many patients suffer from life-threatening systemic problems and need to be carefully monitored in ICUs. An intelligent prognosis can help physicians take an early intervention, prevent adverse outcomes, and optimize the medical resource allocation, which is urgently needed, especially in this ongoing global pandemic crisis. However, in the early stage of the epidemic outbreak, the data available for analysis is limited due to the lack of effective diagnostic mechanisms, the rarity of the cases, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a distilled transfer learning framework, which leverages the existing publicly available online Electronic Medical Records to enhance the prognosis for inpatients with emerging infectious diseases. It learns to embed the COVID-19-related medical features based on massive existing EMR data. The transferred parameters are further trained to imitate the teacher model\u2019s representation based on distillation, which embeds the health status more comprehensively on the source dataset. We conduct Length-of-Stay prediction experiments for patients in ICUs on real-world COVID-19 datasets. The experiment results indicate that our proposed model consistently outperforms competitive baseline methods. In order to further verify the scalability of o deal with different clinical tasks on different EMR datasets, we conduct an additional mortality prediction experiment on End-Stage Renal Disease datasets. The extensive experiments demonstrate that an benefit the prognosis for emerging pandemics and other diseases with limited EMR."}}
