It reduces the memory footprint and the computational cost at inference, facilitating the deployment of resource-hungry models. However, the parameter perturbations caused by this transformation result in behavioral disparities between the model before and after quantization. For example, a quantized model can misclassify some test-time samples that are otherwise classified correctly. It is not known whether such differences lead to a new security vulnerability. We hypothesize that an adversary may control this disparity to introduce specific behaviors that activate upon quantization. To study this hypothesis, we weaponize quantization-aware training and propose a new training framework to implement adversarial quantization outcomes. Following this framework, we present three attacks we carry out with quantization: (i) an indiscriminate attack for significant accuracy loss; (ii) a targeted attack against specific samples; and (iii) a backdoor attack for controlling the model with an input trigger. We further show that a single compromised model defeats multiple quantization schemes, including robust quantization techniques. Moreover, in a federated learning scenario, we demonstrate that a set of malicious participants who conspire can inject our quantization-activated backdoor. Lastly, we discuss potential counter-measures and show that only re-training consistently removes the attack artifacts.

This enables an adversary to determine whether a data point was in a model's training set by conducting a membership inference attack (MIA). Prior work has conjectured that regularization techniques, which combat overfitting, may also mitigate the leakage. While many regularization mechanisms exist, their effectiveness against MIAs has not been studied systematically, and the resulting privacy properties are not well understood. We explore the lower bound for information leakage that practical attacks can achieve. First, we evaluate the effectiveness of 8 mechanisms in mitigating two recent MIAs, on three standard image classification tasks. We find that certain mechanisms, such as label smoothing, may inadvertently help MIAs. Second, we investigate the potential of improving the resilience to MIAs by combining complementary mechanisms. Finally, we quantify the opportunity of future MIAs to compromise privacy by designing a white-box `distance-to-confident' (DtC) metric, based on adversarial sample crafting. Our metric reveals that, even when existing MIAs fail, the training samples may remain distinguishable from test samples. This suggests that regularization mechanisms can provide a false sense of privacy, even when they appear effective against existing MIAs."}}

Prior taxonomies that focus on specific scenarios, e.g., indiscriminate or targeted, have enabled defenses for the corresponding subset of known attacks. Yet, this introduces an inevitable arms race between adversaries and defenders. In this work, we study the feasibility of an attack-agnostic defense relying on artifacts that are common to all poisoning attacks. Specifically, we focus on a common element between all attacks: they modify gradients computed to train the model. We identify two main artifacts of gradients computed in the presence of poison: (1) their $\\ell_2$ norms have significantly higher magnitudes than those of clean gradients, and (2) their orientation differs from clean gradients. Based on these observations, we propose the prerequisite for a generic poisoning defense: it must bound gradient magnitudes and minimize differences in orientation. We call this gradient shaping. As an exemplar tool to evaluate the feasibility of gradient shaping, we use differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), which clips and perturbs individual gradients during training to obtain privacy guarantees. We find that DP-SGD, even in configurations that do not result in meaningful privacy guarantees, increases the model's robustness to indiscriminate attacks. It also mitigates worst-case targeted attacks and increases the adversary's cost in multi-poison scenarios. The only attack we find DP-SGD to be ineffective against is a strong, yet unrealistic, indiscriminate attack. Our results suggest that, while we currently lack a generic poisoning defense, gradient shaping is a promising direction for future research."}}

This paper presents the first in-depth security analysis of DNN fingerprinting attacks that exploit cache side-channels.  First, we define the threat model for these attacks:  our adversary does not need the ability to query the victim model; instead, she runs a co-located process on the host machine victim \u2019s deep learning  (DL) system is running and passively monitors the accesses of the target functions in the shared framework.  Second, we introduce DeepRecon, an attack that reconstructs the architecture of the victim network by using the internal information extracted via Flush+Reload, a cache side-channel technique. Once the attacker observes function invocations that map directly to architecture attributes of the victim network, the attacker can reconstruct the victim\u2019s entire network architecture.  In our evaluation, we demonstrate that an attacker can accurately reconstruct two complex networks (VGG19 and ResNet50) having only observed one forward propagation. Based on the extracted architecture attributes, we also demonstrate that an attacker can build a meta-model that accurately fingerprints the architecture and family of the pre-trained model in a transfer learning setting. From this meta-model,  we evaluate the importance of the observed attributes in the fingerprinting process. Third, we propose and evaluate new framework-level defense techniques that obfuscate our attacker\u2019s observations. Our empirical security analysis represents a step toward understanding the DNNs\u2019 vulnerability to cache side-channel attacks."}}
