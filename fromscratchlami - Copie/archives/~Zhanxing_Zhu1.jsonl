These are known as adversarial attacks. To counter adversarial attacks, adversarial training formulated as a form of robust optimization has been demonstrated to be effective. However, conducting adversarial training brings much computational overhead compared with standard training. In order to reduce the computational cost, we propose an annealing mechanism, annealing mechanism for adversarial training acceleration (Amata), to reduce the overhead associated with adversarial training. The proposed Amata is provably convergent, well-motivated from the lens of optimal control theory, and can be combined with existing acceleration methods to further enhance performance. It is demonstrated that, on standard datasets, Amata can achieve similar or better robustness with around 1/3\u20131/2 the computational time compared with traditional methods. In addition, Amata can be incorporated into other adversarial training acceleration algorithms (e.g., YOPO, Free, Fast, and ATTA), which leads to a further reduction in computational time on large-scale problems."}}

The graph structure is either given apriori or learned based the similarity between nodes. However, the relationship between multiple time series is typically complicated, for instance, the sum of outflows from upstream nodes may be equal to the inflows of downstream nodes. Such relations widely exist in many real-world multivariate time series forecasting scenarios, yet are far from well studied. In these cases, graph might only be a crude description on the dependency between nodes. To this end, we explore a new framework to model the inter-node relationship in a more precise way based our proposed inductive bias for graphs, Functional Relation Field, where a group of functions parameterized by neural networks are learned to characterize the dependency between multiple time series. These learned functions are versatile: they can then be used to discover the underlying graph structure by identifying the most relevant neighbors of the target node; and on the other hand, the learned functions will form a \u201cfield\u201d where the nodes in the backbone prediction networks are enforced to satisfy the constraints defined by these functions. The experiment is conducted on one toy dataset to show our approach can well recover the true constraint relationship between nodes. And two real-world MiniApp calling traffic and road network datasets are also considered with various different backbone networks. Results show that the prediction error can be reduced remarkably with the aid of the proposed functional relation field framework."}}

It has been used to learn dynamics, solve inverse problems and facilitate design, and is at its inception of impact. Current successes have concentrated on general physics models such as rigid bodies, deformable sheets, etc, assuming relatively simple structures and forces. Their granularity is intrinsically coarse and therefore incapable of modelling complex physical phenomena. Fine-grained models are still to be developed to incorporate sophisticated material structures and force interactions with gradient-based learning. Following this motivation, we propose a new differentiable fabrics model for composite materials such as cloths, where we dive into the granularity of yarns and model individual yarn physics and yarn-to-yarn interactions. To this end, we propose several differentiable forces, whose counterparts in empirical physics are indifferentiable, to facilitate gradient-based learning. These forces, albeit applied to cloths, are ubiquitous in various physical systems. Through comprehensive evaluation and comparison, we demonstrate our model's $\\textit{explicability}$ in learning meaningful physical parameters, $\\textit{versatility}$ in incorporating complex physical structures and heterogeneous materials, $\\textit{data-efficiency}$ in learning, and $\\textit{high-fidelity}$ in capturing subtle dynamics."}}

The explicit regularization term is designed in different types, depending on its applications. While regularized learning often boost the performance with higher accuracy and faster convergence, the regularization would sometimes hurt the empirical loss minimization and lead to poor performance. To deal with such issues in this work, we propose a novel strategy, namely Gradients Orthogonal Decomposition (GrOD), that improves the training procedure of regularized deep learning. Instead of linearly combining gradients of the two terms, GrOD re-estimates a new direction for iteration that does not hurt the empirical loss minimization while preserving the regularization affects, through orthogonal decomposition. We have performed extensive experiments to use GrOD improving the commonly used algorithms of transfer learning\u00a0[2], knowledge distillation\u00a0[3], and adversarial learning\u00a0[4].

In this work, we propose a new adaptive progressive network framework including two models for continual learning: Reinforced Continual Learning (RCL) and Bayesian Optimized Continual Learning with Attention mechanism (BOCL) to solve this fundamental issue. The core idea of this framework is to dynamically and adaptively expand the neural network structure upon the arrival of new tasks. RCL and BOCL employ reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization to achieve it, respectively. An outstanding advantage of our proposed framework is that it will not forget the knowledge that has been learned through adaptively controlling the architecture. We propose effective ways of employing the learned knowledge in the two methods to control the size of the network. RCL employs previous knowledge directly while BOCL selectively utilizes previous knowledge (e.g., feature maps of previous tasks) via attention mechanism. The experiments on variants of MNIST, CIFAR-100 and Sequence of 5-Datasets demonstrate that our methods outperform the state-of-the-art in preventing catastrophic forgetting and fitting new tasks better under the same or less computing resource."}}
