How to measure personality more conveniently and accurately has always been a problem for scholars in related fields. With the rapid development of computer technology and the widespread popularity of social media in recent years, the research of computational personality has attracted wide attention of researchers in Computational Linguistics and psychology. Various methods, from statistical methods in psychology to machine learning and then to deep learning, have been proposed to deal with different areas of computational personality. In this paper, we first summarize the research framework of computational personality, and then review the current research progress of computational personality from the aspects of personality prediction, depression detection, suicide detection and happiness assessment, and provide the corresponding research resources for reference. Finally, we provide some possible research directions."}}

Both industry and academia have realized the importance of the relationship between emotion word and context. However, most existing methods usually ignore the fact that the position information is also crucial for detecting the emotion cause. When an emotion word occurs in a clause, its neighboring words and clauses should be given more attractive than others with a long distance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework Position-aware Word-level and Clause-level Attention (PWCA) Network based on bidirectional GRU. PWCA not only concentrates on the position information of emotion word, but also builds the relation between emotion clause and candidate clause by leveraging word-level and clause-level attention mechanism. The experimental results show that our model obviously outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Through the visualization of attention over words, we validate our observation mentioned above."}}

Modeling Price and Interest Preferences in Session-based Recommendation", "abstract": "Session-based recommendation aims to predict items that an anonymous user would like to purchase based on her short behavior sequence. The current approaches towards session-based recommendation only focus on modeling users' interest preferences, while they all ignore a key attribute of an item, i.e., the price. Many marketing studies have shown that the price factor significantly influences users' behaviors and the purchase decisions of users are determined by both price and interest preferences simultaneously. However, it is nontrivial to incorporate price preferences for session-based recommendation. Firstly, it is hard to handle heterogeneous information from various features of items to capture users' price preferences. Secondly, it is difficult to model the complex relations between price and interest preferences in determining user choices. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel method Co-guided Heterogeneous Hypergraph Network (CoHHN) for session-based recommendation. Towards the first challenge, we devise a heterogeneous hypergraph to represent heterogeneous information and rich relations among them. A dual-channel aggregating mechanism is then designed to aggregate various information in the heterogeneous hypergraph. After that, we extract users' price preferences and interest preferences via attention layers. As to the second challenge, a co-guided learning scheme is designed to model the relations between price and interest preferences and enhance the learning of each other. Finally, we predict user actions based on item features and users' price and interest preferences. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CoHHN. Further analysis reveals the significance of price for session-based recommendation."}}

Besides language, multimodal information is also of great significance in humor expression and understanding, which promotes the development of multimodal humor research. However, in existing datasets, images and text often have a one-to-one relationship, making it difficult to control image modality variables. It causes the low correlation and low enhancement between the two modalities in humor recognition tasks. Moreover, with the development of Vision Transformers (ViTs), the generalization ability of visual models has been greatly enhanced. Using ViTs alone can achieve impressive performance, but is difficult to explain. In this paper, we introduce Memeplate (Our dataset is available at https://github.com/chineselzf/memeplate .), a novel multimodal humor dataset containing 203 templates, 5,184 memes and manually annotated humor levels. The template transfers images and text into a one-to-many relationship, which can make it easier for researchers to cut through the linguistic lens to multimodal humor. And it provides examples closer to human behavior for generation research. In addition, we provide multiple baseline results on the humor recognition task, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our control over image modality and the importance of introducing multimodal cues."}}
