So far, both approaches are limited by complexities in evaluating their objectives for general purpose models, and require generating samples from a typically intractable posterior over the coreset throughout inference and testing.  In this work, we present a black-box variational inference framework for coresets that overcomes these constraints and enables principled application of variational coresets to intractable models, such as Bayesian neural networks. We apply our techniques to supervised learning problems, and compare them with existing approaches in the literature for data summarization and inference."}}

While there have been numerous attempts to solve this problem for large-scale supervised classification, little has been done to overcome catastrophic forgetting for few-shot classification problems. Few-shot meta-learning algorithms often require all few-shot tasks to be readily available in a batch for training. The popular gradient-based model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm (MAML) is a typical algorithm that suffers from these limitations. This work introduces a Bayesian online meta-learning framework to tackle the catastrophic forgetting and the sequential few-shot tasks problems. Our framework incorporates MAML into a Bayesian online learning algorithm with Laplace approximation or variational inference.  This framework enables few-shot classification on a range of sequentially arriving datasets with a single meta-learned model and training on sequentially arriving few-shot tasks. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that our framework can effectively prevent catastrophic forgetting and is capable of online meta-learning in various few-shot classification settings."}}
