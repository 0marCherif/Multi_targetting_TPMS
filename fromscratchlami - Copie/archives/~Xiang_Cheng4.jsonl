Given an entity pair and its sentence bag as input, in the encoder component, we employ the convolutional neural network to extract the features of the sentences in the sentence bag and merge them into a bag representation. In the decoder component, we utilize the long short-term memory network to model relation dependencies and predict the target relations in a sequential manner. In particular, to enable the sequential prediction of relations, we introduce a measure to quantify the amounts of information the relations take in their sentence bag, and use such information to determine the order of the relations of a sentence bag during model training. Moreover, we incorporate the attention mechanism into our model to dynamically adjust the bag representation to reduce the impact of sentences whose corresponding relations have been predicted. Extensive experiments on a popular dataset show that our model achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods."}}

Recently, many deep hashing methods have been proposed to perform simultaneous nonlinear feature learning and hash projection learning, which have shown superior performance compared to hand-crafted feature based hashing methods. Nonlinear projection functions have shown their advantages over the linear ones due to their powerful generalization capabilities. To improve the performance of deep hashing methods by generalizing projection functions, we propose the idea of implementing a pure nonlinear deep hashing network architecture. By consolidating the above idea, this paper presents a Deep Supervised Hashing architecture with Nonlinear Projections (DSHNP). In particular, soft decision trees are adopted as the nonlinear projection functions, since they can generate differentiable nonlinear outputs and can be trained with deep neural networks in an end-to-end way. Moreover, to make the hash codes as independent as possible, we design two regularizers imposed on the parameter matrices of the leaves in the soft decision trees. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark image datasets show that the proposed DSHNP outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing methods."}}
