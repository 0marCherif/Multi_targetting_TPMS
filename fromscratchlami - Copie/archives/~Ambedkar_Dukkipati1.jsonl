While performance guarantees for spectral clustering are well understood, recent studies have focused on enforcing \"fairness\" in clusters, requiring them to be \"balanced\" with respect to a categorical sensitive node attribute (e.g. the race distribution in clusters must match the race distribution in the population). In this paper, we consider a setting where sensitive attributes indirectly manifest in an auxiliary representation graph rather than being directly observed. This graph specifies node pairs that can represent each other with respect to sensitive attributes and is observed in addition to the usual similarity graph. Our goal is to find clusters in the similarity graph while respecting a new individual-level fairness constraint encoded by the representation graph. We develop variants of unnormalized and normalized spectral clustering for this task and analyze their performance under a fair planted partition model induced by the representation graph. This model uses both the cluster membership of the nodes and the structure of the representation graph to generate random similarity graphs. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first consistency results for constrained spectral clustering under an individual-level fairness constraint. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings."}}

Central to achieving this is how the agents coordinate. One way to coordinate is by learning to communicate with each other. Can the agents develop a language while learning to perform a common task? In this paper, we formulate and study a MARL problem where cooperative agents are connected to each other via a fixed underlying network. These agents can communicate along the edges of this network by exchanging discrete symbols. However, the semantics of these symbols are not predefined and, during training, the agents are required to develop a language that helps them in accomplishing their goals. We propose a method for training these agents using emergent communication. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework by applying it to the problem of managing traffic controllers, where we achieve state-of-the-art performance as compared to a number of strong baselines. More importantly, we perform a detailed analysis of the emergent communication to show, for instance, that the developed language is grounded and demonstrate its relationship with the underlying network topology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only work that performs an in depth analysis of emergent communication in a networked MARL setting while being applicable to a broad class of problems."}}

A step in this direction is to re-imagine the traditional heuristics based training of systems as this approach is incapable of modelling the involved dynamics. While one can apply Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to such problems by considering each vertex in the network as an agent, most MARL-based models assume the agents to be independent. In many real-world tasks, agents need to behave as a group, rather than as a collection of individuals. In this paper, we propose a framework that induces cooperation and coordination amongst agents, connected via an underlying network, using emergent communication in a MARL-based setup. We formulate the problem in a general network setting and demonstrate the utility of communication in networks with the help of a case study on traffic systems. Furthermore, we study the emergent communication protocol and show the formation of distinct communities with grounded vocabulary. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only work that studies emergent language in a networked MARL setting."}}

While this connection between RL and probabilistic inference has been extensively studied in the single-agent setting, it has not yet been fully understood in the multi-agent setup. In this paper, we pose the problem of multi-agent reinforcement learning as the problem of performing inference in a particular graphical model. We model the environment, as seen by each of the agents, using separate but related Markov decision processes. We derive a practical off-policy maximum-entropy actor-critic algorithm that we call Multi-agent Soft Actor-Critic (MA-SAC) for performing approximate inference in the proposed model using variational inference. MA-SAC can be employed in both cooperative and competitive settings. Through experiments, we demonstrate that MA-SAC outperforms a strong baseline on several multi-agent scenarios. While MA-SAC is one resultant multi-agent RL algorithm that can be derived from the proposed probabilistic framework, our work provides a unified view of maximum-entropy algorithms in the multi-agent setting."}}

Our model allows the number of communities in the network to be different at different time steps. We use a neural network based methodology to perform approximate inference in the proposed model and its simplified version. Experiments done on synthetic and real world networks for the task of community detection and link prediction demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our model as compared to other similar existing approaches."}}

Recent methods have almost exclusively focused on the first point above. However, the quantitative improvements offered by them are often due to complex black-box models like deep neural networks at the expense of explainability. Approaches that focus on the second point are either domain-specific or have poor performance in practice. This paper proposes explainable, domain-independent statistical models for networks with node covariates that additionally offer good quantitative performance. Our models combine the strengths of Stochastic Block Models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines to provide interpretable insights about the communities. They support both pure and mixed community memberships. Besides providing explainability, our approach's main strength is that it does not explicitly assume a causal direction between community memberships and node covariates, making it applicable in diverse domains. We derive efficient inference procedures for our models, which can, in some cases, run in linear time in the number of nodes and edges. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our models achieve close to state-of-the-art performance on community detection and link prediction tasks while also providing explanations for the discovered communities."}}

We learn on a new unknown domain by jointly using unsupervised information directly from unknown domain and supervised information previously acquired knowledge from some other domain. Motivated by this supervised-unsupervised joint learning, we propose a simple model referred as Contradistinguisher (CTDR) for unsupervised domain adaptation whose objective is to jointly learn to contradistinguish on unlabeled target domain in a fully unsupervised manner along with prior knowledge acquired by supervised learning on an entirely different domain. Most recent works in domain adaptation rely on an indirect way of first aligning the source and target domain distributions and then learn a classifier on labeled source domain to classify target domain. This approach of indirect way of addressing the real task of unlabeled target domain classification has three main drawbacks. (i) The sub-task of obtaining a perfect alignment of the domain in itself might be impossible due to large domain shift (e.g., language domains). (ii) The use of multiple classifiers to align the distributions, unnecessarily increases the complexity of the neural networks leading to over-fitting in many cases. (iii) Due to distribution alignment, the domain specific information is lost as the domains get morphed. In this work, we propose a simple and direct approach that does not require domain alignment. We jointly learn CTDR on both source and target distribution for unsupervised domain adaptation task using contradistinguish loss for the unlabeled target domain in conjunction with supervised loss for labeled source domain. Our experiments show that avoiding domain alignment by directly addressing the task of unlabeled target domain classification using CTDR achieves state-of-the-art results on eight visual and four language benchmark domain adaptation datasets."}}

Recently, multiple attempts at replicating the process of emergence of language in artificial agents have been made. While existing approaches study emergent languages as referential tools, in this paper, we study their role in discovering and implementing strategies. We formulate the problem using a voting game where two candidate agents contest in an election with the goal of convincing population members (other agents), that are connected to each other via an underlying network, to vote for them. To achieve this goal, agents are only allowed to exchange messages in the form of sequences of discrete symbols to spread their propaganda. We use neural networks with Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for sampling categorical random variables to parameterize the policies followed by all agents. Using our proposed framework, we provide concrete answers to the following questions: (i) Do the agents learn to communicate in a meaningful way and does the emergent communication play a role in deciding the winner? (ii) Does the system evolve as expected under various reward structures? (iii) How is the emergent language affected by the community structure in the network? To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore emergence of communication for discovering and implementing strategies in a setting where agents communicate over a network."}}

In this paper, we propose a statistical model for dynamically evolving networks, together with a variational inference approach. Our model, Neural Latent Space Model with Variational Inference, encodes edge dependencies across different time snapshots. It represents nodes via latent vectors and uses interaction matrices to model the presence of edges. These matrices can be used to incorporate multiple relations in heterogeneous networks by having a separate matrix for each of the relations. To capture the temporal dynamics, both node vectors and interaction matrices are allowed to evolve with time. Existing network analysis methods use representation learning techniques for modelling networks. These techniques are different for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks because heterogeneous networks can have multiple types of edges and nodes as opposed to a homogeneous network. Unlike these, we propose a unified model for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks in a variational inference framework. Moreover, the learned node latent vectors and interaction matrices may be interpretable and therefore provide insights on the mechanisms behind network evolution. We experimented with a single step and multi-step link forecasting on real-world networks of homogeneous, bipartite, and heterogeneous nature, and demonstrated that our model significantly outperforms existing models."}}

Based on this we propose Skip Residual Pairwise Networks (SRPN) for few-shot learning based on residual Siamese networks. We validate our hypothesis by evaluating the proposed model for few-shot learning on Omniglot and mini-Imagenet datasets. Our model outperforms the residual Siamese design of equal depth and parameters. We also show that our model is competitive with state-of-the-art meta-learning based methods for few-shot learning on the challenging mini-Imagenet dataset whilst being a much simpler design, obtaining 54.4% accuracy on the five-way few-shot learning task with only a single example per class and over 70% accuracy with five examples per class. We further observe that the network weights in our model are much smaller compared to an equivalent residual Siamese Network under similar regularization, thus validating our hypothesis that our model design allows for better generalization. We also observe that our asymmetric, non-metric SRPN design automatically learns to approximate natural metric learning priors such as a symmetry and the triangle inequality."}}
