In this paper, we re-evaluate such methods through the lens of different metrics that characterize the augmented manifold, finding contradictory evidence. Our extensive empirical analysis involving 5 data augmentation methods, all tested with an increasing probability of augmentation, shows that: (i) novel data augmentation methods proposed to improve adversarial robustness only improve it when combined with classical augmentations (like image flipping and rotation), and even worsen adversarial robustness if used in isolation; and (ii) adversarial robustness is significantly affected by the augmentation probability, conversely to what is claimed in recent work. We conclude by discussing how to rethink the development and evaluation of novel data augmentation methods for adversarial robustness."}}

Given a succinct natural language goal, e.g., \u201cmake a shelf\u201d, and a video of the user\u2019s progress so far, the aim of VPA is to devise a plan, i.e. a sequence of actions such as \u201csand shelf\u201d, \u201cpaint shelf\u201d, etc. to realize the speci- fied goal. This requires assessing the user\u2019s progress from the (untrimmed) video, and relating it to the requirements of natural language goal, i.e. which actions to select and in what order? Consequently, this requires handling long video history and arbitrarily complex action dependencies. To address these challenges, we decompose VPA into video action segmentation and forecasting. Importantly, we ex- periment by formulating the forecasting step as a multi- modal sequence modeling problem, allowing us to leverage the strength of pre-trained LMs (as the sequence model). This novel approach, which we call Visual Language Model based Planner (VLaMP), outperforms baselines across a suite of metrics that gauge the quality of the generated plans. Furthermore, through comprehensive ablations, we also isolate the value of each component \u2013 language pre- training, visual observations, and goal information. We have open-sourced all the data, model checkpoints, and training code."}}

However, CL agents that are trained using RL with neural networks produce limited generalization to later tasks in the curriculum. We show that online distillation using learned informative rewards tackles this problem. Here, we consider a reward to be informative if it is positive when the agent makes progress towards the goal and negative otherwise. Thus, an informative reward allows an agent to learn immediately to avoid states which are irrelevant to the task. And, the value and policy networks do not utilize their limited capacity to fit targets for these irrelevant states. Consequently, this improves generalization to later tasks. Our contributions: First, we propose InfODist, an online distillation method that makes use of informative rewards to significantly improve generalization in CL. Second, we show that training with informative rewards ameliorates the capacity loss phenomenon that was previously attributed to non-stationarities during the training process. Third, we show that learning from task-irrelevant states explains the capacity loss and subsequent impaired generalization. In conclusion, our work is a crucial step toward scaling curriculum learning to complex real world tasks.\n"}}

We follow the strategy to compute several models using different hyper-parameters, and, to subsequently compute a linear aggregation of the models. While several heuristics exist that follow this strategy, methods are still missing that rely on thorough theories for bounding the target error. In this turn, we propose a method that extends weighted least squares to vector-valued functions, e.g., deep neural networks. We show that the target error of the proposed algorithm is asymptotically not worse than twice the error of the unknown optimal aggregation. We also perform a large scale empirical comparative study on several datasets, including text, images, electroencephalogram, body sensor signals and signals from mobile phones. Our method outperforms deep embedded validation (DEV) and importance weighted validation (IWV) on all datasets, setting a new state-of-the-art performance for solving parameter choice issues in unsupervised domain adaptation with theoretical error guarantees. We further study several competitive heuristics, all outperforming IWV and DEV on at least five datasets. However, our method outperforms each heuristic on at least five of seven datasets."}}

For example, when a new user interacts with a system, the system has to adapt to the needs of the user, which might differ based on the user\u2019s characteristics that are often not observable. In this Contextual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) setting, the agent has to not only recognise and adapt to a context, but also remember previous ones. However, often in CRL the context is unknown, hence a supervised approach for learning to predict the context is not feasible. In this paper, we introduce Context-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Agent (CARLA), that is capable of learning context variables in an unsupervised manner, and can adapt the policy to the current context. We provide a hypothesis based on the generative process that explains how the context variable relates to the states and observations of an environment. Further, we propose an experimental protocol to test and validate our hypothesis; and compare the performance of the proposed approach with other methods in a CRL environment. Finally, we provide empirical results in support of our hypothesis, demonstrating the effectiveness of CARLA in tackling CRL."}}

In this paper, we propose a new GAN variant called Mixture Density GAN that overcomes this problem by encouraging the Discriminator to form clusters in its embedding space, which in turn leads the Generator to exploit these and discover different modes in the data. This is achieved by positioning Gaussian density functions in the corners of a simplex, using the resulting Gaussian mixture as a likelihood function over discriminator embeddings, and formulating an objective function for GAN training that is based on these likelihoods. We show how formation of these clusters changes the probability landscape of the discriminator and improves the mode discovery of the GAN. We also show that the optimum of our training objective is attained if and only if the generated and the real distribution match exactly. We support our theoretical results with empirical evaluations on three mode discovery benchmark datasets (Stacked-MNIST, Ring of Gaussians and Grid of Gaussians), and four image datasets (CIFAR-10, CelebA, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST). Furthermore, we demonstrate (1) the ability to avoid mode collapse and discover all the modes and (2) superior quality of the generated images (as measured by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID)), achieving the lowest FID compared to all baselines.\n"}}

These techniques rely on different ideas such as invariance-preserving transformations (e.g, expert-defined augmentation), statistical heuristics (e.g, Mixup), and learning the data distribution (e.g, GANs). However, in the adversarial settings it remains unclear under what conditions such data augmentation methods reduce or even worsen the misclassification risk. In this paper, we therefore analyse the effect of different data augmentation techniques on the adversarial risk by three measures: (a) the well-known risk under adversarial attacks, (b) a new measure of prediction-change stress based on the Laplacian operator, and (c) the influence of training examples on prediction. The results of our empirical analysis disprove the hypothesis that an improvement in the classification performance induced by a data augmentation is always accompanied by an improvement in the risk under adversarial attack. Further, our results reveal that the augmented data has more influence than the non-augmented data, on the resulting models. Taken together, our results suggest that general-purpose data augmentations that do not take into the account the characteristics of the data and the task, must be applied with care."}}

This problem is intriguing as no labels are available in the target domain. Our approach starts with the observation that the widely-used method of minimizing the source error, penalized by a distance measure between source and target feature representations, shares characteristics with regularized ill-posed inverse problems. Regularization parameters in inverse problems are optimally chosen by the fundamental principle of balancing approximation and sampling errors. We use this principle to balance learning errors and domain distance in a target error bound. As a result, we obtain a theoretically justified rule for the choice of the regularization parameter. In contrast to the state of the art, our approach allows source and target distributions with disjoint supports. An empirical comparative study on benchmark datasets underpins the performance of our approach."}}
