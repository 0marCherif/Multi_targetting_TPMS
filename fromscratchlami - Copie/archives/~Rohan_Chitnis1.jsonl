Recent work has shown how to enable such bilevel planning by learning abstract models in the form of symbolic operators and neural samplers. In this work, we show that existing symbolic operator learning approaches fall short in many robotics domains where a robot's actions tend to cause a large number of irrelevant changes in the abstract state. This is primarily because they attempt to learn operators that exactly predict all observed changes in the abstract state. To overcome this issue, we propose to learn operators that `choose what to predict' by only modelling changes necessary for abstract planning to achieve specified goals. Experimentally, we show that our approach learns operators that lead to efficient planning across 10 different hybrid robotics domains, including 4 from the challenging BEHAVIOR-100 benchmark, while generalizing to novel initial states, goals, and objects."}}

In such settings, correlational information can be valuable for planning efficiently. Previous approaches that consider correlational information typically resort to ad-hoc, greedy search strategies. We introduce the Correlational Object Search POMDP (COS-POMDP), which models correlations while preserving optimal solutions with a reduced state space. We propose a hierarchical planning algorithm to scale up COS-POMDPs for practical domains. Our evaluation, conducted with the AI2-THOR household simulator and the YOLOv5 object detector, shows that our method finds objects more successfully and efficiently compared to baselines, particularly for hard-to-detect objects such as srub brush and remote control."}}

One way to alleviate this challenge is to perform bilevel planning with abstractions, where a high-level search for abstract plans is used to guide planning in the original transition space. In this paper, we develop a novel framework for learning state and action abstractions that are explicitly optimized for both effective (successful) and efficient (fast) bilevel planning. Given demonstrations of tasks in an environment, our data-efficient approach learns relational, neuro-symbolic abstractions that generalize over object identities and numbers. The symbolic components resemble the STRIPS predicates and operators found in AI planning, and the neural components refine the abstractions into actions that can be executed in the environment. Experimentally, we show across four robotic planning environments that our learned abstractions are able to quickly solve held-out tasks of longer horizons than were seen in the demonstrations, and can even outperform the efficiency of abstractions that we manually specified. We also find that as the planner configuration varies, the learned abstractions adapt accordingly, indicating that our abstraction learning method is both \"task-aware\" and \"planner-aware.\" Code: https://tinyurl.com/predicators-release"}}

However, the long-horizon goal-based problems found in classical planning lead to sparse rewards for RL, making direct application inefficient. In this paper, we propose to leverage domain-independent heuristic functions commonly used in the classical planning literature to improve the sample efficiency of RL. These classical heuristics act as dense reward generators to alleviate the sparse-rewards issue and enable our RL agent to learn domain-specific value functions as residuals on these heuristics, making learning easier. Correct application of this technique requires consolidating the discounted metric used in RL and the non-discounted metric used in heuristics. We implement the value functions using Neural Logic Machines, a neural network architecture designed for grounded first-order logic inputs. We demonstrate on several classical planning domains that using classical heuristics for RL allows for good sample efficiency compared to sparse-reward RL. We further show that our learned value functions generalize to novel problem instances in the same domain.

TAMP approaches rely on domain-specific symbolic operators to guide the task-level search, making planning efficient. In this work, we formalize and study the problem of operator learning for TAMP. Central to this study is the view that operators define a lossy abstraction of the transition model of a domain. We then propose a bottom-up relational learning method for operator learning and show how the learned operators can be used for planning in a TAMP system. Experimentally, we provide results in three domains, including long-horizon robotic planning tasks. We find our approach to substantially outperform several baselines, including three graph neural network-based model-free approaches from the recent literature.
