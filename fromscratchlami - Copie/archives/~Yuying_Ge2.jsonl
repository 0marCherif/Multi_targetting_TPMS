They pursue better performance via utilizing heavier unimodal encoders or multimodal fusion Transformers, resulting in increased parameters with lower efficiency in downstream tasks. In this work, we for the first time introduce an end-to-end VLP model, namely all-in-one Transformer, that embeds raw video and textual signals into joint representations using a unified backbone architecture. We argue that the unique temporal information of video data turns out to be a key barrier hindering the design of a modality-agnostic Transformer. To overcome the challenge, we introduce a novel and effective token rolling operation to encode temporal representations from video clips in a non-parametric manner. The careful design enables the representation learning of both video-text multimodal inputs and unimodal inputs using a unified model. Our pretrained ali-in-one Transformer is transferred to various downstream video-text tasks after fine-tuning, including text-video retrieval, video-question answering, multiple choice and video captioning. State-of-the-art performances with the minimal model FLOPs on ten datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the competitive counterparts.

In this work, we address the evaluation of generative comprehension in MLLMs as a preliminary step towards a comprehensive assessment of generative models, by introducing a benchmark named SEED-Bench. SEED-Bench consists of 19K multiple choice questions with accurate human annotations (x 6 larger than existing benchmarks), which spans 12 evaluation dimensions including the comprehension of both the image and video modality. We develop an advanced pipeline for generating multiple-choice questions that target specific evaluation dimensions, integrating both automatic filtering and manual verification processes. Multiple-choice questions with groundtruth options derived from human annotation enables an objective and efficient assessment of model performance, eliminating the need for human or GPT intervention during evaluation. We further evaluate the performance of 18 models across all 12 dimensions, covering both the spatial and temporal understanding. By revealing the limitations of existing MLLMs through evaluation results, we aim for SEED-Bench to provide insights for motivating future research. We will launch and consistently maintain a leaderboard to provide a platform for the community to assess and investigate model capability."}}

Beyond text and image, sound is a vital element within the sphere of human perception, offering vivid representations and naturally coinciding with corresponding scenes. Taking advantage of sound therefore presents a promising avenue for exploration within image generation research. However, the relationship between audio and image supervision remains significantly underdeveloped, and the scarcity of related, high-quality datasets brings further obstacles. In this paper, we propose a unified framework 'Align, Adapt, and Inject' (AAI) for sound-guided image generation, editing, and stylization. In particular, our method adapts input sound into a sound token, like an ordinary word, which can plug and play with existing powerful diffusion-based Text-to-Image (T2I) models. Specifically, we first train a multi-modal encoder to align audio representation with the pre-trained textual manifold and visual manifold, respectively. Then, we propose the audio adapter to adapt audio representation into an audio token enriched with specific semantics, which can be injected into a frozen T2I model flexibly. In this way, we are able to extract the dynamic information of varied sounds, while utilizing the formidable capability of existing T2I models to facilitate sound-guided image generation, editing, and stylization in a convenient and cost-effective manner. The experiment results confirm that our proposed AAI outperforms other text and sound-guided state-of-the-art methods. And our aligned multi-modal encoder is also competitive with other approaches in the audio-visual retrieval and audio-text retrieval tasks."}}

Research on image tokenizers has previously reached an impasse, as frameworks employing quantized visual tokens have lost prominence due to subpar performance and convergence in multimodal comprehension (compared to BLIP-2, etc.) or generation (compared to Stable Diffusion, etc.). Despite the limitations, we remain confident in its natural capacity to unify visual and textual representations, facilitating scalable multimodal training with LLM's original recipe. In this study, we identify two crucial principles for the architecture and training of SEED that effectively ease subsequent alignment with LLMs. (1) Image tokens should be independent of 2D physical patch positions and instead be produced with a 1D causal dependency, exhibiting intrinsic interdependence that aligns with the left-to-right autoregressive prediction mechanism in LLMs. (2) Image tokens should capture high-level semantics consistent with the degree of semantic abstraction in words, and be optimized for both discriminativeness and reconstruction during the tokenizer training phase. As a result, the off-the-shelf LLM is able to perform both image-to-text and text-to-image generation by incorporating our SEED through efficient LoRA tuning. Comprehensive multimodal pretraining and instruction tuning, which may yield improved results, are reserved for future investigation. This version of SEED was trained in 5.7 days using only 64 V100 GPUs and 5M publicly available image-text pairs. Our preliminary study emphasizes the great potential of discrete visual tokens in versatile multimodal LLMs and the importance of proper image tokenizers in broader research."}}

The key idea is to convert the visual information into the language feature space so that the capacity of LLMs can be fully exploited. Existing VideoQA methods typically take two paradigms: (1) learning cross-modal alignment, and (2) using an off-the-shelf captioning model to describe the visual data. However, the first design needs costly training on many extra multi-modal data, whilst the second is further limited by limited domain generalization. To address these limitations, a simple yet effective Retrieving-to-Answer (R2A) framework is proposed.Given an input video, R2A first retrieves a set of semantically similar texts from a generic text corpus using a pre-trained multi-modal model (e.g., CLIP). With both the question and the retrieved texts, a LLM (e.g., DeBERTa) can be directly used to yield a desired answer. Without the need for cross-modal fine-tuning, R2A allows for all the key components (e.g., LLM, retrieval model, and text corpus) to plug-and-play. Extensive experiments on several VideoQA benchmarks show that despite with 1.3B parameters and no fine-tuning, our R2A can outperform the 61 times larger Flamingo-80B model even additionally trained on nearly 2.1B multi-modal data."}}

To this end, we present a large-scale dataset, JourneyDB, for multi-modal visual understanding in generative images. Our curated dataset covers 4 million diverse and high-quality generated images paired with the text prompts used to produce them. We further design 4 benchmarks to quantify the performance of generated image understanding in terms of both content and style interpretation. These benchmarks include prompt inversion, style retrieval, image captioning and visual question answering. Lastly, we assess the performance of current state-of-the-art multi-modal models when applied to JourneyDB, and provide an in-depth analysis of their strengths and limitations in generated content understanding. We hope the proposed dataset and benchmarks will facilitate the research in the field of generative content understanding. The dataset will be available on https://journeydb.github.io."}}

Despite some progress, existing methods are mostly limited to highly curated datasets (e.g., K400) and exhibit unsatisfactory out-of-the-box representations. We argue that it is due to the fact that they only capture pixel-level knowledge rather than spatiotemporal commonsense, which is far away from cognition-level video understanding. Inspired by the great success of image-text pre-training (e.g., CLIP), we take the first step to exploit language semantics to boost transferable spatiotemporal representation learning. We introduce a new pretext task, Turning to Video for Transcript Sorting (TVTS), which sorts shuffled ASR scripts by attending to learned video representations. We do not rely on descriptive captions and learn purely from video, i.e., leveraging the natural transcribed speech knowledge to provide noisy but useful semantics over time. Furthermore, rather than the simple concept learning in vision-caption contrast, we encourage cognition-level temporal commonsense reasoning via narrative reorganization. The advantages enable our model to contextualize what is happening like human beings and seamlessly apply to large-scale uncurated video data in the real world. Note that our method differs from ones designed for video-text alignment (e.g., Frozen) and multimodal representation learning (e.g., Merlot). Our method demonstrates strong out-of-the-box spatiotemporal representations on diverse video benchmarks, e.g., +13.6% gains over VideoMAE on SSV2 via linear probing."}}

The recent success of image BERT pre-training with masked visual modeling that promotes the learning of local visual context, motivates a possible solution to address the above limitation. In this work, we for the first time investigate masked visual modeling in video-text pre-training with the \u201cdual-encoder\u201d architecture. We perform Masked visual modeling with Injected LanguagE Semantics (MILES) by employing an extra snapshot video encoder as an evolving \u201ctokenizer\u201d to produce reconstruction targets for masked video patch prediction. Given the corrupted video, the video encoder is trained to recover text-aligned features of the masked patches via reasoning with the visible regions along the spatial and temporal dimensions, which enhances the discriminativeness of local visual features and the fine-grained cross-modality alignment. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for text-to-video retrieval on four datasets with both zero-shot and fine-tune evaluation protocols. Our approach also surpasses the baseline models significantly on zero-shot action recognition, which can be cast as video-to-text retrieval."}}
