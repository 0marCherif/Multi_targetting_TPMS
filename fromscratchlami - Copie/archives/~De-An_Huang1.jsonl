Herein, we automate suturing technical skill scoring through computer vision (CV) methods as a scalable method to provide feedback. Methods Twenty-two surgeons completed a suturing exercise three times on the Mimic\u2122 Flex VR simulator. Instrument kinematic data (XYZ coordinates of each instrument and pose) were captured at 30 Hz. After standardized training, three human raters manually video segmented suturing task into four sub-stitch phases (Needle handling, Needle targeting, Needle driving, Needle withdrawal) and labeled the corresponding technical skill domains (Needle positioning, Needle entry, Needle driving, and Needle withdrawal). The CV framework extracted RGB features and optical flow frames using a pre-trained AlexNet. Additional CV strategies including auxiliary supervision (using kinematic data during training only) and attention mechanisms were implemented to improve performance. Results This study included data from 15 expert surgeons (median caseload 300 [IQR 165\u2013750]) and 7 training surgeons (0 [IQR 0\u20138]). In all, 226 virtual sutures were captured. Automated assessments for Needle positioning performed best with the simplest approach (1 s video; AUC 0.749). Remaining skill domains exhibited improvements with the implementation of auxiliary supervision and attention mechanisms when deployed separately (AUC 0.604\u20130.794). All techniques combined produced the best performance, particularly for Needle driving and Needle withdrawal (AUC 0.959 and 0.879, respectively). Conclusions This study demonstrated the best performance of automated suturing technical skills assessment to date using advanced CV techniques. Future work will determine if a \u201chuman in the loop\u201d is necessary to verify surgeon evaluations."}}

This paper addresses the challenges of applying differential privacy to video activity recognition, which primarily stem from: (1) a discrepancy between the desired privacy level for entire videos and the nature of input data processed by contemporary video architectures, which are typically short, segmented clips; and (2) the complexity and sheer size of video datasets relative to those in image classification, which render traditional differential privacy methods inadequate. To tackle these issues, we propose Multi-Clip DP-SGD, a novel framework for enforcing video-level differential privacy through clip-based classification models. This method samples multiple clips from each video, averages their gradients, and applies gradient clipping in DP-SGD without incurring additional privacy loss. Moreover, we incorporate a parameter-efficient transfer learning strategy to make the model scalable for large-scale video datasets. Through extensive evaluations on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, our approach exhibits impressive performance, achieving 81% accuracy with a privacy budget of epsilon=5 on UCF-101, marking a 76% improvement compared to a direct application of DP-SGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our transfer learning strategy is versatile and can enhance differentially private image classification across an array of datasets including CheXpert, ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100."}}

However, existing pFL methods either (1) introduce high communication and computation costs or (2) overfit to local data, which can be limited in scope, and are vulnerable to evolved test samples with natural shifts. In this paper, we propose PerAda, a parameter-efficient pFL framework that reduces communication and computational costs and exhibits superior generalization performance, especially under test-time distribution shifts. PerAda reduces the costs by leveraging the power of pretrained models and only updates and communicates a small number of additional parameters from adapters. PerAda has good generalization since it regularizes each client's personalized adapter with a global adapter, while the global adapter uses knowledge distillation to aggregate generalized information from all clients. Theoretically, we provide generalization bounds to explain why PerAda improves generalization, and we prove its convergence to stationary points under non-convex settings. Empirically, PerAda demonstrates competitive personalized performance (+4.85% on CheXpert) and enables better out-of-distribution generalization (+5.23% on CIFAR-10-C) on different datasets across natural and medical domains compared with baselines, while only updating 12.6% of parameters per model based on the adapter."}}

However, harnessing them to learn complex low-level manipulation tasks, such as dexterous pen spinning, remains an open problem. We bridge this fundamental gap and present Eureka, a human-level reward design algorithm powered by LLMs. Eureka exploits the remarkable zero-shot generation, code-writing, and in-context improvement capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, to perform evolutionary optimization over reward code. The resulting rewards can then be used to acquire complex skills via reinforcement learning. Without any task-specific prompting or pre-defined reward templates, Eureka generates reward functions that outperform expert human-engineered rewards. In a diverse suite of 29 open-source RL environments that include 10 distinct robot morphologies, Eureka outperforms human experts on 83% of the tasks, leading to an average normalized improvement of 52%. The generality of Eureka also enables a new gradient-free in-context learning approach to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), readily incorporating human inputs to improve the quality and the safety of the generated rewards without model updating. Finally, using Eureka rewards in a curriculum learning setting, we demonstrate for the first time, a simulated Shadow Hand capable of performing pen spinning tricks, adeptly manipulating a pen in circles at rapid speed."}}

A major cause of model unfairness is the imbalanced representation of different groups in training data. Recently, several works aim to alleviate this issue using generated data. However, these approaches often use generated data to obtain similar amounts of data across groups, which is not optimal for achieving high fairness due to different learning difficulties and generated data qualities across groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel adaptive sampling approach that leverages both real and generated data for fairness. We design a bilevel optimization that finds the optimal data sampling ratios among groups and between real and generated data while training a model. The ratios are dynamically adjusted considering both the model's accuracy as well as its fairness. To efficiently solve our non-convex bilevel optimization, we propose a simple approximation to the solution given by the implicit function theorem. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy on the CelebA and ImageNet People Subtree datasets. We also observe that our method adaptively relies less on the generated data when it has poor quality."}}

However, they typically learn tabula rasa in isolated environments with limited and manually conceived objectives, thus failing to generalize across a wide spectrum of tasks and capabilities. Inspired by how humans continually learn and adapt in the open world, we advocate a trinity of ingredients for building generalist agents: 1) an environment that supports a multitude of tasks and goals, 2) a large-scale database of multimodal knowledge, and 3) a flexible and scalable agent architecture. We introduce MineDojo, a new framework built on the popular Minecraft game that features a simulation suite with thousands of diverse open-ended tasks and an internet-scale knowledge base with Minecraft videos, tutorials, wiki pages, and forum discussions. Using MineDojo's data, we propose a novel agent learning algorithm that leverages large pre-trained video-language models as a learned reward function. Our agent is able to solve a variety of open-ended tasks specified in free-form language without any manually designed dense shaping reward. We open-source the simulation suite, knowledge bases, algorithm implementation, and pretrained models (https://minedojo.org) to promote research towards the goal of generally capable embodied agents."}}

Instead of relying on hand-engineered prompts, recent works learn prompts using the training data from downstream tasks. While effective, training on domain-specific data reduces a model's generalization capability to unseen new domains. In this work, we propose test-time prompt tuning (TPT), a method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample. TPT optimizes the prompt by minimizing the entropy with confidence selection so that the model has consistent predictions across different augmented views of each test sample. In evaluating generalization to natural distribution shifts, TPT improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP by 3.6\\% on average, surpassing previous prompt tuning approaches that require additional task-specific training data. In evaluating cross-dataset generalization with unseen categories, TPTperforms on par with the state-of-the-art approaches that use additional training data."}}

But can pre-trained LMs be further leveraged for more general machine learning problems? We propose an approach for using LMs to scaffold learning and generalization in general sequential decision-making problems. In this approach, goals and observations are represented as a sequence of embeddings, and a policy network initialized with a pre-trained LM predicts the next action. We demonstrate that this framework enables effective combinatorial generalization across different environments and supervisory modalities. We begin by assuming access to a set of expert demonstrations, and show that initializing policies with LMs and fine-tuning them via behavior cloning improves task completion rates by 43.6% in the VirtualHome environment. Next, we integrate an active data gathering procedure in which agents iteratively interact with the environment, relabel past \"failed\" experiences with new goals, and update their policies in a self-supervised loop. Active data gathering further improves combinatorial generalization, outperforming the best baseline by 25.1%. Finally, we explain these results by investigating three possible factors underlying the effectiveness of the LM-based policy. We find that sequential input representations (vs. fixed-dimensional feature vectors) and LM-based weight initialization are both important for generalization. Surprisingly, however, the format of the policy inputs encoding (e.g. as a natural language string vs. an arbitrary sequential encoding) has little influence. Together, these results suggest that language modeling induces representations that are useful for modeling not just language, but also goals and plans; these representations can aid learning and generalization even outside of language processing."}}

By only training a query-based image instance segmentation model, MinVIS outperforms the previous best result on the challenging Occluded VIS dataset by over 10% AP. Since MinVIS treats frames in training videos as independent images, we can drastically sub-sample the annotated frames in training videos without any modifications. With only 1% of labeled frames, MinVIS outperforms or is comparable to fully-supervised state-of-the-art approaches on YouTube-VIS 2019/2021. Our key observation is that queries trained to be discriminative between intra-frame object instances are temporally consistent and can be used to track instances without any manually designed heuristics. MinVIS thus has the following inference pipeline: we first apply the trained query-based image instance segmentation to video frames independently. The segmented instances are then tracked by bipartite matching of the corresponding queries. This inference is done in an online fashion and does not need to process the whole video at once. MinVIS thus has the practical advantages of reducing both the labeling costs and the memory requirements, while not sacrificing the VIS performance."}}
