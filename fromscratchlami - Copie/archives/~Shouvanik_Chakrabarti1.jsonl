Inspired by previous studies on the adversarial training of classical and quantum generative models, we propose the first design of quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs), which has been shown to improve the robustness and the scalability of the adversarial training of quantum generative models even on noisy quantum hardware. Specifically, we propose a definition of the Wasserstein semimetric between quantum data, which inherits a few key theoretical merits of its classical counterpart. We also demonstrate how to turn the quantum Wasserstein semimetric into a concrete design of quantum WGANs that can be efficiently implemented on quantum machines. Our numerical study, via classical simulation of quantum systems, shows the more robust and scalable numerical performance of our quantum WGANs over other quantum GAN proposals. As a surprising application, our quantum WGAN has been used to generate a 3-qubit quantum circuit of ~50 gates that well approximates a 3-qubit 1-d Hamiltonian simulation circuit that requires over 10k gates using standard techniques."}}

We present a quantum algorithm that estimates the volume of an $n$-dimensional convex body within multiplicative error $\\epsilon$ using $\\tilde{O}(n^{3}+n^{2.5}/\\epsilon)$ queries to a membership oracle and $\\tilde{O}(n^{5}+n^{4.5}/\\epsilon)$ additional arithmetic operations. For comparison, the best known classical algorithm uses $\\tilde{O}(n^{4}+n^{3}/\\epsilon^{2})$ queries and $\\tilde{O}(n^{6}+n^{5}/\\epsilon^{2})$ additional arithmetic operations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantum speedup for volume estimation. Our algorithm is based on a refined framework for speeding up simulated annealing algorithms that might be of independent interest. This framework applies in the setting of \"Chebyshev cooling\", where the solution is expressed as a telescoping product of ratios, each having bounded variance. We develop several novel techniques when implementing our framework, including a theory of continuous-space quantum walks with rigorous bounds on discretization error. To complement our quantum algorithms, we also prove that volume estimation requires $\\Omega(\\sqrt n+1/\\epsilon)$ quantum membership queries, which rules out the possibility of exponential quantum speedup in $n$ and shows optimality of our algorithm in $1/\\epsilon$ up to poly-logarithmic factors."}}
