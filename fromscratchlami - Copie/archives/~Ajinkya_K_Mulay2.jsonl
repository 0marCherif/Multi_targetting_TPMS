Power for individual parameters of interest cannot be reliably estimated univariately since correlation and variance explained relative to one parameter will impact the power for another parameter, all usual univariate considerations being equal. Explicit solutions in such cases, especially for models with many parameters, are either impractical or impossible to solve, leaving researchers to the prevailing method of simulating power. However, the point estimates for a vector of model parameters are uncertain, and the impact of inaccuracy is unknown. In such cases, sensitivity analysis is recommended such that multiple combinations of possible observable parameter vectors are simulated to understand power trade-offs. A limitation to this approach is that it is computationally expensive to generate sufficient sensitivity combinations to accurately map the power trade-off function in increasingly high-dimensional spaces for the models that social scientists estimate. This paper explores the efficient estimation and graphing of statistical power for a study over varying model parameter combinations. We propose a simple and generalizable machine learning inspired solution to cut the computational cost to less than 10% of the brute force method while providing F1 scores above 90%. We further motivate the impact of transfer learning in learning power manifolds across varying distributions."}}

Differential privacy, by means of adding noise, provides strong privacy guarantees for such learning algorithms. The cost of differential privacy is often a reduced model accuracy and a lowered convergence speed. This paper investigates the impact of differential privacy on learning algorithms in terms of their carbon footprint due to either longer run-times or failed experiments. Through extensive experiments, further guidance is provided on choosing the noise levels which can strike a balance between desired privacy levels and reduced carbon emissions."}}

Most of the IoT architecture takes client and server model -- IoT devices are connected to a server on the Cloud. Real time communication, especially from the server to client, is necessary when we consider the earthquake alert applications. WebSocket protocol, which has been successfully used in browsers for bi-directional communication, can be applied to such communication. However, we have to carefully manage the loss of connection between the client and server. In this paper, we propose a WebSocket connection management algorithm for IoT, called reconnection with dynamic ping-pong algorithm (RDPPA), focusing on improving and adapting the WebSocket protocol for connecting IoT devices. We implemented the algorithm and carried out experiments for evaluating message delivery latency and the amount of traffic overhead."}}
