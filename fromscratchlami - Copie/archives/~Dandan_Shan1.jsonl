VISOR annotates videos from EPIC-KITCHENS, which comes with a new set of challenges not encountered in current video segmentation datasets. Specifically, we need to ensure both short- and long-term consistency of pixel-level annotations as objects undergo transformative interactions, e.g. an onion is peeled, diced and cooked - where we aim to obtain accurate pixel-level annotations of the peel, onion pieces, chopping board, knife, pan, as well as the acting hands. VISOR introduces an annotation pipeline, AI-powered in parts, for scalability and quality. In total, we publicly release 272K manual semantic masks of 257 object classes, 9.9M interpolated dense masks, 67K hand-object relations, covering 36 hours of 179 untrimmed videos. Along with the annotations, we introduce three challenges in video object segmentation, interaction understanding and long-term reasoning.\n\nFor data, code and leaderboards: http://epic-kitchens.github.io/VISOR"}}

Duration-informed Temporal Localization of Narrated Actions in Vlogs", "abstract": "We consider the task of temporal human action localization in lifestyle vlogs. We introduce a novel dataset consisting of manual annotations of temporal localization for 13,000 narrated actions in 1,200 video clips. We present an extensive analysis of this data, which allows us to better understand how the language and visual modalities interact throughout the videos. We propose a simple yet effective method to localize the narrated actions based on their expected duration. Through several experiments and analyses, we show that our method brings complementary information with respect to previous methods, and leads to improvements over previous work for the task of temporal action localization."}}

Our system takes a single RGB image and hand location as input to segment the hand and hand-held object. For learning, we generate responsibility maps that show how well a hand's motion explains other pixels' motion in video. We use these responsibility maps as pseudo-labels to train a weakly-supervised neural network using an attention-based similarity loss and contrastive loss. Our system outperforms alternate methods, achieving good performance on the 100DOH, EPIC-KITCHENS, and HO3D datasets."}}
