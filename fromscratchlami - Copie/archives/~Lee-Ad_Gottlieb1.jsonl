These predictions can be used to fuel growth: It may allow these companies to target individual customers -- for example to convert non-paying consumers to begin paying for for enhanced services -- or to identify customers not maximizing their subscription product.\nThis assistance can avoid an increase in the churn rate, and for some consumers may increase their usage.\n\nIn this work, we develop a deep learning model to predict the product usage of a given consumer, based on historical usage. We adapt a Convolutional Neural Network to time-series data followed by Auxiliary Output, and demonstrate that this enhanced model effectively predicts future change in usage."}}

This improves upon the best previous result due to Chan et al. (SIAM J. Comput. 4 (2018)), who gave a runtime of about n2O(ddim) \u00b7 2(ddim/\u0454)O(ddim) \u221alogn. For Steiner tree our methods achieve an even better runtime n (logn)(1/\u0454)O(ddim2)."}}
