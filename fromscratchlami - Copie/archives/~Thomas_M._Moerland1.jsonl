In contrast to parametric deep reinforcement learning approaches in which reward signals need to be back-propagated slowly, these methods only need to discover the solution once, and may then repeatedly solve the task. However, episodic control solutions are stored in discrete tables, and this approach has so far only been applied to discrete action space problems. Therefore, this paper introduces Continuous Episodic Control (CEC), a novel non-parametric episodic memory algorithm for sequential decision making in problems with a continuous action space. Results on several sparse-reward continuous control environments show that our proposed method learns faster than state-of-the-art model-free RL and memory-augmented RL algorithms, while maintaining good long-run performance as well. In short, CEC can be a fast approach for learning in continuous control tasks."}}

Non-parametric episodic memory, on the other hand, provides a faster learning alternative that does not require representation learning and uses maximum episodic return as state-action values for action selection. Episodic memory and reinforcement learning both have their own strengths and weaknesses. Notably, humans can leverage multiple memory systems concurrently during learning and benefit from all of them. In this work, we propose a method called Two-Memory reinforcement learning agent (2M) that combines episodic memory and reinforcement learning to distill both of their strengths. The 2M agent exploits the speed of the episodic memory part and the optimality and the generalization capacity of the reinforcement learning part to complement each other. Our experiments demonstrate that the 2M agent is more data efficient and outperforms both pure episodic memory and pure reinforcement learning, as well as a state-of-the-art memory-augmented RL agent. Moreover, the proposed approach provides a general framework that can be used to combine any episodic memory agent with other off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms."}}

The key insight of Go-Explore was that successful exploration requires an agent to first return to an interesting state ('Go'), and only then explore into unknown terrain ('Explore'). We refer to such exploration after a goal is reached as 'post-exploration'. In this paper we present a systematic study of post-exploration, answering open questions that the Go-Explore paper did not answer yet. First, we study the isolated potential of post-exploration, by turning it on and off within the same algorithm. Subsequently, we introduce new methodology to adaptively decide when to post-explore and for how long to post-explore. Experiments on a range of MiniGrid environments show that post-exploration indeed boosts performance (with a bigger impact than tuning regular exploration parameters), and this effect is further enhanced by adaptively deciding when and for how long to post-explore. In short, our work identifies adaptive post-exploration as a promising direction for RL exploration research. "}}

Yet, it has remained a considerable challenge to develop practical algorithms that exhibit some of these promises. To improve our fundamental understanding of HRL, we investigate hierarchical credit assignment from the perspective of conventional multistep reinforcement learning. We show how e.g., a 1-step `hierarchical backup' can be seen as a conventional multistep backup with $n$ skip connections over time connecting each subsequent state to the first independent of actions inbetween. Furthermore, we find that generalizing hierarchy to multistep return estimation methods requires us to consider how to partition the environment trace, in order to construct backup paths. We leverage these insight to develop a new hierarchical algorithm Hier$Q_k(\\lambda)$, for which we demonstrate that hierarchical credit assignment alone can already boost agent performance (i.e., when eliminating generalization or exploration). Altogether, our work yields fundamental insight into the nature of hierarchical backups and distinguishes this as an additional basis for reinforcement learning research. "}}

In contrast to standard forward dynamics models that predict a full next state, value equivalent models are trained to predict a future value, thereby emphasizing value relevant information in the representations. While value equivalent models have shown strong empirical success, there is no research yet that visualizes and  investigates what types of representations these models actually learn. Therefore, in this paper we visualize the latent representation of MuZero agents. We find that action trajectories may diverge between observation embeddings and internal state transition dynamics, which could lead to instability during planning. Based on this insight, we propose two regularization techniques to stabilize MuZero's performance. Additionally, we provide an open-source implementation of MuZero along with an interactive visualizer of learned representations, which may aid further investigation of value equivalent algorithms."}}

Two key approaches to this problem are reinforcement learning (RL) and planning. This paper presents a survey of the integration of both fields, better known as model-based reinforcement learning. Model-based RL has two main steps. First, we systematically cover approaches to dynamics model learning, including challenges like dealing with stochasticity, uncertainty, partial observability, and temporal abstraction. Second, we present a systematic categorization of planning-learning integration, including aspects like: where to start planning, what budgets to allocate to planning and real data collection, how to plan, and how to integrate planning in the learning and acting loop. After these two sections, we also discuss implicit model-based RL as an end-to-end alternative for model learning and planning, and we cover the potential benefits of model-based RL. Along the way, the survey also draws connections to several related RL fields, like hierarchical RL and transfer learning. Altogether, the survey presents a broad conceptual overview of the combination of planning and learning for MDP optimization."}}

Two successful approaches to MDP optimization are reinforcement learning and planning, which both largely have their own research communities. However, if both research fields solve the same problem, then we might be able to disentangle the common factors in their solution approaches. Therefore, this paper presents a unifying algorithmic framework for reinforcement learning and planning (FRAP), which identifies underlying dimensions on which MDP planning and learning algorithms have to decide. At the end of the paper, we compare a variety of well-known planning, model-free and model-based RL algorithms along these dimensions. Altogether, the framework may help provide deeper insight in the algorithmic design space of planning and reinforcement learning."}}

Multi-step approximate real-time dynamic programming, a recently successful algorithm class of which AlphaZero [Silver et al., 2018] is an example, combines both by nesting planning within a learning loop. However, the combination of planning and learning introduces a new question: how should we balance time spend on planning, learning and acting? The importance of this trade-off has not been explicitly studied before. We show that it is actually of key importance, with computational results indicating that we should neither plan too long nor too short. Conceptually, we identify a new spectrum of planning-learning algorithms which ranges from exhaustive search (long planning) to model-free RL (no planning), with optimal performance achieved midway."}}

However, these local visit counts ignore a second type of uncertainty induced by the size of the subtree below an action. We first show how, due to the lack of this second uncertainty type, MCTS may completely fail in well-known sparse exploration problems, known from the reinforcement learning community. We then introduce a new algorithm, which estimates the size of the subtree below an action, and leverages this information in the UCB formula to better direct exploration. Subsequently, we generalize these ideas by showing that loops, i.e., the repeated occurrence of (approximately) the same state in the same trace, are actually a special case of subtree depth variation. Testing on a variety of tasks shows that our algorithms increase sample efficiency, especially when the planning budget per timestep is small."}}

The survey focuses on agent/robot emotions, and mostly ignores human user emotions. Emotions are recognized as functional in decision-making by influencing motivation and action selection. Therefore, computational emotion models are usually grounded in the agent\u2019s decision making architecture, of which RL is an important subclass. Studying emotions in RL-based agents is useful for three research fields. For machine learning (ML) researchers, emotion models may improve learning efficiency. For the interactive ML and human\u2013robot interaction community, emotions can communicate state and enhance user investment. Lastly, it allows affective modelling researchers to investigate their emotion theories in a successful AI agent class. This survey provides background on emotion theory and RL. It systematically addresses (1) from what underlying dimensions (e.g. homeostasis, appraisal) emotions can be derived and how these can be modelled in RL-agents, (2) what types of emotions have been derived from these dimensions, and (3) how these emotions may either influence the learning efficiency of the agent or be useful as social signals. We also systematically compare evaluation criteria, and draw connections to important RL sub-domains like (intrinsic) motivation and model-based RL. In short, this survey provides both a practical overview for engineers wanting to implement emotions in their RL agents, and identifies challenges and directions for future emotion-RL research."}}
