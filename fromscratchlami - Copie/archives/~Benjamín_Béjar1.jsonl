Behavioral therapy is the first-line treatment for patients with TS, and it helps patients raise awareness about tic occurrence as well as develop tic inhibition strategies. However, the limited availability of therapists and the difficulties for in-home follow up work limits its effectiveness. An automatic tic detection system that is easy to deploy could alleviate the difficulties of home-therapy by providing feedback to the patients while exercising tic awareness. In this work, we propose a novel architecture (T-Net) for automatic tic detection and classification from untrimmed videos. T-Net combines temporal detection and segmentation and operates on features that are interpretable to a clinician. We compare T-Net to several state-of-the-art systems working on deep features extracted from the raw videos and T-Net achieves comparable performance in terms of average precision while relying on interpretable features needed in clinical practice."}}

Our approach builds upon recent results on continuous sparse signal recovery using the finite rate of innovation framework. Our results show that our method achieves near to optimal performance in terms of signal recovery on synthetically generated data. We then explore its potential application to neural activity inference from calcium imaging fluorescence traces, and propose an algorithm based on the proposed estimation method that is applicable to real calcium fluorescence signals of arbitrary length."}}

In many cases, it is important to be able to detect biological objects, such as blood cells, in microscopic images. However, state-of-the-art object detection methods are not designed to work on holographic images. Typically, the hologram must first be reconstructed into an image of the specimen, given a priori knowledge of the distance between the specimen and sensor, and standard object detection methods can then be used to detect objects in the reconstructed image. This paper describes a method for detecting objects directly in holograms while jointly reconstructing the image. This is achieved by assuming a sparse convolutional model for the objects being imaged and modeling the diffraction process responsible for generating the recorded hologram. This paper also describes an unsupervised method for training the convolutional templates, shows that the proposed method produces promising results for detecting white blood cells in holographic images, and demonstrates that the proposed object detection method is robust to errors in estimated focal depth."}}

Motivated by simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and structure from motion (SfM), we investigate sampling at unknown locations. Without further constraints, the problem is often hopeless. For example, we recently showed that, for polynomial and bandlimited signals, it is possible to find two signals, arbitrarily far from each other, that fit the measurements. However, we also showed that this can be overcome by adding constraints to the sample positions. In this paper, we show that these constraints lead to a uniform sampling of a composite of functions. Furthermore, the formulation retains the key aspects of the SLAM and SfM problems, whilst providing uniqueness, in many cases. We demonstrate this by studying two simple examples of constrained sampling at unknown locations. In the first, we consider sampling a periodic bandlimited signal composite with an unknown linear function. We derive the sampling requirements for uniqueness and present an algorithm that recovers both the bandlimited signal and the linear warping. Furthermore, we prove that, when the requirements for uniqueness are not met, the cases of multiple solutions have measure zero. For our second example, we consider polynomials sampled such that the sampling positions are constrained by a rational function. We previously proved that, if a specific sampling requirement is met, uniqueness is achieved. In addition, we present an alternate minimization scheme for solving the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Finally, fully reproducible simulation results are provided to support our theoretical analysis."}}

We derive general conditions under which perfect reconstruction is possible for sampling kernels satisfying Strang-Fix conditions. Previous results on the subject consider two particular cases; when the kernel is able to reproduce (complex) exponentials, or when it has the polynomial reproduction property. In this paper, we extend such analysis to the case where both properties could be found in the sampling kernel and show that the former two situations can be regarded as special cases. As a result of our analysis, we provide general conditions under which perfect recovery in the noiseless case is possible. In practice, a given sampling kernel might not satisfy Strang-Fix conditions. When dealing with arbitrary sampling kernels, we propose a unified view for sampling and reconstruction in the frequency domain. Our formulation generalizes previous approaches and provides new insights for devising optimal reconstruction schemes. We also propose a novel algorithm for denoising treating the problem as a particular instance of structured low-rank approximation. Finally, we provide some numerical experiments and a comparison between different state-of-the-art methods showing the improved estimation performance of the proposed approach."}}
