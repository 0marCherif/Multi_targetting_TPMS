KD approaches conventionally address problem domains where the teacher and student network have equal numbers of classes for classification. We provide a knowledge distillation solution tailored for class specialization, where the user requires a compact and performant network specializing in a subset of classes from the class set used to train the teacher model. To this end, we introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework, Class Specialized Knowledge Distillation (CSKD), that combines two loss functions: Renormalized Knowledge Distillation (RKD) and Intra-Class Variance (ICV) to render a computationally-efficient, specialized student network. We report results on several popular architectural benchmarks and tasks. In particular, CSKD consistently demonstrates significant performance improvements over teacher models for highly restrictive specialization tasks (e.g., instances where the number of subclasses or datasets is relatively small), in addition to outperforming other state-of-the-art knowledge distillation approaches for class specialization tasks."}}

Inspired by the cyclic nature of the original CycleGAN, we perform single image blind motion deblurring in similar fashion while presenting motion deblurring as a cycle-consistent approach. Our proposed method achieves the best qualitative and quantitative results in comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods on GoPro dataset. We also explore the industrial aspect of motion deblurring in wind turbines (WT) with surface cracks on turbine blades. We collect 700 high-resolution images of faulty WT blades via UAV, which we called Turbine Blade dataset. Finally, we compare the performance of our proposed method against existing methods on Turbine Blade dataset and show that our proposed approach achieves the best performance both qualitatively and quantitatively."}}

Adaptive image smoothing is achieved using auto-threshold canny edge detection to produce an accurate edge map used to produce a blurred image that preserves more edge features. The proposed algorithm then uses color reduction techniques to reconstruct the image using only a few representative colors. Through this technique, the algorithm can reduce the effects of adversarial perturbations on images. We also discuss experimental data on classification accuracy. Our results showed that the proposed approach reduces adversarial perturbation in adversarial attacks and increases the robustness of the deep convolutional neural network models."}}

For the first time in blind motion deblurring, we propose a sparse ResNet-block as a combination of sparse convolution layers and a trainable spatial pooler k-winner based on HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory) to replace non-linearity such as ReLU in the ResNet-block of SL-CycleGAN generators. Furthermore, unlike many state-of-the-art GAN-based motion deblurring methods that treat motion deblurring as a linear end-to-end process, we take our inspiration from the domain-to-domain translation ability of CycleGAN, and we show that image deblurring can be cycle-consistent while achieving the best qualitative results. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on popular image benchmarks both qualitatively and quantitatively and achieve the record-breaking PSNR of 38.087 dB on GoPro dataset, which is 5.377 dB better than the most recent deblurring method."}}

We utilize a Cooperative Context-Aware Pruning (CCAP) module to produce sparse attention maps. They are then used to transmit the source models\u2019 parameters to the target model precisely. We also leverage a weight-regular loss to minimize the difference between the source models\u2019 and the target models\u2019 parameters. Our quantitatively empirical evaluation shows that our CCAP module plus the weight-regular loss achieves lower model complexity without having serious performance decreasing."}}

Learning-based frame interpolation techniques use machine learning algorithms to predict frames but have difficulty with uncovered areas and non-linear motion. This approach uses DCT-based residual coding only on areas that are difficult for video interpolation and provides tunable compression for such areas through an adaptive selection of data to be encoded. Experimental data for both PSNR and the newer video multi-method assessment fusion (VMAF) metrics are provided. Our results show that we can reduce the amount of data required to represent a video stream compared with traditional video coding while outperforming video frame interpolation techniques in quality."}}

We propose three color quantization pre-processing techniques to make DCNNs more robust to adversarial perturbation including Gaussian smoothing and PNM color reduction (GPCR), color quantization using Gaussian smoothing and K-means (GK-means), and fast GK-means. We evaluate the approaches on a subset of the ImageNet dataset. Our evaluation reveals that our GK-means-based algorithms have the best top-1 accuracy.

In our approach, the moving object is extracted by background subtraction, and the background model is updated by the first order recurrence filter. Then, two complementary shape features are extracted for moving object classification. They are contour-based description: Fourier descriptor and region-based description: histogram of oriented gradient. As the binary classifier (support vector machine) is able to provide the posterior probability, we effectively integrate two types of features to achieve better performance. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective and outperforms some existing technique."}}
