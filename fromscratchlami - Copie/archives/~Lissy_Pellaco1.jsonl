We focus on the case of nodes that employ time-to-digital converters to determine the range between them precisely. This specific design choice leads to a sawtooth model for the captured signal, which has not been studied before from an estimation theoretic standpoint. In the study of this model, we recover the basic conclusion of a well-known article by Freris, Graham, and Kumar in clock synchronization. More importantly, we discover a surprising identifiability result on the sawtooth signal model: noise improves the theoretical condition of the estimation of the phase and offset parameters. To complete our study, we provide performance references for joint clock synchronization and ranging using the sawtooth signal model by presenting an exhaustive simulation study on basic estimation strategies under different realistic conditions. With our contributions in this paper, we enable further research in the estimation of sawtooth signal models and pave the path towards their industrial use for clock synchronization and ranging."}}

In this paper, we study the use of time-to-digital converters in wireless sensors, which provides clock synchronization and ranging at negligible communication overhead through a sawtooth signal model for round trip times between two nodes. In particular, we derive Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bounds for a linearitzation of the sawtooth signal model, and we thoroughly evaluate simple estimation techniques by simulation, giving clear and concise performance references for this technology."}}

However, link adaptation suffers from impairments due to channel state information (CSI) feedback delay. In this paper, we extend the data-driven MCS selection scheme in our previous work to the case of outdated CSI, by assuming that CSI history is available to the system. We present two approaches that leverage the CSI history to optimally select the MCS for the current channel, i.e., i) an end-to-end (E2E) machine learning approach and ii) a hybrid data-driven and model-based approach. The E2E method uses the CSI history as input to a neural network for MCS selection. Conversely, the hybrid method uses a lower-dimensionality sufficient statistic for the instantaneous CSI, computed from the CSI history, as input to a neural network for MCS selection. We demonstrate that replacing the CSI history with the sufficient statistic comes without loss of generality. Moreover, by means of numerical experiments, we show that both approaches effectively compensate for the feedback delay. However, we advocate the hybrid approach as it comes with the additional benefits of i) a smaller neural network, which in turn requires a lower amount of data and training time, ii) improved explainability, and iii) better insights into optimization choices."}}

However, computing the transmit beamformer that maximizes the weighted sum rate subject to a power constraint is an NP-hard problem. As a result, iterative algorithms that converge to a local optimum are used in practice. Among them, the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm has gained popularity, but its computational complexity and consequent latency has motivated the need for lower-complexity approximations at the expense of performance. Motivated by the recent success of deep unfolding in the trade-off between complexity and performance, we propose the novel application of deep unfolding to the WMMSE algorithm for a MISO downlink channel. The main idea consists of mapping a fixed number of iterations of the WMMSE algorithm into trainable neural network layers, whose architecture reflects the structure of the original algorithm. With respect to traditional end-to-end learning, deep unfolding naturally incorporates expert knowledge, with the benefits of immediate and well-grounded architecture selection, fewer trainable parameters, and better explainability. However, the formulation of the WMMSE algorithm, as described in Shi et al., is not amenable to be unfolded due to a matrix inversion, an eigendecomposition, and a bisection search performed at each iteration. Therefore, we present an alternative formulation that circumvents these operations by resorting to projected gradient descent. By means of simulations, we show that, in most of the settings, the unfolded WMMSE outperforms or performs equally to the WMMSE for a fixed number of iterations, with the advantage of a lower computational load."}}
