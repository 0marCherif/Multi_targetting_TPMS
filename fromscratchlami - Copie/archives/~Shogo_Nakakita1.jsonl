We discuss the estimation and test theories for the parameter determining the smoothness of the observation, as well as the least-square-type estimation for the parameters in the diffusion coefficient and the drift one of the latent diffusion process. In addition to the theoretical discussion, we also examine the performance of the estimation and the test with computational simulation, and show an example of real data analysis for one EEG data whose observation can be regarded as smoother one than ordinary diffusion processes with statistical significance."}}
