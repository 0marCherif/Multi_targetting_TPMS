They have resemblance to Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs), but break free from some limitations of PGMs. By aiming to provide expressive methods for representation learning instead of computing marginals or most likely configurations, GNNs provide flexibility in the choice of information flowing rules while maintaining good performance. Despite their success and inspirations, they lack efficient ways to represent and learn higher-order relations among variables/nodes. More expressive higher-order GNNs which operate on k-tuples of nodes need increased computational resources in order to process higher-order tensors. We propose Factor Graph Neural Networks (FGNNs) to effectively capture higher-order relations for inference and learning. To do so, we first derive an efficient approximate Sum-Product loopy belief propagation inference algorithm for discrete higher-order PGMs. We then neuralize the novel message passing scheme into a Factor Graph Neural Network (FGNN) module by allowing richer representations of the message update rules; this facilitates both efficient inference and powerful end-to-end learning. We further show that with a suitable choice of message aggregation operators, our FGNN is also able to represent Max-Product belief propagation, providing a single family of architecture that can represent both Max and Sum-Product loopy belief propagation. Our extensive experimental evaluation on synthetic as well as real datasets demonstrates the potential of the proposed model."}}

However, poorly designed implicit GNN layers can experience over-smoothing or may have limited adaptability to learn data geometry, potentially hindering their performance in graph learning problems. To address these issues, we introduce a geometric framework to design implicit graph diffusion layers based on a parameterized graph Laplacian operator. Our framework allows learning the geometry of vertex and edge spaces, as well as the graph gradient operator from data. We further show how implicit GNN layers can be viewed as the fixed-point solution of a Dirichlet energy minimization problem and give conditions under which it may suffer from over-smoothing. To overcome the over-smoothing problem, we design our implicit graph diffusion layer as the solution of a Dirichlet energy minimization problem with constraints on vertex features, enabling it to trade off smoothing with the preservation of node feature information. With an appropriate hyperparameter set to be larger than the largest eigenvalue of the parameterized graph Laplacian, our framework guarantees a unique equilibrium and quick convergence. Our models demonstrate better performance than leading implicit and explicit GNNs on benchmark datasets for node and graph classification tasks, with substantial accuracy improvements observed for some datasets."}}

They rely on message passing that iteratively aggregates neighbour's features and often suffer performance degradation on non-homophilous graphs where useful information is hardly available in the local neighbourhood. In addition, earlier studies show that in some cases GNNs are even outperformed by Multi-Layer Perceptron, indicating insufficient exploitation of node feature information. Motivated by the two limitations, we propose ProtoGNN, a novel message passing framework that augments existing GNNs by effectively combining node features with structural information. ProtoGNN learns multiple class prototypes for each class from raw node features with the slot-attention mechanism. These prototype representations are then transferred onto the structural node features with explicit message passing to all non-training nodes irrespective of distance. This form of message passing, from training nodes to class prototypes to non-training nodes, also serves as a shortcut that bypasses local graph neighbourhoods and captures global information. ProtoGNN is a generic framework which can be applied onto any of the existing GNN backbones to improve node representations when node features are strong and local graph information is scarce. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that ProtoGNN brings performance improvement to various GNN backbones and achieves state-of-the-art on several non-homophilous datasets."}}

GNNs follow an approach of message passing analogous to 1-dimensional Weisfeiler Lehman (1-WL) test for graph isomorphism and consequently are limited by the distinguishing power of 1-WL. More expressive higher-order GNNs which operate on k-tuples of nodes need increased computational resources in order to process higher-order tensors. Instead of the WL approach, in this work, we follow the classical approach of Individualization and Refinement (IR), a technique followed by most practical isomorphism solvers. Individualization refers to artificially distinguishing a node in the graph and refinement is the propagation of this information to other nodes through message passing. We learn to adaptively select nodes to individualize and to aggregate the resulting graphs after refinement to help handle the complexity. Our technique lets us learn richer node embeddings while keeping the computational complexity manageable. Theoretically, we show that our procedure is more expressive than the 1-WL test. Experiments show that our method outperforms prominent 1-WL GNN models as well as competitive higher-order baselines on several benchmark synthetic and real datasets. Furthermore, our method opens new doors for exploring the paradigm of learning on graph structures with individualization and refinement."}}

Other more expressive models either are computationally expensive or need preprocessing to extract structural features from the graph. In this work, we propose to make GNNs universal by guiding the learning process with exact isomorphism solver techniques which operate on the paradigm of $\\textit{Individualization and refinement}$ (IR), a method to artificially introduce asymmetry and further refine the coloring when 1-WL stops. Isomorphism solvers generate a search-tree of colorings whose leaves uniquely identify the graph. However, the tree grows exponentially large and needs hand-crafted pruning techniques which are not desirable from a learning perspective. We take a probabilistic view and approximate the search tree of colorings ( i.e. embeddings) by sampling multiple paths from root to leaves of the search-tree. To learn more discriminative representations, we guide the sampling process with $\\textit{particle filter}$ updates, a principled approach for sequential state estimation. Our algorithm is end-to-end differentiable, can be applied with any GNN as backbone and learns richer graph representations with only linear increase in runtime. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach consistently outperforms leading GNN models on both synthetic benchmarks for isomorphism detection as well as real-world datasets."}}

These models often rely on localized first order approximations of spectral graph convolutions and hence are unable to capture higher-order relational information between nodes. Probabilistic Graphical Models form another class of models that provide rich flexibility in incorporating such relational information but are limited by inefficient approximate inference algorithms at higher order. In this paper, we propose to combine these approaches to learn better node and graph representations. First, we derive an efficient approximate sum-product loopy belief propagation inference algorithm for higher-order PGMs. We then embed the message passing updates into a neural network to provide the inductive bias of the inference algorithm in end-to-end learning. This gives us a model that is flexible enough to accommodate domain knowledge while maintaining the computational advantage. We further propose methods for constructing higher-order factors that are conditioned on node and edge features and share parameters wherever necessary. Our experimental evaluation shows that our model indeed captures higher-order information, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art $k$-order graph neural networks in molecular datasets."}}
