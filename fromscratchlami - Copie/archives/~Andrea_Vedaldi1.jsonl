In this paper, we show that this task can be addressed effectively by leveraging instead 2D pre-trained models for instance segmentation. We propose a novel approach to lift 2D segments to 3D and fuse them by means of a neural field representation, which encourages multi-view consistency across frames. The core of our approach is a slow-fast clustering objective function, which is scalable and well-suited for scenes with a large number of objects. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require an upper bound on the number of objects or object tracking across frames. To demonstrate the scalability of the slow-fast clustering, we create a new semi-realistic dataset called the Messy Rooms dataset, which features scenes with up to 500 objects per scene. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on challenging scenes from the ScanNet, Hypersim, and Replica datasets, as well as on our newly created Messy Rooms dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of our slow-fast clustering method."}}

However, they do not correctly interpret instructions that specify the spatial layout of the composition. We propose a simple approach that can achieve robust layout control without requiring training or fine-tuning the image generator. Our technique, which we call layout guidance, manipulates the cross-attention layers that the model uses to interface textual and visual information and steers the reconstruction in the desired direction given, e.g., a user-specified layout. In order to determine how to best guide attention, we study the role of different attention maps when generating images and experiment with two alternative strategies, forward and backward guidance. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively with several experiments, validating its effectiveness. We further demonstrate its versatility by extending layout guidance to the task of editing the layout and context of a given real image."}}

As a result, in recent years, open-vocabulary methods have attracted the interest of the community. This paper proposes a new method for zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. Prior work largely relies on contrastive training using image-text pairs, leveraging grouping mechanisms to learn image features that are both aligned with language and well-localised. This however can introduce ambiguity as the visual appearance of images with similar captions often varies. Instead, we leverage the generative properties of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to sample a set of support images for a given textual category. This provides a distribution of appearances for a given text circumventing the ambiguity problem. We further propose a mechanism that considers the contextual background of the sampled images to better localise objects and segment the background directly. We show that our method can be used to ground several existing pre-trained self-supervised feature extractors in natural language and provide explainable predictions by mapping back to regions in the support set. Our proposal is training-free, relying on pre-trained components only, yet, shows strong performance on a range of open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks, obtaining a lead of more than 10% on the Pascal VOC benchmark."}}

Recent approaches have utilized this signal to learn correspondence estimation from close-by frame pairs. However, by only relying on close-by frame pairs, those approaches miss out on the richer long-range consistency between distant overlapping frames. To address this, we propose a self-supervised approach for correspondence estimation that learns from multiview consistency in short RGB-D video sequences. Our approach combines pairwise correspondence estimation and registration with a novel SE(3) transformation synchronization algorithm. Our key insight is that self-supervised multiview registration allows us to obtain correspondences over longer time frames; increasing both the diversity and difficulty of sampled pairs. We evaluate our approach on indoor scenes for correspondence estimation and RGB-D pointcloud registration and find that we perform on-par with supervised approaches."}}

Such methods are not able to scale to diverse sets of objects in the wild. We present BANMo, a method that requires neither a specialized sensor nor a pre-defined template shape. BANMo builds high-fidelity, articulated 3D models (including shape and animatable skinning weights) from many monocular casual videos in a differentiable rendering framework. While the use of many videos provides more coverage of camera views and object articulations, they introduce significant challenges in establishing correspondence across scenes with different backgrounds, illumination conditions, etc. Our key insight is to merge three schools of thought; (1) classic deformable shape models that make use of articulated bones and blend skinning, (2) volumetric neural radiance fields (NeRFs) that are amenable to gradient-based optimization, and (3) canonical embeddings that generate correspondences between pixels and an articulated model. We introduce neural blend skinning models that allow for differentiable and invertible articulated deformations. When combined with canonical embeddings, such models allow us to establish dense correspondences across videos that can be self-supervised with cycle consistency. On real and synthetic datasets, BANMo shows higher-fidelity 3D reconstructions than prior works for humans and animals, with the ability to render realistic images from novel viewpoints and poses."}}

Here, the unlabelled images may come from labelled classes or from novel ones. Existing recognition methods are not able to deal with this setting, because they make several restrictive assumptions, such as the unlabelled instances only coming from known - or unknown - classes, and the number of unknown classes being known a-priori. We address the more unconstrained setting, naming it 'Generalized Category Discovery', and challenge all these assumptions. We first establish strong baselines by taking state-of-the-art algorithms from novel category discovery and adapting them for this task. Next, we propose the use of vision transformers with contrastive representation learning for this open-world setting. We then introduce a simple yet effective semi-supervised k-means method to cluster the unlabelled data into seen and unseen classes automatically, substantially outperforming the baselines. Finally, we also propose a new approach to estimate the number of classes in the unlabelled data. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on public datasets for generic object classification and on fine-grained datasets, leveraging the recent Semantic Shift Benchmark suite."}}

However, compared to using appearance, it has some blind spots, such as the fact that objects become invisible if they do not move. In this work, we propose an approach that combines the strengths of motion-based and appearance-based segmentation. We propose to supervise an image segmentation network, tasking it with predicting regions that are likely to contain simple motion patterns, and thus likely to correspond to objects. We apply this network in two modes. In the unsupervised video segmentation mode, the network is trained on a collection of unlabelled videos, using the learning process itself as an algorithm to segment these videos. In the unsupervised image segmentation model, the network is learned using videos and applied to segment independent still images. With this, we obtain strong empirical results in unsupervised video and image segmentation, significantly outperforming the state of the art on benchmarks such as DAVIS, sometimes with a  IoU gap."}}

Given an image feature extractor, for example pre-trained using self-supervision, N3F uses it as a teacher to learn a student network defined in 3D space. The 3D student network is similar to a neural radiance field that distills said features and can be trained with the usual differentiable rendering machinery. As a consequence, N3F is readily applicable to most neural rendering formulations, including vanilla NeRF and its extensions to complex dynamic scenes. We show that our method not only enables semantic understanding in the context of scene-specific neural fields without the use of manual labels, but also consistently improves over the self-supervised 2D baselines. This is demonstrated by considering various tasks, such as 2D object retrieval, 3D segmentation, and scene editing, in diverse sequences, including long egocentric videos in the EPIC-KITCHENS benchmark."}}

In this paper, we consider in particular how to characterise visual groupings discovered automatically by deep neural networks, starting with state-of-the-art clustering methods. In some cases, clusters readily correspond to an existing labelled dataset. However, often they do not, yet they still maintain an\" intuitive interpretability''. We introduce two concepts, visual learnability and describability, that can be used to quantify the interpretability of arbitrary image groupings, including unsupervised ones. The idea is to measure (1) how well humans can learn to reproduce a grouping by measuring their ability to generalise from a small set of visual examples (learnability) and (2) whether the set of visual examples can be replaced by a succinct, textual description (describability). By assessing human annotators as classifiers, we remove the subjective quality of existing evaluation metrics. For better scalability, we finally propose a class-level captioning system to generate descriptions for visual groupings automatically and compare it to human annotators using the describability metric."}}

These tasks are particularly interesting in an unsupervised setting due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining dense image annotations, but existing unsupervised approaches struggle with complex scenes containing multiple objects. Differently from existing methods, which are purely based on deep learning, we take inspiration from traditional spectral segmentation methods by reframing image decomposition as a graph partitioning problem. Specifically, we examine the eigenvectors of the Laplacian of a feature affinity matrix from self-supervised networks. We find that these eigenvectors already decompose an image into meaningful segments, and can be readily used to localize objects in a scene. Furthermore, by clustering the features associated with these segments across a dataset, we can obtain well-delineated, nameable regions, ie semantic segmentations. Experiments on complex datasets (Pascal VOC, MS-COCO) demonstrate that our simple spectral method outperforms the state-of-the-art in unsupervised localization and segmentation by a significant margin. Furthermore, our method can be readily used for a variety of complex image editing tasks, such as background removal and compositing."}}
