Inspired by the dynamic deep networks that adapt the model structures or parameters conditioned on the inputs, we propose a DCP-guided hierarchical dynamic mechanism for image enhancement to adapt the model parameters and features from local to global as well as to keep spatial adjacency within the region. Specifically, channel-spatial-level, structure-level, and region-level dynamic components are sequentially applied. Channel-spatial-level dynamics obtain channel- and spatial-wise representation variations, and structure-level dynamics enable modeling geometric transformations and augment sampling locations for the varying local features to better describe the structures. In addition, a novel region-level dynamic is proposed to generate spatially continuous masks for dynamic features which capitalizes on the Dark Channel Priors (DCP). The proposed region-level dynamics benefit from exploiting the statistical differences between distorted and undistorted images. Moreover, the DCP-guided region generations are inherently spatial coherent which facilitates capturing local coherence of the images. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and generates visually pleasing images for multiple enhancement tasks,i.e. , image dehazing, image deraining and low-light image enhancement.

Moreover, dehazing performance of the learned model may deteriorate significantly when the training hazy-clean image pairs are insufficient and are different from real hazy images in applications. In this paper, we show that exploiting large scale training set and adapting to real hazy images are two critical issues in learning effective deep dehazing models. Under the depth guidance estimated by a well-trained depth estimation network, we leverage the conventional atmospheric scattering model to generate massive hazy-clean image pairs for the self-supervised pre-training of dehazing network. Furthermore, self-supervised adaptation is presented to adapt pre-trained network to real hazy images. Learning without forgetting strategy is also deployed in self-supervised adaptation by combining self-supervision and model adaptation via contrastive learning. Experiments show that our proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods, and is quite efficient, i.e., handling a 4K image in 23 ms.
