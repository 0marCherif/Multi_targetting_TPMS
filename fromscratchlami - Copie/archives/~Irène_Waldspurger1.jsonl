This strongly reduces the number of variables to optimize, but destroys the convexity of the problem, thus possibly introducing spurious second-order critical points which can prevent local optimization algorithms from finding the solution. Boumal, Voroninski, and Bandeira [2018] have recently shown that, when the size of the factors is of the order of the square root of the number of linear constraints, this does not happen: For almost any cost matrix, second-order critical points are global solutions. In this article, we show that this result is essentially tight: For smaller values of the size, second-order critical points are not generically optimal, even when considering only semidefinite programs with a rank 1 solution."}}

In her PhD, the author showed that, under some conditions on the wavelets, the norm of the scattering coefficients at a given layer only depends on the values of the signal outside a frequency band whose size is exponential in the depth of the layer. We give here a succinct presentation of this result, and slightly generalize it by removing one of the assumptions on the wavelets (namely the weak analyticity condition)."}}

It relies on a new reformulation of the phase retrieval problem, that involves the holomorphic extension of the wavelet transform. This reformulation allows to propagate phase information from low to high frequencies.\nNumerical results, on audio and non-audio signals, show that reconstruction is precise and stable to noise. The complexity of the algorithm is linear in the size of the signal, up to logarithmic factors. It can thus be applied to large signals."}}

We show that the reconstruction operator is continuous but not uniformly continuous. We describe how to construct pairs of functions which are far away in L 2 -norm but whose wavelet transforms are very close, in modulus. The principle is to modulate the wavelet transform of a fixed initial function by a phase which varies slowly in both time and frequency. This construction seems to cover all the instabilities that we observe in practice; we give a partial formal justification to this fact.\nFinally, we describe an exact reconstruction algorithm and use it to numerically confirm our analysis of the stability question."}}

We solve this problem using a provably convergent block coordinate descent algorithm whose structure is similar to that of the original greedy algorithm in Gerchberg and Saxton [1972], where each iteration is a matrix vector product.

(Transform\u00e9e en ondelettes : reconstruction de phase et de scattering)", "abstract": "Automatically understanding the content of a natural signal, like a sound or an image, is in general a difficult task. In their naive representation, signals are indeed complicated objects, belonging to high-dimensional spaces. With a different representation, they can however be easier to interpret. This thesis considers a representation commonly used in these cases, in particular for theanalysis of audio signals: the modulus of the wavelet transform. To better understand the behaviour of this operator, we study, from a theoretical as well as algorithmic point of view, the corresponding inverse problem: the reconstruction of a signal from the modulus of its wavelet transform. This problem belongs to a wider class of inverse problems: phase retrieval problems. In a first chapter, we describe a new algorithm, PhaseCut, which numerically solves a generic phase retrieval problem. Like the similar algorithm PhaseLift, PhaseCut relies on a convex relaxation of the phase retrieval problem, which happens to be of the same form as relaxations of the widely studied problem MaxCut. We compare the performances of PhaseCut and PhaseLift, in terms of precision and complexity. In the next two chapters, we study the specific case of phase retrieval for the wavelet transform. We show that any function with no negative frequencies is uniquely determined (up to a global phase) by the modulus of its wavelet transform, but that the reconstruction from the modulus is not stable to noise, for a strong notion of stability. However, we prove a local stability property. We also present a new non-convex phase retrieval algorithm, which is specific to the case of the wavelet transform, and we numerically study its performances. Finally, in the last two chapters, we study a more sophisticated representation, built from the modulus of the wavelet transform: the scattering transform. Our goal is to understand which properties of a signal are characterized by its scattering transform. We first prove that the energy of scattering coefficients of a signal, at a given order, is upper bounded by the energy of the signal itself, convolved with a high-pass filter that depends on the order. We then study a generalization of the scattering transform, for stationary processes. We show that, in finite dimension, this generalized transform preserves the norm. In dimension one, we also show that the generalized scattering coefficients of a process characterize the tail of its distribution."}}
