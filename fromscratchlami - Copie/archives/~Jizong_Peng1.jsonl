To avoid degenerate solutions, two regularization strategies are applied on unlabeled images. The first one leverages mutual information maximization to ensure that all prototype vectors are considered by the network. The second explicitly enforces prototypes to be orthogonal by minimizing their cosine distance. Experimental results on two benchmark medical segmentation datasets reveal our method's effectiveness in improving segmentation performance when few annotated images are available."}}

Recent efforts have focused on incorporating such constraints in the training of convolutional neural networks (CNN), however this has so far been done within a continuous optimization framework. Yet, various segmentation constraints and regularization can be modeled and optimized more efficiently in a discrete formulation. This paper proposes a method, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, to train a CNN with discrete constraints and regularization priors. This method is applied to the segmentation of medical images with weak annotations, where both size constraints and boundary length regularization are enforced. Experiments on two benchmark datasets for medical image segmentation show our method to provide significant improvements compared to existing approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy, constraint satisfaction and convergence speed."}}

We present a method based on an ensemble of deep segmentation models. Models are trained on subsets of the annotated data and use non-annotated images to exchange information with each other, similar to co-training. Diversity across models is enforced with the use of adversarial samples. We demonstrate the potential of our method on three challenging image segmentation problems, and illustrate its ability to share information between simultaneously trained models, while preserving their diversity. Results indicate clear advantages in terms of performance compared to recently proposed semi-supervised methods for segmentation."}}

Semi-supervised learning seeks to overcome this limitation by exploiting unlabeled examples in the learning process. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised segmentation method that leverages mutual information (MI) on categorical distributions to achieve both global representation invariance and local smoothness. In this method, we maximize the MI for intermediate feature embeddings that are taken from both the encoder and decoder of a segmentation network. We first propose a global MI loss constraining the encoder to learn an image representation that is invariant to geometric transformations. Instead of resorting to computationally-expensive techniques for estimating the MI on continuous feature embeddings, we use projection heads to map them to a discrete cluster assignment where MI can be computed efficiently. Our method also includes a local MI loss to promote spatial consistency in the feature maps of the decoder and provide a smoother segmentation. Since mutual information does not require a strict ordering of clusters in two different assignments, we incorporate a final consistency regularization loss on the output which helps align the cluster labels throughout the network. We evaluate the method on four challenging publicly-available datasets for medical image segmentation. Experimental results show our method to outperform recently-proposed approaches for semi-supervised segmentation and provide an accuracy near to full supervision while training with very few annotated images."}}

Among various methods, contrastive learning learns a discriminative representation by constructing positive and negative pairs. However, it is not trivial to build reasonable pairs for a segmentation task in an unsupervised way. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised pre-training framework that avoids the drawback of contrastive learning. Our framework consists of two principles: unsupervised over-segmentation as a pre-train task using mutual information maximization and boundary-aware preserving learning. Experimental results on two benchmark medical segmentation datasets reveal our method's effectiveness in improving segmentation performance when few annotated images are available."}}
