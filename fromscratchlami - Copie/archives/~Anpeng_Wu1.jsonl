Existing methods either directly adjust the relationship between observed covariates and treatments or recover the hidden confounders by probabilistic models. However, they either rely on a correctly specified treatment assignment model or require strong prior of the unobserved confounder distribution. To relax these requirements, we propose a Contrastive Regularizer (CR) to learn the proxy representation that  contains all the relevant information in unobserved confounders. Based on the CR, we propose a novel ranked weighting method (Rw) to de-bias the treatment assignment. Combining Cr and Rw, we propose a neural network framework named CRNet to estimate the effects of multiple continuous treatments under unobserved confounders, evaluated by the Average Dose-Response Function. Empirically, we demonstrate that CRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets."}}

Recently, nonlinear IV estimators were proposed to allow for nonlinear model in both stages. However, the observed confounders may be imbalanced in stage 2, which could still lead to biased treatment effect estimation in certain cases. To this end, we propose a Confounder Balanced IV Regression (CB-IV) algorithm to jointly remove the bias from the unmeasured confounders and the imbalance of observed confounders. Theoretically, by redefining and solving an inverse problem for potential outcome function, we show that our CB-IV algorithm can unbiasedly estimate treatment effects and achieve lower variance. The IV methods have a major disadvantage in that little prior or theory is currently available to pre-define a valid IV in real-world scenarios. Thus, we study two more challenging settings without pre-defined valid IVs: (1) indistinguishable IVs implicitly present in observations, i.e., mixed-variable challenge, and (2) latent IVs don't appear in observations, i.e., latent-variable challenge. To address these two challenges, we extend our CB-IV by a latent-variable module, namely CB-IV-L algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CB-IV(-L) outperforms the existing approaches."}}

However, the presence of unmeasured confounders increases the difficulty of estimating ICE in real-world scenarios. A wide range of methods have been proposed to address the unmeasured confounders with the aid of instrument variable (IV), which sources from the treatment randomization. The performance of these methods relies on the well-predefined IVs that satisfy the unconfounded instruments assumption (i.e., the IVs are independent with the unmeasured confounders given observed covariates), which is untestable and leads to finding a valid IV becomes an art rather than science. In this paper, we focus on estimating the ICE with confounded instruments that violate the unconfounded instruments assumption. By considering the conditional independence between the set of confounded instruments and the outcome variable, we propose a novel method, named CVAE-IV, to generate a substitute of the unmeasured confounder with a conditional variational autoencoder. Our theoretical analysis guarantees that the generated confounder substitute will identify unbiased ICE. Extensive experiments on bias demand prediction and Mendelian randomization analysis verify the effectiveness of our method."}}

However, the existing IV-based counterfactual prediction methods need well-predefined IVs, while it\u2019s an art rather than science to find valid IVs in many real-world scenes. Moreover, the predefined hand-made IVs could be weak or erroneous by violating the conditions of valid IVs. These thorny facts hinder the application of the IV-based counterfactual prediction methods. In this article, we propose a novel Automatic Instrumental Variable decomposition (AutoIV) algorithm to automatically generate representations serving the role of IVs from observed variables (IV candidates). Specifically, we let the learned IV representations satisfy the relevance condition with the treatment and exclusion condition with the outcome via mutual information maximization and minimization constraints, respectively. We also learn confounder representations by encouraging them to be relevant to both the treatment and the outcome. The IV and confounder representations compete for the information with their constraints in an adversarial game, which allows us to get valid IV representations for IV-based counterfactual prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates valid IV representations for accurate IV-based counterfactual prediction."}}

This allows researchers to better understand the underlying mechanisms at work in complex systems and make more informed decisions. In many settings, we may not fully observe all the confounders that affect both the treatment and outcome variables, complicating the estimation of causal effects. To address this problem, a growing literature in both causal inference and machine learning proposes to use Instrumental Variables (IV). This paper serves as the first effort to systematically and comprehensively introduce and discuss the IV methods and their applications in both causal inference and machine learning. First, we provide the formal definition of IVs and discuss the identification problem of IV regression methods under different assumptions. Second, we categorize the existing work on IV methods into three streams according to the focus on the proposed methods, including two-stage least squares with IVs, control function with IVs, and evaluation of IVs. For each stream, we present both the classical causal inference methods, and recent developments in the machine learning literature. Then, we introduce a variety of applications of IV methods in real-world scenarios and provide a summary of the available datasets and algorithms. Finally, we summarize the literature, discuss the open problems and suggest promising future research directions for IV methods and their applications. We also develop a toolkit of IVs methods reviewed in this survey at https://github.com/causal-machine-learning-lab/mliv."}}

Due to possibly omitted source labels and unmeasured confounders, traditional methods cannot estimate individual treatment assignment probability and infer treatment effect effectively. Therefore, we propose to reconstruct the source label and model it as a Group Instrumental Variable (GIV) to implement IV-based Regression for treatment effect estimation. In this paper, we conceptualize this line of thought and develop a unified framework (Meta-EM) to (1) map the raw data into a representation space to construct Linear Mixed Models for the assigned treatment variable; (2) estimate the distribution differences and model the GIV for the different treatment assignment mechanisms; and (3) adopt an alternating training strategy to iteratively optimize the representations and the joint distribution to model GIV for IV regression. Empirical results demonstrate the advantages of our Meta-EM compared with state-of-the-art methods."}}

A popular way to address this challenge is to utilize an instrumental variable (IV) for two-stage regression, i.e., 2SLS and variants, but they need to assume the additive separability of noise and are limited to the linear setting. Recently, many nonlinear IV regression variants were proposed by regressing the treatment with IVs and confounders in the first stage, leading to confounding bias between the predicted treatment and outcome in the second stage. In this paper, we propose a Confounder Balanced IV Regression (CB-IV) algorithm to jointly remove the bias from the unmeasured confounders with IV regression and reduce the bias from the observed confounders by balancing for treatment effect estimation. Specifically, CB-IV algorithm consists of three main modules: (1) treatment regression: regressing the treatment with IVs and confounders like previous nonlinear IV methods for removing the confounding from unmeasured confounders; (2) confounder balancing: learning a balanced representation of confounders to eliminate the bias induced by the observed confounders  (3) outcome regression: regressing the outcome with the predicted treatment and the balanced confounders representation for treatment effect estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to combine confounder balancing in IV regression for treatment effect estimation. Moreover, we theoretically prove that CB-IV algorithm is also effective even without the additive separability assumption on noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CB-IV algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including IV regression and confounder balancing methods, for treatment effect estimation."}}
