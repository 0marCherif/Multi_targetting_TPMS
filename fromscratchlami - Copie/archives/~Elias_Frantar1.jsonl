This is achieved via a new pruning method called SparseGPT, specifically designed to work efficiently and accurately on massive GPT-family models. We can execute SparseGPT on the largest available open-source models, OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B, in under 4.5 hours, and can reach 60% unstructured sparsity with negligible increase in perplexity: remarkably, more than 100 billion weights from these models can be ignored at inference time. SparseGPT generalizes to semi-structured (2:4 and 4:8) patterns, and is compatible with weight quantization approaches. The code is available at: https://github.com/IST-DASLab/sparsegpt."}}

In practical settings, such as camera traps, users have limited resources, and may fine-tune a pretrained model on (often limited) data from a small set of specific categories of interest. These users may wish to make use of modern, highly-accurate models, but are often computationally constrained. To address this, we ask: can we quickly compress large generalist models into accurate and efficient specialists? For this, we propose a simple and versatile technique called Few-Shot Task-Aware Compression (TACO). Given a large vision model that is pretrained to be accurate on a broad task, such as classification over ImageNet-22K, TACO produces a smaller model that is accurate on specialized tasks, such as classification across vehicle types or animal species. Crucially, TACO works in few-shot fashion, i.e. only a few task-specific samples are used, and the procedure has low computational overheads. We validate TACO on highly-accurate ResNet, ViT/DeiT, and ConvNeXt models, originally trained on ImageNet, LAION, or iNaturalist, which we specialize and compress to a diverse set of \"downstream\" subtasks. TACO can reduce the number of non-zero parameters in existing models by up to 20x relative to the original models, leading to inference speedups of up to 3$\\times$, while remaining accuracy-competitive with the uncompressed models on the specialized tasks."}}

Specifically, due to their massive size, even inference for large, highly-accurate GPT models may require multiple performant GPUs, which limits the usability of such models. While there is emerging work on relieving this pressure via model compression, the applicability and performance of existing compression techniques is limited by the scale and complexity of GPT models. In this paper, we address this challenge, and propose OPTQ, a new one-shot weight quantization method based on approximate second-order information, that is both highly-accurate and highly-efficient. Specifically, OPTQ can quantize GPT models with 175 billion parameters in approximately four GPU hours, reducing the bitwidth down to 3 or 4 bits per weight, with negligible accuracy degradation relative to the uncompressed baseline. Our method more than doubles the compression gains relative to previously-proposed one-shot quantization methods, preserving accuracy, allowing us for the first time to execute an 175 billion-parameter model inside a single GPU for generative inference. Moreover, we also show that our method can still provide reasonable accuracy in the extreme quantization regime, in which weights are quantized to 2-bit or even ternary quantization levels.\nWe show experimentally that these improvements can be leveraged for end-to-end inference speedups over FP16, of around 3.25x when using high-end GPUs (NVIDIA A100) and 4.5x when using more cost-effective ones (NVIDIA A6000). The implementation is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/gptq."}}

Yet, they still face barriers to deployment, notably the fact that their accuracy can be severely impacted by compression techniques such as pruning. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this issue by introducing \\textit{Optimal ViT Surgeon (oViT)}, a new state-of-the-art method for the weight sparsification of Vision Transformers (ViT) models. At the technical level, oViT introduces a new weight pruning algorithm which leverages second-order information, specifically adapted to be both highly-accurate and efficient in the context of ViTs. We complement this accurate one-shot pruner with an in-depth investigation of gradual pruning, augmentation, and recovery schedules for ViTs, which we show to be critical for successful ViT compression. We validate our method via extensive experiments on classical ViT and DeiT models, as well as on newer variants, such as XCiT, EfficientFormer and Swin. Moreover, our results are even relevant to recently-proposed highly-accurate ResNets. Our results show for the first time that ViT-family models can in fact be pruned to high sparsity levels (e.g. $\\geq 75\\%$) with low impact on accuracy ($\\leq 1\\%$ relative drop), and that our approach outperforms prior methods by significant margins at high sparsities. In addition, we show that our method is compatible with structured pruning methods and quantization, and that it can lead to significant speedups on a sparsity-aware inference engine. \n"}}

To address this issue, entire families of compression mechanisms have been developed, including quantization, sparsification, and low-rank approximation, some of which are seeing significant practical adoption. Despite this progress, almost all known compression schemes apply compression uniformly across DNN layers, although layers are heterogeneous in terms of parameter count and their impact on model accuracy. In this work, we provide a general framework for adapting the degree of compression across the model's layers dynamically during training, improving the overall compression, while leading to substantial speedups, without sacrificing accuracy. Our framework, called L-GreCo, is based on an adaptive algorithm, which automatically picks the optimal compression parameters for model layers guaranteeing the best compression ratio while satisfying an error constraint. Extensive experiments over image classification and language modeling tasks shows that L-GreCo is effective across all existing families of compression methods, and achieves up to 2.5$\\times$ training speedup and up to 5$\\times$ compression improvement over efficient implementations of existing approaches, while recovering full accuracy. Moreover, L-GreCo is complementary to existing adaptive algorithms, improving their compression ratio by 50% and practical throughput by 66%."}}
