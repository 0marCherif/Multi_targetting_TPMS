However, studying the RL-based approaches from the adversary's perspective has received little attention. Additionally, RL-based approaches in an anti-adversary or adversarial paradigm mostly consider single-channel communication (either channel selection or single channel power control), while multi-channel communication is more common in practice. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent adversary system (MAAS) for modeling and analyzing adversaries in a wireless communication scenario by careful design of the reward function under realistic communication scenarios. In particular, by modeling the adversaries as learning agents, we show that the proposed MAAS is able to successfully choose the transmitted channel(s) and their respective allocated power(s) without any prior knowledge of the sender strategy. Compared to the single-agent adversary (SAA), multi-agents in MAAS can achieve significant reduction in signal-to-noise ratio (SINR) under the same power constraints and partial observability, while providing improved stability and a more efficient learning process. Moreover, through empirical studies we show that the results in simulation are close to the ones in communication in reality, a conclusion that is pivotal to the validity of performance of agents evaluated in simulations."}}

In many cases, only the magnitude of these functions are observed on various points on the purely imaginary $j\\omega$-axis since coherent measurement of their phases is often expensive. However, it is desirable to retrieve the lost phases from the magnitudes when possible. To this end, we propose a physics-infused deep neural network based on the Blaschke products for phase retrieval. Inspired by the Helson and Sarason Theorem, we recover coefficients of a rational function of Blaschke products using a Blaschke Product Neural Network (BPNN), based upon the magnitude observations as input. The resulting rational function is then used for phase retrieval. We compare the BPNN to conventional deep neural networks (NNs) on several phase retrieval problems, comprising both synthetic and contemporary real-world problems (e.g., metamaterials for which data collection requires substantial expertise and is time consuming). On each phase retrieval problem, we compare against a population of conventional NNs of varying size and hyperparameter settings. Even without any hyper-parameter search, we find that BPNNs consistently outperform the population of optimized NNs in scarce data scenarios, and do so despite being much smaller models. The results can in turn be applied to calculate the refractive index of metamaterials, which is an important problem in emerging areas of material science."}}

This distance represents the complexity of transferring the knowledge from one task to another. We provide a proof of consistency for our distance through theorems and experiments on various classification tasks from MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and Taskonomy datasets. Next, we construct an online neural architecture search framework using the Fisher task distance, in which we have access to the past learned tasks. By using the Fisher task distance, we can identify the closest learned tasks to the target task, and utilize the knowledge learned from these related tasks for the target task. Here, we show how the proposed distance between a target task and a set of learned tasks can be used to reduce the neural architecture search space for the target task. The complexity reduction in search space for task-specific architectures is achieved by building on the optimized architectures for similar tasks instead of doing a full search and without using this side information. Experimental results for tasks in MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach and its improvements, in terms of the performance and the number of parameters, over other gradient-based search methods, such as ENAS, DARTS, PC-DARTS."}}

We generate a rich example dataset of received radar signals by randomly placing targets of variable strengths in a predetermined region using RFView, a site-specific radio frequency modeling and simulation tool developed by ISL Inc. For each data sample within this region, we generate heatmap tensors in range, azimuth, and elevation of the output power of a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer, which can be replaced with a desired test statistic. These heatmap tensors can be thought of as stacked images, and in an airborne scenario, the moving radar creates a sequence of these time-indexed image stacks, resembling a video. Our goal is to use these images and videos to detect targets and estimate their locations, a procedure reminiscent of computer vision algorithms for object detection$-$namely, the Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN). The Faster R-CNN consists of a proposal generating network for determining regions of interest (ROI), a regression network for positioning anchor boxes around targets, and an object classification algorithm; it is developed and optimized for natural images. Our ongoing research will develop analogous tools for heatmap images of radar data. In this regard, we will generate a large, representative adaptive radar signal processing database for training and testing, analogous in spirit to the COCO dataset for natural images. As a preliminary example, we present a regression network in this paper for estimating target locations to demonstrate the feasibility of and significant improvements provided by our data-driven approach."}}
