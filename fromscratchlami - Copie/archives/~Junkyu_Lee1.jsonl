Unlike the majority of approaches in causal reinforcement learning that focus on model-based approaches and off-policy evaluations, we explore another direction: online model-free methods. We achieve this by extending a causal sequential decision-making formulation with factored Markov decision process (FMDP) and MDP with unobserved confounders (MDPUC), and by incorporating the concept of action as intervention. The choice of extending MDPUC addresses the issue of bidirectional arcs in learned causal diagrams. The action as intervention idea allows for the incorporation of high-level action models into the action space in an RL environment as a vector of interventions to the causal variables. We also present a value decomposition method and utilize the value decomposition network architecture popular in multi-agent reinforcement learning, showing encouraging preliminary evaluation results."}}

We characterize a valid label reduction for classical planning tasks and propose an automated way of obtaining such valid reductions by leveraging lifted mutex groups. Our experiments show a significant reduction in the action label space size across a wide collection of planning domains.  We demonstrate the benefit of our automated label reduction in two separate use cases: improved sample complexity of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms and speeding up successor generation in lifted planning.

The supply, however, is somewhat limited. Past International Planning Competitions (IPCs) have introduced the de-facto standard benchmarks with the domains written by domain experts. The few existing methods for sampling random planning tasks severely limit the resulting problem structure. In this work we show a method for generating planning tasks of any requested causal graph structure, alleviating the shortage in existing planning benchmarks. We present an algorithm for constructing random SAS+ planning tasks given an arbitrary causal graph and offer random task generators for the well-explored causal graph structures in the planning literature. We further allow to generate a planning task equivalent in causal structure to an input SAS+ planning task. We generate two benchmark sets: 26 collections for select well-explored causal graph structures and 42 collections for existing IPC domains. We evaluate both benchmark sets with the state-of-the-art optimal planners, showing the adequacy for adopting them as benchmarks in cost-optimal classical planning. The benchmark sets and the task generator code are publicly available at https://github.com/IBM/fdr-generator."}}
