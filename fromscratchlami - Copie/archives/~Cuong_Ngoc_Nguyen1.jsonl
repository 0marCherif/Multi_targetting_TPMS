We focus on regression tasks, which received little previous attention, and propose two simple and computationally efficient approaches that estimate transferability based on the negative regularized mean squared error of a linear regression model. We prove novel theoretical results connecting our approaches to the actual transferability of the optimal target models obtained from the transfer learning process. Despite their simplicity, our approaches significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art regression transferability estimators in both accuracy and efficiency. On two large-scale keypoint regression benchmarks, our approaches yield 12% to 36% better results on average while being at least 27% faster than previous state-of-the-art methods."}}

To improve the effectiveness of transfer learning and to understand relationships between tasks, we consider the problem of transferability estimation between regression tasks and propose two novel transferability estimators that are simple, computationally efficient, yet effective and theoretically grounded. We test our proposed methods extensively in various challenging, practical scenarios and show they significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art regression task transferability estimators in both accuracy and efficiency."}}

We focus on regression tasks, which received little previous attention, and develop novel transferability estimation methods that are simple, computationally efficient, yet effective and theoretically grounded. We propose two families of transferability estimators, both of which utilize the mean squared error of a regularized linear regression model to estimate the transferability. We prove novel theoretical bounds connecting our methods with the expected risk of the optimal target models obtained from the actual transfer learning process. We test our methods extensively in various challenging, practical scenarios and show they significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art regression task transferability estimators, in both accuracy and efficiency."}}
