Using H\\\"older's inequality, we derive a set of bounds on the confounding bias |E[Y|T=t]-E[Y|do(T=t)]| based on the degree of unmeasured confounding (i.e., the strength of the connection U->T, and the strength of U->Y). These bounds are tight either when U is independent of T or when U is independent of Y given T (when there is no unobserved confounding). We focus on a special case of this bound depending on the total variation distance between the distributions p(U) and p(U|T=t), as well as the maximum (over all possible values of U) deviation of the conditional expected outcome E[Y|U=u,T=t] from the average expected outcome E[Y|T=t]. We discuss possible calibration strategies for this bound to get interval estimates for treatment effects, and experimentally validate the bound using synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets."}}

Specifically, we theoretically link balance to the quality of propensity estimation, emphasize the importance of identifying a proper target population, and elaborate on the complementary roles of feature balancing and weight adjustments. Using these concepts, we then develop an algorithm for flexible, scalable and accurate estimation of causal effects. Finally, we show how the learned weighted representations may serve to facilitate alternative causal learning procedures with appealing statistical features. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on both synthetic examples and standard benchmarks, and report encouraging results relative to state-of-the-art baselines."}}

Abstract We consider machine-learning-based thyroid-malignancy prediction from cytopathology whole-slide images (WSI). Multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches, typically used for the analysis of WSIs, divide the image (bag) into patches (instances), which are used to predict a single bag-level label. These approaches perform poorly in cytopathology slides due to a unique bag structure: sparsely located informative instances with varying characteristics of abnormality. We address these challenges by considering multiple types of labels: bag-level malignancy and ordered diagnostic scores, as well as instance-level informativeness and abnormality labels. We study their contribution beyond the MIL setting by proposing a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework, from which we derive a two-stage deep-learning-based algorithm. The algorithm identifies informative instances and assigns them local malignancy scores that are incorporated into a global malignancy prediction. We derive a lower bound of the MLE, leading to an improved training strategy based on weak supervision, that we motivate through statistical analysis. The lower bound further allows us to extend the proposed algorithm to simultaneously predict multiple bag and instance-level labels from a single output of a neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides competitive performance compared to several competing methods, achieves (expert) human-level performance, and allows augmentation of human decisions."}}

The examples we consider are pathology slides represented by sets of patches and medical text data represented by sets of word embeddings. State-of-the-art methods, such as the transformer network, typically use attention mechanisms to learn representations of set data, by modeling interactions between instances of the set. These methods, however, have complex heuristic architectures comprising multiple heads and layers. The complexity of attention architectures hampers their training when only a small number of labeled sets is available, as is often the case in medical applications. To address this problem, we present a kernel-based representation learning framework that links learning affinity kernels to learning representations from attention architectures. We show that learning a combination of the sum and the product of kernels is equivalent to learning representations from multi-head multi-layer attention architectures. From our framework, we devise a simplified attention architecture which we term affinitention (affinity-attention) nets. We demonstrate the application of affinitention nets to the classification of the Set-Cifar10 dataset, thyroid malignancy prediction from pathology slides, as well as patient text-message triage. We show that affinitention nets provide competitive results compared to heuristic attention architectures and outperform other competing methods."}}

To de-bias causal estimators with high-dimensional data in observational studies, recent advances suggest the importance of combining machine learning models for both the propensity score and the outcome function. We propose a novel scalable method to learn double-robust representations for counterfactual predictions, leading to consistent causal estimation if the model for either the propensity score or the outcome, but not necessarily both, is correctly specified. Specifically, we use the entropy balancing method to learn the weights that minimize the Jensen-Shannon divergence of the representation between the treated and control groups, based on which we make robust and efficient counterfactual predictions for both individual and average treatment effects. We provide theoretical justifications for the proposed method. The algorithm shows competitive performance with the state-of-the-art on real world and synthetic data."}}
