It differs from standard Masked Autoencoding in two key aspects: I) it can optionally accept additional modalities of information in the input besides the RGB image (hence \"multi-modal\"), and II) its training objective accordingly includes predicting multiple outputs besides the RGB image (hence \"multi-task\"). We make use of masking (across image patches and input modalities) to make training MultiMAE tractable as well as to ensure cross-modality predictive coding is indeed learned by the network. We show this pre-training strategy leads to a flexible, simple, and efficient framework with improved transfer results to downstream tasks. In particular, the same exact pre-trained network can be flexibly used when additional information besides RGB images is available or when no information other than RGB is available - in all configurations yielding competitive to or significantly better results than the baselines. To avoid needing training datasets with multiple modalities and tasks, we train MultiMAE entirely using pseudo labeling, which makes the framework widely applicable to any RGB dataset. The experiments are performed on multiple transfer tasks (image classification, semantic segmentation, depth estimation) and datasets (ImageNet, ADE20K, Taskonomy, Hypersim, NYUv2). The results show an intriguingly impressive capability by the model in cross-modal/task predictive coding and transfer."}}

While a number of large-scale empirical studies on the transfer performance of such models have been conducted, there is not yet an agreed-upon set of control baselines, evaluation practices, and metrics to report, which often hinders a nuanced and calibrated understanding of the real efficacy of the methods. We share an evaluation standard that aims to quantify and communicate transfer learning performance in an informative and accessible setup. This is done by baking a number of simple yet critical control baselines in the evaluation method, particularly the blind-guess (quantifying the dataset bias), scratch-model (quantifying the architectural contribution), and maximal-supervision (quantifying the upper-bound). To demonstrate how the evaluation standard can be employed, we provide an example empirical study investigating a few basic questions about self-supervised learning. For example, using this standard, the study shows the effectiveness of existing self-supervised pre-training methods is skewed towards image classification tasks versus dense pixel-wise predictions. In general, we encourage using/reporting the suggested control baselines in evaluating transfer learning in order to gain a more meaningful and informative understanding."}}

At the same time, many machine learning systems, such as search, matching, and recommendation systems, heavily rely on embeddings. Unfortunately, due to misalignment of features of independently trained models, embeddings, cannot be improved with a naive deep ensemble like approach. In this work, we look at the ensembling of representations and propose mean embeddings with test-time augmentation (MeTTA) simple yet well-performing recipe for ensembling representations. Empirically we demonstrate that MeTTA significantly boosts the quality of linear evaluation on ImageNet for both supervised and self-supervised models. Even more exciting, we draw connections between MeTTA, image retrieval, and transformation invariant models. We believe that spreading the success of ensembles to inference higher-quality representations is the important step that will open many new applications of ensembling."}}
