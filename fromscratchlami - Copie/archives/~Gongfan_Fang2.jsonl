Currently, most of these approaches are tailored for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, there is a tendency that Transformers, with a completely different architecture, are starting to challenge the domination of CNNs in many computer vision tasks. Nevertheless, directly applying the previous KA methods to Transformers leads to severe performance degradation. In this work, we explore a more effective KA scheme for Transformer-based object detection models. Specifically, considering the architecture characteristics of Transformers, we propose to dissolve the KA into two aspects: sequence-level amalgamation (SA) and task-level amalgamation (TA). In particular, a hint is generated within the sequence-level amalgamation by concatenating teacher sequences instead of redundantly aggregating them to a fixed-size one as previous KA approaches. Besides, the student learns heterogeneous detection tasks through soft targets with efficiency in the task-level amalgamation. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and COCO have unfolded that the sequence-level amalgamation significantly boosts the performance of students, while the previous methods impair the students. Moreover, the Transformer-based students excel in learning amalgamated knowledge, as they have mastered heterogeneous detection tasks rapidly and achieved superior or at least comparable performance to those of the teachers in their specializations."}}

However, such impressive capability typically comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in both the deployment, inference, and training stages. With LLM being a general-purpose task solver, we explore its compression in a task-agnostic manner, which aims to preserve the multi-task solving and language generation ability of the original LLM. One challenge to achieving this is the enormous size of the training corpus of LLM, which makes both data transfer and model post-training over-burdensome. Thus, we tackle the compression of LLMs within the bound of two constraints: being task-agnostic and minimizing the reliance on the original training dataset. Our method, named LLM-Pruner, adopts structural pruning that selectively removes non-critical coupled structures based on gradient information, maximally preserving the majority of the LLM's functionality. To this end, the performance of pruned models can be efficiently recovered through tuning techniques, LoRA, in merely 3 hours, requiring only 50K data. We validate the LLM-Pruner on three LLMs, including LLaMA, Vicuna, and ChatGLM, and demonstrate that the compressed models still exhibit satisfactory capabilities in zero-shot classification and generation.

However, the parameter-grouping patterns vary widely across different models, making architecture-specific pruners, which rely on manually-designed grouping schemes, non-generalizable to new architectures. In this work, we study a highly-challenging yet barely-explored task, any structural pruning, to tackle general structural pruning of arbitrary architecture like CNNs, RNNs, GNNs and Transformers. The most prominent obstacle towards this goal lies in the structural coupling, which not only forces different layers to be pruned simultaneously, but also expects all removed parameters to be consistently unimportant, thereby avoiding structural issues and significant performance degradation after pruning. To address this problem, we propose a general and {fully automatic} method, \\emph{Dependency Graph} (DepGraph), to explicitly model the dependency between layers and comprehensively group coupled parameters for pruning. In this work, we extensively evaluate our method on several architectures and tasks, including ResNe(X)t, DenseNet, MobileNet and Vision transformer for images, GAT for graph, DGCNN for 3D point cloud, alongside LSTM for language, and demonstrate that, even with a simple norm-based criterion, the proposed method consistently yields gratifying performances."}}

The impressive capability of these models, however, often entails significant computational overhead during both training and inference. To tackle this challenge, we present Diff-Pruning, an efficient compression method tailored for learning lightweight diffusion models from pre-existing ones, without the need for extensive re-training. The essence of Diff-Pruning is encapsulated in a Taylor expansion over pruned timesteps, a process that disregards non-contributory diffusion steps and ensembles informative gradients to identify important weights. Our empirical assessment, undertaken across four diverse datasets highlights two primary benefits of our proposed method: 1) Efficiency: it enables approximately a 50% reduction in FLOPs at a mere 10% to 20% of the original training expenditure; 2) Consistency: the pruned diffusion models inherently preserve generative behavior congruent with their pre-trained progenitors.

Despite the encouraging results achieved, state-of-the-art DFKD methods still suffer from the inefficiency of data synthesis, making the data-free training process extremely time-consuming and thus inapplicable for large-scale tasks. In this work, we introduce an efficacious scheme, termed as FastDFKD, that allows us to accelerate DFKD by a factor of orders of magnitude. At the heart of our approach is a novel strategy to reuse the shared common features in training data so as to synthesize different data instances. Unlike prior methods that optimize a set of data independently, we propose to learn a meta-synthesizer that seeks common features as the initialization for the fast data synthesis. As a result, FastDFKD achieves data synthesis within only a few steps, significantly enhancing the efficiency of data-free training. Experiments over CIFAR, NYUv2, and ImageNet demonstrate that the proposed FastDFKD achieves 10x and even 100x acceleration while preserving performances on par with state of the art.

At the heart of DFKD is to reconstruct a synthetic dataset by inverting the parameters of the uncompressed model. Prior DFKD approaches, however, have largely relied on hand-crafted priors of the target data distribution for the reconstruction, which can be inevitably biased and often incompetent to capture the intrinsic distributions. To address this problem, we propose a prompt-based method, termed as PromptDFD, that allows us to take advantage of learned language priors, which effectively harmonizes the synthetic sentences to be semantically and grammatically correct. Specifically, PromptDFD leverages a pre-trained generative model to provide language priors and introduces a reinforced topic prompter to control data synthesis, making the generated samples thematically relevant and semantically plausible, and thus friendly to downstream tasks. As shown in our experiments, the proposed method substantially improves the synthesis quality and achieves considerable improvements on distillation performance. In some cases, PromptDFD even gives rise to results on par with those from the data-driven knowledge distillation with access to the original training data."}}

However, existing inversion methods usually suffer from the mode collapse problem, where the synthesized instances are highly similar to each other and thus show limited effectiveness for downstream tasks, such as knowledge distillation. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Model Inversion (CMI), where the data diversity is explicitly modeled as an optimizable objective, to alleviate the mode collapse issue. Our main observation is that, under the constraint of the same amount of data, higher data diversity usually indicates stronger instance discrimination. To this end, we introduce in CMI a contrastive learning objective that encourages the synthesizing instances to be distinguishable from the already synthesized ones in previous batches. Experiments of pre-trained models on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CMI not only generates more visually plausible instances than the state of the arts, but also achieves significantly superior performance when the generated data are used for knowledge distillation.
