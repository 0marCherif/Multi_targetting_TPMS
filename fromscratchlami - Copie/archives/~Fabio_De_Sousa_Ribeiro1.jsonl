The power and flexibility of deep generative models make them valuable tools for learning mechanisms in structural causal models. However, their flexibility makes counterfactual identifiability impossible in the general case.\nMotivated by these issues, we revisit Pearl's axiomatic definition of counterfactuals to determine the necessary constraints of any counterfactual inference model: composition, reversibility, and effectiveness. We frame counterfactuals as functions of an input variable, its parents, and counterfactual parents and use the axiomatic constraints to restrict the set of functions that could represent the counterfactual, thus deriving distance metrics between the approximate and ideal functions. We demonstrate how these metrics can be used to compare and choose between different approximate counterfactual inference models and to provide insight into a model's shortcomings and trade-offs."}}

Detected failure cases can be referred to human assessment, ensuring patient safety in computer-aided clinical decision making. Despite its paramount importance, there is insufficient evidence about the ability of state-of-the-art confidence scoring methods to detect test-time failures of classification models in the context of medical imaging. This paper provides a reality check, establishing the performance of in-domain misclassification detection methods, benchmarking 9 confidence scores on 6 medical imaging datasets with different imaging modalities, in multiclass and binary classification settings. Our experiments show that the problem of failure detection is far from being solved. We found that none of the benchmarked advanced methods proposed in the computer vision and machine learning literature can consistently outperform a simple softmax baseline. Our developed testbed facilitates future work in this important area."}}

In capsule networks, scalar neurons are replaced with capsule vectors or matrices, whose entries represent different properties of objects. The relationships between objects and their parts are learned via trainable viewpoint-invariant transformation matrices, and the presence of a given object is decided by the level of agreement among votes from its parts. This interaction occurs between capsule layers and is a process called routing-by-agreement. In this paper, we propose a new capsule routing algorithm derived from Variational Bayes for fitting a mixture of transforming gaussians, and show it is possible transform our capsule network into a Capsule-VAE. Our Bayesian approach addresses some of the inherent weaknesses of MLE based models such as the variance-collapse by modelling uncertainty over capsule pose parameters. We outperform the state-of-the-art on smallNORB using \u224350% fewer capsules than previously reported, achieve competitive performances on CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, and demonstrate significant improvement in MNIST to affNIST generalisation over previous works.1"}}

In our formulation, the local routing iterations are replaced with variational inference of part-object connections in a probabilistic capsule network, leading to a significant speedup without sacrificing performance. In this way, global context is also considered when routing capsules by introducing global latent variables that have direct influence on the objective function, and are updated discriminatively in accordance with the minimum description length (MDL) principle. We focus on enhancing capsule network properties, and perform a thorough evaluation on pose-aware tasks, observing improvements in performance over previous approaches whilst being more computationally efficient."}}
{"id": "F5Gd73ilUAq", "cdate": 1577836800000, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Deep Bayesian Self-Training", "abstract": "Supervised deep learning has been highly successful in recent years, achieving state-of-the-art results in most tasks. However, with the ongoing uptake of such methods in industrial applications, the requirement for large amounts of annotated data is often a challenge. In most real-world problems, manual annotation is practically intractable due to time/labour constraints; thus, the development of automated and adaptive data annotation systems is highly sought after. In this paper, we propose both a (1) deep Bayesian self-training methodology for automatic data annotation, by leveraging predictive uncertainty estimates using variational inference and modern neural network (NN) architectures, as well as (2) a practical adaptation procedure for handling high label variability between different dataset distributions through clustering of NN latent variable representations. An experimental study on both public and private datasets is presented illustrating the superior performance of the proposed approach over standard self-training baselines, highlighting the importance of predictive uncertainty estimates in safety-critical domains."}}
