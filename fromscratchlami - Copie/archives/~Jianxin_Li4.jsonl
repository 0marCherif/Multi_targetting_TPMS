Most of the previous studies on multiview learning have been dedicated to increasing the prediction accuracy, while ignoring the reliability of the decision. This would limit their deployment in high-risk IoT and industrial applications such as the automated vehicle. Although a trusted multiview classification model has been proposed recently, it cannot well deal with the highly complementary multiview data. In this work, we present an evidential multiview deep learning (EMDL) method to make reliable decisions. EMDL first seeks view-specific evidence of each category, which could be termed as the amount of support to each category collected from data. It then dynamically fuses different views at the evidence level to construct the multiview common evidence and makes reliable prediction accordingly (strong evidence indicates high prediction confidence). In particular, we establish a degradation layer to learn the mappings from the common evidence (comprehensive information) to view-specific evidences (partial information) for evidence fusion. It aims to explicitly model consistent and complementary relations in multiview data at the evidence level. We apply EMDL on a synthetic toy dataset and five real-world datasets (three datasets are related to industrial scenarios). Experiments show that EMDL outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods."}}

Federated learning facilitates collaborative training of global models among distributed edge nodes without sharing their training data. Unfortunately, existing privacy-preserving federated learning applied to this scenario still faces three challenges: 1) It typically employs complex cryptographic algorithms, which results in excessive training overhead; 2) It cannot guarantee Byzantine robustness while preserving data privacy; and 3) Edge nodes have limited computing power and may drop out frequently. As a result, the privacy-preserving federated learning cannot be effectively applied to edge computing scenarios. Therefore, we propose a lightweight and secure federated learning scheme LSFL, which combines the features of privacy-preserving and Byzantine-Robustness. Specifically, we design the Lightweight Two-Server Secure Aggregation protocol, which utilizes two servers to enable secure Byzantine robustness and model aggregation. This scheme protects data privacy and prevents Byzantine nodes from influencing model aggregation. We implement and evaluate LSFL in a LAN environment, and the experiment results show that LSFL meets fidelity, security, and efficiency design goals, and maintains model accuracy compared to the popular FedAvg scheme."}}

It enables broad applications, such as optimizing resource allocations for promising research areas, predicting future technology trends, finding knowledge gaps and new concepts, and recommending personalized research directions. However, two challenges - the rareness of emerging-topic publications and the linguistic diversity in the description of emerging topics - hinder existing text analytic methods from effectively identifying the evolving terms in emerging topics. According to our observation, an emerging topic originating from a collaboration of two sub-fields could be represented by a biterm, each term from one sub-field. In this paper, we propose a novel finding Infrequent Synonymous Biterms to discover Emerging Scientific Topics (isBEST) method to overcome the challenges. Our isBEST method reduces linguistic diversity using document-level clustering to find the linguistic variants of each key biterm. The biterms in the same cluster expressing very similar meanings are unified to the most common synonymous biterm. Then, to address the rareness issue, isBEST converts each input document into a vector of coefficients on synonymous biterms and clusters them at the corpus level with cosine similarity. In each document, larger coefficients are assigned to rarer synonymous biterms. The underlying logic is the higher chance of a rarer synonymous biterm to be an emerging topic denoted by the two terms, each from a collaborating sub-field. Experiments on two large scholarly paper datasets demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our isBEST method."}}

Therefore, many researchers take the node attributes into consideration in the network representation learning to improve the downstream task performance. In this article, we mainly focus on an untouched \u201coversmoothing\u201d problem in the research of the attributed network representation learning. Although the Laplacian smoothing has been applied by the state-of-the-art works to learn a more robust node representation, these works cannot adapt to the topological characteristics of different networks, thereby causing the new oversmoothing problem and reducing the performance on some networks. In contrast, we adopt a smoothing parameter that is evaluated from the topological characteristics of a specified network, such as small worldness or node convergency and, thus, can smooth the nodes\u2019 attribute and structure information adaptively and derive both robust and distinguishable node features for different networks. Moreover, we develop an integrated autoencoder to learn the node representation by reconstructing the combination of the smoothed structure and attribute information. By observation of extensive experiments, our approach can preserve the intrinsical information of networks more effectively than the state-of-the-art works on a number of benchmark datasets with very different topological characteristics."}}

Traditionally, insider threat is detected by analyzing logged user behaviours and then establishing a binary classifier to distinguish malicious ones. However, most approaches consider user behaviour in an isolated manner, inevitably missing the background information from organizational connections such as a shared supervisor or e-mail interactions. Consequently, the performance of those existing works still has the potential to be enhanced. In this paper, we propose a bi-channel insider threat detection (B-CITD) framework enhanced by graph intelligence to improve the overall performance of existing methods. Firstly, We extract behavioural features from a series of log files as the inner-user channel features. Secondly, we construct an organizational connection graph and extract topological features through a graph neural networks (GNN) model as the inter-user channel features. In the end, the features from inner-user and inter-user channels are combined together to perform an insider threat detection task through a binary classification model. Experimental results on an open-sourced CERT 4.2 dataset show that B-CITD can enhance the performance of insider threat detection by a large margin, compared with using features only from inner-user or inter-user channels.

During the implementation of smart cities, electricity supply plays a profound role and needs to be guaranteed. To do this, a health model with terminal sensors data is usually adopted to enable the security of the transmission line. However, due to the extreme weather condition and the interference of sensors, some transmitted values are missing, which renders the sensors unreliable. Unfortunately, the existing prediction methods have a lower accuracy and there still exists a gap between the real value and the predicted value. In this article, we propose a novel data fusion model, named as KNN-XGBoost, to predict the missing values. Specifically, in this model, it mainly consists of two parts: 1) KNN stage: a KNN model is used to find <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${K}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> nearest labels as new attributes and 2) XGBoost: an XGBoost model is applied to predict missing attribute values. The experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed model can improve the accuracy from 1.11% to 4.05%, 0.55% to 1.84%, and 1.10% to 4.04% than the other methods under the three grid health models, respectively."}}

More recently, the emergence of the Delta variant of COVID-19 has once again put the world at risk. Fortunately, many countries and companies have developed vaccines for the coronavirus. As of 23 August 2021, more than 20 vaccines have been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), bringing light to people besieged by the pandemic. The global rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine has sparked much discussion on social media platforms, such as the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. However, there has not been much systematic analysis of public opinion on the COVID-19 vaccine. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the discussions related to the COVID-19 vaccine on Twitter. We analyze the hot topics discussed by people and the corresponding emotional polarity from the perspective of countries and vaccine brands. The results show that most people trust the effectiveness of vaccines and are willing to get vaccinated. In contrast, negative tweets tended to be associated with news reports of post-vaccination deaths, vaccine shortages, and post-injection side effects. Overall, this study uses popular Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to mine people\u2019s opinions on the COVID-19 vaccine on social media and objectively analyze and visualize them. Our findings can improve the readability of the confusing information on social media platforms and provide effective data support for the government and policy makers."}}

However, these studies only utilize the aggregation of disjoint structural information to measure the quality and ignore the reliability of the communities in a continuous time interval. To fill this research gap, we propose a novel $(\\theta,k)$-$core$ reliable community (CRC) model in the weighted dynamic networks, and define the problem of \\textit{most reliable community search} that couples the desirable properties of connection strength, cohesive structure continuity, and the maximal member engagement. To solve this problem, we first develop a novel edge filtering based online CRC search algorithm that can effectively filter out the trivial edge information from the networks while searching for a \\textit{reliable} community. Further, we propose an index structure, Weighted Core Forest-Index (WCF-index), and devise an index-based dynamic programming CRC search algorithm, that can prune a large number of insignificant intermediate results and support efficient query processing. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments systematically to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms on eight real datasets under various experimental settings."}}
