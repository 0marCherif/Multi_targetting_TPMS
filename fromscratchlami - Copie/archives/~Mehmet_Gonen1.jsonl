Standard machine learning algorithms could be used to discriminate early- and late-stage cancers from each other using their genomic characterizations. Even though these algorithms would get satisfactory predictive performance, their knowledge extraction capability would be quite restricted due to highly correlated nature of genomic data. That is why we need algorithms that can also extract relevant information about these biological mechanisms using our prior knowledge about pathways/gene sets."}}

We present a new machine learning algorithm BaTFLED (Bayesian Tensor Factorization Linked to External Data) that predicts values in a three-dimensional response tensor using input features for each of the dimensions. BaTFLED uses a probabilistic Bayesian framework to learn projection matrices mapping input features for each mode into latent representations that multiply to form the response tensor. By utilizing a Tucker decomposition, the model can capture weights for interactions between latent factors for each mode in a small core tensor. Priors that encourage sparsity in the projection matrices and core tensor allow for feature selection and model regularization. This method is shown to far outperform elastic net and neural net models on 'cold start' tasks from data simulated in a three-mode structure. Additionally, we apply the model to predict dose-response curves in a panel of breast cancer cell lines treated with drug compounds that was used as a Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) challenge."}}

(ii) Gene set analysis methods are used to find gene sets on which phenotypes are linearly dependent by bringing prior biological knowledge into the analysis, which may not capture more complex nonlinear dependencies. Thus, formulating an integrated model of gene set analysis and nonlinear predictive modeling is of great practical importance. Results In this study, we propose a Bayesian binary classification framework to integrate gene set analysis and nonlinear predictive modeling. We then generalize this formulation to multitask learning setting to model multiple related datasets conjointly. Our main novelty is the probabilistic nonlinear formulation that enables us to robustly capture nonlinear dependencies between genomic data and phenotype even with small sample sizes. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms using repeated random subsampling validation experiments on two cancer and two tuberculosis datasets by predicting important disease phenotypes from genome-wide gene expression data. Conclusions We are able to obtain comparable or even better predictive performance than a baseline Bayesian nonlinear algorithm and to identify sparse sets of relevant genes and gene sets on all datasets. We also show that our multitask learning formulation enables us to further improve the generalization performance and to better understand biological processes behind disease phenotypes."}}

There are several algorithms to optimize AUC measures instead of minimizing the error rate. However, this idea has not been fully exploited in Bayesian hierarchical models owing to the difficulties in inference. Here, we formulate a general Bayesian inference framework, called Bayesian AUC Maximization (BAM), to integrate AUC maximization into Bayesian hierarchical models by borrowing the pairwise and listwise ranking ideas from the information retrieval literature. To showcase our BAM framework, we develop two Bayesian linear classifier variants for two ranking approaches and derive their variational inference procedures. We perform validation experiments on four biomedical data sets to demonstrate the better predictive performance of our framework over its error-minimizing counterpart in terms of average AUROC and AUPR values."}}

The previous research focused on designing features and developing feature extraction methods. Generally, a multimedia content can be represented with different feature representations (i.e., views). However, the most suitable feature representation related to people\u05f3s emotions is usually not known a priori. We propose here a novel Bayesian multiple kernel learning algorithm for affective classification and retrieval tasks. The proposed method can make use of different representations simultaneously (i.e., multiview learning) to obtain a better prediction performance than using a single feature representation (i.e., single-view learning) or a subset of features, with the advantage of automatic feature selections. In particular, our algorithm has been implemented within a multilabel setup to capture the correlation between emotions, and the Bayesian formulation enables our method to produce probabilistic outputs for measuring a set of emotions triggered by a single image. As a case study, we perform classification and retrieval experiments with our algorithm for predicting people\u05f3s emotional states evoked by images, using generic low-level image features. The empirical results with our approach on the widely-used International Affective Picture System (IAPS) data set outperform several existing methods in terms of classification performance and results interpretability.

In this paper, we formulate a general framework to address the problem of modeling heterogeneous data. Our main contribution is a novel embedding method, called multiple kernel preserving embedding (MKPE), which projects heterogeneous data into a unified embedding space by preserving crossdomain interactions and within-domain similarities simultaneously. These interactions and similarities between data points are approximated with Gaussian kernels to transfer local neighborhood information to the projected subspace. We also extend our method for out-of-sample embedding using a parametric formulation in the projection step. The performance of MKPE is illustrated on two tasks: (i) modeling biological interaction networks and (ii) cross-domain information retrieval. Empirical results of these two tasks validate the predictive performance of our algorithm."}}
