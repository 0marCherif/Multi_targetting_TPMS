Here we report insights from ten weeks of collaborative short-term forecasting of COVID-19 in Germany and Poland (12 October\u201319 December 2020). The study period covers the onset of the second wave in both countries, with tightening non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and subsequently a decay (Poland) or plateau and renewed increase (Germany) in reported cases. Thirteen independent teams provided probabilistic real-time forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths. These were reported for lead times of one to four weeks, with evaluation focused on one- and two-week horizons, which are less affected by changing NPIs. Heterogeneity between forecasts was considerable both in terms of point predictions and forecast spread. Ensemble forecasts showed good relative performance, in particular in terms of coverage, but did not clearly dominate single-model predictions. The study was preregistered and will be followed up in future phases of the pandemic."}}

This method is known to facilitate music perception in cochlear implant (CI) users as spectrally less complex signals are perceived as being more pleasant. In this paper we investigate a method to obtain a reduced-rank approximation for the desired complexity reduction that extends the established projection approximation subspace tracking methods (PAST, CPAST) with an additional sparsity constraint. We evaluate our method with the instrumental SIR and SAR measures as well as an auditory distortion measure (ADR) on a database of 110 classical chamber music pieces. While the resulting signal quality is found to be comparable to existing methods the iterative structure and the reduced computational complexity of our method make it suitable for real-time and low-latency on-line applications."}}

It is assumed that X is a known ill-conditioned n \u00d7 p matrix with n \u2265 p and with large dimension p. In this situation the vector \u03b2 is estimated with the help of spectral regularization of the maximum likelihood estimate, and the noise level estimate is computed with the help of adaptive (i.e., data-driven) normalization of the quadratic prediction error. For this estimate, we compute its concentration rate around the pseudo-estimate ||Y \u2212 X\u03b2||2/n."}}

In this paper we present a novel unsupervised segmentation procedure for music signals which relies on an explained variance criterion in the eigenspace of the constant-Q spectral domain. The procedure is used in the context of a spectral complexity reduction method which mitigates effects of cochlear hearing loss. It is compared to a segmentation based on equidistant boundaries. The results demonstrate that the proposed segmentation procedure gives an improvement in terms of signal-to-artefacts ratio in comparison to corresponding equidistant boundaries segmentation."}}

Based on this analogy, we propose a simple method for controlling accuracy of spline interpolation."}}

Often the number of these features exceeds the number of the samples in the data set. After a feature generation process the problem of feature selection from a set of highly correlated features arises. The proposed algorithm uses an evidence maximization procedure to select a model as a subset of generated features. During the selection process it rejects multicollinear features. A problem of European option volatility modeling illustrates the algorithm. Its performance is compared with the performances of similar well-known algorithms."}}
