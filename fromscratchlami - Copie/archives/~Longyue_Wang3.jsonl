However, previous studies generally evaluate the quality of translating ZPs with BLEU scores on MT testsets, which is not expressive or sensitive enough for accurate assessment. To bridge the data and evaluation gaps, we propose a benchmark testset for target evaluation on Chinese-English ZP translation. The human-annotated testset covers five challenging genres, which reveal different characteristics of ZPs for comprehensive evaluation. We systematically revisit eight advanced models on ZP translation and identify current challenges for future exploration. We release data, code, models and annotation guidelines, which we hope can significantly promote research in this field (https://github.com/longyuewangdcu/mZPRT)."}}

However, existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on the evaluation of inter-sentence properties and overlook critical discourse phenomena that cross sentences. To bridge the gap, we propose Disco-Bench, a benchmark that can evaluate intra-sentence discourse properties across a diverse set of NLP tasks, covering understanding, translation, and generation. Disco-Bench consists of 9 document-level testsets in the literature domain, which contain rich discourse phenomena (e.g. cohesion and coherence) in Chinese and/or English. For linguistic analysis, we also design a diagnostic test suite that can examine whether the target models learn discourse knowledge. We totally evaluate 20 general-, in-domain and commercial models based on Transformer, advanced pretraining architectures and large language models (LLMs). Our results show (1) the challenge and necessity of our evaluation benchmark; (2) fine-grained pretraining based on literary document-level training data consistently improves the modeling of discourse information. We will release the datasets, pretrained models, and leaderboard, which we hope can significantly facilitate research in this field: https://github.com/longyuewangdcu/Disco-Bench."}}

This phenomenon poses a substantial challenge to the reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we survey recent efforts on the detection, explanation, and mitigation of hallucination, with an emphasis on the unique challenges posed by LLMs. We present taxonomies of the LLM hallucination phenomena and evaluation benchmarks, analyze existing approaches aiming at mitigating LLM hallucination, and discuss potential directions for future research."}}

In this work, we propose Macaw-LLM, a novel multi-modal LLM that seamlessly integrates visual, audio, and textual information. Macaw-LLM consists of three main components: a modality module for encoding multi-modal data, a cognitive module for harnessing pretrained LLMs, and an alignment module for harmonizing diverse representations. Our novel alignment module seamlessly bridges multi-modal features to textual features, simplifying the adaptation process from the modality modules to the cognitive module. In addition, we construct a large-scale multi-modal instruction dataset in terms of multi-turn dialogue, including 69K image instances and 50K video instances. We have made our data, code and model publicly available, which we hope can pave the way for future research in multi-modal LLMs and expand the capabilities of LLMs to handle diverse data modalities and address complex real-world scenarios."}}

Although various T2I models have shown impressive but arbitrary examples, there is no benchmark to systematically evaluate a T2I model's ability to generate cross-cultural images. To bridge the gap, we propose a Challenging Cross-Cultural (C3) benchmark with comprehensive evaluation criteria, which can assess how well-suited a model is to a target culture. By analyzing the flawed images generated by the Stable Diffusion model on the C3 benchmark, we find that the model often fails to generate certain cultural objects. Accordingly, we propose a novel multi-modal metric that considers object-text alignment to filter the fine-tuning data in the target culture, which is used to fine-tune a T2I model to improve cross-cultural generation. Experimental results show that our multi-modal metric provides stronger data selection performance on the C3 benchmark than existing metrics, in which the object-text alignment is crucial. We release the benchmark, data, code, and generated images to facilitate future research on culturally diverse T2I generation (https://github.com/longyuewangdcu/C3-Bench)."}}

One of the key challenges in this area is how to effectively integrate visual and linguistic information to enable machines to understand video content and query information. In this work, we leverage graph-based representations and multi-grained audio-visual alignment to address this challenge. First, our approach starts by transforming video and query inputs into visual-scene graphs and semantic role graphs using a visual-scene parser and semantic role labeler respectively. These graphs are then encoded using graph neural networks to obtain enriched representations and combined to obtain a video-query joint representation that enhances the semantic expressivity of the inputs. Second, to achieve accurate matching of relevant parts of audio and visual features, we propose a multi-grained alignment module that aligns the audio and visual features at multiple scales. This enables us to effectively fuse the audio and visual information in a way that is consistent with the semantic-level information captured by the graph-based representations. Experiments on five representative datasets collected for Video Retrieval and Video Question Answering tasks show that our approach outperforms the literature on several metrics. Our extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of graph-based representation and multi-grained audio-visual alignment."}}
