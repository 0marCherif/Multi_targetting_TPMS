Previous research on diversity has mainly focused on promoting diversity to encourage exploration and thereby improve quality (the cumulative reward), maximizing diversity subject to quality constraints, or jointly maximizing quality and diversity, known as the quality-diversity problem. In this work, we present the quality-similar diversity problem that features diversity among policies of similar qualities. In contrast to task-agnostic diversity, we focus on task-specific diversity defined by a set of user-specified Behavior Descriptors (BDs). A BD is a scalar function of a trajectory (e.g., the fire action rate for an Atari game), which delivers the type of diversity the user prefers. To derive the gradient of the user-specified diversity with respect to a policy, which is not trivially available, we introduce a set of BD estimators and connect it with the classical policy gradient theorem. Based on the diversity gradient, we develop a population-based RL algorithm to adaptively and efficiently optimize the population diversity at multiple quality levels throughout training. Extensive results on MuJoCo and Atari demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of generating user-specified diverse policies across different quality levels."}}

This task is particularly challenging on two levels: (1) it requires more information than what is contained in the instant retina or imaging sensor, (2) it is difficult to obtain enough well-annotated amodal labels for supervision. To this end, this paper develops a new framework of Self-supervised amodal Video object segmentation (SaVos). Our method efficiently leverages the visual information of video temporal sequences to infer the amodal mask of objects. The key intuition is that the occluded part of an object can be explained away if that part is visible in other frames, possibly deformed as long as the deformation can be reasonably learned. Accordingly, we derive a novel self-supervised learning paradigm that efficiently utilizes the visible object parts as the supervision to guide the training on videos. In addition to learning type prior to complete masks for known types, SaVos also learns the spatiotemporal prior, which is also useful for the amodal task and could generalize to unseen types. The proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the synthetic amodal segmentation benchmark FISHBOWL and the real world benchmark KINS-Video-Car. Further, it lends itself well to being transferred to novel distributions using test-time adaptation, outperforming existing models even after the transfer to a new distribution."}}

This is challenging because humans make decisions based on complex social relations and personal intents, resulting in highly complex uncertainties over trajectories. To address this problem, we propose a conditional deep generative model that combines advances in graph neural networks. The prior and recognition model encodes two types of latent codes for each agent: an inter-agent latent code to represent social relations and an intra-agent latent code to represent agent intentions. The decoder is carefully devised to leverage the codes in a disentangled way to predict multi-modal future trajectory distribution. Specifically, a graph attention network built upon inter-agent latent code is used to learn continuous pair-wise relations, and an agent's motion is controlled by its latent intents and its observations of all other agents. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our model outperforms previous work in multiple performance metrics. We also show that our model generates realistic multi-modal trajectories."}}
