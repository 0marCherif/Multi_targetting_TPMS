We present a novel end- to-end learning method for generating semantic-rich 3D scenes from images. Scene understanding techniques have often been limited to the 2D space with object detection and segmentation. While new methods infer the 3D models and 6-DOF object pose from images, they either support very few object categories or assume object locations are known. Our solution learns to detect, classify, segment, retrieve 3D models and poses from an image to generate 3D scenes. Our proposed network architecture builds on top of MaskR- CNN to infer 3D information. Our shape retrieval has a Top-1 accuracy of about 40% on Pascal 3D+, on par with prior work on single object retrieval and pose estimation."}}

While, on the one hand, mobile video traffic surge is forecast-ed to require significant investments in bandwidth acquisition and infrastructure dimensioning and roll-out, on the other hand, users are not likely to be willing to pay significantly more than today. This increases the pressure to develop solutions capable of making the mobile provision of video more affordable without either affecting user experience or limiting usage. In this respect, this paper proposes a novel methodology for video content delivery which is based on a user video quality perception model. According to this scheme, the video quality of each scene in a movie is selected, from among a finite set of available qualities, with the purpose of reducing the overall bandwidth required to attain a given user experience level targeted by the system for each user and each video. This novel methodology also adopts a clustering approach to identify users with similar Quality of Experience (QoE) profiles and leverages this information for improving the accuracy of user perceived quality predictions. This approach has been validated through a crowd-sourced subjective test evaluation performed with real users using a novel method involving the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. The results showed that the proposed method is capable of achieving a prediction accuracy in the order of \u00b10.5 MOS points. This approach can be effectively used to select the video qualities minimizing bandwidth costs while delivering predefined level of perceived quality to the end users."}}

Since video is very bandwidth consuming, its distribution costs are becoming too high to scale with network investments that are required to support the increasing bandwidth demand. Content providers and operators are searching for solutions to reduce this video traffic load, without degrading their customers' perceived Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper proposes a method that can programmatically optimize video content for desired QoE according to perceptual video quality and device display properties, while achieving bandwidth and storage savings for content providers, operators, and end users. The preliminary results obtained with Samsung Galaxy S3 phone show that up to 60% savings can be achieved by optimizing movies without compromising the perceptible video quality, and up to 70% for perceptible, but not annoying video quality difference. Tailoring video optimization to individual user perception can provide seamless QoE delivery across all users, with a low overhead (i.e., 10%) required to achieve this goal. Finally, two applications of video optimization: QoE-aware delivery and storage, are proposed and examined."}}

By streaming an optimized video for the particular video quality and channel conditions to a mobile device, we can improve the worst video qualities caused by DASH streaming and reduce quality variations using fewer number of bits."}}

In order to deliver substantially higher peak rates operators will need to deploy a much denser infrastructure and/or acquire more spectrum, thus significantly increasing their CAPEX and OPEX and reducing revenues. To improve the utilization of available network resources this paper presents ActiveCast, a disruptive content delivery paradigm that supports opportunistic content pre-fetching by introducing semantic and context awareness in the currently \u201cagnostic\u201d networking paradigm. The experimental investigations presented in the paper focus on mobile video provision and a content provider, integrated with Facebook and YouTube, has been developed and used to identify socially relevant content for a set of test users. Part of the studies presented in the paper aim at experimentally understanding the structure of the energy costs associated with pre-fetching and on defining a delivery strategy that allows controlling the amount of energy invested. A comparison between a centralized implementation, in which pre-fetching is coordinated by the mobile operators, and an Over-The-Top (OTT) implementation of ActiveCast are also presented. The results show that complementing the context information available at individual user terminals with traffic information, shared by mobile operators through the ActiveCast API, can substantially reduce the energy costs of content delivery, as compared with \u201con demand\u201d video streaming. Additionally, opportunistically exploiting connections with WiFi APs can amplify the gains already achievable by prefetching on wide area networks."}}

According to recent studies, video has been the main driver of mobile data consumption, having a higher growth rate than any other mobile application. However, streaming a medium/high quality video files can be an issue in a mobile environment where available capacity needs to be shared among a large number of users. Additionally, the energy consumption in mobile devices increases proportionally with the duration of data transfers, which depend on the download data rates achievable by the device. In this respect, adoption of opportunistic content pre-fetching schemes that exploit times and locations with high data rates to deliver content before a user requests it, has the potential to reduce the energy consumption associated with content delivery and improve the user's quality of experience, by allowing playback of pre-stored content with virtually no perceived interruptions or delays. This paper presents a family of opportunistic content pre-fetching schemes and compares their performance to standard on-demand access to content. By adopting a simulation approach on experimental data, collected with monitoring software installed in mobile terminals, we show that content pre-fetching can reduce energy consumption of the mobile devices by up to 30% when compared to the on demand download of the same file, with a time window of 1 hour needed to complete the content prepositioning."}}

Most smart phone users now run both enterprise as well as personal applications simultaneously on their phones. However, most of the personal apps that are downloaded from public market places are hardly tested for enterprise grade security, and there have been instances of malware appearing in public markets that steal sensitive user information. Smart phone platforms such as Android require users to explicitly provide permissions to applications at install time, yet lack run time monitoring of permission usage by applications. In this paper, we present a framework for the run time enforcement of privacy policies on smart phones, in particular, protecting the privacy of enterprise data on smart phones. Our privacy policies are defined in terms of permissible information flows on the phone during different contexts. This arms users with finer grained control over information access by different applications. In our policy framework, an information flow is defined based on the entities involved in the corresponding inter-process communication(IPC) viz, the caller, callee and the associated IPC data. The information flow policy specifies the conditions under which an IPC flow may be permitted (or denied). Our system tracks information flows at run time and enforces that only flows satisfying all the current policies are permitted on the phone. We describe the design and implementation of our policy based framework in Android, and present performance evaluation results measuring the overhead imposed by our framework."}}
