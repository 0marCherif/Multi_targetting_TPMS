A key ingredient of our method is a hybrid appearance blending module that combines the advantages of the implicit body NeRF representation and image-based rendering. Existing generalizable human NeRF methods that are conditioned on the body model have shown robustness against the geometric variation of arbitrary human performers. Yet they often exhibit blurry results when generalized onto unseen identities. Meanwhile, image-based rendering shows high-quality results when sufficient observations are available, whereas it suffers artifacts in sparse-view settings. We propose Neural Image-based Avatars (NIA) that exploits the best of those two methods: to maintain robustness under new articulations and self-occlusions while directly leveraging the available (sparse) source view colors to preserve appearance details of new subject identities. Our hybrid design outperforms recent methods on both in-domain identity generalization as well as challenging cross-dataset generalization settings. Also, in terms of the pose generalization, our method outperforms even the per-subject optimized animatable NeRF methods."}}

In this paper, we propose a new computer vision benchmark: Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS). To study this important problem, we present two datasets, Cityscapes-VPS and VIPER together with a new evaluation metric, video panoptic quality (VPQ). We also propose VPSNet++, an advanced video panoptic segmentation network, which simultaneously performs classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking of all identities in videos. Specifically, VPSNet++ builds upon a top-down panoptic segmentation network by adding pixel-level feature fusion head and object-level association head. The former temporally augments the pixel features while the latter performs object tracking. Furthermore, we propose panoptic boundary learning as an auxiliary task, and instance discrimination learning which learns spatio-temporally clustered pixel embedding for individual thing or stuff regions, i.e., exactly the objective of the video panoptic segmentation problem. Our VPSNet++ significantly outperforms the default VPSNet, i.e., FuseTrack baseline, and achieves state-of-the-art results on both Cityscapes-VPS and VIPER datasets.

Recent works in this domain have mainly focused on direct manipulation of the raw RGB pixels, which only allows to perform edits involving relatively small shape changes (e.g., sleeves). The goal of our Virtual Personal Tailoring Network (VPTNet) is to extend the editing capabilities to much larger shape changes of fashion items, such as cloth length. To achieve this goal, we decouple the fashion attribute editing task into two conditional stages: shape-then-appearance editing. To this aim, we propose a shape editing network that employs a semantic parsing of the fashion image as an interface for manipulation. Compared to operating on the raw RGB image, our parsing map editing enables performing more complex shape editing operations. Second, we introduce an appearance completion network that takes the previous stage results and completes the shape difference regions to produce the final RGB image. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on the DeepFashion-Synthesis dataset confirm that VPTNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both small and large shape attribute editing."}}

Recently, several works have addressed this problem by learning person-specific neural radiance fields (NeRF) to capture the appearance of a particular human. In parallel, some work proposed to use pixel-aligned features to generalize radiance fields to arbitrary new scenes and objects. Adopting such generalization approaches to humans, however, is highly challenging due to the heavy occlusions and dynamic articulations of body parts. To tackle this, we propose Neural Human Performer, a novel approach that learns generalizable neural radiance fields based on a parametric human body model for robust performance capture. Specifically, we first introduce a temporal transformer that aggregates tracked visual features based on the skeletal body motion over time. Moreover, a multi-view transformer is proposed to perform cross-attention between the temporally-fused features and the pixel-aligned features at each time step to integrate observations on the fly from multiple views. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and AIST datasets show that our method significantly outperforms recent generalizable NeRF methods on unseen identities and poses."}}

The common paradigm is to learn object proposals from data labeled with a set of object regions and their corresponding categories. However, this approach often struggles with novel objects in the open world that are absent in the training set. In this paper, we identify that the problem is that the binary classifiers in existing proposal methods tend to overfit to the training categories. Therefore, we propose a classification-free Object Localization Network (OLN) which estimates the objectness of each region purely by how well the location and shape of a region overlap with any ground-truth object (e.g., centerness and IoU). This simple strategy learns generalizable objectness and outperforms existing proposals on cross-category generalization on COCO, as well as cross-dataset evaluation on RoboNet, Object365, and EpicKitchens. Finally, we demonstrate the merit of OLN for long-tail object detection on large vocabulary dataset, LVIS, where we notice clear improvement in rare and common categories."}}

For the panoptic understanding of dynamic scenes, we further extend this concept to every segment. Specifically, we aim to learn coarse segment-level matching and fine pixel-level matching together. We implement this idea by designing two novel learning objectives. To validate our proposals, we adopt a deep siamese model and train the model to learn the temporal correspondence on two different levels (i.e., segment and pixel) along with the target task. At inference time, the model processes each frame independently without any extra computation and post-processing. We show that our per-frame inference model can achieve new state-of-the-art results on Cityscapes-VPS and VIPER datasets. Moreover, due to its high efficiency, the model runs in a fraction of time (3x) compared to the previous state-of-the-art approach. The codes and models will be released."}}
