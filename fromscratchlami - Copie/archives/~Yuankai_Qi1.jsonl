However, these methods neglect the importance of historical contexts or ignore predicting future actions during pre-training, limiting the learning of visual-textual correspondence and the capability of decision-making. To address these problems, we present a history-enhanced and order-aware pre-training with the complementing fine-tuning paradigm (HOP+) for VLN. Specifically, besides the common Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Trajectory-Instruction Matching (TIM) tasks, we design three novel VLN-specific proxy tasks: Action Prediction with History (APH) task, Trajectory Order Modeling (TOM) task and Group Order Modeling (GOM) task. APH task takes into account the visual perception trajectory to enhance the learning of historical knowledge as well as action prediction. The two temporal visual-textual alignment tasks, TOM and GOM further improve the agent's ability to order reasoning. Moreover, we design a memory network to address the representation inconsistency of history context between the pre-training and the fine-tuning stages. The memory network effectively selects and summarizes historical information for action prediction during fine-tuning, without costing huge extra computation consumption for downstream VLN tasks. HOP+ achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four downstream VLN tasks (R2R, REVERIE, RxR, and NDH), which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method."}}

Unlike existing methods focused on predicting a more accurate action at each step in navigation, in this paper, we make the first attempt to tackle a long-ignored problem in VLN: narrowing the gap between Success Rate (SR) and Oracle Success Rate (OSR). We observe a consistently large gap (up to 9%) on four state-of-the-art VLN methods across two benchmark datasets: R2R and REVERIE. The high OSR indicates the robot agent passes the target location, while the low SR suggests the agent actually fails to stop at the target location at last. Instead of predicting actions directly, we propose to mine the target location from a trajectory given by off-the-shelf VLN models. Specially, we design a multi-module transformer-based model for learning compact discriminative trajectory viewpoint representation, which is used to predict the confidence of being a target location as described in the instruction. The proposed method is evaluated on three widely-adopted datasets: R2R, REVERIE and NDH, and shows promising results, demonstrating the potential for more future research."}}

However, this method faces two major challenges for video task: substantial computing resources from loading teacher model and limited replay capability from performance-limited teacher model. To address these problems, we first propose a knowledge distillation-free framework for rehearsal-based video incremental learning called \\textit{Teacher Agent}. Instead of loading parameter-heavy teacher networks, we introduce an agent generator that is either parameter-free or uses only a few parameters to obtain accurate and reliable soft labels. This method not only greatly reduces the computing requirement but also circumvents the problem of knowledge misleading caused by inaccurate predictions of the teacher model. Moreover, we put forward a self-correction loss which provides an effective regularization signal for the review of old knowledge, which in turn alleviates the problem of catastrophic forgetting. Further, to ensure that the samples in the memory buffer are memory-efficient and representative, we introduce a unified sampler for rehearsal-based video incremental learning to mine fixed-length key video frames. Interestingly, based on the proposed strategies, the network exhibits a high level of robustness against spatial resolution reduction when compared to the baseline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method, yielding significant performance improvements while utilizing only half the spatial resolution of video clips as network inputs in the incremental phases."}}

Existing VLN tasks are built for agents that navigate on the ground, either indoors or outdoors. However, many tasks require intelligent agents to carry out in the sky, such as UAV-based goods delivery, traffic/security patrol, and scenery tour, to name a few. Navigating in the sky is more complicated than on the ground because agents need to consider the flying height and more complex spatial relationship reasoning. To fill this gap and facilitate research in this field, we propose a new task named AerialVLN, which is UAV-based and towards outdoor environments. We develop a 3D simulator rendered by near-realistic pictures of 25 city-level scenarios. Our simulator supports continuous navigation, environment extension and configuration. We also proposed an extended baseline model based on the widely-used cross-modal-alignment (CMA) navigation methods. We find that there is still a significant gap between the baseline model and human performance, which suggests AerialVLN is a new challenging task.

To effectively regulate models, various improved L2 loss functions have been proposed to find a better correspondence between predicted density and annotation positions. In this paper, we propose to predict the density map at one resolution but measure the density map at multiple resolutions. By maximizing the posterior probability in such a setting, we obtain a log-formed multi-resolution L2-difference loss, where the traditional single-resolution L2 loss is its particular case. We mathematically prove it is superior to a single-resolution L2 loss. Without bells and whistles, the proposed loss substantially improves several baselines and performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art methods on four crowd counting datasets, ShanghaiTech A & B, UCF-QNRF, and JHU-Crowd++."}}

However, most existing pre-training methods employ discrete panoramas to learn visual-textual associations. This requires the model to implicitly correlate incomplete, duplicate observations within the panoramas, which may impair an agent's spatial understanding. Thus, we propose a new map-based pre-training paradigm that is spatial-aware for use in VLN. Concretely, we build a local metric map to explicitly aggregate incomplete observations and remove duplicates, while modeling navigation dependency in a global topological map. This hybrid design can balance the demand of VLN for both short-term reasoning and long-term planning. Then, based on the hybrid map, we devise a pre-training framework to learn a multimodal map representation, which enhances spatial-aware cross-modal reasoning thereby facilitating the language-guided navigation goal. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the map-based pre-training route for VLN, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art on four VLN benchmarks."}}

Existing works typically require compressed video bitstream to be decoded to RGB frames before being segmented, which increases computation and storage requirements and ultimately slows the inference down. This may hamper its application in real-world computing resource limited scenarios, such as autonomous cars and drones. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we explore the referring object segmentation task on compressed videos, namely on the original video data flow. Besides the inherent difficulty of the video referring object segmentation task itself, obtaining discriminative representation from compressed video is also rather challenging. To address this problem, we propose a multi-attention network which consists of dual-path dual-attention module and a query-based cross-modal Transformer module. Specifically, the dual-path dual-attention module is designed to extract effective representation from compressed data in three modalities, i.e., I-frame, Motion Vector and Residual. The query-based cross-modal Transformer firstly models the correlation between linguistic and visual modalities, and then the fused multi-modality features are used to guide object queries to generate a content-aware dynamic kernel and to predict final segmentation masks. Different from previous works, we propose to learn just one kernel, which thus removes the complicated post mask-matching procedure of existing methods. Extensive promising experimental results on three challenging datasets show the effectiveness of our method compared against several state-of-the-art methods which are proposed for processing RGB data.

V2C is more challenging than conventional text-to-speech tasks as it additionally requires the generated speech to exactly match the varying emotions and speaking speed presented in the video. Unlike previous works, we propose a novel movie dubbing architecture to tackle these problems via hierarchical prosody modelling, which bridges the visual information to corresponding speech prosody from three aspects: lip, face, and scene. Specifically, we align lip movement to the speech duration, and convey facial expression to speech energy and pitch via attention mechanism based on valence and arousal representations inspired by recent psychology findings. Moreover, we design an emotion booster to capture the atmosphere from global video scenes. All these embeddings together are used to generate mel-spectrogram and then convert to speech waves via existing vocoder. Extensive experimental results on the Chem and V2C benchmark datasets demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed method. The source code and trained models will be released to the public."}}

As the pseudo labels play a crucial role, we propose an enhancement framework by exploiting completeness and uncertainty properties for effective self-training. Specifically, we first design a multi-head classification module (each head serves as a classifier) with a diversity loss to maximize the distribution differences of predicted pseudo labels across heads. This encourages the generated pseudo labels to cover as many abnormal events as possible. We then devise an iterative uncertainty pseudo label refinement strategy, which improves not only the initial pseudo labels but also the updated ones obtained by the desired classifier in the second stage. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches on the UCF-Crime, TAD, and XD-Violence benchmark datasets."}}
