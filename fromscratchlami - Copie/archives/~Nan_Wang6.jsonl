Given an instance, a classification model computes a score for each class, all of which are then used to sort the classes. The performance of a classification model is usually measured by Top-K Accuracy (e.g., K=1 or 5). In this paper, we examine MCC through the lens of learning to rank (LTR) in the deep learning setting. By viewing MCC as to rank classes for an instance, we first argue that ranking metrics from the information retrieval literature, such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), can be more informative than the existing Top-K metrics in evaluating the performance of classification models, especially for real-world user-facing applications. We further demonstrate that the most popular MCC architecture in deep learning can be mathematically formulated as a LTR pipeline equivalently, with a specific set of choices in terms of ranking model architecture and loss function. Based on these observations, we propose several techniques, stemmed from the rich LTR literature, to improve the MCC performance. Comprehensive empirical results on both text and image classification tasks, with diverse datasets and backbone models (e.g., BERT for text classification and ResNet for image classification) show the value of our proposed framework."}}

However, current mainstream solutions loosely connect the learning of explanation with the learning of recommendation: for example, they are often separately modeled as rating prediction and content generation tasks. In this work, we propose to strengthen their connection by enforcing the idea of sentiment alignment between a recommendation and its corresponding explanation. At training time, the two learning tasks are joined by a latent sentiment vector, which is encoded by the recommendation module and used to make word choices for explanation generation. At both training and inference time, the explanation module is required to generate explanation text that matches sentiment predicted by the recommendation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate our solution outperforms a rich set of baselines in both recommendation and explanation tasks, especially on the improved quality of its generated explanations. More importantly, our user studies confirm our generated explanations help users better recognize the differences between recommended items and understand why an item is recommended."}}

Abstract An accurate forecast of daily meteorological factors throughout the year is not only of great significance for the study of climate trends in a certain area but also enables the prediction of crop growth stages. Moreover, the prediction of crop growth stages is related to the scheduling of planting and tillage, the determination of machine harvest time, and the prediction of crop yield. However, highly complex dynamics cause large volatility in meteorological factors, so it is very challenging to predict the crop growth stage accurately, based on weather data. To solve this problem, we propose a data-driven encoder-decoder model, using long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), which can be applied to forecast daily sunshine duration, cumulative precipitation, and average temperature for the coming year. To further test the performance of the ConvLSTM-based model, it is compared with the conventional LSTM encoder-decoder model and the convolutional neural network (CNN)-LSTM encoder-decoder model. The results demonstrate that, the ConvLSTM-based model is more accurate than the others for forecasting temperature (MAE\u00a0=\u00a02.602\u00a0\u00b0C, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a03.456\u00a0\u00b0C), precipitation (MAE\u00a0=\u00a03.878\u00a0mm, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a010.503\u00a0mm), and\u00a0sunshine hours (MAE\u00a0=\u00a03.445\u00a0h, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a04.172\u00a0h) in 2014\u20132016. Furthermore, precise forecasting of meteorological factors allows us to develop a hybrid model and a data-driven model for the prediction of each growth stage separately. The hybrid model combines the ConvLSTM encoder-decoder model with empirical models, whereas the data-driven model comprises the ConvLSTM encoder-decoder model and traditional neural network structures. Finally, we compared the two types of models on a real-world dataset from Dandong, and concluded that the data-driven model is more accurate than the hybrid model for prediction of maize growth stages, with R 2 in the range of 0.755\u20130.883, MAE 0.588\u20132.205\u00a0days, and RMSE 0.978\u20132.729\u00a0days. In the future, these models can also be used to predict the growth stages of other crops."}}

Extensive studies have shown that modeling such data greatly improves the effectiveness and explainability of the recommendations. However, as ranking is essential in recommendation, there is no principled solution yet for collectively generating multiple item rankings over different aspects. In this work, we propose a directional multi-aspect ranking criterion to enable a holistic ranking of items with respect to multiple aspects. Specifically, we view multi-aspect evaluation as an integral effort from a user that forms a vector of his/her preferences over aspects. Our key insight is that the direction of the difference vector between two multi-aspect preference vectors reveals the pairwise order of comparison. Hence, it is necessary for a multi-aspect ranking criterion to preserve the observed directions from such pairwise comparisons. We further derive a complete solution for the multi-aspect ranking problem based on a probabilistic multivariate tensor factorization model. Comprehensive experimental analysis on a large TripAdvisor multi-aspect rating dataset and a Yelp review text dataset confirms the effectiveness of our solution."}}

Early prenatal detection of brain abnormalities is essential for informing clinical management pathways and consulting for parents. The purpose of this research is to develop computer-aided diagnosis algorithms for five common fetal brain abnormalities, which may provide assistance to doctors for brain abnormalities detection in antenatal neurosonographic assessment. Methods We applied a classifier to classify images of fetal brain standard planes (transventricular and transcerebellar) as normal or abnormal. The classifier was trained by image-level labeled images. In the first step, craniocerebral regions were segmented from the ultrasound images. Then, these segmentations were classified into four categories. Last, the lesions in the abnormal images were localized by class activation mapping. Results We evaluated our algorithms on real-world clinical datasets of fetal brain ultrasound images. We observed that the proposed method achieved a Dice score of 0.942 on craniocerebral region segmentation, an average F1-score of 0.96 on classification and an average mean IOU of 0.497 on lesion localization. Conclusion We present computer-aided diagnosis algorithms for fetal brain ultrasound images based on deep convolutional neural networks. Our algorithms could be potentially applied in diagnosis assistance and are expected to help junior doctors in making clinical decision and reducing false negatives of fetal brain abnormalities."}}

The hybrid effect of two types of impulses including both stabilizing and destabilizing impulses is considered simultaneously in the analysis of systems. To characterize the occurrence features of impulses, the concepts of average impulse interval and average impulse strength are employed. Based on the analysis of stability, a pinning impulsive controller which can ensure the global exponential stability of the studied neural networks is designed by pinning a small fraction of neurons. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes for delayed neural networks with hybrid impulses."}}

Though theoretically sound in correcting the bias introduced by treating clicked documents as relevant, IPS ignores the bias caused by (implicitly) treating non-clicked ones as irrelevant. In this work, we first rigorously prove that such use of click data leads to unnecessary pairwise comparisons between relevant documents, which prevent unbiased ranker optimization. Based on the proof, we derive a simple yet well justified new weighting scheme, called Propensity Ratio Scoring (PRS), which provides treatments on both clicks and non-clicks. Besides correcting the bias in clicks, PRS avoids relevant-relevant document comparisons in LTR training and enjoys a lower variability. Our extensive empirical evaluations confirm that PRS ensures a more effective use of click data and improved performance in both synthetic data from a set of LTR benchmarks, as well as in the real-world large-scale data from GMail search."}}
