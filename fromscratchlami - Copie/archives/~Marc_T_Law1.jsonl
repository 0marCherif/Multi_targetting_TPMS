However, for high-stakes applications (e.g. autonomous driving), it is common to have a modest amount of human-labeled real data in addition to plentiful auto-labeled source data (e.g. from a driving simulator). We study this setting of supervised sim2real DA applied to 2D object detection. We propose Domain Translation via Conditional Alignment and Reweighting (CARE) a novel algorithm that systematically exploits target labels to explicitly close the sim2real appearance and content gaps. We present an analytical justification of our algorithm and demonstrate strong gains over competing methods on standard benchmarks."}}

In this work, we introduce a general family of representations for directed graphs through connected time-oriented Lorentz manifolds, called \"spacetimes\" in general relativity. Spacetimes intrinsically contain a causal structure that indicates whether or not there exists a causal or even chronological order between points of the manifold, called events. This chronological order allows us to naturally represent directed edges via imposing the correct ordering when the nodes are embedded as events in the spacetime. Previous work in machine learning only considers embeddings lying on the simplest Lorentz manifold or does not exploit the connection between Lorentzian pre-length spaces and directed graphs. We introduce a well-defined approach to map data onto a general family of spacetimes.  We empirically evaluate our framework in the tasks of hierarchy extraction of undirected graphs, directed link prediction and representation of directed graphs."}}

Over-collecting data incurs unnecessary present costs, while under-collecting may incur future costs and delay workflows. We propose a new paradigm for modeling the data collection workflow as a formal optimal data collection problem that allows designers to specify performance targets, collection costs, a time horizon, and penalties for failing to meet the targets. Additionally, this formulation generalizes to tasks requiring multiple data sources, such as labeled and unlabeled data used in semi-supervised learning. To solve our problem, we develop Learn-Optimize-Collect (LOC), which minimizes expected future collection costs. Finally, we numerically compare our framework to the conventional baseline of estimating data requirements by extrapolating from neural scaling laws. We significantly reduce the risks of failing to meet desired performance targets on several classification, segmentation, and detection tasks, while maintaining low total collection costs."}}

In this paper, we introduce a novel and general domain-adversarial framework. Specifically, we derive a novel generalization bound for domain adaptation that exploits a new measure of discrepancy between distributions based on a variational characterization of f-divergences. It recovers the theoretical results from Ben-David et al. (2010a) as a special case and supports divergences used in practice. Based on this bound, we derive a new algorithmic framework that introduces a key correction in the original adversarial training method of Ganin et al. (2016). We show that many regularizers and ad-hoc objectives introduced over the last years in this framework are then not required to achieve performance comparable to (if not better than) state-of-the-art domain-adversarial methods. Experimental analysis conducted on real-world natural language and computer vision datasets show that our framework outperforms existing baselines, and obtains the best results for f-divergences that were not considered previously in domain-adversarial learning."}}

The large scale of data sets used in deep learning forces most sample selection strategies to employ efficient heuristics. This paper introduces an integer optimization problem for selecting a core set that minimizes the discrete Wasserstein distance from the unlabeled pool. We demonstrate that this problem can be tractably solved with a Generalized Benders Decomposition algorithm. Our strategy uses high-quality latent features that can be obtained by unsupervised learning on the unlabeled pool. Numerical results on several data sets show that our optimization approach is competitive with baselines and particularly outperforms them in the low budget regime where less than one percent of the data set is labeled.

Recently, some pseudo-Riemannian space forms that generalize both hyperbolic and spherical geometries have been exploited to learn a specific type of nonparametric embedding called ultrahyperbolic. The lack of geodesic between every pair of ultrahyperbolic points makes the task of learning parametric models (e.g., neural networks) difficult. This paper introduces a method to learn parametric models in ultrahyperbolic space. We experimentally show the relevance of our approach in the tasks of graph and node classification. "}}

The existing theory of domain adaptation derived generalization bounds based on divergence measures that are hard to optimize in practice. This has led to a large disconnect between theory and state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, we propose a novel domain-adversarial framework that introduces new theory for domain adaptation and leads to practical learning algorithms with neural networks. In particular, we derive a novel generalization bound that utilizes a new measure of discrepancy between distributions based on a variational characterization of f-divergences. We show that our bound recovers the theoretical results from Ben-David et al. (2010a) as a special case with a particular choice of divergence, and also supports divergences typically used in practice. We derive a general algorithm for domain-adversarial learning for the complete family of f-divergences. We provide empirical results for several f-divergences and show that some, not considered previously in domain-adversarial learning, achieve state-of-the-art results in practice. We provide empirical insights into how choosing a particular divergence affects the transfer performance on real-world datasets. By further recognizing the optimization problem as a Stackelberg game, we utilize the latest optimizers from the game optimization literature, achieving additional performance boosts in our training algorithm. We show that our f-domain adversarial framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging Office-31 and Office-Home datasets without extra hyperparameters."}}
