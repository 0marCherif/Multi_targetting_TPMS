Recently, there is a surge of interest in modeling spatial relations between variables as graphs, i.e., first learning one static graph for each dataset and then exploiting the graph structure via graph neural networks. However, as spatial relations may differ substantially across samples, building one static graph for all the samples inherently limits flexibility and severely degrades the performance in practice. To address this issue, we propose a framework for fine-grained modeling and utilization of spatial correlation between variables. By analyzing the statistical properties of real-world datasets, a universal decomposition of spatial correlation graphs is first identified. Specifically, the hidden spatial relations can be decomposed into a prior part, which applies across all the samples, and a dynamic part, which varies between samples, and building different graphs is necessary to model these relations. To better coordinate the learning of the two relational graphs, we propose a min-max learning paradigm that not only regulates the common part of different dynamic graphs but also guarantees spatial distinguishability among samples. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on both time-series forecasting and time-series point prediction tasks."}}

Recent advances in neuroscience revealed that neurons interact with each other through various kinds of connectivity patterns to process information, in which the common connectivity patterns are also called circuit motifs. However, many existing ANNs can only model one or two circuit motifs in their architectures, so that their performance may drastically vary among different types of machine learning tasks. \nIn this paper, we propose a new type of neural network inspired by the architectures of neuronal circuits, namely Circuit Neural Network (CircuitNet). In CircuitNet, a group of densely connected neurons, namely circuit motif unit (CMU), form the basic unit of the network, which is capable of modeling universal circuit motifs by adjusting the weights within the CMUs. Compared with traditional feed-forward networks, CircuitNet has the ability to model more types of neuron connections such as feed-back and lateral motifs.\nInspired by the locally dense and globally sparse structure of the human brain, several iterations of signal transmission among different CMUs are achieved by sparse connections through the input ports and output ports of different CMUs. \nExperiments have demonstrated that CircuitNet can outperform popular neural network architectures in function approximation, reinforcement learning, image classification, and time series forecasting tasks."}}

In this paper, we propose an alternative direction, i.e., to efficiently leverage a pool of pretrained models without fine-tuning. Through extensive empirical and theoretical evidence, we demonstrate that (1) pretrained models have possessed generalization to some extent while there is no single best pretrained model across all distribution shifts, and (2) out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization error depends on the fitness between the pretrained model and unseen test distributions. This analysis motivates us to incorporate diverse pretrained models and to dispatch the best matched models for each OOD sample by means of recommendation techniques. To this end, we propose SIMPLE, a specialized model-sample matching method for domain generalization. First, the predictions of pretrained models are adapted to the target domain by a linear label space transformation. A matching network aware of model specialty is then proposed to dynamically recommend proper pretrained models to predict each test sample. The experiments on DomainBed show that our method achieves significant performance improvements (up to 12.2% for individual dataset and 3.9% on average) compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and further achieves 6.1% gain via enlarging the pretrained model pool. Moreover, our method is highly efficient and achieves more than 1000 times training speedup compared to the conventional DG methods with fine-tuning a pretrained model.

In recent years, lots of work pays attention to domain generalization (DG) where distribution shift exists and target data are unseen. Despite the progress in algorithm design, two foundational factors have long been ignored: 1) the optimization for regularization-based objectives (e.g., distribution alignment), and 2) the model selection for DG since no knowledge about the target domain can be utilized. In this paper, we propose Mixup guided optimization and selection techniques for domain generalization. For optimization, we utilize an adapted Mixup to generate an out-of-distribution dataset that can guide the preference direction and optimize with Pareto optimization. For model selection, we generate a validation dataset with a closer distance to the target distribution, and thereby it can better represent the target data. We also present some theoretical insights behind our proposals. Comprehensive experiments on one visual classification benchmark and three time-series benchmarks demonstrate that our model optimization and selection techniques can largely improve the performance of existing domain generalization algorithms and even achieve new state-of-the-art results."}}

However, fine-tuning is usually computationally expensive due to the ever-growing size of pretrained models. More importantly, it may cause over-fitting on source domain and compromise their generalization ability as shown in recent works. Generally, pretrained models possess some level of generalization ability and can achieve decent performance regarding specific domains and samples. However, the generalization performance of pretrained models could vary significantly over different test domains even samples, which raises challenges for us to best leverage pretrained models in DG tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel domain generalization paradigm to better leverage various pretrained models, named specialized ensemble learning for domain generalization (SEDGE). It first trains a linear label space adapter upon fixed pretrained models, which transforms the outputs of the pretrained model to the label space of the target domain. Then, an ensemble network aware of model specialty is proposed to dynamically dispatch proper pretrained models to predict each test sample. Experimental studies on several benchmarks show that SEDGE achieves significant performance improvements comparing to strong baselines including state-of-the-art method in DG tasks and reduces the trainable parameters by ~99% and the training time by ~99.5%."}}

Take financial trading as an example, the market information is noisy yet imperfect and the macroeconomic regulation or other factors may shift between training and evaluation, thus it requires both generalization and high sample efficiency for resolving the task. However, directly applying typical RL algorithms can lead to poor performance in such scenarios. To derive a robust and applicable RL algorithm, in this work, we design a simple but effective method named Ensemble Proximal Policy Optimization (EPPO), which learns ensemble policies in an end-to-end manner. Notably, EPPO combines each policy and the policy ensemble organically and optimizes both simultaneously. In addition, EPPO adopts a diversity enhancement regularization over the policy space which helps to generalize to unseen states and promotes exploration. We theoretically prove that EPPO can increase exploration efficacy, and through comprehensive experimental evaluations on various tasks, we demonstrate that EPPO achieves higher efficiency and is robust for real-world applications compared with vanilla policy optimization algorithms and other ensemble methods.
