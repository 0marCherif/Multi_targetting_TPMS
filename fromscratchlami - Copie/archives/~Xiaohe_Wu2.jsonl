By merging information from multiple shifted images of a scene, burst super-resolution aims to recover details which otherwise cannot be obtained using a simple input image. This paper reviews the NTIRE 2022 challenge on burst super-resolution. In the challenge, the participants were tasked with generating a clean RGB image with 4\u00d7 higher resolution, given a RAW noisy burst as input. That is, the methods need to perform joint denoising, demosaicking, and super-resolution. The challenge consisted of 2 tracks. Track 1 employed synthetic data, where pixel-accurate high-resolution ground truths are available. Track 2 on the other hand used real-world bursts captured from a handheld camera, along with approximately aligned reference images captured using a DSLR. 14 teams participated in the final testing phase. The top performing methods establish a new state-of-the-art on the burst super-resolution task."}}

With the ability to generate photo-realistic high-resolution (e.g., $1024\\times1024$) images, recent GAN models have greatly narrowed the gaps between the generated images and the real ones. Therefore, many recent works show emerging interest to take advantage of pre-trained GAN models by exploiting the well-disentangled latent space and the learned GAN priors. In this paper, we briefly review recent progress on leveraging pre-trained large-scale GAN models from three aspects, i.e., 1) the training of large-scale generative adversarial networks, 2) exploring and understanding the pre-trained GAN models, and 3) leveraging these models for subsequent tasks like image restoration and editing.

Most existing methods deploy a deterministic model to learn the retouching style from a specific expert, making it less flexible to meet diverse subjective preferences. Besides, the intrinsic diversity of an expert due to the targeted processing on different images is also deficiently described. To circumvent such issues, we propose to learn diverse image retouching with normalizing flow-based architectures. Unlike current flow-based methods which directly generate the output image, we argue that learning in a style domain could (i) disentangle the retouching styles from the image content, (ii) lead to a stable style presentation form, and (iii) avoid the spatial disharmony effects. For obtaining meaningful image tone style representations, a joint-training pipeline is delicately designed, which is composed of a style encoder, a conditional RetouchNet, and the image tone style normalizing flow (TSFlow) module. In particular, the style encoder predicts the target style representation of an input image, which serves as the conditional information in the RetouchNet for retouching, while the TSFlow maps the style representation vector into a Gaussian distribution in the forward pass. After training, the TSFlow can generate diverse image tone style vectors by sampling from the Gaussian distribution. Extensive experiments on MIT-Adobe FiveK and PPR10K datasets show that our proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods and is effective in generating diverse results to satisfy different human aesthetic preferences.

Bidirectional recurrent networks (BiRNN) have exhibited appealing performance in several video restoration tasks. However, BiRNN is intrinsically offline because it uses backward recurrent modules to propagate from the last to current frames, which causes high latency and large memory consumption. To address the offline issue of BiRNN, we present a novel recurrent network consisting of forward and look-ahead recurrent modules for unidirectional video denoising. Particularly, look-ahead module is an elaborate forward module for leveraging information from near-future frames. When denoising the current frame, the hidden features by forward and look-ahead recurrent modules are combined, thereby making it feasible to exploit both historical and near-future frames. Due to the scene motion between non-neighboring frames, border pixels missing may occur when warping look-ahead feature from near-future frame to current frame, which can be largely alleviated by incorporating forward warping and proposed border enlargement. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with constant latency and memory consumption. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/nagejacob/FloRNN ."}}

Performance drop will inevitably happen when the sensor and ISP pipeline of test images are different from those for training the deep denoisers (i.e., noise discrepancy). In this paper, we present an unpaired learning scheme to adapt a color image denoiser for handling test images with noise discrepancy. We consider a practical training setting, i.e., a pre-trained denoiser, a set of test noisy images, and an unpaired set of clean images. To begin with, the pre-trained denoiser is used to generate the pseudo clean images for the test images. Pseudo-ISP is then suggested to jointly learn the pseudo ISP pipeline and signal-dependent rawRGB noise model using the pairs of test and pseudo clean images. We further apply the learned pseudo ISP and rawRGB noise model to clean color images to synthesize realistic noisy images for denoiser adaption. Pseudo-ISP is effective in synthesizing realistic noisy sRGB images, and improved denoising performance can be achieved by alternating between Pseudo-ISP training and denoiser adaption. Experiments show that our Pseudo-ISP not only can boost simple Gaussian blurring-based denoiser to achieve competitive performance against CBDNet, but also is effective in improving state-of-the-art deep denoisers, e.g., CBDNet and RIDNet."}}

However, such data-driven models ignore the inherent characteristics of transformation between the low and normal light images, leading to unstable training and artifacts. Here, we propose to leverage the invertible network to enhance low-light image in forward process and degrade the normal-light one inversely with unpaired learning. The generated and real images are then fed into discriminators for adversarial learning. In addition to the adversarial loss, we design various loss functions to ensure the stability of training and preserve more image details. Particularly, a reversibility loss is introduced to alleviate the over-exposure problem. Moreover, we present a progressive self-guided enhancement process for low-light images and achieve favorable performance against the SOTAs."}}

The performance of existing trackers using deep classification networks is limited by two aspects. First, the positive samples in each frame are highly spatially overlapped, and they fail to capture rich appearance variations. Second, there exists extreme class imbalance between positive and negative samples. This paper presents the VITAL algorithm to address these two problems via adversarial learning. To augment positive samples, we use a generative network to randomly generate masks, which are applied to adaptively dropout input features to capture a variety of appearance changes. With the use of adversarial learning, our network identifies the mask that maintains the most robust features of the target objects over a long temporal span. In addition, to handle the issue of class imbalance, we propose a highorder cost sensitive loss to decrease the effect of easy negative samples to facilitate training the classification network. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat the proposed tracker performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches.\n"}}

Nonetheless, the existing CF trackers adopt a cosine window to spatially reweight base image to alleviate boundary discontinuity. However, cosine window emphasizes more on the central regions of base image and has the risk of contaminating negative training samples during model learning. On the other hand, spatial regularization deployed in many recent CF trackers plays a similar role as cosine window by enforcing spatial penalty on CF coefficients. Therefore, we in this paper investigate the feasibility to remove cosine window from CF trackers with spatial regularization. When simply removing cosine window, CF with spatial regularization still suffers from small degree of boundary discontinuity. To tackle this issue, binary and Gaussian shaped mask functions are further introduced for eliminating boundary discontinuity while reweighting the estimation error of each training sample, and can be incorporated with multiple CF trackers with spatial regularization. In comparison to the baseline methods with cosine window, our methods are effective in handling boundary discontinuity and sample contamination, thereby benefiting tracking performance. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that our methods perform favorably against the state-of-the-art trackers using either handcrafted or deep CNN features."}}

Such problem setting generally is practical and valuable considering that it is feasible to collect unpaired noisy and clean images in most real-world applications. And we further assume that the noise can be signal dependent but is spatially uncorrelated. In order to facilitate unpaired learning of denoising network, this paper presents a two-stage scheme by incorporating self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation. For self-supervised learning, we suggest a dilated blind-spot network (D-BSN) to learn denoising solely from real noisy images. Due to the spatial independence of noise, we adopt a network by stacking 1x1 convolution layers to estimate the noise level map for each image. Both the D-BSN and image-specific noise model (CNN\\_est) can be jointly trained via maximizing the constrained log-likelihood. Given the output of D-BSN and estimated noise level map, improved denoising performance can be further obtained based on the Bayes' rule. As for knowledge distillation, we first apply the learned noise models to clean images to synthesize a paired set of training images, and use the real noisy images and the corresponding denoising results in the first stage to form another paired set. Then, the ultimate denoising model can be distilled by training an existing denoising network using these two paired sets. Experiments show that our unpaired learning method performs favorably on both synthetic noisy images and real-world noisy photographs in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation."}}
