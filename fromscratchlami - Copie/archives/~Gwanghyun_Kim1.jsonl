To mitigate these problems and enable faithful manipulation of real images, we propose a novel method, dubbed DiffusionCLIP, that performs textdriven image manipulation using diffusion models. Based on full inversion capability and high-quality image generation power of recent diffusion models, our method performs zeroshot image manipulation successfully even between unseen domains and takes another step towards general application by manipulating images from a widely varying ImageNet dataset.

This situation poses the problem that the chest x-rays collected annually in hospitals cannot be used due to the lack of manual labeling by experts, especially in deprived areas. To address this, here we present a novel deep learning framework that uses knowledge distillation through self-supervised learning and self-training, which shows that the performance of the original model trained with a small number of labels can be gradually improved with more unlabeled data. Experimental results show that the proposed framework maintains impressive robustness against a real-world environment and has general applicability to several diagnostic tasks such as tuberculosis, pneumothorax, and COVID-19. Notably, we demonstrated that our model performs even better than those trained with the same amount of labeled data. The proposed framework has a great potential for medical imaging, where plenty of data is accumulated every year, but ground truth annotations are expensive to obtain."}}

For example, this enables neural network training for COVID-19 diagnosis on chest X-ray (CXR) images without collecting patient CXR data across multiple hospitals. Unfortunately, the exchange of the weights quickly consumes the network bandwidth if highly expressive network architecture is employed. So-called split learning partially solves this problem by dividing a neural network into a client and a server part, so that the client part of the network takes up less extensive computation resources and bandwidth. However, it is not clear how to find the optimal split without sacrificing the overall network performance. To amalgamate these methods and thereby maximize their distinct strengths, here we show that the Vision Transformer, a recently developed deep learning architecture with straightforward decomposable configuration, is ideally suitable for split learning without sacrificing performance. Even under the non-independent and identically distributed data distribution which emulates a real collaboration between hospitals using CXR datasets from multiple sources, the proposed framework was able to attain performance comparable to data-centralized training. In addition, the proposed framework along with heterogeneous multi-task clients also improves individual task performances including the diagnosis of COVID-19, eliminating the need for sharing large weights with innumerable parameters. Our results affirm the suitability of Transformer for collaborative learning in medical imaging and pave the way forward for future real-world implementations."}}

This situation is suitable for vision transformer architecture that can exploit the abundant unlabeled data using pre-training. However, the direct use of existing vision transformer that uses the corpus generated by the ResNet is not optimal for correct feature embedding. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel vision Transformer by using the low-level CXR feature corpus that are obtained to extract the abnormal CXR features. Specifically, the backbone network is trained using large public datasets to obtain the abnormal features in routine diagnosis such as consolidation, glass-grass opacity (GGO), etc. Then, the embedded features from the backbone network are used as corpus for vision transformer training.

Although pixel-level lesion severity labels, e.g. lesion segmentation, can be the most excellent target to build a robust model, collecting enough data with such labels is difficult due to time and labor-intensive annotation tasks. Instead, array-based severity labeling that assigns integer scores on six subdivisions of lungs can be an alternative choice enabling the quick labeling. Several groups proposed deep learning algorithms that quantify the severity of COVID-19 using the array-based COVID-19 labels and localize the lesions with explainability maps. To further improve the accuracy and interpretability, here we propose a novel Vision Transformer tailored for both quantification of the severity and clinically applicable localization of the COVID-19 related lesions. Our model is trained in a weakly-supervised manner to generate the full probability maps from weak array-based labels. Furthermore, a novel progressive self-training method enables us to build a model with a small labeled dataset. The quantitative and qualitative analysis on the external testset demonstrates that our method shows comparable performance with radiologists for both tasks with stability in a real-world application."}}

This situation is ideally suited for the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, where a lot of unlabeled data can be used through structural modeling by the self-attention mechanism. However, the use of existing ViT is not optimal, since feature embedding through direct patch flattening or ResNet backbone in the standard ViT is not intended for CXR. To address this problem, here we propose a novel Vision Transformer that utilizes low-level CXR feature corpus obtained from a backbone network that extracts common CXR findings. Specifically, the backbone network is first trained with large public datasets to detect common abnormal findings such as consolidation, opacity, edema, etc. Then, the embedded features from the backbone network are used as corpora for a Transformer model for the diagnosis and the severity quantification of COVID-19.
