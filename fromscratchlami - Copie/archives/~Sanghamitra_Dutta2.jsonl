The corollary to this problem is the detection in-distribution (ID) samples, which is applicable to domain adaptation scenarios for augmenting a train set with ID samples from other data sets, or to continual learning for replay from the past. For both ID or OOD detection, we propose a principled yet simple approach of (empirically) estimating KL-Divergence, in its dual form, for a given test set w.r.t. a known set of ID samples in order to quantify the contribution of each test sample individually towards the divergence measure and\naccordingly detect it as OOD or ID. Our approach is compute-efficient and enjoys strong theoretical guarantees. For WideResnet101 and ViT-L-16, by considering ImageNet-1k dataset as the ID benchmark, we evaluate the proposed OOD detector on 51 test (OOD) datasets, and observe drastically and consistently lower false positive rates w.r.t. all the competitive methods. Moreover, the proposed ID detector is evaluated, using ECG and stock price datasets, for the task of data augmentation in domain adaptation and continual learning settings, and we observe higher efficacy compared to relevant baselines.\n"}}

This allows deep learning engineers to instantiate large models without having to worry about over-fitting. Despite its benefits, however, prior work has shown that over-parameterization can exacerbate bias against minority subgroups. Several fairness-constrained DNN training methods have been proposed to address this concern. Here, we critically examine MinDiff, a fairness-constrained training procedure implemented within TensorFlow's Responsible AI Toolkit, that aims to achieve Equality of Opportunity. We show that although MinDiff improves fairness for under-parameterized models, it is likely to be ineffective in the over-parameterized regime. This is because an overfit model with zero training loss is trivially group-wise fair on training data, creating an \u201cillusion of fairness,\u201d thus turning off the MinDiff optimization (this will apply to any disparity-based measures which care about errors or accuracy; while it won\u2019t apply to demographic parity). We find that within specified fairness constraints, under-parameterized MinDiff models can even have lower error compared to their over-parameterized counterparts (despite baseline over-parameterized models having lower error compared to their under-parameterized counterparts). We further show that MinDiff optimization is very sensitive to choice of batch size in the under-parameterized regime. Thus, fair model training using MinDiff requires time-consuming hyper-parameter searches. Finally, we suggest using previously proposed regularization techniques, viz. L2, early stopping and flooding in conjunction with MinDiff to train fair over-parameterized models. In our results, over-parameterized models trained using MinDiff+regularization with standard batch sizes are fairer than their under-parameterized counterparts, suggesting that at the very least, regularizers should be integrated into fair deep learning flows, like MinDiff."}}

Towards finding robust counterfactuals, existing literature often assumes that the original model $m$ and the new model $M$ are bounded in the parameter space, i.e., $\\|\\text{Params}(M){-}\\text{Params}(m)\\|{<}\\Delta$. However, models can often change significantly in the parameter space with little to no change in their predictions or accuracy on the given dataset. In this work, we introduce a mathematical abstraction termed \\emph{naturally-occurring} model change, which allows for arbitrary changes in the parameter space such that the change in predictions on points that lie on the data manifold is limited. Next, we propose a measure -- that we call \\emph{Stability} -- to quantify the robustness of counterfactuals to potential model changes for differentiable models, e.g., neural networks. Our main contribution is to show that counterfactuals with sufficiently high value of \\emph{Stability} as defined by our measure will remain valid after potential ``naturally-occurring'' model changes with high probability (leveraging concentration bounds for Lipschitz function of independent Gaussians). Since our quantification depends on the local Lipschitz constant around a data point which is not always available, we also examine practical relaxations of our proposed measure and demonstrate experimentally how they can be incorporated to find robust counterfactuals for neural networks that are close, realistic, and remain valid after potential model changes. This work also has interesting connections with model multiplicity, also known as, the Rashomon effect."}}

There is a lack of understanding of the interplay between global and local fairness in FL, and if and when one implies the other. To address this gap, we leverage a body of work in information theory called partial information decomposition (PID) which first identifies three sources of unfairness in FL, namely, \\emph{Unique Disparity}, \\emph{Redundant Disparity}, and \\emph{Masked Disparity}. Using canonical examples, we demonstrate how these three disparities contribute to global and local fairness. This decomposition helps us derive fundamental limits and trade-offs between global or local fairness, particularly under data heterogeneity, as well as, derive conditions under which one implies the other. We also present experimental results on benchmark datasets to support our theoretical findings. This work offers a more nuanced understanding of the sources of disparity in FL that can inform the use of local disparity mitigation techniques, and their convergence and effectiveness when deployed in practice."}}

This process is often achieved with accuracy as an objective, and can be cumbersome and computationally expensive for large-scale datasets. Several additional model performance characteristics such as fairness and robustness are of importance for model development. As regulations are driving the need for more trustworthy models, deployed models need to be corrected for model characteristics associated with responsible artificial intelligence. When feature selection is done with respect to one model performance characteristic (eg. accuracy), feature selection with secondary model performance characteristics (eg. fairness and robustness) as objectives would require going through the computationally expensive selection process from scratch. In this paper, we introduce the problem of feature reselection, so that features can be selected with respect to secondary model performance characteristics efficiently even after a feature selection process has been done with respect to a primary objective. To address this problem, we propose REFRESH, a method to reselect features so that additional constraints that are desirable towards model performance can be achieved without having to train several new models. REFRESH\u2019s underlying algorithm is a novel technique using SHAP values and correlation analysis that can approximate for the predictions of a model without having to train these models. Empirical evaluations on three datasets, including a large-scale loan defaulting dataset show that REFRESH can help find alternate models with better model characteristics efficiently. We also discuss the need for reselection and REFRESH based on regulation desiderata."}}

This review article aims to provide a survey of some recent and emerging applications of partial information decomposition in algorithmic fairness and explainability, which are of immense importance given the growing use of machine learning in high-stakes applications. For instance, PID, in conjunction with causality, has enabled the disentanglement of the non-exempt disparity which is the part of the overall disparity that is not due to critical job necessities. Similarly, in federated learning, PID has enabled the quantification of tradeoffs between local and global disparities. We introduce a taxonomy that highlights the role of PID in algorithmic fairness and explainability in three main avenues: (i) Quantifying the legally non-exempt disparity for auditing or training; (ii) Explaining contributions of various features or data points; and (iii) Formalizing tradeoffs among different disparities in federated learning. Lastly, we also review techniques for the estimation of PID measures, as well as discuss some challenges and future directions."}}

Although sensitive attributes are typically assumed to be known during training, they may not be available in practice due to privacy and other logistical concerns. Recent work has sought to train fair models without sensitive attributes on training data. However, these methods need extensive hyper-parameter tuning to achieve good results, and hence assume that sensitive attributes are known on validation data. However, this assumption too might not be practical. Here, we propose Antigone, a framework to train fair classifiers without access to sensitive attributes on either training or validation data. Instead, we generate pseudo sensitive attributes on the validation data by training a biased classifier and using the classifier's incorrectly (correctly) labeled examples as proxies for minority (majority) groups. Since fairness metrics like demographic parity, equal opportunity and subgroup accuracy can be estimated to within a proportionality constant even with noisy sensitive attribute information, we show theoretically and empirically that these proxy labels can be used to maximize fairness under average accuracy constraints. Key to our results is a principled approach to select the hyper-parameters of the biased classifier in a completely unsupervised fashion (meaning without access to ground truth sensitive attributes) that minimizes the gap between fairness estimated using noisy versus ground-truth sensitive labels."}}
