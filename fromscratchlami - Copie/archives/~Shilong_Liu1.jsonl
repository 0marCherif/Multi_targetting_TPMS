DINO improves over previous DETR-like models in performance and efficiency by using a contrastive way for denoising training, a look forward twice scheme for box prediction, and a mixed query selection method for anchor initialization. DINO achieves 49.4AP in 12 epochs and 51.3AP in 24 epochs on COCO with a ResNet-50 backbone and multi-scale features, yielding a significant improvement of +6.0AP and +2.7AP, respectively, compared to DN-DETR, the previous best DETR-like model. DINO scales well in both model size and data size. Without bells and whistles, after pre-training on the Objects365 dataset with a SwinL backbone, DINO obtains the best results on both COCO val2017 (63.2AP) and test-dev (63.3AP) with model size under 1 billion parameters. Compared to other models on the leaderboard, DINO significantly reduces its model size and pre-training data size while achieving better results. The code will be available."}}

Different from previous one-stage methods, ED-Pose re-considers this task as two explicit box detection processes with a unified representation and regression supervision. First, we introduce a human detection decoder from encoded tokens to extract global features. It can provide a good initialization for the latter keypoint detection, making the training process converge fast. Second, to bring in contextual information near keypoints, we regard pose estimation as a keypoint box detection problem to learn both box positions and contents for each keypoint. A human-to-keypoint detection decoder adopts an interactive learning strategy between human and keypoint features to further enhance global and local feature aggregation. In general, ED-Pose is conceptually simple without post-processing and dense heatmap supervision. It demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency compared with both two-stage and one-stage methods. Notably, explicit box detection boosts the pose estimation performance by 4.5 AP on COCO and 9.9 AP on CrowdPose. For the first time, as a fully end-to-end framework with a L1 regression loss, ED-Pose surpasses heatmap-based Top-down methods under the same backbone by 1.2 AP on COCO and achieves the state-of-the-art with 76.6 AP on CrowdPose without bells and whistles.

We show that the slow convergence results from the instability of bipartite graph matching which causes inconsistent optimization goals in early training stages. To address this issue, except for the Hungarian loss, our method additionally feeds ground-truth bounding boxes with noises into Transformer decoder and trains the model to reconstruct the original boxes, which effectively reduces the bipartite graph matching difficulty and leads to a faster convergence. Our method is universal and can be easily plugged into any DETR-like methods by adding dozens of lines of code to achieve a remarkable improvement. As a result, our DN-DETR results in a remarkable improvement (+1.9AP) under the same setting and achieves the best result (AP 43.4 and 48.6 with 12 and 50 epochs of training respectively) among DETR-like methods with ResNet-50 backbone.

This survey is inspired by the remarkable progress in both computer vision and natural language processing, and recent trends shifting from single modality processing to multiple modality comprehension. We summarize the development in this field into three time periods, namely task-specific methods, vision-language pre-training (VLP) methods, and larger models empowered by large-scale weakly-labeled data. We first take some common VL tasks as examples to introduce the development of task-specific methods. Then we focus on VLP methods and comprehensively review key components of the model structures and training methods. After that, we show how recent work utilizes large-scale raw image-text data to learn language-aligned visual representations that generalize better on zero or few shot learning tasks. Finally, we discuss some potential future trends towards modality cooperation, unified representation, and knowledge incorporation. We believe that this review will be of help for researchers and practitioners of AI and ML, especially those interested in computer vision and natural language processing."}}
