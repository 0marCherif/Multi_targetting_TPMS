A most successful tactic for test-time adaptation conducts further optimization on the target data using the predictions by the source-trained model. However, due to domain shifts, the source-trained model predictions themselves can be largely inaccurate, which results in a model misspecified to the target data and therefore damages their adaptation ability. In this paper, we address test-time adaptation from a probabilistic perspective. We formulate model adaption as a probabilistic inference problem, which incorporates the uncertainty into source model predictions by modeling pseudo labels as distributions. Based on the probabilistic formalism, we propose variational pseudo labels that explore the information of neighboring target samples to improve pseudo labels and achieve a model better specified to target data. By a meta-learning paradigm, we train our model by simulating domain shifts and the test-time adaptation procedure. In doing so, our model learns the ability to generate more accurate pseudo-label distributions and to adapt to new domains. Experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal. "}}

Inspired by the human ability to recall past learning experiences from the brain\u2019s memory, we propose an episodic memory optimization for meta-learning, which we call EMO, that retains the gradient history of past experienced tasks in external memory. It enables few-shot learning in a memory-augmented way by leveraging the meta-learning setting and learns to retain and recall the learning process of past training tasks for gradient descent optimization. By doing so, EMO nudges the parameter updates in the right direction, even when the gradients provided by a limited number of examples are uninformative. Additionally, we prove theoretically that our algorithm converges for smooth, strongly convex objectives. EMO is generic, flexible, and model agnostic, making it a simple plug-and-play optimizer seamlessly embedded into existing optimization-based meta-learning approaches. Empirically, EMO scales well with most of the few-shot classification benchmarks, and our experiments show that the optimization-based meta-learning method enjoys accelerated convergence and improved performance with EMO."}}

Hence, individual tasks do not contain complete training data for the categories in the test set. To generalize to such test data, it is crucial for individual tasks to leverage knowledge from related tasks. To this end, we propose learning an association graph to transfer knowledge among tasks for missing classes. We construct the association graph with nodes representing tasks, classes and instances, and encode the relationships among the nodes in the edges to guide their mutual knowledge transfer. By message passing on the association graph, our model enhances the categorical information of each instance, making it more discriminative. To avoid spurious correlations between task and class nodes in the graph, we introduce an assignment entropy maximization that encourages each class node to balance its edge weights. This enables all tasks to fully utilize the categorical information from related tasks.

To tackle this issue, we propose a Neighbor Transformer Network, or NFormer, which explicitly models interactions across all input images, thus suppressing outlier features and leading to more robust representations overall. As modelling interactions between enormous amount of images is a massive task with lots of distractors, NFormer introduces two novel modules, the Landmark Agent Attention, and the Reciprocal Neighbor Softmax. Specifically, the Landmark Agent Attention efficiently models the relation map between images by a low-rank factorization with a few landmarks in feature space. Moreover, the Reciprocal Neighbor Softmax achieves sparse attention to relevant -rather than all- neighbors only, which alleviates interference of irrelevant representations and further relieves the computational burden.

In this paper, we propose spherical zero-shot learning (SZSL) to address the major challenges in ZSL. By decoupling the similarity metric in the spherical embedding space into radius and angle, our SZSL can map classes to hyperspherical surfaces of different radiuses, which greatly increases its flexibility. Specifically, we introduce the spherical alignment on angles to spread classes as uniformly as possible to alleviate the hubness problem and simultaneously preserve the inter-class semantic structure to make the alignment more reasonable. We also introduce the spherical calibration with a minimum entropy based regularizer by adopting a larger radius for unseen classes than seen classes to reduce the prediction bias. Extensive experiments on five middle-scale benchmarks and large-scale ImageNet dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently achieves superior performance for the traditional and generalized settings of ZSL."}}

As they can encode contextual data in the network's function space, they offer a new way to model task relatedness in multi-task learning. To study its potential, we develop multi-task neural processes, a new variant of neural processes for multi-task learning. In particular, we propose to explore transferable knowledge from related tasks in the function space to provide inductive bias for improving each individual task. To do so, we derive the function priors in a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework, which enables each task to incorporate the shared knowledge provided by related tasks into its context of the prediction function. Our multi-task neural processes methodologically expand the scope of vanilla neural processes and provide a new way of exploring task relatedness in function spaces for multi-task learning. The proposed multi-task neural processes are capable of learning multiple tasks with limited labeled data and in the presence of domain shift. We perform extensive experimental evaluations on several benchmarks for the multi-task regression and classification tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-task neural processes in transferring useful knowledge among tasks for multi-task learning and superior performance in multi-task classification and brain image segmentation."}}
