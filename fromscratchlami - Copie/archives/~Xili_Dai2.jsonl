Autoencoders often use generic deep networks as the encoder or decoder, which are difficult to interpret, and the learned representations lack clear structure. In this work, we make the explicit assumption that the image distribution is generated from a multi-stage sparse deconvolution. The corresponding inverse map, which we use as an encoder, is a multi-stage convolution sparse coding (CSC), with each stage obtained from unrolling an optimization algorithm for solving the corresponding (convexified) sparse coding program. To avoid computational difficulties in minimizing distributional distance between the real and generated images, we utilize the recent closed-loop transcription (CTRL) framework that optimizes the rate reduction of the learned sparse representations. Conceptually, our method has high-level connections to score-matching methods such as diffusion models. Empirically, our framework demonstrates competitive performance on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K, compared to existing autoencoding and generative methods under fair conditions. Even with simpler networks and fewer computational resources, our method demonstrates high visual quality in regenerated images. More surprisingly, the learned autoencoder performs well on unseen datasets. Our method enjoys several side benefits, including more structured and interpretable representations, more stable convergence, and scalability to large datasets. Our method is arguably the first to demonstrate that a concatenation of multiple convolution sparse coding/decoding layers leads to an interpretable and effective autoencoder for modeling the distribution of large-scale natural image datasets."}}

While most existing unsupervised learning approaches focus on a representation for only one of these two goals, we show that a unified representation can enjoy the mutual benefits of having both. Such a representation is attainable by generalizing the recently proposed closed-loop transcription framework, known as CTRL, to the unsupervised setting. This entails solving a constrained maximin game over a rate reduction objective that expands features of all samples while compressing features of augmentations of each sample. Through this process, we see discriminative low-dimensional structures emerge in the resulting representations.  Under comparable experimental conditions and network complexities, we demonstrate that these structured representations enable classification performance close to state-of-the-art unsupervised discriminative representations, and conditionally generated image quality significantly higher than that of state-of-the-art unsupervised generative models."}}

Our approach is based on establishing a {\\em closed-loop transcription} between the  classes and a corresponding set of subspaces, known as a linear discriminative representation, in a low-dimensional feature space. Our method is simpler than existing approaches for incremental learning, and more efficient in terms of model size, storage, and computation: it requires only a single, fixed-capacity autoencoding network with a feature space that is used for both discriminative and generative purposes. Network parameters are optimized simultaneously without architectural manipulations, by solving a constrained minimax game between the encoding and decoding maps over a single rate reduction-based objective. Experimental results show that our method can effectively alleviate catastrophic forgetting, achieving significantly better performance than prior work of generative replay on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-50, despite requiring fewer resources."}}

Most previous work relies on the cuboid shape prior. This paper considers a more general indoor assumption, i.e., the room layout consists of a single ceiling, a single floor, and several vertical walls. To this end, we first employ Convolutional Neural Networks to detect planes and vertical lines between adjacent walls. Meanwhile, estimating the 3D parameters for each plane. Then, a simple yet effective geometric reasoning method is adopted to achieve room layout reconstruction. Furthermore, we optimize the 3D plane parameters to reconstruct a geometrically consistent room layout between planes and lines.
