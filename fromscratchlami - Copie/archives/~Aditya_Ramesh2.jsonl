Handcrafting an appropriate historical context is an attractive alternative to transform a nonstationary problem into a stationary problem that can be solved efficiently. However, even a carefully designed historical context may introduce spurious relationships or lack a convenient representation of crucial information. In order to address these issues, we propose an approach that learns to represent the relevant context for a decision based solely on the raw history of interactions between the agent and the environment. This approach relies on a combination of features extracted by recurrent neural networks with a contextual linear bandit algorithm based on posterior sampling. Our experiments on a diverse selection of contextual and noncontextual nonstationary problems show that our recurrent approach consistently outperforms its feedforward counterpart, which requires handcrafted historical contexts, while being more widely applicable than conventional nonstationary bandit algorithms. Although it is very difficult to provide theoretical performance guarantees for our new approach, we also prove a novel regret bound for linear posterior sampling with measurement error that may serve as a foundation for future theoretical work."}}

Using context commands of the form \"generate a policy that achieves a desired expected return,\" our NN generators combine powerful exploration of parameter space with generalization across commands to iteratively find better and better policies. A form of weight-sharing HyperNetworks and policy embeddings scales our method to generate deep NNs.

Recent prominent approaches are based on state novelty or variants of artificial curiosity. However, directly applying them to partially observable environments can be ineffective and lead to premature dissipation of intrinsic rewards. Here we propose random curiosity with general value functions (RC-GVF), a novel intrinsic reward function that draws upon connections between these distinct approaches. Instead of using only the current observation\u2019s novelty or a curiosity bonus for failing to predict precise environment dynamics, RC-GVF derives intrinsic rewards through predicting temporally extended general value functions. We demonstrate that this improves exploration in a hard-exploration diabolical lock problem. Furthermore, RC-GVF significantly outperforms previous methods in the absence of ground-truth episodic counts in the partially observable MiniGrid environments. Panoramic observations on MiniGrid further boost RC-GVF's performance such that it is competitive to baselines exploiting privileged information in form of episodic counts."}}

In partially observable settings where observations look alike, state novelty can lead to intrinsic reward vanishing prematurely. On the other hand, curiosity-based approaches require modeling precise environment dynamics which are potentially quite complex. Here we propose random curiosity with general value functions (RC-GVF), an intrinsic reward function that connects state novelty and artificial curiosity. Instead of predicting the entire environment dynamics, RC-GVF predicts temporally extended values through general value functions (GVFs) and uses the prediction error as an intrinsic reward. In this way, our approach generalizes a popular approach called random network distillation (RND) by encouraging behavioral diversity and reduces the need for additional maximum entropy regularization. Our experiments on four procedurally generated partially observable environments indicate that our approach is competitive to RND and could be beneficial in environments that require behavioural exploration."}}
