However, higher-order relations in practice contain complex patterns and are often highly irregular. So, it is often challenging to design an HNN that suffices to express those relations while keeping computational efficiency. Inspired by hypergraph diffusion algorithms, this work proposes a new HNN architecture named ED-HNN, which provably approximates any continuous equivariant hypergraph diffusion operators that can model a wide range of higher-order relations. ED-HNN can be implemented efficiently by combining star expansions of hypergraphs with standard message passing neural networks. ED-HNN further shows great superiority in processing heterophilic hypergraphs and constructing deep models. We evaluate ED-HNN for node classification on nine real-world hypergraph datasets. ED-HNN uniformly outperforms the best baselines over these nine datasets and achieves more than 2%$\\uparrow$ in prediction accuracy over four datasets therein.

These networks typically evolve according to certain laws, such as the law of triadic closure, which is universal in social networks. Inductive representation learning of temporal networks should be able to capture such laws and further be applied to systems that follow the same laws but have not been unseen during the training stage. Previous works in this area depend on either network node identities or rich edge attributes and typically fail to extract these laws. Here, we propose {\\em Causal Anonymous Walks (CAWs)} to inductively represent a temporal network. CAWs are extracted by temporal random walks and work as automatic retrieval of temporal network motifs to represent network dynamics while avoiding the time-consuming selection and counting of those motifs. CAWs adopt a novel anonymization strategy that replaces node identities with the hitting counts of the nodes based on a set of sampled walks to keep the method inductive, and simultaneously establish the correlation between motifs. We further propose a neural-network model CAW-N to encode CAWs, and pair it with a CAW sampling strategy with constant memory and time cost to support online training and inference. CAW-N is evaluated to predict links over 6 real temporal networks and uniformly outperforms previous SOTA methods by averaged 15\\% AUC gain in the inductive setting. CAW-N also outperforms previous methods in 5 out of the 6 networks in the transductive setting."}}

As texts always contain a large proportion of task-irrelevant words, accurate alignment between aspects and their sentimental descriptions is the most crucial and challenging step. State-of-the-art approaches are mainly based on word-level attention learned from recurrent neural network variants (e.g., LSTM) or graph neural networks. From another view, these methods essentially weight and aggregate all possible alignments. However, this mechanism heavily relies on large-scale supervision training: without enough labels, it could easily overfit with difficulty in generalization. To address this challenge, we propose SentRL, a reinforcement learning-based framework for aspect-based sentiment classification. In this framework, input texts are transformed into their dependency graphs. Then, an agent is deployed to walk on the graphs, explores paths from target aspect nodes to their potential sentimental regions, and differentiates the effectiveness of different paths. By limiting the agent's exploration budget, our method encourages the agent to skip task-irrelevant information and focus on the most effective paths for alignment purpose. Our method considerably reduces the impact of task-irrelevant words and improves generalization performance. Compared with competitive baseline methods, our approach achieves the highest performance on public benchmark datasets with up to $3.7\\%$ improvement. "}}
