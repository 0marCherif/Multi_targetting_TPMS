To drive innovation in this area, we setup a community-wide challenge using the largest available dataset of its kind to assess nuclear segmentation and cellular composition. Our challenge, named CoNIC, stimulated the development of reproducible algorithms for cellular recognition with real-time result inspection on public leaderboards. We conducted an extensive post-challenge analysis based on the top-performing models using 1,658 whole-slide images of colon tissue. With around 700 million detected nuclei per model, associated features were used for dysplasia grading and survival analysis, where we demonstrated that the challenge's improvement over the previous state-of-the-art led to significant boosts in downstream performance. Our findings also suggest that eosinophils and neutrophils play an important role in the tumour microevironment. We release challenge models and WSI-level results to foster the development of further methods for biomarker discovery."}}

Recently, the preference for unimodal distributions in the output space has been incorporated into models and loss functions to account for such ordering information. However, current approaches rely on heuristics that lack a theoretical foundation. Here, we propose two new approaches to incorporate the preference for unimodal distributions into the predictive model. We analyse the set of unimodal distributions in the probability simplex and establish fundamental properties. We then propose a new architecture that imposes unimodal distributions and a new loss term that relies on the notion of projection in a set to promote unimodality. Experiments show the new architecture achieves top-2 performance, while the proposed new loss term is very competitive while maintaining high unimodality."}}

Nowadays, applications of deep learning (DL) methods to diagnose cancer from whole-slide images (WSI) are, more than ever, a reality within different research groups. Nonetheless, the development of these systems was limited by a myriad of constraints regarding the lack of training samples, the scaling difficulties, the opaqueness of DL methods, and, more importantly, the lack of clinical validation. As such, we propose a system designed specifically for the diagnosis of colorectal samples. The construction of such a system consisted of four stages: (1) a careful data collection and annotation process, which resulted in one of the largest WSI colorectal samples datasets; (2) the design of an interpretable mixed-supervision scheme to leverage the domain knowledge introduced by pathologists through spatial annotations; (3) the development of an effective sampling approach based on the expected severeness of each tile, which decreased the computation cost by a factor of almost 6x; (4) the creation of a prototype that integrates the full set of features of the model to be evaluated in clinical practice. During these stages, the proposed method was evaluated in four separate test sets, two of them are external and completely independent. On the largest of those sets, the proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 93.44%. DL for colorectal samples is a few steps closer to stop being research exclusive and to become fully integrated in clinical practice."}}
