Previous methods generate adversarial patches by either optimizing their perturbation values while fixing the position on the image or manipulating the position while fixing the content of the patch.\nIn this paper, we propose a method to simultaneously optimize the position and perturbation to generate transferable adversarial patches, and thus obtain high attack success rates in the black-box setting. We adjust the transferability by taking the position, weights of surrogate models in the ensemble attack and the attack step size as parameters, and utilize the reinforcement learning framework to simultaneously solve these parameters based on the reward information obtained from the target model with a small number of queries.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on the Face Recognition (FR) task, and the results on four representative FR models demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the attack success rate and the query efficiency. Besides, experiments on the commercial FR service and physical environments confirm the practical application value of our method."}}
