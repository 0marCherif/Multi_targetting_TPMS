To address these limitations, two new modules are proposed in this work. First, a contextual feature transformation module is introduced in the generator to ensure that the generated feature encoding of either object or stuff is aware of other co-existing objects/stuff in the scene.

The generated face image given a target age code is expected to be age-sensitive reflected by bio-plausible transformations of shape and texture, while being identity preserving. This is extremely challenging because the shape and texture characteristics of a face undergo separate and highly nonlinear transformations w.r.t. age. Most recent LFS models are based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) whereby age code conditional transformations are applied to a latent face representation. They benefit greatly from the recent advancements of GANs. However, without explicitly disentangling their latent representations into the texture, shape and identity factors, they are fundamentally limited in modeling the nonlinear age-related transformation on texture and shape whilst preserving identity. In this work, a novel LFS model is proposed to disentangle the key face characteristics including shape, texture and identity so that the unique shape and texture age transformations can be modeled effectively. This is achieved by extracting shape, texture and identity features separately from an encoder. Critically, two transformation modules, one conditional convolution based and the other channel attention based, are designed for modeling the nonlinear shape and texture feature transformations respectively. This is to accommodate their rather distinct aging processes and ensure that our synthesized images are both age-sensitive and identity preserving. Extensive experiments show that our LFS model is clearly superior to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

However, it remains a challenge due to the behavior of a target agent being affected by other agents dynamically and there being more than one socially possible paths the agent could take. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named Dynamic Context Encoder Network (DCENet). In our framework, first, the spatial context between agents is explored by using self-attention architectures. Then, the two-stream encoders are trained to learn temporal context between steps by taking the respective observed trajectories and the extracted dynamic spatial context as input. The spatial-temporal context is encoded into a latent space using a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) module. Finally, a set of future trajectories for each agent is predicted conditioned on the learned spatial-temporal context by sampling from the latent space, repeatedly. DCENet is evaluated on one of the most popular challenging benchmarks for trajectory forecasting Trajnet and reports a new state-of-the-art performance. It also demonstrates superior performance evaluated on the benchmark inD for mixed traffic at intersections. A series of ablation studies is conducted to validate the effectiveness of each proposed module. Our code is available at https://github.com/wtliao/DCENet."}}

The best performing works to date are based on exploiting the context surrounding objects or relations, e.g.no, by passing information among objects. In these approaches, to transform the representation of source objects is a critical process for extracting information for the use by target objects. In this paper, we argue that a source object should give what target object needs and give different objects different information rather than contributing common information to all targets. To achieve this goal, we propose a Target-Tailored Source-Transformation (TTST) method to propagate information among object proposals and relations. Particularly, for a source object proposal which will contribute information to other target objects, we transform the source object feature to the target object feature domain by simultaneously taking both the source and target into account. We further explore more powerful representation by integrating language prior with visual context in the transformation for scene graph generation. By doing so the target object is able to extract target-specific information from source object and source relation accordingly to refine its representation. Our framework is validated on the Visual Genome benchmark and demonstrated its state-of-the-art performance for the scene graph generation. The experimental results show that the performance of object detection and visual relationship detection are promoted mutually by our method. The code will be released upon acceptance."}}
