With the Look, Listen, and Parse dataset (LLP), we investigate the under-explored unaligned setting, where the goal is to recognize audio and visual events in a video with only weak labels observed. Such weak video-level labels only tell what events happen without knowing the modality they are perceived (audio, visual, or both). To enhance learning in this challenging setting, we incorporate large-scale contrastively pre-trained models as the modality teachers. A simple, effective, and generic method, termed Visual-Audio Label Elaboration (VALOR), is innovated to harvest modality labels for the training events. Empirical studies show that the harvested labels significantly improve an attentional baseline by 8.0 in average F-score (Type@AV). Surprisingly, we found that modality-independent teachers outperform their modality-fused counterparts since they are noise-proof from the other potentially unaligned modality. Moreover, our best model achieves the new state-of-the-art on all metrics of LLP by a substantial margin (+5.4 F-score for Type@AV). VALOR is further generalized to Audio-Visual Event Localization and achieves the new state-of-the-art as well. Code is available at: https://github.com/Franklin905/VALOR."}}

However, when it comes to producing images with complex scenes, how to properly describe both image global structures and object details remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present Frido, a Feature Pyramid Diffusion model performing a multi-scale coarse-to-fine denoising process for image synthesis. Our model decomposes an input image into scale-dependent vector quantized features, followed by a coarse-to-fine gating for producing image output. During the above multi-scale representation learning stage, additional input conditions like text, scene graph, or image layout can be further exploited. Thus, Frido can be also applied for conditional or cross-modality image synthesis. We conduct extensive experiments over various unconditioned and conditional image generation tasks, ranging from text-to-image synthesis, layout-to-image, scene-graph-to-image, to label-to-image. More specifically, we achieved state-of-the-art FID scores on five benchmarks, namely layout-to-image on COCO and OpenImages, scene-graph-to-image on COCO and Visual Genome, and label-to-image on COCO."}}

However, despite their success, text descriptions often struggle to adequately convey detailed controls, even when composed of long and complex texts. Moreover, recent studies have also shown that these models face challenges in understanding such complex texts and generating the corresponding images. Therefore, there is a growing need to enable more control modes beyond text description. In this paper, we introduce Uni-ControlNet, a novel approach that allows for the simultaneous utilization of different local controls (e.g., edge maps, depth map, segmentation masks) and global controls (e.g., CLIP image embeddings) in a flexible and composable manner within one model. Unlike existing methods, Uni-ControlNet only requires the fine-tuning of two additional adapters upon frozen pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, eliminating the huge cost of training from scratch. Moreover, thanks to some dedicated adapter designs, Uni-ControlNet only necessitates a constant number (i.e., 2) of adapters, regardless of the number of local or global controls used. This not only reduces the fine-tuning costs and model size, making it more suitable for real-world deployment, but also facilitate composability of different conditions. Through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, Uni-ControlNet demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in terms of controllability, generation quality and composability.

However, they tend to struggle when deployed in an unseen environment. This lack of generalizability is due to the agent's insensitivity to subtle changes in natural language instructions. To mitigate this issue, we propose explicitly aligning the agent's hidden states with the instructions via contrastive learning. Nevertheless, the semantic gap between high-level language instructions and the agent's low-level action space remains an obstacle. Therefore, we further introduce a novel concept of meta-actions to bridge the gap. Meta-actions are ubiquitous action patterns that can be parsed from the original action sequence. These patterns represent higher-level semantics that are intuitively aligned closer to the instructions. When meta-actions are applied as additional training signals, the agent generalizes better to unseen environments. Compared to a strong multi-modal Transformer baseline, we achieve a significant 4.5% absolute gain in success rate in unseen environments of ALFRED Embodied Instruction Following. Additional analysis shows that the contrastive objective and meta-actions are complementary in achieving the best results, and the resulting agent better aligns its states with corresponding instructions, making it more suitable for real-world embodied agents.

While single-view reconstruction yields visually appealing results, it can deviate significantly from the actual object, especially on unseen sides. Additional views improve reconstruction fidelity but necessitate known camera poses. However, assuming the availability of pose may be unrealistic, and existing pose estimators fail in sparse view scenarios. To address this, we harness a pre-trained novel view synthesis diffusion model, which embeds implicit knowledge about the geometry and appearance of diverse objects. Our strategy unfolds in three steps: (1) We invert the diffusion model for camera pose estimation instead of synthesizing novel views. (2) The diffusion model is fine-tuned using provided views and estimated poses, turned into a novel view synthesizer tailored for the target object. (3) Leveraging registered views and the fine-tuned diffusion model, we reconstruct the 3D object. Experiments demonstrate strong performance in both pose estimation and novel view synthesis. Moreover, iFusion seamlessly integrates with various reconstruction methods and enhances them."}}

Nevertheless, they lose diversity and complexity due to the constraints in collecting data. Meanwhile, models pre-trained with image-only or text-only data (we call them unimodal pretrained models) continue to flourish and impress the community. Compared to image-text pairs, unimodal data has less constraints during the collection process resulting in more diverse styles. A natural question is how to leverage unimodal pretrained models to benefit downstream VL tasks? Most existing works focus on fusing VL information in the expensive pre-training stage. They directly plug in unimodal pre-trained encoders into a VL framework and redo an additional pre-training step on paired image-text data. This causes additional computation expense and the unimodal pretrained knowledge might be forgotten. In this paper, we take a different route and investigate how to fuse VL information in the finetuning stage oaly. To directly transfer pretrained knowledge from unimodal models to belp downstream VL tasks, we propose $\\mathrm{ADVL}$, which avoids redoing any pre-training step and is generalizable to be applied of top of various VL models. To comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of ADVL, we conduct evaluation across three mostly recognized highly semantic VL benchmarks: VCR, VQA, and SNLI-VE under three settings, low-shot, full-shot and domainshifted settings. Results show that ADVL consistently improves the performance with different VL base models across all settings. It even achieves state-of-theart (SOTA) performance on VCR among models pre-trained with image-text data and delivers competitive results on VQA and SNLI-VE, Based on our analysis, we also discover that ADVL can improve the robustness of VL models and regulate them to better use vision information."}}

While these datasets reach an order of 10 million samples, the labor cost is prohibitive to scale further. Conversely, unimodal encoders are pretrained with simpler annotations that are less cost-prohibitive, achieving scales of hundreds of millions to billions. As a result, unimodal encoders have achieved state-of-art (SOTA) on many downstream tasks. However, challenges remain when applying to VL tasks. The pretraining data is not optimal for cross-modal architectures and requires heavy computational resources. In addition, unimodal architectures lack cross-modal interactions that have demonstrated significant benefits for VL tasks. Therefore, how to best leverage pretrained unimodal encoders for VL tasks is still an area of active research. In this work, we propose a method to leverage unimodal vision and text encoders for VL tasks that augment existing VL approaches while conserving computational complexity. Specifically, we propose Multimodal Adaptive Distillation (MAD), which adaptively distills useful knowledge from pretrained encoders to cross-modal VL encoders. Second, to better capture nuanced impacts on VL task performance, we introduce an evaluation protocol that includes Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), Visual Entailment (SNLI-VE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), across a variety of data constraints and conditions of domain shift. Experiments demonstrate that MAD leads to consistent gains in the low-shot, domain-shifted, and fully-supervised conditions on VCR, SNLI-VE, and VQA, achieving SOTA performance on VCR compared to other single models pretrained with image-text data. Finally, MAD outperforms concurrent works utilizing pretrained vision encoder from CLIP. Code will be made available."}}
