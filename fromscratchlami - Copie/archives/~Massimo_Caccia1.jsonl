TACRL combines the difficulties of partially observable RL (due to task agnosticism) and the challenges of continual learning (CL), which involves learning on a non-stationary sequence of tasks. As such, TACRL is important in real-world applications where agents must continuously adapt to changing environments. Our focus is on a previously unexplored and straightforward baseline for TACRL called replay-based recurrent RL (3RL). This approach augments an RL algorithm with recurrent mechanisms to mitigate partial observability and experience replay mechanisms to prevent catastrophic forgetting in CL. We pose a counterintuitive hypothesis that 3RL could outperform its soft upper bounds prescribed by previous literature: multi-task learning (MTL) methods that do not have to deal with non-stationary data distributions, as well as task-aware methods that can operate under full observability. Specifically, we believe that the challenges that arise in certain training regimes could be best overcome by 3RL enabled by its ability to perform \\emph{fast adaptation}, compared to task-aware approaches, which focus on task memorization.\nWe extensively test our hypothesis by performing a large number of experiments on synthetic data as well as continuous-action multi-task and continual learning benchmarks where our results provide strong evidence that validates our hypothesis.

An even more ambitious goal is to build models that never stop adapting, and that become increasingly more efficient through time by suitably transferring the accrued knowledge. Beyond the study of the actual learning algorithm and model architecture, there are several hurdles towards our quest to build such models, such as the choice of learning protocol, metric of success and data needed to validate research hypotheses. In this work, we introduce the Never-Ending VIsual-classification Stream (NEVIS'22), a benchmark consisting of a stream of over 100 visual classification tasks, sorted chronologically and extracted from papers sampled uniformly from computer vision proceedings spanning the last three decades. The resulting stream reflects what the research community thought was meaningful at any point in time, and it serves as an ideal test bed to assess how well models can adapt to new tasks, and do so better and more efficiently as time goes by. Despite being limited to classification, the resulting stream has a rich diversity of tasks from OCR, to texture analysis, scene recognition, and so forth. The diversity is also reflected in the wide range of dataset sizes, spanning over four orders of magnitude. Overall, NEVIS'22 poses an unprecedented challenge for current sequential learning approaches due to the scale and diversity of tasks, yet with a low entry barrier as it is limited to a single modality and well understood supervised learning problems. Moreover, we provide a reference implementation including strong baselines and an evaluation protocol to compare methods in terms of their trade-off between accuracy and compute."}}

In this work, we investigate the factors that contribute to the performance differences between task-agnostic CL and multi-task (MTL) agents. We pose two hypotheses: (1) task-agnostic methods might provide advantages in settings with limited data, computation, or high dimensionality, and (2) faster adaptation may be particularly beneficial in continual learning settings, helping to mitigate the effects of catastrophic forgetting. To investigate these hypotheses, we introduce a replay-based recurrent reinforcement learning (3RL) methodology for task-agnostic CL agents. We assess 3RL on a synthetic task and the Meta-World benchmark, which includes 50 unique manipulation tasks. Our results demonstrate that 3RL outperforms baseline methods and can even surpass its multi-task equivalent in challenging settings with high dimensionality. We also show that the recurrent task-agnostic agent consistently outperforms or matches the performance of its transformer-based counterpart. These findings provide insights into the advantages of task-agnostic CL over task-aware MTL approaches and highlight the potential of task-agnostic methods in resource-constrained, high-dimensional, and multi-task environments."}}

In practice, a plethora of evaluation procedures (settings) and algorithmic solutions (methods) exist, each with their own potentially disjoint set of assumptions. This variety makes measuring progress in CL difficult. We propose a taxonomy of settings, where each setting is described as a set of assumptions. A tree-shaped hierarchy emerges from this view, where more general settings become the parents of those with more restrictive assumptions. This makes it possible to use inheritance to share and reuse research, as developing a method for a given setting also makes it directly applicable onto any of its children. We instantiate this idea as a publicly available software framework called Sequoia, which features a wide variety of settings from both the Continual Supervised Learning (CSL) and Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) domains. Sequoia also includes a growing suite of methods which are easy to extend and customize, in addition to more specialized methods from external libraries. We hope that this new paradigm and its first implementation can help unify and accelerate research in CL. You can help us grow the tree by visiting (this GitHub URL)."}}

Learning and then composing modules to solve different tasks provides an abstraction to address the principal challenges of CL including catastrophic forgetting, backward and forward transfer across tasks, and sub-linear model growth. We introduce local module composition (LMC), an approach to modular CL where each module is provided a local structural component that estimates a module\u2019s relevance to the input. Dynamic module composition is performed layer-wise based on local relevance scores. We demonstrate that agnosticity to task identities (IDs) arises from (local) structural learning that is module-specific as opposed to the task- and/or model-specific as in previous works, making LMC applicable to more CL settings compared to previous works. In addition, LMC also tracks statistics about the input distribution and adds new modules when outlier samples are detected. In the first set of experiments, LMC performs favorably compared to existing methods on the recent Continual Transfer-learning Benchmark without requiring task identities. In another study, we show that the locality of structural learning allows LMC to interpolate to related but unseen tasks (OOD), as well as to compose modular networks trained independently on different task sequences into a third modular network without any fine-tuning. Finally, in search for limitations of LMC we study it on more challenging sequences of 30 and 100 tasks, demonstrating that local module selection becomes much more challenging in presence of a large number of candidate modules. In this setting best performing LMC spawns much fewer modules compared to an oracle based baseline, however, it reaches a lower overall accuracy. The codebase is available under https://github.com/oleksost/LMC. "}}
