There have been many studies on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from one domain to another, e.g., from computer graphics to real images. However, there is still a gap in accuracy between UDA and supervised training on native domain data. It is arguably attributable to the class-level misalignment between the source and target domain data. To cope with this, we propose a method that applies adversarial training to align two feature distributions in the target domain. It uses a self-training framework to split the image into two regions (i.e., trusted and untrusted), which form two distributions to align in the feature space. We term this approach cross-region adaptation (CRA) to distinguish it from the previous methods of aligning different domain distributions, which we call cross-domain adaptation (CDA). CRA can be applied after any CDA method. Experimental results show that this always improves the accuracy of the combined CDA method."}}

Recent studies have tackled the problem using ALFRED, a well-designed dataset for the task, but achieved only very low accuracy. This paper proposes a new method, which outperforms the previous methods by a large margin. It is based on a combination of several new ideas. One is a two-stage interpretation of the provided instructions. The method first\nselects and interprets an instruction without using visual information, yielding a tentative action sequence prediction. It then integrates the prediction with the visual information etc., yielding the final prediction of an action and an object. As the object\u2019s class to interact is identified in the first stage, it can accurately select the correct object from the input image. Moreover, our method considers multiple egocentric views of the environment and extracts essential information by applying hierarchical attention conditioned on the current instruction. This contributes to the accurate prediction of actions for navigation. A preliminary version of the method won the ALFRED Challenge 2020. The\ncurrent version achieves the unseen environment\u2019s success rate of 4.45% with a single view, which is further improved to 8.37% with multiple views."}}

The Transformer has recently been extended and applied to several bi-modal tasks, yielding promising results. For visual dialog, it becomes necessary to consider interactions between three or more inputs, i.e., an image, a question, and a dialog history, or even its individual dialog components. In this paper, we present a neural architecture named Light-weight Transformer for Many Inputs (LTMI) that can efficiently deal with all the interactions between multiple such inputs in visual dialog. It has a block structure similar to the Transformer and employs the same design of attention computation, whereas it has only a small number of parameters, yet has sufficient representational power for the purpose. Assuming a standard setting of visual dialog, a layer built upon the proposed attention block has less than one-tenth of parameters as compared with its counterpart, a natural Transformer extension. The experimental results on the VisDial datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing improvements of the best NDCG score on the VisDial v1.0 dataset from 57.59 to 60.92 with a single model, from 64.47 to 66.53 with ensemble models, and even to 74.88 with additional finetuning."}}

However, they have several  issues, such as lack of contextual information, the risk of inaccurate detection, and the high computational cost. The first two could be resolved by additionally using grid-based features. However, how to extract and fuse these two types of features is uncharted. This paper proposes a Transformer-only neural architecture, dubbed GRIT (Grid- and Regionbased Image captioning Transformer), that effectively utilizes the two visual features to generate better captions. GRIT replaces the CNN-based detector employed in previous methods with a DETR-based one, making it computationally faster. Moreover, its monolithic design consisting only of Transformers enables end-to-end training of the model. This innovative design and the integration of the dual visual features bring about significant performance improvement. The experimental results on several image captioning benchmarks show that GRIT outperforms previous methods in inference accuracy and speed."}}

While they are attractive since they do not need negative samples, it necessitates some mechanism to avoid collapsing into a trivial solution. Currently, there are two approaches to collapse prevention. One uses an asymmetric architecture on a joint embedding of input, e.g., BYOL and SimSiam, and the other imposes decorrelation criteria on the same joint embedding, e.g., Barlow-Twins and VICReg. The latter methods have theoretical support from information theory as to why they can learn good representation. However, it is not fully understood why the former performs equally well. In this paper, focusing on BYOL/SimSiam, which uses the stop-gradient and a predictor as asymmetric tricks, we present a novel interpretation of these tricks; they implicitly impose a constraint that encourages feature decorrelation similar to Barlow-Twins/VICReg. We then present a novel non-contrastive method, which replaces the stop-gradient in BYOL/SimSiam with the derived constraint; the method empirically shows comparable performance to the above SOTA methods in the standard benchmark test using ImageNet. This result builds a bridge from BYOL/SimSiam to the decorrelation-based methods, contributing to demystifying their secrets."}}

Recent studies employ deep learning and solve the problem in an end-to-end fashion, leading to significant performance improvements. However, it is still hard to generate a good quality image from LDR images of a dynamic scene captured by a hand-held camera, e.g., occlusion due to the large motion of foreground objects, causing ghosting artifacts. The key to success relies on how well we can fuse the input images in their feature space, where we wish to remove the factors leading to low-quality image generation while performing the fundamental computations for HDR image generation, e.g., selecting the best-exposed image/region. We propose a novel method that can better fuse the features based on two ideas. One is multi-step feature fusion; our network gradually fuses the features in a stack of blocks having the same structure. The other is the design of the component block that effectively performs two operations essential to the problem, i.e., comparing and selecting appropriate images/regions. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark tests.\n\n"}}

So many studies have been conducted, especially for semantic segmentation due to its high annotation cost. The existing studies stick to the basic assumption that no labeled sample is available for the new domain. However, this assumption has several issues. First, it is pretty unrealistic, considering the standard practice of ML to confirm the model's performance before its deployment; the confirmation needs labeled data. Second, any UDA method will have a few hyper-parameters, needing a certain amount of labeled data. To rectify this misalignment with reality, we rethink UDA from a data-centric point of view. Specifically, we start with the assumption that we do have access to a minimum level of labeled data. Then, we ask how many labeled samples are necessary for finding satisfactory hyper-parameters of existing UDA methods. How well does it work if we use the same data to train the model, e.g., finetuning? We conduct experiments to answer these questions with popular scenarios, {GTA5, SYNTHIA}$\\rightarrow$Cityscapes. Our findings are as follows: i) for some UDA methods, good hyper-parameters can be found with only a few labeled samples (i.e., images), e.g., five, but this does not apply to others, and ii) finetuning outperforms most existing UDA methods with only ten labeled images."}}

Previous classical methods follow two-steps approaches, i.e., first defocus map estimation and then the non-blind deblurring. In the era of deep learning, some researchers have tried to address these two problems by CNN. However, the simple concatenation of defocus map, which represents the blur level, leads to suboptimal performance. Considering the spatial variant property of the defocus blur and the blur level indicated in the defocus map, we employ the defocus map as conditional guidance to adjust the features from the input blurring images instead of simple concatenation. Then we propose a simple but effective network with spatial modulation based on the defocus map. To achieve this, we design a network consisting of three sub-networks, including the defocus map estimation network, a condition network that encodes the defocus map into condition features, and the defocus deblurring network that performs spatially dynamic modulation based on the condition features. Moreover, the spatially dynamic modulation is based on an affine transform function to adjust the features from the input blurry images. Experimental results show that our method can achieve better quantitative and qualitative evaluation performance than the existing state-of-the-art methods on the commonly used public test datasets."}}

It first extracts multi-scale features and then aligns features from non-reference images. After alignment, we use residual channel attention blocks to merge the features from different images. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and produces excellent results where color artifacts and geometric distortions are significantly reduced."}}

It is to detect unknown objects while correctly detecting/classifying known objects. We first point out that the scenario of OSOD considered in recent studies, which considers an unlimited variety of unknown objects similar to open-set recognition (OSR), has a fundamental issue. That is, we cannot determine what to detect and what not for such unlimited unknown objects, which is necessary for detection tasks. This issue leads to difficulty with the evaluation of methods' performance on unknown object detection. We then introduce a novel scenario of OSOD, which deals with only unknown objects that share the super-category with known objects. It has many real-world applications, e.g., detecting an increasing number of fine-grained objects. This new setting is free from the above issue and evaluation difficulty. Moreover, it makes detecting unknown objects more realistic owing to the visual similarity between known and unknown objects. We show through experimental results that a simple method based on the uncertainty of class prediction from standard detectors outperforms the current state-of-the-art OSOD methods tested in the previous setting."}}
