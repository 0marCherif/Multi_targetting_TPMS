A thorough\nempirical evaluation is carried out on a real-world high dimensional ML\nproblem (image denoising). Results indicate that GP\u2019s performance is\nenhanced only when cooperation happens at an output level (ensemble-\nalike). The proposed co-evolutionary ensemble approach is compared\nagainst a canonical GP implementation and a GP customized for im-\nage processing tasks. Preliminary results show that the proposed frame-\nwork obtains superior average performance in comparison to the other\nGP models. Our most relevant finding is the empirical evidence showing\nthat the proposed CCGP model is a promising alternative to specialized\nGP implementations that require knowledge of the problem\u2019s domain.\n"}}

It involves a\npartitioning scheme of high dimensional input representations for distributed pro-\ncessing as well as an on-line form of learning that allows GP to efficiently process\ntraining datasets composed of hundreds or thousands of samples. The use of this\non-line learning approach has important consequences in computational cost given\ndifferent evolutionary population dynamics, namely steady state evolution and gen-\nerational replacement. We perform a complete experimental study to compare the\nevolution of autoencoders (AEs) under different population dynamics and genetic\noperators useful to evolve GP based AEs\u2019 individuals. Also, we compare the perfor-\nmance of GP based AEs with another representation learning method. Competitive\nresults have been achieved through the proposed method. To the best of the authors\u2019\nknowledge, this research work is a precursor within the field of evolutionary deep\nlearning."}}
