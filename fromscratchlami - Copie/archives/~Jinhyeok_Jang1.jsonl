In particular, the datasets appropriate for the intended application are difficult to obtain. To cope with this situation, we introduce a new dataset called ETRI-Activity3D, focusing on the daily activities of the elderly in robot-view. The major characteristics of the new dataset are as follows: 1) practical action categories that are selected from the close observation of the daily lives of the elderly; 2) realistic data collection, which reflects the robot's working environment and service situations; and 3) a large-scale dataset that overcomes the limitations of the current 3D activity analysis benchmark datasets. The proposed dataset contains 112,620 samples including RGB videos, depth maps, and skeleton sequences. During the data acquisition, 100 subjects were asked to perform 55 daily activities. Additionally, we propose a novel network called four-stream adaptive CNN (FSA-CNN). The proposed FSA-CNN has three main properties: robustness to spatio-temporal variations, input-adaptive activation function, and extension of the conventional two-stream approach. In the experiment section, we confirmed the superiority of the proposed FSA-CNN using NTU RGB+D and ETRI-Activity3D. Further, the domain difference between both groups of age was verified experimentally. Finally, the extension of FSA-CNN to deal with the multimodal data was investigated."}}

In practice, achieving accurate FER is challenging due to the large amount of inter-personal variations such as expression intensity variations. In this paper, we propose a new spatio-temporal feature representation learning for FER that is robust to expression intensity variations. The proposed method utilizes representative expression-states (e.g., onset, apex and offset of expressions) which can be specified in facial sequences regardless of the expression intensity. The characteristics of facial expressions are encoded in two parts in this paper. As the first part, spatial image characteristics of the representative expression-state frames are learned via a convolutional neural network. Five objective terms are proposed to improve the expression class separability of the spatial feature representation. In the second part, temporal characteristics of the spatial feature representation in the first part are learned with a long short-term memory of the facial expression. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on a deliberate expression dataset (MMI) and a spontaneous micro-expression dataset (CASME II). Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved higher recognition rates in both datasets compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}}

The concentrated views of a human observer while focusing and exploring parts of a facial image over time are generated and fed into a recurrent network. The network makes a decision concerning facial attributes based on the features gleaned from the observer's visual fixations. Experiments on facial expression, gender, and age datasets show that applying visual fixation to recurrent networks improves recognition rates significantly. The proposed method not only outperforms state-of-the-art recognition methods based on static facial features, but also those based on dynamic facial features."}}

The nodes' sensitivities are affected by activation function selections such that the nodes with smaller indices become increasingly more sensitive. As a result, features learned by the nodes are sorted by the node indices in the order of their importance. Asymmetric networks not only learn input features but also the importance of those features. Nodes of lesser importance in asymmetric networks can be pruned to reduce the complexity of the networks, and the pruned networks can be retrained without incurring performance losses. We validate the feature-sorting property using both shallow and deep asymmetric networks as well as deep asymmetric networks transferred from famous networks."}}

Each node in a network is assigned a variable that determines the sensitivity with which it learns to perform a given task. The network is trained by a constrained optimization that maximizes the sparsity of the sensitivity variables while ensuring the network's performance. As a result, the network learns to perform a given task using only a small number of sensitive nodes. Insensitive nodes, the nodes with zero sensitivity, can be removed from a trained network to obtain a computationally efficient network. Removing zero-sensitivity nodes has no effect on the network's performance because the network has already been trained to perform the task without them. The regularization parameter used to solve the optimization problem is found simultaneously during the training of networks. To validate our approach, we design networks with computationally efficient architectures for various tasks such as autoregression, object recognition, facial expression recognition, and object detection using various datasets. In our experiments, the networks designed by the proposed method provide the same or higher performance but with far less computational complexity."}}

Each pixel, node, and layer is assigned with a polynomial activation function, whose coefficients are provided by an auxiliary activation network. The activation of a feature depends on the features of neighboring pixels in a convolutional layer and other nodes in a dense layer. The dependency is learned from data by the activation networks. In our experiments, networks with activation networks provide significant performance improvement compared to the baseline networks on which they are built. The proposed method can be used to improve the network performance as an alternative to increasing the number of nodes and layers."}}
