In this context, existing methods often use either a Wasserstein metric, or else they apply concurrent barycenter approaches when more than two distributions are considered. In this paper, we  leverage multi-marginal optimal transport (MMOT), where we take advantage of a procedure that computes a generalized earth mover's distance as a sub-routine. We show that not only is our algorithm computationally more efficient compared to other barycentric-based distance methods, but it has the additional advantage that gradients used for backpropagation can be efficiently computed during the forward pass computation itself, which leads to substantially faster model training. We provide technical details about this new regularization term and its properties, and we present experimental demonstrations of faster runtimes when compared to standard Wasserstein-style methods. Finally, on a range of experiments designed to assess effectiveness at enforcing fairness, we demonstrate our method compares well with alternatives."}}

These spurious correlations, present in the training datasets, wrongly direct the neural network predictions resulting in reduced performance on certain groups, especially the minority groups. Robust training against such correlations requires the knowledge of group membership on every training sample. This need is impractical in situations where the data labeling efforts, for minority/rare groups, are significantly laborious or where the individuals comprising the dataset choose to conceal sensitive information pertaining to the groups. On the other hand, the presence of data collection efforts often results in datasets that contain partially labeled group information. Recent works, addressing the problem, have tackled fully unsupervised scenarios where no labels for groups are available. We aim to fill a missing gap in the literature that addresses a more realistic setting by leveraging partially available group information during training. First, we construct a constraint set and derive a high probability bound for the group assignment to belong to the set. Second, we propose an algorithm that optimizes for a worst-off group assignment from the constraint set. Through experiments on image and tabular datasets, we show improvements in the minority group's performance while preserving overall accuracy across groups."}}

When there is only a single source of variability (e.g., different scanners), domain adaptation and matching the distributions of representations may suffice in many scenarios.

Invariant representation learning, by itself, is illsuited to fully model the data generation process. In this paper, we show how bringing recent results on equivariant representation learning (for studying symmetries in neural networks) instantiated on structured spaces together with simple use of classical results on causal inference provides an effective practical solution.

Recent evidence suggests that existing solutions dependent on simple Gaussian formulations may not be sufficient. However, moving to other distributions necessitates Monte Carlo (MC) sampling to estimate quantities such as the KL divergence: it could be expensive and scales poorly as the dimensions of both the input data and the model grow. This is directly related to the structure of the computation graph, which can grow linearly as a function of the number of MC samples needed. Here, we construct a framework to describe these computation graphs, and identify probability families where the graph size can be independent or only weakly dependent on the number of MC samples. These families correspond directly to large classes of distributions. Empirically, we can run a much larger number of iterations for MC approximations for larger architectures used in computer vision with gains in performance measured in confident accuracy, stability of training, memory and training time."}}

In our paper, we introduce a class of losses for learning representations that are invariant to some extraneous variable of interest by inverting the class of contrastive losses, i.e., inverse contrastive loss (ICL). We show that if the extraneous variable is binary, then optimizing ICL is equivalent to optimizing a regularized MMD divergence. More generally, we also show that if we are provided a metric on the sample space, our formulation of ICL can be decomposed into a sum of convex functions of the given distance metric. Our experimental results indicate that models obtained by optimizing ICL achieve significantly better invariance to the extraneous variable for a fixed desired level of accuracy. In a variety of experimental settings, we show applicability of ICL for learning invariant representations for both continuous and discrete protected/extraneous variables.
