However, significant performance gaps exist between instance-level MIL algorithms and supervised learners since the instance labels are unavailable in MIL. Most existing MIL algorithms tackle the problem by treating multi-instance bags as harmful ambiguities and predicting instance labels by reducing the supervision inexactness. This work studies MIL from a new perspective by considering bags as auxiliary information, and utilize it to identify instance-level causal representations from bag-level weak supervision. We propose the CausalMIL algorithm, which not only excels at instance label prediction but also provides robustness to distribution change by synergistically integrating MIL with identifiable variational autoencoder. Our approach is based on a practical and general assumption: the prior distribution over the instance latent representations belongs to the non-factorized exponential family conditioning on the multi-instance bags. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms various baselines on instance label prediction and out-of-distribution generalization tasks."}}

It deals with tasks where the data is a set of bags and each bag is a set of instances. Only the bag labels are observed whereas the labels for the instances are unknown. An important advantage of multi-instance learning is that by representing objects as a bag of instances, it is able to preserve the inherent dependencies among parts of the objects. Unfortunately, most existing algorithms assume all instances to be \\textit{identically and independently distributed}, which violates real-world scenarios since the instances within a bag are rarely independent. In this work, we propose the Multi-Instance Variational Auto-Encoder (MIVAE) algorithm which explicitly models the dependencies among the instances for predicting both bag labels and instance labels. Experimental results on several multi-instance benchmarks and end-to-end medical imaging datasets demonstrate that MIVAE performs better than state-of-the-art algorithms for both instance label and bag label prediction tasks."}}

In recent years, a need for estimating the heterogeneous treatment effects conditioning on the different characteristics of individuals has emerged from research fields such as personalized healthcare, social science, and online marketing. To meet the need, researchers and practitioners from different communities have developed algorithms by taking the treatment effect heterogeneity modeling approach and the uplift modeling approach, respectively. In this paper, we provide a unified survey of these two seemingly disconnected yet closely related approaches under the potential outcome framework. We then provide a structured survey of existing methods by emphasizing on their inherent connections with a set of unified notations to make comparisons of the different methods easy. We then review the main applications of the surveyed methods in personalized marketing, personalized medicine, and social studies. Finally, we summarize the existing software packages and present discussions based on the use of methods on synthetic, semi-synthetic and real world data sets and provide some general guidelines for choosing methods."}}

For example, which customers are persuadable by a product promotion? which patients should be treated with a certain type of treatment? These are typical causal questions involving the effect or the change in outcomes made by an intervention. The questions cannot be answered with traditional classification methods as they only use associations to predict outcomes. For personalised marketing, these questions are often answered with uplift modelling. The objective of uplift modelling is to estimate causal effect, but its literature does not discuss when the uplift represents causal effect. Causal heterogeneity modelling can solve the problem, but its assumption of unconfoundedness is untestable in data. So practitioners need guidelines in their applications when using the methods. In this paper, we use causal classification for a set of personalised decision making problems, and differentiate it from classification. We discuss the conditions when causal classification can be resolved by uplift (and causal heterogeneity) modelling methods. We also propose a general framework for causal classification, by using off-the-shelf supervised methods for flexible implementations. Experiments have shown two instantiations of the framework work for causal classification and for uplift (causal heterogeneity) modelling, and are competitive with the other uplift (causal heterogeneity) modelling methods."}}

Unfortunately, this assumption is frequently violated in real-world applications, since some variables only affect the treatment but not the outcome, and vice versa. Moreover, in many cases only the proxy variables of the underlying confounding factors can be observed. In this work, we first show the importance of differentiating confounding factors from instrumental and risk factors for both average and conditional average treatment effect estimation, and then we propose a variational inference approach to simultaneously infer latent factors from the observed variables, disentangle the factors into three disjoint sets corresponding to the instrumental, confounding, and risk factors, and use the disentangled factors for treatment effect estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a wide range of synthetic, benchmark, and real-world datasets."}}

However, the definition and annotation of miRNAs have been changed significantly across different versions of miRBase. The changes cause inconsistency in miRNA related data between different databases and articles published at different times. Several tools have been developed for different purposes of querying and converting the information of miRNAs between different miRBase versions, but none of them individually can provide the comprehensive information about miRNAs in miRBase and users will need to use a number of different tools in their analyses. Results We introduce miRBaseConverter, an R package integrating the latest miRBase version 22 available in Bioconductor to provide a suite of functions for converting and retrieving miRNA name (ID), accession, sequence, species, version and family information in different versions of miRBase. The package is implemented in R and available under the GPL-2 license from the Bioconductor website ( http://bioconductor.org/packages/miRBaseConverter/ ). A Shiny-based GUI suitable for non-R users is also available as a standalone application from the package and also as a web application at http://nugget.unisa.edu.au:3838/miRBaseConverter . miRBaseConverter has a built-in database for querying miRNA information in all species and for both pre-mature and mature miRNAs defined by miRBase. In addition, it is the first tool for batch querying the miRNA family information. The package aims to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use tool for miRNA research community where researchers often utilize published miRNA data from different sources. Conclusions The Bioconductor package miRBaseConverter and the Shiny-based web application are presented to provide a suite of functions for converting and retrieving miRNA name, accession, sequence, species, version and family information in different versions of miRBase. The package will serve a wide range of applications in miRNA research and could provide a full view of the miRNAs of interest."}}

Recently, several recursive partitioning methods have been proposed to identify the subgroups that respond differently towards a treatment, and they rely on a fitness criterion to minimize the error between the estimated treatment effects and the unobservable ground truths. Results In this paper, we propose that a heterogeneity criterion, which maximizes the differences of treatment effects among the subgroups, also needs to be considered. Moreover, we show that better performances can be achieved when the fitness and the heterogeneous criteria are considered simultaneously. Selecting the optimal splitting points then becomes a multi-objective problem; however, a solution that achieves optimal in both aspects are often not available. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-objective splitting procedure to balance both criteria. The proposed procedure is computationally efficient and fits naturally into the existing recursive partitioning framework. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-objective approach performs consistently better than existing ones. Conclusion Heterogeneity should be considered with fitness in heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, and the proposed multi-objective splitting procedure achieves the best performance by balancing both criteria."}}
