We do so by performing experiments on artificial neural networks in the context of fairness in machine learning, where the goal is to induce fairness in the system through interventions. Using our recently developed M-information flow framework, we measure the flow of information about the true label (responsible for accuracy, and hence desirable), and separately, the flow of information about a protected attribute (responsible for bias, and hence undesirable) on the edges of a trained neural network. We then compare the flow magnitudes against the effect of intervening on those edges by pruning. We show that pruning edges that carry larger information flows about the protected attribute reduces bias at the output to a greater extent. This demonstrates that M-information flow can meaningfully suggest targets for interventions, answering the title's question in the affirmative. We also evaluate bias-accuracy tradeoffs for different intervention strategies, to analyze how one might use estimates of desirable and undesirable information flows (here, accuracy and bias flows) to inform interventions that preserve the former while reducing the latter."}}

While quantifying disparity is essential, sometimes the needs of an occupation may require the use of certain features that are critical in a way that any disparity that can be explained by them might need to be exempted. E.g., in hiring a software engineer for a safety-critical application, coding-skills may be weighed strongly, whereas name, zip code, or reference letters may be used only to the extent that they do not add disparity. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic decomposition of the total disparity (a quantification inspired from counterfactual fairness) into two components: a non-exempt component which quantifies the part that cannot be accounted for by the critical features, and an exempt component that quantifies the remaining disparity. This decomposition allows one to check if the disparity arose purely due to the critical features (inspired from the business necessity defense of disparate impact law) and also enables selective removal of the non-exempt component if desired. We arrive at this decomposition through canonical examples that lead to a set of desirable properties (axioms) that a measure of non-exempt disparity should satisfy. Our proposed measure satisfies all of them. Our quantification bridges ideas of causality, Simpson's paradox, and a body of work from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition. We also obtain an impossibility result showing that no observational measure can satisfy all the desirable properties, leading us to relax our goals and examine observational measures that satisfy only some of them. We perform case studies to show how one can audit/train models while reducing non-exempt disparity."}}

We defined a computational model of a neural circuit consisting of computational nodes and transmissions being sent between these nodes over time. We then gave a formal definition of information flow pertaining to a specific message, which was capable of identifying paths along which information flowed in such a system. However, this definition also had some non-intuitive properties, such as the existence of \"orphans\"-nodes from which information flowed out, even though no information flowed in. In part, these non-intuitive properties arose because we restricted our attention to measures that were functions of transmissions at a single time instant, and measures that were observational rather than counterfactual. In this paper, we consider alternative definitions, including one that is a function of transmissions at multiple time instants, one that is counterfactual, and a new observational definition. We show that a definition of information flow based on counterfactual causal influence (CCI) guarantees the existence of information paths while also having no orphans. We also prove that no observational definition of information flow that satisfies the information path property can match CCI in every instance. Furthermore, each of the definitions we examine (including CCI) is shown to have examples in which the information flow can take a non-intuitive path. Nevertheless, we believe our framework remains more amenable to drawing clear interpretations than classical tools used in neuroscience, such as Granger Causality."}}

Motivated by practical applications, we consider the challenging sparse regime, where expected node degrees are constant, and the inter-community mean degree ($b$) scales proportionally to intra-community mean degree ($a$). Prior work has sharply characterized partial or full community recovery in terms of a ``signal-to-noise ratio'' ($\\mathrm{SNR}$) based on $a$ and $b$. For both problems, we propose computationally-efficient tests that can succeed far beyond the regime where recovery of community membership is even possible. Overall, for large changes, $s \\gg \\sqrt{n}$, we need only $\\mathrm{SNR}= O(1)$ whereas a na\\\"ive test based on community recovery with $O(s)$ errors requires $\\mathrm{SNR}= \\Theta(\\log n)$. Conversely, in the small change regime, $s \\ll \\sqrt{n}$, via an information theoretic lower bound, we show that, surprisingly, no algorithm can do better than the na\\\"ive algorithm that first estimates the community up to $O(s)$ errors and then detects changes. We validate these phenomena numerically on SBMs and on real-world datasets as well as Markov Random Fields where we only observe node data rather than the existence of links."}}

CSDs are waves of neurochemical changes that suppress the neuronal activity as they propagate across the brain's cortical surface. CSDs are believed to mediate secondary brain damage after brain trauma and cerebrovascular diseases like stroke. We address the following two key challenges in detecting CSDs from EEG signals: i) attenuation and loss of high spatial resolution information; and ii) cortical folds, which complicate tracking CSD waves. Methods: Our algorithm detects and tracks \u201cwavefronts\u201d of a CSD wave, and stitch together data across space and time to make a detection. To test our algorithm, we provide different models of CSD waves, including different widths of CSD suppressions and different patterns, and use them to simulate scalp EEG signals using head models of four subjects. Results and conclusion: Our results suggest that low-density EEG grids (40 electrodes) can detect CSD widths of 1.1 cm on average, while higher density EEG grids (340 electrodes) can detect CSD patterns as thin as 0.43 cm (less than minimum widths reported in prior works), among which single-gyrus CSDs are the hardest to detect because of their small suppression area. Significance: The proposed algorithm is a first step toward noninvasive, automated detection of CSDs, which can help in reducing secondary brain damages."}}

Moreover, the wet conductive carbon fiber silicone sponges achieve an electrode-skin impedance as low as 2.5k\u03a9 at 1kHz when wet, making them better than state of the art gel electrodes. Additionally, even as the sponge dries out, it continues to remain conductive and performs as a reliable dry electrode. We demonstrate through experiments that these conductive carbon fiber silicone sponge electrodes, wet or dry, are able to measure alpha wave activity. Our carbon fiber conductive sponge electrodes are low-cost and are highly suitable for designs of portable high density EEG measurement systems."}}
