In order to find these failures before deployment, we introduce MultiMon, a system that automatically identifies systematic failures -- generalizable, natural-language descriptions of patterns of model failures. To uncover systematic failures, MultiMon scrapes a corpus for examples of erroneous agreement: inputs that produce the same output, but should not. It then prompts a language model (e.g., GPT-4) to find systematic patterns of failure and describe them in natural language. We use MultiMon to find 14 systematic failures (e.g., \"ignores quantifiers\") of the CLIP text-encoder, each comprising hundreds of distinct inputs (e.g., \"a shelf with a few/many books\"). Because CLIP is the backbone for most state-of-the-art multimodal systems, these inputs produce failures in Midjourney 5.1, DALL-E, VideoFusion, and others. MultiMon can also steer towards failures relevant to specific use cases, such as self-driving cars. We see MultiMon as a step towards evaluation that autonomously explores the long tail of potential system failures. Code for MULTIMON is available at https://github.com/tsb0601/MultiMon."}}

In this work, we cast auditing as a discrete optimization problem, where we automatically search for input-output pairs that match a desired target behavior. For example, we might aim to find non-toxic input that starts with ``Barack Obama'' and maps to a toxic output. Our optimization problem is difficult to solve as the set of feasible points is sparse, the space is discrete, and the language models we audit are non-linear and high-dimensional. To combat these challenges, we introduce a discrete optimization algorithm, ARCA, that is tailored to autoregressive language models. We demonstrate how our approach can: uncover derogatory completions about celebrities (e.g. ``Barack Obama is a legalized unborn'' $\\rightarrow$ ``child murderer'), produce French inputs that complete to English outputs, and find inputs that generate a specific name. Our work offers a promising new tool to uncover models' failure-modes before deployment. $\\textbf{Trigger Warning: This paper contains model behavior that can be offensive in nature.}$"}}

Existing procedures to defend against such perturbations are either (i) heuristic in nature and susceptible to stronger attacks or (ii) provide guaranteed robustness to worst-case attacks, but are incompatible with state-of-the-art models like BERT. In this work, we introduce robust encodings (RobEn): a simple framework that confers guaranteed robustness, without making compromises on model architecture. The core component of RobEn is an encoding function, which maps sentences to a smaller, discrete space of encodings. Systems using these encodings as a bottleneck confer guaranteed robustness with standard training, and the same encodings can be used across multiple tasks. We identify two desiderata to construct robust encoding functions: perturbations of a sentence should map to a small set of encodings (stability), and models using encodings should still perform well (fidelity). We instantiate RobEn to defend against a large family of adversarial typos. Across six tasks from GLUE, our instantiation of RobEn paired with BERT achieves an average robust accuracy of 71.3% against all adversarial typos in the family considered, while previous work using a typo-corrector achieves only 35.3% accuracy against a simple greedy attack."}}

Previous heuristic defenses cannot guard against the exponentially large number of possible perturbations, and previous certified defenses only work with limited model sizes and simple architectures. In this paper, we construct task-agnostic robust encodings (TARE): sentence representations that improve the robustness of any model for multiple downstream tasks at once, and enable efficient exact computation of robust accuracy (accuracy on worst-case perturbations) for a fixed family of perturbations. The core idea behind TARE is to map sentences through a discrete bottleneck before feeding them to a downstream model. To create robust encodings, we must optimize for two competing goals: the encoding of a sentence must retain enough information about the sentence, but should also map all perturbations of the sentence to the same encoding to ensure invariance to perturbations. Averaged across six tasks from GLUE, a standard suite of NLP tasks,  the same encoding leads to robust accuracy of 71.2% when defending against a large family of typos, while a strong baseline that uses a typo corrector achieves only 38.5% accuracy, and training on random typos achieves only 9.9% accuracy."}}
