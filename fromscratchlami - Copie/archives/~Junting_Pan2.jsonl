Despite increasingly stronger variants with ever higher recognition accuracies, due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention, existing ViTs are typically demanding in computation and model size. Although several successful design choices (e.g., the convolutions and hierarchical multi-stage structure) of prior CNNs have been reintroduced into recent ViTs, they are still not sufficient to meet the limited resource requirements of mobile devices. This motivates a very recent attempt to develop light ViTs based on the state-of-the-art MobileNet-v2, but still leaves a performance gap behind. In this work, pushing further along this under-studied direction we introduce EdgeViTs, a new family of light-weight ViTs that, for the first time, enable attention based vision models to compete with the best light-weight CNNs in the tradeoff between accuracy and on-device efficiency. This is realized by introducing a highly cost-effective local-global-local (LGL) information exchange bottleneck based on optimal integration of self-attention and convolutions. For device-dedicated evaluation, rather than relying on inaccurate proxies like the number of FLOPs or parameters, we adopt a practical approach of focusing directly on on-device latency and, for the first time, energy efficiency. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation validate high efficiency of our EdgeViTs\u00a0when compared to the state-of-the-art efficient CNNs and ViTs in terms of accuracy-efficiency tradeoff on mobile hardware. Specifically, we show that our models are Pareto-optimal when both accuracy-latency and accuracy-energy tradeoffs are considered, achieving strict dominance over other ViTs in almost all cases and competing with the most efficient CNNs.

Recent advances have been achieved by modeling direct pairwise relations between entities. In this paper, we take one step further, not only model direct relations between pairs but also take into account indirect higher-order relations established upon multiple elements. We propose to explicitly model the Actor-Context-Actor Relation, which is the relation between two actors based on their interactions with the context. To this end, we design an Actor-Context-Actor Relation Network (ACAR-Net) which builds upon a novel High-order Relation Reasoning Operator and an Actor-Context Feature Bank to enable indirect relation reasoning for spatio-temporal action localization. Experiments on AVA and UCF101-24 datasets show the advantages of modeling actor-context-actor relations, and visualization of attention maps further verifies that our model is capable of finding relevant higher-order relations to support action detection. Notably, our method ranks first in the AVA-Kinetics action localization task of ActivityNet Challenge 2020, outperforming other entries by a significant margin (+6.71 mAP). The code is available online."}}

Different from typical end-to-end approaches, which model both scene content and dynamics in a single step, we propose to decompose this difficult task into two sub-problems. As current image generation methods do better than video generation in terms of detail, we synthesize high quality content by only generating the first frame. Then we animate the scene based on its semantic meaning to obtain temporally coherent video, giving us excellent results overall. We employ a cVAE for predicting optical flow as a beneficial intermediate step to generate a video sequence conditioned on the initial single frame. A semantic label map is integrated into the flow prediction module to achieve major improvements in the image-to-video generation process. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset show that our method outperforms all competing methods."}}

The goal of ODAS is to detect the start of an action instance, with high categorization accuracy and low detection latency. ODAS is important in many applications such as early alert generation to allow timely security or emergency response. We propose three novel methods to specifically address the challenges in training ODAS models: (1) hard negative samples generation based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to distinguish ambiguous background, (2) explicitly modeling the temporal consistency between data around action start and data succeeding action start, and (3) adaptive sampling strategy to handle the scarcity of training data. We conduct extensive experiments using THUMOS\u201914 and ActivityNet. We show that our proposed methods lead to significant performance gains and improve the state-of-the-art methods. An ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each proposed method."}}

This paper, however, addresses the problem with a completely data-driven approach by training a convolutional neural network (convnet). The learning process is formulated as a minimization of a loss function that measures the Euclidean distance of the predicted saliency map with the provided ground truth. The recent publication of large datasets of saliency prediction has provided enough data to train end-to-end architectures that are both fast and accurate. Two designs are proposed: a shallow convnet trained from scratch, and a another deeper solution whose first three layers are adapted from another network trained for classification. To the authors' knowledge, these are the first end-to-end CNNs trained and tested for the purpose of saliency prediction."}}
