The existing work, however, only used either generative or information compression models to improve the performance of the target task. In this paper, we propose to combine the two types of IB models into one system to enhance Named Entity Recognition (NER). For one type of IB model, we incorporate two unsupervised generative components, span reconstruction and synonym generation, into a span-based NER system. The span reconstruction ensures that the contextualised span representation keeps the span information, while the synonym generation makes synonyms have similar representations even in different contexts. For the other type of IB model, we add a supervised IB layer that performs information compression into the system to preserve useful features for NER in the resulting span representations. Experiments on five different corpora indicate that jointly training both generative and information compression models can enhance the performance of the baseline span-based NER system.

Linguistic theory postulates that expressions of negation and uncertainty are semantically independent from each other and the content they modify. However, previous works on representation learning do not explicitly model this independence. We therefore attempt to disentangle the representations of negation, uncertainty, and content using a Variational Autoencoder. We find that simply supervising the latent representations results in good disentanglement, but auxiliary objectives based on adversarial learning and mutual information minimization can provide additional disentanglement gains."}}

The power of such PLMs can be combined with the advantages of deep generative models. These are examples of these combinations. However, they are trained only on general domain text, and biomedical models are still missing. In this work, we describe BioVAE, the first large-scale pre-trained latent variable language model for the biomedical domain, which uses the OPTIMUS framework to train on large volumes of biomedical text. The model shows SOTA performance on several biomedical text mining tasks when compared to existing publicly available biomedical PLMs. In addition, our model can generate more accurate biomedical sentences than the original OPTIMUS output."}}

However, existing studies have not performed the paragraph-level analysis of the procedures. Moreover, since most of the synthesis procedures are described in natural language in articles and technical documents, it is necessary to structure them in a format that can be handled by computers through information extraction. Therefore, in this study, we construct a pipeline system that extracts synthesis procedures from text in the form of a flow graph and analyzes each procedure as a flow graph rather than a set of processes. The extraction system extracts entities by the deep learning model and relations between entities by the rule-based extractor from all paragraphs in the literature and selects procedures that include valid structures of entities and relations. Our evaluation of a benchmark dataset gave micro-averaged F-scores of 0.807, 0.830, and 0.609 for the entity extractor, relation extractor, and pipeline extractor, respectively. We applied this system to a large amount of literature and extracted approximately 90,000 flow graphs (procedures) containing approximately 4 million entities and 3 million relations. We performed several analyses, including taking statistics of the extracted graphs and checking frequent subgraphs for the extracted graphs. Commonly used methods in materials science were confirmed from our analyses; for example, ethanol is often dried by heating at 60 \u00b0C, and less-reactive noble gases are rarely included in the products. As a result, we experimentally confirmed that the extracted procedures were reasonable."}}

However, state-of-the-art neural models either neglect those structures during learning or use syntactic features and external tools to detect them. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents and compares two neural models: a novel EXhaustive Neural Network (EXNN) and a Search-Based Neural Network (SBNN) for detection of nested and overlapping events. Results We evaluate the proposed models as an event detection component in isolation and within a pipeline setting. Evaluation in several annotated biomedical event extraction datasets shows that both EXNN and SBNN achieve higher performance in detecting nested and overlapping events, compared to the state-of-the-art model Turku Event Extraction System (TEES). Conclusions The experimental results reveal that both EXNN and SBNN are effective for biomedical event extraction. Furthermore, results on a pipeline setting indicate that our models improve detection of events compared to models that use either gold or predicted named entities."}}

We treat the relations in a document as a relation graph among entities in this approach. The relation graph is iteratively constructed by editing edges of an initial graph, which might be a graph extracted by another system or an empty graph. The way to edit edges is to classify them in a close-first manner using the document and temporally-constructed graph information; each edge is represented with a document context information by a pretrained transformer model and a graph context information by a graph convolutional neural network model. We evaluate our approach on the task to extract material synthesis procedures from materials science texts. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach in editing the graphs initialized by our in-house rule-based system and empty graphs."}}

This is because materials researchers refer to produce promising terms of experiments for material synthesis. However, there are only a few systems that can extract material names and their properties. This study proposes a large-scale natural language processing (NLP) pipeline for extracting material names and properties from materials science literature to enable the search and retrieval of results in materials science. Therefore, we propose a label definition for extracting material names and properties and accordingly build a corpus containing 836 annotated paragraphs extracted from 301 papers for training a named entity recognition (NER) model. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of this NER model; it achieves successful extraction with a micro-F1 score of 78.1%. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we present a thorough evaluation on a real-world automatically annotated corpus by applying our trained NER model to 12,895 materials science papers. We analyze the trend in materials science by visualizing the outputs of the NLP pipeline. For example, the country-by-year analysis indicates that in recent years, the number of papers on \u201cMoS $$_2$$ ,\u201d a material used in perovskite solar cells, has been increasing rapidly in China but decreasing in the United States. Further, according to the conditions-by-year analysis, the processing temperature of the catalyst material \u201cPEDOT:PSS\u201d is shifting below 200\u00a0 $$^{\\circ }$$ C, and the number of reports with a processing time exceeding 5\u00a0h is increasing slightly."}}
