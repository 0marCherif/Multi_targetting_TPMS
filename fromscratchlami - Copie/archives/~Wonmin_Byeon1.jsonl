Most CL methods focus on adapting a single network to a new task/class by modifying its weights. However, with rapid progress in architecture design, the problem of adapting existing solutions to novel architectures becomes relevant. For the first time, we propose Heterogeneous Continual Learning (HCL) to address this problem, where a wide range of evolving network architectures emerge continually together with novel data/tasks. As a solution, we build on top of the distillation family of techniques and modify it to a new setting where a weaker model takes the role of a teacher; meanwhile, a new stronger architecture acts as a student. Furthermore, we consider a setup of limited access to previous data and propose Quick Deep Inversion (QDI) to recover prior task visual features to support knowledge transfer. QDI significantly reduces computational costs compared to previous solutions and improves overall performance. In summary, we propose a new setup for CL with a modified knowledge distillation paradigm and design a quick data inversion method to enhance distillation. Our evaluation of various benchmarks shows that the proposed method can successfully progress over various networks while outperforming state-of-the-art methods with a 2x improvement on accuracy."}}

We propose a theoretical framework for orthogonal convolutional layers to address this problem, establishing the equivalence between diverse orthogonal convolutional layers in the spatial domain and the paraunitary systems in the spectral domain. Since a complete factorization exists for paraunitary systems, any orthogonal convolution layer can be parameterized as convolutions of spatial filters. Our framework endows high expressive power to various convolutional layers while maintaining their exact orthogonality. Furthermore, our layers are memory and computationally efficient for deep networks compared to previous designs. Our versatile framework, for the first time, enables the study of architecture designs for deep orthogonal networks, such as choices of skip connection, initialization, stride, and dilation. Consequently, we scale up orthogonal networks to deep architectures, including ResNet and ShuffleNet, substantially increasing the performance over their shallower counterparts. Finally, we show how to construct residual flows, a flow-based generative model that requires strict Lipschitzness, using our orthogonal networks."}}

It is therefore interesting to study how these two tasks can be coupled to benefit each other. Indeed, segmentation can be easily transformed into contour edges to guide edge learning. However, the converse is nontrivial since general edges may not always form closed contours. In this paper, we propose a principled end-to-end framework for coupled edge and segmentation learning, where edges are leveraged as pairwise similarity cues to guide segmentation. At the core of our framework is a recurrent module termed as dynamic graph propagation (DGP) layer that performs message passing on dynamically constructed graphs. The layer uses learned gating to dynamically select neighbors for message passing using max-pooling. The output from message passing is further gated with an edge signal to refine segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to let both tasks mutually improve each other. On Cityscapes validation, our best model achieves 83.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and 78.7% maximum F-score in semantic edge detection. Our method also leads to improved zero-shot robustness on Cityscapes with natural corruptions (Cityscapes-C)."}}

In contrast, videos of human interactions in unconstrained environments are abundantly available and can be much more easily annotated with frame-level activity labels. In this work, we tackle the previously unexplored problem of weakly-supervised gaze estimation from videos of human interactions. We leverage the insight that strong gaze-related geometric constraints exist when people perform the activity of \"looking at each other\" (LAEO). To acquire viable 3D gaze supervision from LAEO labels, we propose a training algorithm along with several novel loss functions especially designed for the task. With weak supervision from two large scale CMU-Panoptic and AVA-LAEO activity datasets, we show significant improvements in (a) the accuracy of semi-supervised gaze estimation and (b) cross-domain generalization on the state-of-the-art physically unconstrained in-the-wild Gaze360 gaze estimation benchmark.

We demonstrate the forecasting performance of the LSTM and compare it with Gaussian processes (GPs) in time series obtained from the Lorenz 96 system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and a prototype climate model. The LSTM networks outperform the GPs in short-term forecasting accuracy in all applications considered. A hybrid architecture, extending the LSTM with a mean stochastic model (MSM-LSTM), is proposed to ensure convergence to the invariant measure.
