These representations predicted a latent similarity structure between objects, which captured most of the explainable variance in human behavioral judgments. Individual dimensions in the low-dimensional embedding were found to be highly reproducible and interpretable as conveying degrees of taxonomic membership, functionality, and perceptual attributes. We further demonstrated the predictive power of the embeddings for explaining other forms of human behavior, including categorization, typicality judgments, and feature ratings, suggesting that the dimensions reflect human conceptual representations of objects beyond the specific task."}}

This paper introduces Variational Interpretable Concept Embeddings (VICE), an approximate Bayesian method for embedding object concepts in a vector space using data collected from humans in a triplet odd-one-out task. VICE uses variational inference to obtain sparse, non-negative representations of object concepts with uncertainty estimates for the embedding values. These estimates are used to automatically select the dimensions that best explain the data. We derive a PAC learning bound for VICE that can be used to estimate generalization performance or determine a sufficient sample size for experimental design. VICE rivals or outperforms its predecessor, SPoSE, at predicting human behavior in the triplet odd-one-out task. Furthermore, VICE's object representations are more reproducible and consistent across random initializations, highlighting the unique advantage of using VICE for deriving interpretable embeddings from human behavior."}}

We use variational inference to obtain a sparse, non-negative solution, with uncertainty information about each embedding value. We leverage this information in a statistical procedure for selecting the dimensionality of the model, based on hypothesis-testing over a validation set. VICE performs as well or better than previous methods on a variety of criteria: accuracy of predicting human behavior in an odd-one-out task, calibration to (empirical) human choice probabilities, reproducibility of object representations across different random initializations, and superior performance on small datasets. The latter is particularly important in cognitive science, where data collection is expensive. Finally, VICE yields highly interpretable object representations, allowing humans to describe the characteristics being represented by each latent dimension."}}
