To avoid such limitations, we propose a probabilistic modeling of the underlying distribution of prompts, allowing prompts within the support of an associated concept to be de- rived through stochastic sampling. This results in a more complete and richer transfer of the information captured by the language model, providing better generalization capabilities for downstream tasks. The resulting algorithm relies on a simple yet powerful variational framework that can be directly integrated with other developments. We show our approach is seamlessly integrated into both standard and conditional prompt learning frameworks, improving the performance in both cases considerably, especially with regard to preserving the generalization capability of the original model. Our method provides the current state-of-the-art for prompt learning, surpassing CoCoOp by 1.6% average Top-1 accuracy on the standard benchmark. Remarkably, it even surpasses the original CLIP model in terms of generalization to new classes. The implementation code will be released.\n"}}

A generative approach has practical advantages like producing more fine-grained and human-readable output, and being naturally open-world. To this end, we propose to adapt a pre-trained generative Vision & Language (V&L) Foundation Model for video/action recognition. While recently there have been a few attempts to adapt V&L models trained with contrastive learning (e.g. CLIP) for video/action, to the best of our knowledge, we propose the very first method that sets outs to accomplish this goal for a generative model. We firstly show that direct fine-tuning of a generative model to produce action classes suffers from severe overfitting. To alleviate this, we introduce REST, a training framework consisting of two key components: an unsupervised method for adapting the generative model to action/video by means of pseudo-caption generation and Self-training, i.e. without using any action-specific labels; (b) a Retrieval approach based on CLIP for discovering a diverse set of pseudo-captions for each video to train the model. Importantly, we show that both components are necessary to obtain high accuracy. We evaluate REST on the problem of zero-shot action recognition where we show that our approach is very competitive when compared to contrastive learning-based methods. Code will be made available"}}

Reported performance has trailed behind standard supervised pre-training by a large margin, barring self-supervised learning from making an impact on models that are deployed on device. Most prior works attribute this poor performance to the capacity bottleneck of the low-compute networks and opt to bypass the problem through the use of knowledge distillation (KD). In this work, we revisit SSL for efficient neural networks, taking a closer at what are the detrimental factors causing the practical limitations, and whether they are intrinsic to the self-supervised low-compute setting. We find that, contrary to accepted knowledge, there is no intrinsic architectural bottleneck, we diagnose that the performance bottleneck is related to the model complexity vs regularization strength trade-off. In particular, we start by empirically observing that the use of local views can have a dramatic impact on the effectiveness of the SSL methods. This hints at view sampling being one of the performance bottlenecks for SSL on low-capacity networks. We hypothesize that the view sampling strategy for large neural networks, which requires matching views in very diverse spatial scales and contexts, is too demanding for low-capacity architectures. We systematize the design of the view sampling mechanism, leading to a new training methodology that consistently improves the performance across different SSL methods (e.g. MoCo-v2, SwAV, DINO), different low-size networks (e.g. MobileNetV2, ResNet18, ResNet34, ViT-Ti), and different tasks (linear probe, object detection, instance segmentation and semi-supervised learning).

Self-supervised Learning Over Sets Of Handled Objects In Egocentric Action Recognition", "abstract": "Learning an egocentric action recognition model from video data is challenging due to distractors (e.g., irrelevant objects) in the background. Further integrating object information into an action model is hence beneficial. Existing methods often leverage a generic object detector to identify and represent the objects in the scene. However, several important issues remain. Object class annotations of good quality for the target domain (dataset) are still required for learning good object representation. Besides, previous methods deeply couple the existing action models and need to retrain them jointly with object representation, leading to costly and inflexible integration. To overcome both limitations, we introduce Self-Supervised Learning Over Sets (SOS), an approach to pre-train a generic Objects In Contact (OIC) representation model from video object regions detected by an off-the-shelf hand-object contact detector. Instead of augmenting object regions individually as in conventional self-supervised learning, we view the action process as a means of natural data transformations with unique spatio-temporal continuity and exploit the inherent relationships among per-video object sets. Extensive experiments on two datasets, EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and EGTEA, show that our OIC significantly boosts the performance of multiple state-of-the-art video classification models. "}}

From a practical perspective, an FSOD system must fulfil the following desiderata: (a) it must be used as is, without requiring any fine-tuning at test time, (b) it must be able to process an arbitrary number of novel objects concurrently while supporting an arbitrary number of examples from each class and (c) it must achieve accuracy comparable to a closed system. While there are (relatively) few systems that support (a), to our knowledge, there is no system supporting (b) and (c). In this work, we make the following contributions: We introduce, for the first time, a simple, yet powerful, few-shot detection transformer (FS-DETR) that can address both desiderata (a) and (b). Our system builds upon the DETR framework, extending it based on two key ideas: (1) feed the provided visual templates of the novel classes as visual prompts during test time, and (2) ``stamp'' these prompts with pseudo-class embeddings, which are then predicted at the output of the decoder. Importantly, we show that our system is not only more flexible than existing methods, but also, making a step towards satisfying desideratum (c), it is more accurate, matching and outperforming the current state-of-the-art on the most well-established benchmarks (PASCAL VOC & MSCOCO) for FSOD.
