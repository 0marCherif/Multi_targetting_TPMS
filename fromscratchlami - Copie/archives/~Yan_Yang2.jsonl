The current PDA methods usually adapt the feature extractor by aligning the target and reweighted source domain distributions. In this paper, we experimentally find that the feature adaptation by the reweighted distribution alignment in some state-of-the-art PDA methods is not robust to the ``noisy'' weights of source domain data, leading to negative domain transfer on some challenging benchmarks. To tackle the challenge of negative domain transfer, we propose a novel Adversarial Reweighting (AR) approach that adversarially learns the weights of source domain data to align the source and target domain distributions, and the transferable deep recognition network is learned on the reweighted source domain data. Based on this idea, we propose a training algorithm that alternately updates the parameters of the network and optimizes the weights of source domain data. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks of ImageNet-Caltech, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and DomainNet. Ablation studies also confirm the effectiveness of our approach."}}

It has been widely applied in medical imaging, remote sensing, image compression, etc. In this paper, we propose two versions of a novel deep learning architecture, dubbed as ADMM-CSNet, by combining the traditional model-based CS method and data-driven deep learning method for image reconstruction from sparsely sampled measurements. We first consider a generalized CS model for image reconstruction with undetermined regularizations in undetermined transform domains, and then two efficient solvers using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for optimizing the model are proposed. We further unroll and generalize the ADMM algorithm to be two deep architectures, in which all parameters of the CS model and the ADMM algorithm are discriminatively learned by end-to-end training. For both applications of fast CS complex-valued MR imaging and CS imaging of real-valued natural images, the proposed ADMM-CSNet achieved favorable reconstruction accuracy in fast computational speed compared with the traditional and the other deep learning methods."}}

Parallel imaging is a fast magnetic resonance imaging technique through spatial sensitivity coding using multi-coils. To reconstruct a high quality MR image from under-sampled k-space data, we propose a novel deep network, dubbed as Blind-PMRI-Net, to simultaneously reconstruct the MR image and sensitivity maps in a blind setting for parallel imaging. The Blind-PMRI-Net is a novel deep architecture inspired by the iterative algorithm optimizing a novel energy model for\njoint image and sensitivity estimation based on image and sensitivity priors. The network is designed to be able to automatically learn these two priors by learning their corresponding proximal operators using convolutional neural networks. Blind-PMRI-Net naturally combines the physical constraint of parallel imaging and prior learning in a single deep architecture. Experiments on a knee MRI dataset show that our network can effectively reconstruct MR image with improved accuracy than previous methods, with fast computational speed. For example, Blind-PMRI-Net takes 0.72 seconds on GPU to reconstruct 15-channel sensitivity maps and a complex-valued MR image in size of 320 \u00d7 320."}}

To improve the current MRI system in reconstruction accuracy and computational speed, in this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture, dubbed ADMM-Net. ADMM-Net is defined over a data flow graph, which is derived from the iterative procedures in Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for optimizing a CS-based MRI model. In the training phase, all parameters of the net, e.g., image transforms, shrinkage functions, etc., are discriminatively trained end-to-end using L-BFGS algorithm. In the testing phase, it has computational overhead similar to ADMM but uses optimized parameters learned from the training data for CS-based reconstruction task. Experiments on MRI image reconstruction under different sampling ratios in k-space demonstrate that it significantly improves the baseline ADMM algorithm and achieves high reconstruction accuracies with fast computational speed."}}
