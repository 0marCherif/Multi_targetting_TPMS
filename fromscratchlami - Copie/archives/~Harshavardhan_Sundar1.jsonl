The current state-of-the-art approaches to SED employ a shared attention mechanism achieved through a stack of MHSA blocks to detect multiple sound events. Consequently, in a multi-label SED task, a common attention mechanism would be responsible for generating relevant feature representations for each of the events to be detected. In this paper, we show through empirical evaluation that having more MHSA blocks dedicated specifically for individual events, rather than having a stack of shared MHSA blocks, improves the overall detection performance. Interestingly, this improvement in performance comes about because the event-specific attention blocks help in resolving confusions in the case of co-occurring events. The proposed \u201cEvent-specific Attention Network\u201d (ESA-Net) can be trained in an end-to-end manner. On the DCASE 2020 Task 4 data set, we show that with ESA-Net, the best single model achieves an event-based F1 score of 52.1 % on the public validation data set improving over the existing state of the art result.

We show that the association ambiguity of the TDOAs can be effectively resolved using the concept of an inverse delay interval region (IDIR), which we introduce in this paper. By examining the association between a spatial domain and the TDOAs, we define IDIR as an inter-hyperboloidal spatial region corresponding to an interval of delays for a given pair of microphones. The proposed scheme for localizing multiple sources involves two stages. In the first stage, the given enclosure is partitioned into non-overlapping elemental regions and the ones that contain a source are detected using a measure based on the generalized cross-correlation with phase transform and the IDIRs. In the second stage, the sources are finely localized within each of the detected elemental regions by identifying the IDIRs containing a single source and a novel region constrained localization approach. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on real recordings from the AV16.3 corpus and in a simulated reverberation setting with a reverberation time RT60 of up to 500 ms, and show that the DOA estimation error with two active speakers is within 2\u00b0 and the spatial localization error is less than 30 cm for each speaker."}}
