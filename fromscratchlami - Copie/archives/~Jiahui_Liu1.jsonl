The system clusters a user's web history and shows it as research trails. We present two user interaction models with the research trails. The first interaction model is implemented as a standalone application, which presents a hierarchical view of research trails. The second interaction model is integrated with the web browser. It shows the user's research trails as selectable and manipulable visual streams when they open a new tab. Thereby, the NewTab page serves as a springboard in the browser for a user resuming an ongoing task."}}

Fresh content about a variety of topics, events, and places is constantly being created and published on the web by news agencies around the world. As intuitively understood by readers, and studied in journalism, news articles produced by different social groups present different attitudes towards and interpretations of the same news issues. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for aggregating news articles according to the local news sources associated with the stakeholders of the news issues. This new paradigm provides users the capability to aggregate and browse various local points of view about the news issues in which they are interested. We implement this paradigm in a system called LocalSavvy. LocalSavvy analyzes the news articles provided by users, using knowledge about locations automatically acquired from the web. Based on the analysis of the news issue, the system finds and aggregates local news articles published by official and unofficial news sources associated with the stakeholders. Moreover, opinions from those local social groups are extracted from the retrieved results, presented in the summaries and highlighted in the news web pages. We evaluate LocalSavvy with a user study. The quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that news articles aggregated by LocalSavvy present relevant and distinct local opinions, which can be clearly perceived by the subjects."}}

Similar events can provide hints for problem solving, as well as larger contexts for understanding the specific circumstances of an event. Lessons can leaned from past experience, insights can be gained about the new situation from familiar examples, and trends can be discovered among similar events. As the largest knowledge base for human beings, the Web provides both an opportunity and a challenge to discover comparable cases in order to facilitate situation analysis and problem solving. In this paper, we present Compare & Contrast, a system that uses the Web to discover comparable cases for news stories, documents about similar situations but involving distinct entities. The system analyzes a news story given by the user and builds a model of the story. With the story model, the system dynamically discovers entities comparable to the main entity in the original story and uses these comparable entities as seeds to retrieve web pages about comparable cases. The system is domain independent, does not require any domain-specific knowledge engineering efforts, and deals with the complexity of unstructured text and noise on the web in a robust way. We evaluated the system with an experiment on a collection of news articles and a user study."}}
