As a consequence, the quality of solutions produced using these algorithms crucially depends on the initial cell coordinates. In this work, we reduce the problem of finding wirelength-minimal initial layouts subject to density and fixed-macro constraints to a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP). We additionally propose an efficient sequential quadratic programming algorithm to recover a block-globally optimal solution and a subspace method to reduce the complexity of problem. We extend our formulation to facilitate direct minimization of the Half-Perimeter Wirelength (HPWL) by showing that a corresponding solution can be derived by solving a sequence of reweighted quadratic programs. Critically, our method is parameter-free, i.e. involves no hyperparameters to tune. We demonstrate that incorporating initial layouts produced by our algorithm with a global analytical placer results in improvements of up to 4.76% in post-detailed-placement wirelength on the ISPD'05 benchmark suite. Our code is available on github. https://github.com/choltz95/laplacian-eigenmaps-revisited."}}

In order to retain the trend of Moore\u2019s law, design technology co-optimization (DTCO) and system technology co-optimization (STCO) are introduced together to continue scaling beyond 5 nm using pitch scaling, patterning, and novel 3-D cell structures [i.e., complementary-FET (CFET)]. However, numerous DTCO and STCO iterations are needed to continue block-level area scaling with considerations of physical layout factors: 1) various standard cell (SDC) library sets (i.e., different cell heights and conventional FET); 2) design rules (DRs); 3) back end of line (BEOL) settings; and 4) power delivery network (PDN) configurations. The growing turnaround time (TAT) among SDC design, DR optimization, and block-level area evaluation becomes one of the major bottlenecks in DTCO and STCO explorations. In this work, we develop a machine learning model that combines bootstrap aggregation and gradient boosting techniques to predict the sensitivity of minimum valid block-level area of various physical layout factors. We first demonstrate that the proposed model achieves 16.3% less mean absolute error (MAE) than the previous work for testing sets. Then, we show that the proposed model successfully captures the block-level area sensitivity of new SDC library sets, new BEOL settings, and new PDN settings with 0.013, 0.004, and 0.027 MAE, respectively. Finally, compared to the previous work, the proposed approach improves the robustness of predicting new circuit designs by up to 6.76%.
