A transmitter Alice sends messages to the receiver Bob in the presence of a hidden adversary Calvin. The adversary Calvin can both eavesdrop and jam on (possibly non-identical) subsets of transmission links. The goal is to communicate reliably (intended receiver can understand the messages) and secretly (adversary cannot understand the messages). Two kinds of jamming, additive and overwrite, are considered. Additive jamming corresponds to wireless network model while overwrite jamming corresponds to wired network model and storage systems. The multipath network consists of C parallel links. Calvin can both jam and eavesdrop any z io number of links, can eavesdrop (but not jam) any z i/o number of links, and can jam (but not eavesdrop) any z o/i number of links. We present the first \u201ccomplete\u201d information-theoretic characterization of maximum achievable rate as a function of the number of links that can be jammed and/or eavesdropped for equal and unequal link capacity multipath networks under additive and overwrite jamming in the large alphabet regime. Our achievability and converse proofs require non-trivial combination of information theoretic and coding theoretic ideas and our achievability schemes are computationally efficient. The PHaSE-Saving techniques 1 are used for achievability while a \u201cstochastic\u201d singleton bound is obtained for converse."}}

The limited-view causal adversary is able to, based on the current and past observations, eavesdrop on a subset of links and also jam on a potentially overlapping subset of links. The goal is to ensure that the communication takes place reliably and secretly. We study two adversarial models - additive and overwrite jamming. For both adversarial models, we consider communication models both without and with passive feedback from decoder to encoder, i.e., the encoder sees everything that the decoder sees. The problem assumes transmissions are in the large alphabet regime. For both types of jamming models, we find the capacity under three scenarios - reliability without feedback, reliability and secrecy without feedback, and reliability with feedback. We observe that in comparison to the non-causal setting the capacity with a causal adversary is strictly increased for a wide variety of parameter settings, and present our intuition through several examples."}}

We survey recent results, and present new results for the setting with passive feedback available to the encoder \u2014 thus providing a \"complete characterization\" for the problem.

In addition to requiring the legitimate receiver to reliably decode, covert communication also requires that the warden is unable to estimate whether or not communication is taking place. The spectral mask at the transmitter restricts excessive radiation beyond the bandwidth of interest. We develop a communication scheme with theoretical guarantees for both covertness and reliability, based on pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) with Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) and root raised cosine (RRC) carrier pulses. Given a fixed time T and a spectral mask with bandwidth parameter W, \u221a we show that one can transmit O( W T ) bits of information covertly and reliably, and our proposed scheme provides a lower bound on the covert capacity."}}

We prove a square-root law for the covert identification problem. This states that an ID message of size exp(exp(\u0398(\u221a{ n})) can be transmitted over n channel uses. We then characterize the exact pre-constant in the \u0398(\u00b7) notation. This constant is referred to as the covert identification capacity. We show that it equals the recently developed covert capacity in the standard covert communication problem, and somewhat surprisingly, the covert identification capacity can be achieved without any shared key between the sender and receivers. The achievability proof relies on a random coding argument with pulse-position modulation (PPM), coupled with a second stage which performs code refinements. The converse proof relies on an expurgation argument as well as results for channel resolvability with stringent input constraints."}}

An active adversary James eavesdrops on their communication over a binary symmetric channel (BSC( q)), and may maliciously flip (up to) a certain fraction p of their transmitted bits based on his observations. We consider a setting where the communication must be simultaneously covert as well as reliable, i.e., James should be unable to accurately distinguish whether or not Alice is communicating, while Bob should be able to correctly recover Alice's message with high probability regardless of the adversarial jamming strategy. We show that, unlike the setting with passive adversaries, covert communication against active adversaries requires Alice and Bob to have a shared key (of length at least \u03a9(logn)) even when Bob has a better channel than James. We present lower and upper bounds on the information-theoretically optimal throughput as a function of the channel parameters, the desired level of covertness, and the amount of shared key available. These bounds match for a wide range of parameters of interest. We also develop a computationally efficient coding scheme (based on concatenated codes) when the amount of shared key available is \u03a9(\u221an logn), and further show that this scheme can be implemented with much less amount of shared key when the adversary is assumed to be computationally bounded."}}
