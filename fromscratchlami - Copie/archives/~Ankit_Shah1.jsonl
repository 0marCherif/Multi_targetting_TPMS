At the lower level, there is a visual front-end with a limited temporal receptive field that processes the raw pixels depicting the lips or faces. At the higher level, there is an encoder that attends to the embeddings produced by the front-end over a large temporal receptive field. Previous work has focused on improving the visual front-end of the model to extract more useful features for speech recognition. Surprisingly, our work shows that complex visual front-ends are not necessary. Instead of allocating resources to a sophisticated visual front-end, we find that a linear visual front-end paired with a larger Conformer encoder results in lower latency, more efficient memory usage, and improved WER performance. We achieve a new state-of-the-art of $12.8\\%$ WER for visual speech recognition on the TED LRS3 dataset, which rivals the performance of audio-only models from just four years ago."}}

We define semi-weak label data as data where we know the presence or absence of a given class and additionally we have the information about the exact count of each class as opposed to knowing the label proportions. A three-stage framework is proposed to address the problem of learning from semi-weak labels. It leverages the fact that counting information is naturally non-negative and discrete. Experiments are conducted on generated samples from CIFAR-10 and we compare our model with a fully-supervised setting baseline, a weakly-supervised setting baseline and a learning from proportion(LLP) baseline. Our framework not only outperforms both baseline models for MIL-based weakly supervised setting and learning from proportion setting, but also gives comparable results compared to the fully supervised model. Further, we conduct thorough ablation studies to analyze across datasets and variation with batch size, losses architectural changes, bag size and regularization, thereby demonstrating robustness of our approach.

In this work, we seek to investigate whether using this ontological information will improve learning from weakly labeled data, which are easier to collect since it requires only the presence or absence of an event to be known. We use the AudioSet ontology and dataset, which contains audio clips weakly labeled with the ontology concepts and the ontology providing the \"Is A\" relations between the concepts. We first re-implemented the model proposed by soundevent_ontology with modification to fit the multi-label scenario and then expand on that idea by using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to model the ontology information to learn the concepts. We find that the baseline Siamese does not perform better by incorporating ontology information in the weak and multi-label scenario, but that the GCN does capture the ontology knowledge better for weak, multi-labeled data. In our experiments, we also investigate how different modules can tolerate noises introduced from weak labels and better incorporate ontology information. Our best Siamese-GCN model achieves mAP=0.45 and AUC=0.87 for lower-level concepts and mAP=0.72 and AUC=0.86 for higher-level concepts, which is an improvement over the baseline Siamese but about the same as our models that do not use ontology information."}}

In these challenges, the best-performing systems relied heavily on human-generated descriptions of the video content, which were available in the datasets but would be unavailable in real-world applications. To promote further advancements for real-world applications, we proposed a third AVSD challenge, at DSTC10, with two modifications: 1) the human-created description is unavailable at inference time, and 2) systems must demonstrate temporal reasoning by finding evidence from the video to support each answer. This paper introduces the new task that includes temporal reasoning and our new extension of the AVSD dataset for DSTC10, for which we collected human-generated temporal reasoning data. We also introduce a baseline system built using an AV-transformer, which we released along with the new dataset. Finally, this paper introduces a new system that extends our baseline system with attentional multimodal fusion, joint student-teacher learning (JSTL), and model combination techniques, achieving state-of-the-art performances on the AVSD datasets for DSTC7, DSTC8, and DSTC10. We also propose two temporal reasoning methods for AVSD: one attention-based, and one based on a time-domain region proposal network."}}
