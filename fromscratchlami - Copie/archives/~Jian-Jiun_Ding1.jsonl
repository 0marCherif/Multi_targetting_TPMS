To this end, a two-stage knowledge learning mechanism including knowledge collation (KC) and knowledge examination (KE) based on a multi-teacher and student architecture is proposed. At the KC, the student network aims to learn the comprehensive bad weather removal problem from multiple well-trained teacher networks where each of them is specialized in a specific bad weather removal problem. To accomplish this process, a novel collaborative knowledge transfer is proposed. At the KE, the student model is trained without the teacher networks and examined by challenging pixel loss derived by the ground truth.

It plays an important role in text comparison, nucleotide sequence alignment, and melody matching. Conventional DP method performs element-to-element or element-to-space comparison and considers only the cases of replacement, deletion, and insertion. In this work, we improve the DP method by performing multiple element comparison. That is, in addition to perform element-wise comparison, we also compare the similarities of element-space to element and space-element to element. Moreover, the global similarity is also adopted to improve the accuracy of DP. Experiments show that, with the proposed algorithm, the accuracy of melody matching can be much improved. It is helpful for improving the performance of the query-by-humming system and applicable to other sequence comparison problems."}}

Conventionally, disparity estimation is usually based on the local information of keypoints. However, keypoints may distribute sparsely in the smooth region, and keypoints with the same descriptors may appear in a symmetric pattern. Therefore, conventional keypoint-based disparity estimation methods may have limited performance in smooth and symmetric regions. The proposed algorithm is superpixel-based. Instead of performing keypoint matching, both keypoint and semiglobal information are applied to determine the disparity in the proposed algorithm. Since the local information of keypoints and the semi-global information of the superpixel are both applied, the accuracy of disparity estimation can be improved, especially for smooth and symmetric regions. Moreover, to address the non-uniform distribution problem of keypoints, a disparity refining mechanism based on the similarity and the distance of neighboring superpixels is applied to correct the disparity of the superpixel with no or few keypoints. The experiments show that the disparity map generated by the proposed algorithm has a lower matching error rate than that generated by other methods."}}

However, relatively little attention has been paid to the playing techniques of musical instruments. This work proposes an automatic system for classifying guitar playing techniques (GPTs). Automatic classification for GPTs is challenging because some playing techniques differ only slightly from others. This work presents a new framework for GPT classification: it uses a new feature extraction method based on spectral\u2013temporal receptive fields (STRFs) to extract features from guitar sounds. This work applies a supervised deep learning approach to classify GPTs. Specifically, a new deep learning model, called the hierarchical cascade deep belief network (HCDBN), is proposed to perform automatic GPT classification. Several simulations were performed and the datasets of: 1) data on onsets of signals; 2) complete audio signals; and 3) audio signals in a real-world environment are adopted to compare the performance. The proposed system improves upon the F-score by approximately 11.47% in setup 1) and yields an F-score of 96.82% in setup 2). The results in setup 3) demonstrate that the proposed system also works well in a real-world environment. These results show that the proposed system is robust and has very high accuracy in automatic GPT classification."}}

Although several methods have been proposed to achieve state-of-the-art performance on this topic, re-identifying vehicle in foggy scenes remains a great challenge due to the degradation of visibility. To our knowledge, this problem is still not well-addressed so far. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose a novel training framework called Semi-supervised Joint Defogging Learning (SJDL) framework. First, the fog removal branch and the re-identification branch are integrated to perform simultaneous training. With the collaborative training scheme, defogged features generated by the defogging branch from input images can be shared to learn better representation for the re-identification branch. However, since the fog-free image of real-world data is intractable, this architecture can only be trained on the synthetic data, which may cause the domain gap problem between real-world and synthetic scenarios. To solve this problem, we design a semi-supervised defogging training scheme that can train two kinds of data alternatively in each iteration. Due to the lack of a dataset specialized for vehicle ReID in the foggy weather, we construct a dataset called FVRID which consists of real-world and synthetic foggy images to train and evaluate the performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and outperforms other existing vehicle ReID methods in the foggy weather. The code and dataset are available in https://github.com/Cihsaing/SJDL-Foggy-Vehicle-Re-Identification--AAAI2022."}}
