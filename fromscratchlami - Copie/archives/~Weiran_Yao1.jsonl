While recent works utilize nonlinear functions to parameterize the transition and emission processes to enhance their expressivity, the form of additive noise still limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a general formulation of SSMs with a completely non-parametric transition model and a flexible emission model which can account for sensor distortion. Besides, to deal with more general scenarios (e.g., non-stationary time series), we add a higher level model to capture time-varying characteristics of the process.\nInterestingly, we find that even though the proposed model is remarkably flexible, the latent processes are generally identifiable. Given this, we further propose the corresponding estimation procedure and make use of it for the forecasting task. Our model can recover the latent processes and their relations from observed sequential data. Accordingly, the proposed procedure can also be viewed as a method for causal representation learning. We argue that forecasting can benefit from causal representation learning, since the estimated latent variables are generally identifiable. Empirical comparisons on various datasets validate that our model could not only reliably identify the latent processes from the observed data, but also consistently outperform baselines in the forecasting task."}}

To solve this problem, we propose to apply optimal transport to match the vision and text modalities. Specifically, we first model images and the categories with visual and textual feature sets.

In the inner loop, we optimize the optimal transport distance to align visual features and prompts by the Sinkhorn algorithm, while in the outer loop, we learn the prompts by this distance from the supervised data.

However, most existing work is constrained by functional form assumptions such as independent sources or further with linear transitions, and distribution assumptions such as stationary, exponential family distribution. It is unknown whether the underlying latent variables and their causal relations are identifiable if they have arbitrary, nonparametric causal influences in between.  In this work, we establish the identifiability theories of nonparametric latent causal processes from their nonlinear mixtures under fixed temporal causal influences and analyze how distribution changes can further benefit the disentanglement. We propose TDRL, a principled framework to recover time-delayed latent causal variables and identify their relations from measured sequential data under stationary environments and under different distribution shifts. Specifically, the framework can factorize unknown distribution shifts into transition distribution changes under fixed and time-varying latent causal relations, and under global changes in observation. Through experiments, we show that time-delayed latent causal influences are reliably identified and that our approach considerably outperforms existing baselines that do not correctly exploit this modular representation of changes.

Estimating causally-related latent variables from observations is particularly challenging as the latent variables are not uniquely recoverable in the most general case. In this work, we consider both a nonparametric, nonstationary setting and a parametric setting for the latent processes and propose two provable conditions under which temporally causal latent processes can be identified from their nonlinear mixtures. We propose LEAP, a theoretically-grounded framework that extends Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) by enforcing our conditions through proper constraints in causal process prior. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that temporally causal latent processes are reliably identified from observed variables under different dependency structures and that our approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage history or nonstationarity information. This demonstrates that using temporal information to learn latent processes from their invertible nonlinear mixtures in an unsupervised manner, for which we believe our work is one of the first, seems promising even without sparsity or minimality assumptions.

A mathematical model of the EVHP was established to describe the hemodynamic behavior of EVHP and quantify the changes in cardiac parameters. A reference model consisting of a virtual proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and the EVHP model was employed to generate the reference trajectory of AoP. An adaptation algorithm tunes the control parameters based on the reference model and the isolated heart. Experiments were conducted using large animal hearts (50 \u00b1 5 kg porcine) to validate the adaptive controller's performance for stepwise and fast switching AoP references. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed controller for regulating the AoP in isolated porcine hearts, in an accurate (mean error less than 2 mmHg) and fast (4-8 s of settling time) manner."}}

The effectiveness of traffic incident management is often limited by the late response time and excessive workload of traffic operators. This paper proposes a novel decision-making framework that learns from both data and domain knowledge to real-time recommend contingency signal plans that accommodate non-recurrent traffic, with the outputs from real-time traffic prediction at least 30 minutes in advance. Specifically, considering the rare occurrences of engagement of contingency signal plans for incidents, we propose to decompose the end-to-end recommendation task into two hierarchical models: real-time traffic prediction and plan association. We learn the connections between the two models through metric learning, which reinforces partial-order preferences observed from historical signal engagement records. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by testing this framework on the traffic network in Cranberry Township in 2019. Results show that our recommendation system has a precision score of 96.75% and recall of 87.5% on the testing plan, and make recommendation of an average of 22.5 minutes lead time ahead of Waze alerts. The results suggest that our framework is capable of giving traffic operators a significant time window to access the conditions and respond appropriately."}}
