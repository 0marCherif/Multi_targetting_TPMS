Our architecture is based on a transformer with a novel attention mechanism. Our key idea is to sparsify the transformer's attention matrix at high resolutions, guided by dense attention extracted at lower image resolutions. While previous attention mechanisms are computationally too expensive for handling high-resolution images or are overly constrained within specific image regions hampering long-range interactions, our novel attention mechanism is both computationally efficient and effective. Our sparsified attention mechanism is able to capture long-range interactions and context, leading to synthesizing interesting phenomena in scenes, such as reflections of landscapes onto water or flora consistent with the rest of the landscape, that were not possible to generate reliably with previous convnets and transformer approaches. We present qualitative and quantitative results, along with user studies, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method."}}

We propose the Swapping Autoencoder, a deep model designed specifically for image manipulation, rather than random sampling.

In particular, we encourage the components to represent structure and texture, by enforcing one component to encode co-occurrent patch statistics across different parts of an image. As our method is trained with an encoder, finding the latent codes for a new input image becomes trivial, rather than cumbersome. As a result, it can be used to manipulate real input images in various ways, including texture swapping, local and global editing, and latent code vector arithmetic.

We explore several critical design choices for making contrastive learning effective in the image synthesis setting. Notably, we use a multilayer, patch-based approach, rather than operate on entire images. Furthermore, we draw negatives from within the input image itself, rather than from the rest of the dataset. We demonstrate that our framework enables one-sided translation in the unpaired image-to-image translation setting, while improving quality and reducing training time.

Due to the spatial uniformity of blobs and the locality inherent to convolution, our network learns to associate different blobs with different entities in a scene and to arrange these blobs to capture scene layout. We demonstrate this emergent behavior by showing that, despite training without any supervision, our method enables applications such as easy manipulation of objects within a scene (e.g., moving, removing, and restyling furniture), creation of feasible scenes given constraints (e.g., plausible rooms with drawers at a particular location), and parsing of real-world images into constituent parts.

Yet, this basic functionality remains an open problem. A popular line of approaches uses the L1 (mean absolute error) loss, either in the pixel or the feature space of pretrained deep networks. However, we observe that these losses tend to produce overly blurry and grey images, and other techniques such as GANs need to be employed to fight these artifacts. In this work, we introduce an information theory based approach to measuring similarity between two images. We argue that a good reconstruction should have high mutual information with the ground truth. This view enables learning a lightweight critic to \"calibrate\" a feature space in a contrastive manner, such that reconstructions of corresponding spatial patches are brought together, while other patches are repulsed. We show that our formulation immediately boosts the perceptual realism of output images when used as a drop-in replacement for the L1 loss, with or without an additional GAN loss."}}

Investigative study using a new data generation procedure indicates that the mode collapse of the generator is driven by the discriminator\u2019s inability to maintain classification accuracy on previously seen samples, a phenomenon called Catastrophic Forgetting in continual learning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a novel training procedure that dynamically spawns additional dis-criminators to remember previous modes of generation. On several datasets, we show that our training scheme can be plugged-in to existing GAN frameworks to mitigate mode collapse and improve standard metrics for GAN evaluation."}}
