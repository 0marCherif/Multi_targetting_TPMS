However, its limited customization options hinder users from accurately describing desired outputs. For example, plain text makes it hard to specify continuous quantities, such as the precise RGB color value or importance of each word. Furthermore, creating detailed text prompts for complex scenes is tedious for humans to write and challenging for text encoders to interpret. To address these challenges, we propose using a rich-text editor supporting formats such as font style, size, color, and footnote. We extract each word's attributes from rich text to enable local style control, explicit token reweighting, precise color rendering, and detailed region synthesis. We achieve these capabilities through a region-based diffusion process. We first obtain each word's region based on attention maps of a diffusion process using plain text. For each region, we enforce its text attributes by creating region-specific detailed prompts and applying region-specific guidance, and maintain its fidelity against plain-text generation through region-based injections. We present various examples of image generation from rich text and demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines with quantitative evaluations."}}

We present a generic approach using latent diffusion models as powerful image priors for various visual synthesis tasks. Existing methods that utilize such priors fail to use these models' full capabilities. To improve this, our core ideas are 1) a feature matching loss between features from different layers of the decoder to provide detailed guidance and 2) a KL divergence loss to regularize the predicted latent features and stabilize the training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on three different applications, text-to-3D, StyleGAN adaptation, and layered image editing. Extensive results show our method compares favorably against baselines."}}

However, these models still fail to precisely follow the text prompt when multiple objects, attributes, and spatial compositions are involved in the prompt. In this paper, we identify the potential reasons in both the cross-attention and self-attention layers of the diffusion model. We propose two novel losses to refocus the attention maps according to a given layout during the sampling process. We perform comprehensive experiments on the DrawBench and HRS benchmarks using layouts synthesized by Large Language Models, showing that our proposed losses can be integrated easily and effectively into existing text-to-image methods and consistently improve their alignment between the generated images and the text prompts."}}

While off-the-shelf billion-scale datasets for image generation are available, collecting similar video data of the same scale is still challenging. Also, training a video diffusion model is computationally much more expensive than its image counterpart. In this work, we explore finetuning a pretrained image diffusion model with video data as a practical solution for the video synthesis task. We find that naively extending the image noise prior to video noise prior in video diffusion leads to sub-optimal performance. Our carefully designed video noise prior leads to substantially better performance. Extensive experimental validation shows that our model, Preserve Your Own Correlation (PYoCo), attains SOTA zero-shot text-to-video results on the UCF-101 and MSR-VTT benchmarks. It also achieves SOTA video generation quality on the small-scale UCF-101 benchmark with a $10\\times$ smaller model using significantly less computation than the prior art."}}

This novel hyperbolic objective encourages the scene-object hypernymy among the representations by optimizing the magnitude of their norms. We show that when pretraining on the COCO and OpenImages datasets, the hyperbolic loss improves downstream performance of several baselines across multiple datasets and tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

However, CNNs are prone to depend on low-level features that humans deem non-semantic. This dependency has been conjectured to induce a lack of robustness to image perturbations or domain shift. In this paper, we show that by generating carefully designed negative samples, contrastive learning can learn more robust representations with less dependence on such features. Contrastive learning utilizes positive pairs which preserve semantic information while perturbing superficial features in the training images. Similarly, we propose to generate negative samples in a reversed way, where only the superfluous instead of the semantic features are preserved. We develop two methods, texture-based and patch-based augmentations, to generate negative samples.  These samples achieve better generalization, especially under out-of-domain settings. We also analyze our method and the generated texture-based samples, showing that texture features are indispensable in classifying particular ImageNet classes and especially finer classes. We also show that the model bias between texture and shape features favors them differently under different test settings. "}}

However, we show that invariance to circular shifts can also lead to greater sensitivity to adversarial attacks.  We first characterize the margin between classes when a shift-invariant {\\em linear} classifier is used. We show that the margin can only depend on the DC component of the signals.  Then, using results about infinitely wide networks, we show that in some simple cases, fully connected and shift-invariant neural networks produce linear decision boundaries.  Using this, we prove that shift invariance in neural networks produces adversarial examples for the simple case of two classes, each consisting of a single image with a black or white dot on a gray background.  This is more than a curiosity; we show empirically that with real datasets and realistic architectures, shift invariance reduces adversarial robustness.  Finally, we describe initial experiments using synthetic data to probe the source of this connection."}}
