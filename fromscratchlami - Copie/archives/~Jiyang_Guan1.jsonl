However, deep neural networks are facing security threats from backdoor attacks and can be manipulated into attacker-decided behaviors by the backdoor attacker. To defend the backdoor, prior research has focused on using clean data to remove backdoor attacks before model deployment. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of defending against backdoor attacks at test time by utilizing partially poisoned data to remove the backdoor from the model. To address the problem, a two-stage method Test-Time Backdoor Defense (TTBD) is proposed. In the first stage, we propose two backdoor sample detection methods, namely DDP and TeCo, to identify poisoned samples from a batch of mixed, partially poisoned samples. Once the poisoned samples are detected, we employ Shapley estimation to calculate the contribution of each neuron's significance in the network, locate the poisoned neurons, and prune them to remove backdoor in the models. Our experiments demonstrate that TTBD removes the backdoor successfully with only a batch of partially poisoned data across different model architectures and datasets against different types of backdoor attacks."}}

However, resizing them to a mobile-friendly size leads to significant performance degradation. Therefore, developing lightweight vision transformers has become a crucial area of research. This paper introduces CloFormer, a lightweight vision transformer that leverages context-aware local enhancement. CloFormer explores the relationship between globally shared weights often used in vanilla convolutional operators and token-specific context-aware weights appearing in attention, then proposes an effective and straightforward module to capture high-frequency local information. In CloFormer, we introduce AttnConv, a convolution operator in attention's style. The proposed AttnConv uses shared weights to aggregate local information and deploys carefully designed context-aware weights to enhance local features. The combination of the AttnConv and vanilla attention which uses pooling to reduce FLOPs in CloFormer enables the model to perceive high-frequency and low-frequency information. Extensive experiments were conducted in image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, demonstrating the superiority of CloFormer. The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/qhfan/CloFormer}."}}

Sample Correlation for Fingerprinting Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "An off-the-shelf model as a commercial service could be stolen by model stealing attacks, posing great threats to the rights of the model owner. Model fingerprinting aims to verify whether a suspect model is stolen from the victim model, which gains more and more attention nowadays. Previous methods always leverage the transferable adversarial examples as the model fingerprint, which is sensitive to adversarial defense or transfer learning scenarios. To address this issue, we consider the pairwise relationship between samples instead and propose a novel yet simple model stealing detection method based on SAmple Correlation (SAC). Specifically, we present SAC-w that selects wrongly classified normal samples as model inputs and calculates the mean correlation among their model outputs. To reduce the training time, we further develop SAC-m that selects CutMix Augmented samples as model inputs, without the need for training the surrogate models or generating adversarial examples. Extensive results validate that SAC successfully defends against various model stealing attacks, even including adversarial training or transfer learning, and detects the stolen models with the best performance in terms of AUC across different datasets and model architectures.

However, prior works show that deep neural networks are easily manipulated into specific, attacker-decided behaviors in the inference stage by backdoor attacks which inject malicious small hidden triggers into model training, raising serious security threats. To determine the triggered neurons and protect against backdoor attacks, we exploit Shapley value and develop a new approach called Shapley Pruning (ShapPruning) that successfully mitigates backdoor attacks from models in a data-insufficient situation (1 image per class or even free of data). Considering the interaction between neurons, ShapPruning identifies the few infected neurons (under 1 % of all neurons) and manages to protect the model's structure and accuracy after pruning as many infected neurons as possible. To accelerate ShapPruning, we further propose discarding threshold and \u220a -greedy strategy to accelerate Shapley estimation, making it possible to repair poisoned models with only several minutes. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method against various attacks and tasks compared to existing methods."}}
