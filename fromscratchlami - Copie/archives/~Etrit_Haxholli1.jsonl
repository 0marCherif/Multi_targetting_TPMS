In this paper, we present AFFJORD, a neural ODE-based normalizing flow which enhances the representation power of FFJORD by defining the neural ODE through special augmented transformation dynamics which preserve the topology of the space. Furthermore, we derive the Jacobian determinant of the general augmented form by generalizing the chain rule in the continuous sense into the 'cable rule', which expresses the forward sensitivity of ODEs with respect to their initial conditions. The cable rule gives an explicit expression for the Jacobian of a neural ODE transformation, and provides an elegant proof of the instantaneous change of variable. Our experimental results on density estimation in synthetic and high dimensional data, such as MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA 32x32, show that AFFJORD outperforms the baseline FFJORD through the improved flexibility of the underlying vector field.
