It has been shown that super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) is effective to achieve such a balance, and has obtained better results than direct high-resolution (HR) acquisition, for certain contrasts and sequences. The focus of this work was on constructing images with spatial resolution higher than can be practically obtained by direct Fourier encoding. A novel learning approach was developed, which was able to provide an estimate of the spatial gradient prior from the low-resolution (LR) inputs for the HR reconstruction. By incorporating the anisotropic acquisition schemes, the learning model was trained over the LR images themselves only. The learned gradients were integrated as prior knowledge into a gradient-guided SRR model. A closed-form solution to the SRR model was developed to obtain the HR reconstruction. Our approach was assessed on the simulated data as well as the data acquired on a Siemens 3T MRI scanner containing 45 MRI scans from 15 subjects. The experimental results demonstrated that our approach led to superior SRR over state-of-the-art methods, and obtained better images at lower or the same cost in scan time than direct HR acquisition."}}

Abstract Functional MRI (fMRI) is extremely challenging to perform in subjects who move because subject motion disrupts blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal measurement. It has become common to use retrospective framewise motion detection and censoring in fMRI studies to eliminate artifacts arising from motion. Data censoring results in significant loss of data and statistical power unless the data acquisition is extended to acquire more data not corrupted by motion. Acquiring more data than is necessary leads to longer than necessary scan duration, which is more expensive and may lead to additional subject non-compliance. Therefore, it is well established that real-time prospective motion monitoring is crucial to ensure data quality and reduce imaging costs. In addition, real-time monitoring of motion allows for feedback to the operator and the subject during the acquisition, to enable intervention to reduce the subject motion. The most widely used form of motion monitoring for fMRI is based on volume-to-volume registration (VVR), which quantifies motion as the misalignment between subsequent volumes. However, motion is not constrained to occur only at the boundaries of volume acquisition, but instead may occur at any time. Consequently, each slice of an fMRI acquisition may be displaced by motion, and assessment of whole volume to volume motion may be insensitive to both intra-volume and inter-volume motion that is revealed by displacement of the slices. We developed the first slice-by-slice self-navigated motion monitoring system for fMRI by developing a real-time slice-to-volume registration (SVR) algorithm. Our real-time SVR algorithm, which is the core of the system, uses a local image patch-based matching criterion along with a Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer, all accelerated via symmetric multi-processing, with interleaved and simultaneous multi-slice acquisition schemes. Extensive experimental results on real motion data demonstrated that our fast motion monitoring system, named Slice Localization Integrated MRI Monitoring (SLIMM), provides more accurate motion measurements than a VVR based approach. Therefore, SLIMM offers improved online motion monitoring which is particularly important in fMRI for challenging patient populations. Real-time motion monitoring is crucial for online data quality control and assurance, for enabling feedback to the subject and the operator to act to mitigate motion, and in adaptive acquisition strategies that aim to ensure enough data of sufficient quality is acquired without acquiring excess data."}}

A critical procedure for bone tumor resection is to plan a set of cut planes that enable resecting the bone tumor with a safe margin while preserving the maximum amount of healthy bone. Currently, the surgeons rely on manual methods to plan the cut planes, which highly depend on the surgeons' experiences and have been demonstrated to be error-prone, and in turn, increase the recurrence rate or resect much healthy bone. This study targets on improving the precision of cut plane planning for the image guided pelvis tumor resection surgeries. A semi-automatic approach to cut plane planning was proposed via a coarse-to-fine strategy. It can efficiently identify a dangerous region in the 3D space, which contains the bone tumor and its surrounding normal tissue with a safe margin. By projecting the dangerous region into an appropriate 2D space, a segmented boundary-constrained linear regression method was leveraged to plan a set of 3D cut planes that ensure the minimum area of the resected specimen in the 2D space while having the dangerous region cleared. Further, a coarse-to-fine 3D cut plane planning method was developed by incorporating a 3D cut plane refinement scheme with our 2D planning method. Extensive experiments, on the surgical data from nine previous pelvis tumor resection surgeries, demonstrated that our proposed approach substantially improved the localization precision of cut planes (p <; 0.001) and decreased the amount of resected specimen (p <; 0.05), as compared to the manual method."}}

Abstract The paper formulates the subspace clustering as a problem of structured representation learning. It is proved that the sparsity of the data representation is significantly promoted by propagating a low-rank structure, leading to a more robust description of the clustering structure. Based on a theoretical proof to support this observation, a novel subspace clustering algorithm is proposed with the structured representation. Two cascade self-expressions are leveraged to implement the propagation. One leads to a low-rank representation of the data samples by exploiting the global structure; whereas the other generates a sparse representation of the former low-rank representation to capture the neighborhood structure. The proposed representation strategy is further investigated from both a geometric and a physical perspective. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms most state-of-the-art methods."}}

We achieved superior reconstruction to state-of-the-art work by introducing a new multi-scale gradient field prior that guides the reconstruction of the high-resolution (HR) image. The prior improves both spatial smoothness and edge preservation. The inverse of the forward model of image formation is used to propagate the gradient guidance from the low-resolution (LR) images to the HR image space. The gradient fields over multiple scales were exploited for more accurate edge localization in the reconstruction. The proposed SRR allows inter-volume motion during the MRI scans and can incorporate with the LR images with arbitrary orientations and displacements in the frequency space, such as orthogonal and origin-shifted scans. The proposed approach was evaluated on the synthetic data as well as the data acquired on a Siemens 3T MRI scanner containing 45 MRI scans from 14 subjects. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed prior leads to improved SRR as compared to state-of-the-art priors, and that the proposed SRR obtains better results at lower or the same cost in scan time than direct HR acquisition. In particular, the anatomical structures of hippocampus can be clearly shown in our reconstructed images. This is a significant improvement for the in vivo studies of the hippocampus."}}

The locality is formulated as a subspace model and exploited under a unified structure of discriminative dictionary learning with a subspace structure. Using the learned dictionary, the target and its background can be described and distinguished effectively through their sparse codes. As a result, the target is localized by integrating both the descriptive and the discriminative qualities.
