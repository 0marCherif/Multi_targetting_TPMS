Given the extent to which the brain has been studied, there is also available ontological knowledge encoding the current state of the art regarding its different areas, activation patterns, keywords associated with studies, etc. Furthermore, there is inherent uncertainty associated with brain scans arising from the mapping between voxels\u20143D pixels\u2014and actual points in different individual brains. Unfortunately, there is currently no unifying framework for accessing such collections of rich heterogeneous data under uncertainty, making it necessary for researchers to rely on ad hoc tools. In particular, one major weakness of current tools that attempt to address this task is that only very limited propositional query languages have been developed. In this paper we present NeuroLang, a probabilistic language based on first-order logic with existential rules, probabilistic uncertainty, ontologies integration under the open world assumption, and built-in mechanisms to guarantee tractable query answering over very large datasets. NeuroLang\u2019s primary objective is to provide a unified framework to seamlessly integrate heterogeneous data, such as ontologies, and map fine-grained cognitive domains to brain regions through a set of formal criteria, promoting shareable and highly reproducible research. After presenting the language and its general query answering architecture, we discuss real-world use cases showing how NeuroLang can be applied to practical scenarios."}}

This task is challenging for large population studies where thousands of measurements are performed over a cohort of hundreds of subjects, resulting in a massive latent parameter space. This large cardinality renders off-the-shelf Variational Inference (VI) computationally impractical.\n\nIn this work, we design structured VI families that can efficiently tackle large population studies. Our main idea is to share the parameterization and learning across the different i.i.d. variables in a generative model --symbolized by the model\u2019s plates. We name this concept plate amortization, and illustrate the powerful synergies it entitles, resulting in expressive, parsimoniously parameterized and orders of magnitude faster to train large scale hierarchical variational distributions.\n\nWe illustrate the practical utility of PAVI through a challenging Neuroimaging example featuring a million latent parameters, demonstrating a significant step towards scalable and expressive Variational Inference."}}

An important step forward has been the creation of large-scale public image repositories, such as NeuroVault. Such repositories enable comparing images across studies and automatically associating them with cognitive terms. Yet, this type of meta-analysis faces a major roadblock: the scarcity and inconsistency of image annotations and metadata. Another resource containing rich annotations is the neuroscientific literature. However it only yields a handful of brain-space coordinates per publication, those of the main activity peaks reported in each study. In this work, we propose Peaks2Image, a neuralnetwork approach to reconstructing continuous spatial representations of brain activity from peak activation tables. Using reconstructions of studies published in the neuroscientific literature, we train a decoder using tf-idf features as labels, leading to a much broader set of decoded terms than current image-based studies. We validate the decoder on 43,000 NeuroVault images, successfully decoding 58 out of 81 concepts in a zero-shot setting."}}

Such high dimensionality hampers the usage of modern, expressive flow-based techniques. To infer parameter posterior distributions in this challenging class of problems, we designed a novel methodology that automatically produces a variational family dual to a target HBM. This variational family, represented as a neural network, consists in the combination of an attention-based hierarchical encoder feeding summary statistics to a set of normalizing flows. Our automatically-derived neural network exploits exchangeability in the plate-enriched HBM and factorizes its parameter space. The resulting architecture reduces by orders of magnitude its parameterization with respect to that of a typical flow-based representation, while maintaining expressivity. Our method performs inference on the specified HBM in an amortized setup: once trained, it can readily be applied to a new data sample to compute the parameters' full posterior. We demonstrate the capability and scalability of our method on simulated data, as well as a challenging high-dimensional brain parcellation experiment.

Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) databases are built by extracting both coordinates of reported peak activations and term associations using natural language processing techniques from neuroimaging studies. Solving term-based queries on these databases makes it possible to obtain statistical maps of the brain related to specific cognitive processes. However, existing tools for analysing CBMA data are limited in their expressivity to propositional logic, restricting the variety of their queries. Moreover, with tools like Neurosynth, term-based queries on multiple terms often lead to power failure, because too few studies from the database contribute to the statistical estimations. We design a probabilistic domain-specific language (DSL) standing on Datalog and one of its probabilistic extensions, CP-Logic, for expressing and solving complex logic-based queries. We show how CBMA databases can be encoded as probabilistic programs. Using the joint distribution of their Bayesian network translation, we show that solutions of queries on these programs compute the right probability distributions of voxel activations. We explain how recent lifted query processing algorithms make it possible to scale to the size of large neuroimaging data, where knowledge compilation techniques fail to solve queries fast enough for practical applications. Finally, we introduce a method for relating studies to terms probabilistically, leading to better solutions for two-term conjunctive queries (CQs) on smaller databases. We demonstrate results for two-term CQs, both on simulated meta-analysis databases and on the widely used Neurosynth database."}}

Diffusion-Weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is sensitive to changes in permeability; however, the parameter has so far remained elusive due to the lack of general biophysical models that incorporate it. Machine learning based computational models can potentially be used to estimate such parameters. Recently, for the first time, a theoretical framework using a random forest (RF) regressor suggests that this is a promising new approach for permeability estimation. In this study, we adopt such an approach and for the first time experimentally investigate it for demyelinating pathologies through direct comparison with histology. We construct a computational model using Monte Carlo simulations and an RF regressor in order to learn a mapping between features derived from DW-MRI signals and ground truth microstructure parameters. We test our model in simulations, and find strong correlations between the predicted and ground truth parameters (intra-axonal volume fraction f: R2 =0.99, \u03c4i: R2 =0.84, intrinsic diffusivity d: R2 =0.99). We then apply the model in-vivo, on a controlled cuprizone (CPZ) mouse model of demyelination, comparing the results from two cohorts of mice, CPZ (N=8) and healthy age-matched wild-type (WT, N=8). We find that the RF model estimates sensible microstructure parameters for both groups, matching values found in literature. Furthermore, we perform histology for both groups using electron microscopy (EM), measuring the thickness of the myelin sheath as a surrogate for exchange time. Histology results show that our RF model estimates are very strongly correlated with the EM measurements (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.98 for f, \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.82 for \u03c4i). Finally, we find a statistically significant decrease in \u03c4i in all three regions of the corpus callosum (splenium/genu/body) of the CPZ cohort (<\u03c4i>=310ms/330ms/350ms) compared to the WT group (<\u03c4i>=370ms/370ms/380ms). This is in line with our expectations that \u03c4i is lower in regions where the myelin sheath is damaged, as axonal membranes become more permeable. Overall, these results demonstrate, for the first time experimentally and in vivo, that a computational model learned from simulations can reliably estimate microstructure parameters, including the axonal permeability ."}}
