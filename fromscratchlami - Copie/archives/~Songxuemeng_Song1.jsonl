Existing SGG approaches generally not only neglect the insufficient modality fusion between vision and language, but also fail to provide informative predicates due to the biased relationship predictions, leading SGG far from practical. Towards this end, we first present a novel Stacked Hybrid-Attention network, which facilitates the intra-modal refinement as well as the intermodal interaction, to serve as the encoder. We then devise an innovative Group Collaborative Learning strategy to optimize the decoder. Particularly, based on the observation that the recognition capability of one classifier is limited towards an extremely unbalanced dataset, we first deploy a group of classifiers that are expert in distinguishing different subsets of classes, and then cooperatively optimize them from two aspects to promote the unbiased SGG. Experiments conducted on VG and GQA datasets demonstrate that, we not only establish a new state-of-the-art in the unbiased metric, but also nearly double the performance compared with two baselines.

Although existing studies have achieved prominent progress, most of them overlook the essential global outfit representation learning, and the hidden complementary factors behind the outfit compatibility uncovering. Towards this end, we propose an Outfit Compatibility Modeling scheme via Complementary Factorization, termed as OCM-CF. In particular, OCM-CF consists of two key components: context-aware outfit representation modeling and hidden complementary factors modeling. The former works on adaptively learning the global outfit representation with graph convolutional networks and the multi-head attention mechanism, where the item context is fully explored. The latter targets at uncovering the latent complementary factors with multiple parallel networks, each of which corresponds to a factor-oriented context-aware outfit representation modeling. In this part, a new orthogonality-based complementarity regularization is proposed to encourage the learned factors to complement each other and better characterize the outfit compatibility. Finally, the outfit compatibility is obtained by summing all the hidden complementary factor-oriented outfit compatibility scores, each of which is derived from the corresponding outfit representation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our OCM-CF over the state-of-the-art methods."}}

Different users place different importance to these aspects which can be thought of as a pref- erence/attention weight vector. Most existing rec- ommender systems assume that for an individual, this vector is the same for all items. However, this assumption is often invalid, especially when con- sidering a user\u2019s interactions with items of diverse characteristics. To tackle this problem, in this pa- per, we develop a novel aspect-aware recommender model named A3NCF, which can capture the vary- ing aspect attentions that a user pays to different items. Specifically, we design a new topic model to extract user preferences and item characteristics from review texts. They are then used to 1) guide the representation learning of users and items, and 2) capture a user\u2019s special attention on each as- pect of the targeted item with an attention network. Through extensive experiments on several large- scale datasets, we demonstrate that our model out- performs the state-of-the-art review-aware recom- mender systems in the rating prediction task."}}
