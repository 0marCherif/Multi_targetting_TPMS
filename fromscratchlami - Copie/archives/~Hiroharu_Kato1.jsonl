Because of this ambiguity, although a 3D object reconstructor can be trained using a single view or a few views per object, reconstructed shapes only fit the observed views and appear incorrect from the unobserved viewpoints. To reconstruct shapes that look reasonable from any viewpoint, we propose to train a discriminator that learns prior knowledge regarding possible views. The discriminator is trained to distinguish the reconstructed views of the observed viewpoints from those of the unobserved viewpoints. The reconstructor is trained to correct unobserved views by fooling the discriminator. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and natural image datasets; this validates the effectiveness of our method."}}

However, learning to generate euphonious\nmelody has turned out to be highly challenging due to a number of factors. Representation\nof multivariate property of notes has been one of the primary challenges.\nIt is also difficult to remain in the permissible spectrum of musical variety, outside\nof which would be perceived as a plain random play without auditory pleasantness.\nObserving the conventional structure of pop music poses further challenges.\nIn this paper, we propose to represent each note and its properties as a unique\n\u2018word,\u2019 thus lessening the prospect of misalignments between the properties, as\nwell as reducing the complexity of learning. We also enforce regularization policies\non the range of notes, thus encouraging the generated melody to stay close\nto what humans would find easy to follow. Furthermore, we generate melody\nconditioned on song part information, thus replicating the overall structure of a\nfull song. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate auditorily\npleasant songs that are more indistinguishable from human-written ones than\nprevious models."}}

A polygon mesh is a promising candidate for its compactness and geometric properties. However, it is not straightforward to model a polygon mesh from 2D images using neural networks because the conversion from a mesh to an image, or rendering, involves a discrete operation called rasterization, which prevents back-propagation. Therefore, in this work, we propose an approximate gradient for rasterization that enables the integration of rendering into neural networks. Using this renderer, we perform single-image 3D mesh reconstruction with silhouette image supervision and our system outperforms the existing voxel-based approach. Additionally, we perform gradient-based 3D mesh editing operations, such as 2D-to-3D style transfer and 3D DeepDream, with 2D supervision for the first time. These applications demonstrate the potential of the integration of a mesh renderer into neural networks and the effectiveness of our proposed renderer."}}

BoVW is defined here as a histogram of quantized descriptors extracted densely on a regular grid at a single scale. Despite its wide use, no report describes reconstruction of the original image of a BoVW. This task is challenging for two reasons: 1) BoVW includes quantization errors when local descriptors are assigned to visual words. 2) BoVW lacks spatial information of local descriptors when we count the occurrence of visual words. To tackle this difficult task, we use a large-scale image database to estimate the spatial arrangement of local descriptors. Then this task creates a jigsaw puzzle problem with adjacency and global location costs of visual words. Solving this optimization problem is also challenging because it is known as an NP-Hard problem. We propose a heuristic but efficient method to optimize it. To underscore the effectiveness of our method, we apply it to BoVWs extracted from about 100 different categories and demonstrate that it can reconstruct the original images, although the image features lack spatial information and include quantization errors."}}
