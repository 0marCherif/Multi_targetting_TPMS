Though state-of-the-art models can generate high-quality images of common entities, they often have difficulty generating images of uncommon entities, such as `Chortai (dog)' or `Picarones (food)'. To tackle this issue, we present the Retrieval-Augmented Text-to-Image Generator (Re-Imagen), a generative model that uses retrieved information to produce high-fidelity and faithful images, even for rare or unseen entities. Given a text prompt, Re-Imagen accesses an external multi-modal knowledge base to retrieve relevant (image, text) pairs, and uses them as references to generate the image. With this retrieval step, Re-Imagen is augmented with the knowledge of high-level semantics and low-level visual details of the mentioned entities, and thus improves its accuracy in generating the entities' visual appearances. We train Re-Imagen on a constructed dataset containing (image,text,retrieval) triples to teach the model to ground on both text prompt and retrieval. Furthermore, we develop a new sampling strategy to interleave the classifier-free guidance for text and retrieval condition to balance the text and retrieval alignment. Re-Imagen achieves new SoTA FID results on two image generation benchmarks, such as COCO (\\ie, FID = 5.25) and WikiImage (\\ie, FID = 5.82) without fine-tuning. To further evaluate the capabilities of the model, we introduce EntityDrawBench, a new benchmark that evaluates image generation for diverse entities, from frequent to rare, across multiple visual domains. Human evaluation on EntityDrawBench shows that Re-Imagen performs on par with the best prior models in photo-realism, but with significantly better real-world faithfulness, especially on less frequent entities.

This urgency gives rise to the need to make QA systems robust to misinformation, a topic previously unexplored. We study the risk of misinformation to QA models by investigating the behavior of the QA model under contradicting contexts that are mixed with both real and fake information. We create the first large-scale dataset for this problem, namely ContraQA, which contains over 10K human-written and model-generated contradicting pairs of contexts. Experiments show that QA models are vulnerable under contradicting contexts brought by misinformation. To defend against such a threat, we build a misinformation-aware QA system as a counter-measure that integrates question answering and misinformation detection in a joint fashion. "}}

Lots of facts can evolve with respect to time. For example, the U.S. President might change every four years. Therefore, it is important to consider the time dimension and empower the existing QA models to reason over time. However, the existing QA datasets contain rather few time-sensitive questions, hence not suitable for diagnosing or benchmarking the model's temporal reasoning capability. In order to promote research in this direction, we propose to construct a time-sensitive QA dataset. The dataset is constructed by 1) mining time-evolving facts from WikiData and aligning them to their corresponding Wikipedia page, 2) employing crowd workers to verify and calibrate these noisy facts, 3) generating question-answer pairs based on the annotated time-sensitive facts. Our dataset poses challenges in the aspect of both temporal understanding and temporal reasoning. We evaluate different SoTA long-document QA systems like BigBird and FiD on our dataset. The best-performing model FiD can only achieve 46\\% accuracy, still far behind the human performance of 87\\%. We demonstrate that these models are still lacking the ability to perform consistent temporal reasoning. Therefore, we believe that our dataset could serve as a benchmark to develop NLP models more sensitive to temporal shifts."}}

In this work, we study model-agnostic explanations of a representative text generation task -- dialogue response generation. Dialog response generation is challenging with its open-ended sentences and multiple acceptable responses. To gain insights into the reasoning process of a generation model, we propose a new method, local explanation of response generation (LERG) that regards the explanations as the mutual interaction of segments in input and output sentences. LERG views the sequence prediction as uncertainty estimation of a human response and then creates explanations by perturbing the input and calculating the certainty change over the human response. We show that LERG adheres to desired properties of explanations for text generation including unbiased approximation, consistency and cause identification. Empirically, our results show that our method consistently improves other widely used methods on proposed automatic- and human- evaluation metrics for this new task by $4.4$-$12.8$\\%. Our analysis demonstrates that LERG can extract both explicit and implicit relations between input and output segments."}}

To mitigate this problem, we propose a causality-based training framework to reduce the spurious correlations caused by observed confounders. We give theoretical analysis on the underlying general Structural Causal Model (SCM) and propose to perform Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) on the interventional distribution instead of the observational distribution, namely Counterfactual Maximum Likelihood Estimation (CMLE). As the interventional distribution, in general, is hidden from the observational data, we then derive two different upper bounds of the expected negative log-likelihood and propose two general algorithms, Implicit CMLE and Explicit CMLE, for causal predictions of deep learning models using observational data. We conduct experiments on both simulated data and two real-world tasks: Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Image Captioning. The results show that CMLE methods outperform the regular MLE method in terms of out-of-domain generalization performance and reducing spurious correlations, while maintaining comparable performance on the regular evaluations."}}

Robust numerical reasoning likewise faces unique challenges in this domain. In this work, we focus on answering deep questions over financial data, aiming to automate the analysis of a large corpus of financial documents. In contrast to existing tasks on general domain, the finance domain includes complex numerical reasoning and understanding of heterogeneous representations. To facilitate analytical progress, we propose a new large-scale dataset, FinQA, with Question-Answering pairs over Financial reports, written by financial experts. We also annotate the gold reasoning programs to ensure full explainability. We further introduce baselines and conduct comprehensive experiments in our dataset. The results demonstrate that popular, large, pre-trained models fall far short of expert humans in acquiring finance knowledge and in complex multi-step numerical reasoning on that knowledge. Our dataset --- the first of its kind --- should therefore enable significant, new community research into complex application domains.

Most open QA systems have considered only retrieving information from unstructured text.  Here we consider for the first time open QA over {\\em both} tabular and textual data and present a new large-scale dataset \\emph{Open Table-and-Text Question Answering} (OTT-QA) to evaluate performance on this task. Most questions in OTT-QA require multi-hop inference across tabular data and unstructured text, and the evidence required to answer a question can be distributed in different ways over these two types of input, making evidence retrieval challenging---our baseline model using an iterative retriever and BERT-based reader achieves an exact match score less than 10\\%. We then propose two novel techniques to address the challenge of retrieving and aggregating evidence for OTT-QA. The first technique is to use ``early fusion'' to group multiple highly relevant tabular and textual units into a fused block, which provides more context for the retriever to search for.  The second technique is to use a cross-block reader to model the cross-dependency between multiple retrieved evidence with global-local sparse attention. Combining these two techniques improves the score significantly, to above 27\\%."}}
{"id": "S1xFm6VKDH", "cdate": 1569439008919, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Meta Module Network for Compositional Visual Reasoning", "abstract": "There are two main lines of research on visual reasoning: neural module network (NMN) with explicit multi-hop reasoning through handcrafted neural modules, and monolithic network with implicit reasoning in the latent feature space. The former excels in interpretability and compositionality, while the latter usually achieves better performance due to model flexibility and parameter efficiency.  \nIn order to bridge the gap of the two, we present Meta Module Network (MMN), a novel hybrid approach that can efficiently utilize a Meta Module to perform versatile functionalities, while preserving compositionality and interpretability through modularized design. The proposed model first parses an input question into a functional program through a Program Generator. Instead of handcrafting a task-specific network to represent each function like traditional NMN, we use Recipe Encoder to translate the functions into their corresponding recipes (specifications), which are used to dynamically instantiate the Meta Module into Instance Modules. To endow different instance modules with designated functionality, a Teacher-Student framework is proposed, where a symbolic teacher pre-executes against the scene graphs to provide guidelines for the instantiated modules (student) to follow. In a nutshell, MMN adopts the meta module to increase its parameterization efficiency, and uses recipe encoding to improve its generalization ability over NMN. Experiments conducted on the GQA benchmark demonstrates that: (1) MMN achieves significant improvement over both NMN and monolithic network baselines; (2) MMN is able to generalize to unseen but related functions."}}

However, existing studies are mainly restricted to dealing with unstructured evidence (e.g., natural language sentences and documents, news, etc), while verification under structured evidence, such as tables, graphs, and databases, remains unexplored. This paper specifically aims to study the fact verification given semi-structured data as evidence. To this end, we construct a large-scale dataset called TabFact with 16k Wikipedia tables as the evidence for 118k human-annotated natural language statements, which are labeled as either ENTAILED or REFUTED. TabFact is challenging since it involves both soft linguistic reasoning and hard symbolic reasoning. To address these reasoning challenges, we design two different models: Table-BERT and Latent Program Algorithm (LPA). Table-BERT leverages the state-of-the-art pre-trained language model to encode the linearized tables and statements into continuous vectors for verification. LPA parses statements into LISP-like programs and executes them against the tables to obtain the returned binary value for verification. Both methods achieve similar accuracy but still lag far behind human performance. We also perform a comprehensive analysis to demonstrate great future opportunities."}}

However, deep neural networks are also known to have very little control over its uncertainty for test examples, which potentially causes very harmful and annoying consequences in practical scenarios. In this paper, we are particularly interested in designing a higher-order uncertainty metric for deep neural networks and investigate its performance on the out-of-distribution detection task proposed by~\\cite{hendrycks2016baseline}. Our method first assumes there exists a underlying higher-order distribution $\\mathcal{P}(z)$, which generated label-wise distribution $\\mathcal{P}(y)$ over classes on the K-dimension simplex, and then approximate such higher-order distribution via parameterized posterior function $p_{\\theta}(z|x)$ under variational inference framework, finally we use the entropy of learned posterior distribution $p_{\\theta}(z|x)$ as uncertainty measure to detect out-of-distribution examples. However, we identify the overwhelming over-concentration issue in such a framework, which greatly hinders the detection performance. Therefore, we further design a log-smoothing function to alleviate such issue to greatly increase the robustness of the proposed entropy-based uncertainty measure. Through comprehensive experiments on various datasets and architectures, our proposed variational Dirichlet framework with entropy-based uncertainty measure is consistently observed to yield significant improvements over many baseline systems."}}
