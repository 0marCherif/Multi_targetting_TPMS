Inspired by the growing body of work on Normalizing Flows, we enlarge this class of priors through a parametric invertible transformation that can be made input-dependent. Doing so also allows us to encode interpretable prior knowledge (e.g., boundedness constraints). We derive a variational approximation to the resulting Bayesian inference problem, which is as fast as stochastic variational GP regression (Hensman et al., 2013; Dezfouli and Bonilla, 2015). This makes the model a computationally efficient alternative to other hierarchical extensions of GP priors (L\u00e1zaro-Gredilla,2012; Damianou and Lawrence,2013). The resulting algorithm\u2019s computational and inferential performance is excellent, and we demonstrate this on a range of data sets. For example, even with only 5 inducing points and an input-dependent flow, our method is consistently competitive with a standard sparse GP fitted using 100 inducing points."}}

However, due to their overparameterization, their generalization capabilities are in doubt and still a field under study. Consequently, DNN can overfit and assign overconfident predictions \u2013 effects that have been shown to affect the calibration of the confidences assigned to unseen data. Data Augmentation (DA) strategies have been proposed to regularize these models, being Mixup one of the most popular due to its ability to improve the accuracy, the uncertainty quantification and the calibration of DNN. In this work however we argue and provide empirical evidence that, due to its fundamentals, Mixup does not necessarily improve calibration. Based on our observations we propose a new loss function that improves the calibration, and also sometimes the accuracy, of DNN trained with this DA technique. Our loss is inspired by Bayes decision theory and introduces a new training framework for designing losses for probabilistic modelling. We provide state-of-the-art accuracy with consistent improvements in calibration performance. (Appendix and code are provided here: GitHub link )"}}

In this setting, the aim of the probabilistic model is to assist an expert practitioner towards identifying the location pattern of antibody deposits within a glomerulus. Since modern neural networks often provide overconfident outputs, we stress the importance of having a reliable prediction, demonstrating that Temperature Scaling (TS), a recently introduced re-calibration technique, can be successfully applied to immunofluorescence classification in renal biopsy. Experimental results demonstrate that the designed model yields good accuracy on the specific task, and that TS is able to provide reliable probabilities, which are highly valuable for such a task given the low inter-rater agreement."}}

However, recent works have pointed out that the outputs provided by these models are not well-calibrated, seriously limiting their use in critical decision scenarios. In this work, we propose to use a decoupled Bayesian stage, implemented with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), to map the uncalibrated probabilities provided by a DNN to calibrated ones, consistently improving calibration. Our results evidence that incorporating uncertainty provides more reliable probabilistic models, a critical condition for achieving good calibration. We report a generous collection of experimental results using high-accuracy DNNs in standardized image classification benchmarks, showing the good performance, flexibility and robust behaviour of our approach with respect to several state-of-the-art calibration methods.

First, different anchoring strategies are proposed, with the objective of adapting the LR computation process to the case at hand, always respecting the propositions defined for the particular case. Second, a fully-Bayesian Gaussian model is used to tackle the sparsity in the training scores that is often present when the proposed anchoring strategies are used. Experiments are performed using the 2014 i-Vector challenge set-up, which presents high variability in a telephone speech context. The results show that the proposed fully-Bayesian model clearly outperforms a more common Maximum-Likelihood approach, leading to high robustness when the scores to train the model become sparse."}}

We compare the use of two well established techniques, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Variational Auto-encoders, as generative models in order to increase the training set in a classification framework. Essentially, we rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for generating new samples. We show that generalization can be improved comparing this methodology to other state-of-the-art techniques, e.g. semi-supervised learning with ladder networks. Furthermore, we show that RBM is better than VAE generating new samples for training a classifier with good generalization capabilities."}}

However, the best results were achieved with a training process that is divided in two parts: first an unsupervised pre-training step is done for initializing the weights of the network and after these weights are refined with the use of supervised data. On the other hand adversarial noise has improved the results of clas- sical supervised learning. Recently, a new neural network topology called Ladder Network, where the key idea is based in some properties of hierar- chichal latent variable models, has been proposed as a technique to train a neural network using supervised and unsupervised data at the same time with what is called semi-supervised learning. This technique has reached state of the art classification. In this work we add adversarial noise to the ladder network and get state of the art classification, with several important conclusions on how adversarial noise can help in addition with new possible lines of investi- gation. We also propose an alternative to add adversarial noise to unsu- pervised data."}}
