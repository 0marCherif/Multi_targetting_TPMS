In this paper, we propose a Deep Conditional Variational Autoencoder based model that synthesizes diverse anatomically plausible 3D-pose samples conditioned on the estimated 2D-pose. We show that CVAE-based 3D-pose sample set is consistent with the 2D-pose and helps tackling the inherent ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. We propose two strategies for obtaining the final 3D pose-(a) depth-ordering/ordinal relations to score and weight-average the candidate 3D-poses, referred to as OrdinalScore, and (b) with supervision from an Oracle. We report close to state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets using OrdinalScore, and state-of-the-art results using the Oracle. We also show that our pipeline yields competitive results without paired image-to-3D annotations. The training and evaluation code is available at https://github. com/ssfootball04/generative_pose."}}

The underlying assumption is that randomly cropped and resized regions of a given image share information about the objects of interest, which the learned representation will capture. This assumption is mostly satisfied in datasets such as ImageNet where there is a large, centered object, which is highly likely to be present in random crops of the full image. However, in other datasets such as OpenImages or COCO, which are more representative of real world uncurated data, there are typically multiple small objects in an image. In this work, we show that self-supervised learning based on the usual random cropping performs poorly on such datasets. We propose replacing one or both of the random crops with crops obtained from an object proposal algorithm. This encourages the model to learn both object and scene level semantic representations. Using this approach, which we call object-aware cropping, results in significant improvements over scene cropping on classification and object detection benchmarks. For example, on OpenImages, our approach achieves an improvement of 8.8% mAP over random scene-level cropping using MoCo-v2 based pre-training. We also show significant improvements on COCO and PASCAL-VOC object detection and segmentation tasks over the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches.\nOur approach is efficient, simple and general, and can be used in most existing contrastive and non-contrastive self-supervised learning frameworks.

However, due to the intractability of reasoning in large, expressive knowledge bases (KBs), many AI systems have limited reasoning capabilities. Successful cognitive systems have used a variety of machine learning and axiom selection methods to improve inference. In this paper, we describe a search heuristic that uses a Monte-Carlo simulation technique to choose inference steps. We test the efficacy of this approach on a very large and expressive KB, Cyc. Experimental results on hundreds of queries show that this method is highly effective in reducing inference time and improving question-answering (Q/A) performance."}}
