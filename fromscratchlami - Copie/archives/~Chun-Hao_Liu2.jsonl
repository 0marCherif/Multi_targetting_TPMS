Imbalanced datasets in real-world object detection often suffer from a large disparity in the number of instances for each class. To improve the generalization performance of object detection models on rare classes, various data sampling techniques have been proposed. Repeat factor sampling (RFS) has shown promise due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Despite its efficiency, RFS completely neglects the instance counts and solely relies on the image count during re-sampling process. However, instance count may immensely vary for different classes with similar image counts. Such variation highlights the importance of both image and instance for addressing the long-tail distributions. Thus, we propose IRFS which unifies instance and image counts for the re-sampling process to be aware of different perspectives of the imbalance in long-tailed datasets. Our method shows promising results on the challenging LVIS v1.0 benchmark dataset over various architectures and backbones, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving the performance of object detection models on rare classes with a relative $+50\\%$ average precision (AP) improvement over counterpart RFS. IRFS can serve as a strong baseline and be easily incorporated into existing long-tailed frameworks."}}

In this work, we first collect the construction site data by driving around our dozers. Then we analyze the data thoroughly to understand its distribution. Finally, two well-known object detection models are trained, and their performances are benchmarked with a wide range of training strategies and hyperparameters."}}

The proposed model generates a desirable radio heatmap and its respective radio dot layout from a given floor plan with wall types, physical dimension, and macro-cell interference, by learning from the accumulated indoor radio designs by human experts. Considering the nature of radio propagation, two new loss functions and a two-stage training strategy are proposed for the generator to learn the right direction of signal propagation and precise dot locations, in addition to a sectional analysis for dealing with large floor plans. Experimental results show that the new model is effectively generating acceptable dot layout designs and that dimension-awareness is a key enabler for this type of prediction."}}

A key factor in DSA networks with multiple channels and multiple users is to establish efficient spectrum sensing and transmission schedules. Multi-user cooperative spectrum sensing reduces the sensing time, thus increasing transmission throughput. At the same time, it may remove transmission opportunities for users participating in the sensing, thereby decreasing the throughput. Furthermore, in a multi-channel network, where the users experience different channel qualities, the problem of designing optimal sensing and transmission schedules becomes more complex. Sensing schedule indicates to each user the channel that it must sense at different sensing moments, and transmission schedules indicates which user should use a found opportunity. In this paper, we explore this problem and then investigate optimal ways to find a joint sensing and transmission schedule. We propose three joint sensing-transmission strategies. Within each one of them, several solutions striking a balance between throughput performance, memory usage, and computational complexity are proposed. Due to the complex nature of optimal solutions, we also propose different heuristics. Simulation results show that the proposed heuristics perform well and thus can be employed in practical scenarios."}}

One potential solution to improve the spectrum utilization is through cognitive radio (CR). Traditional CR approach adopts the sense-and-transmit strategy to exploit more transmission opportunities. After CR senses the RF channel, it will utilize this channel as long as it is not occupied by licensed users. However, there are some limitations using this approach. First, if the licensed users appear while CR is transmitting on the same channel, the collision occurs. Second, if the licensed users stop transmitting and CR does not detect this opportunity, the throughput loss occurs.In this dissertation, we focus on studying the statistical properties of the licensed channel bands, and explore the approaches to exploit the tra\ufb03c knowledge to improve the traditional CR strategy. The statistical knowledge of the busy/idle period on the licensed channel allows CR to switch to better channels to increase throughput. To this end, our goal is to develop tra\ufb03c-aware spectrum sharing protocols. As a \ufb01rst step, we proposed a tra\ufb03c classi\ufb01er to classify the distribution for the idle/busy period using less number of observations and extended to the cases where there is no perfect knowledge of tra\ufb03c parameters and periods. We also proposed a tra\ufb03c prediction algorithm based on Markov chain derivation and estimated tra\ufb03c parameters, and we analyzed the impact of estimation errors on the prediction accuracy. Based on this result, we furtherdesigned spectrum sharing protocols with multi-channel sensing strategies for CRusers. The CR users are scheduled for their transmission and cooperative sensingstrategies in order to achieve maximal user throughput. We proposed to solvethe scheduling optimization problem with four low-complexity strategies, i.e.,sequential, parallel, sequential-parallel, and iterative-parallel sensing strategies.The optimal sensing order for sequential strategy was derived, and we also pro-posed several heuristics to further reduce the computation complexity for otherstrategies. Furthermore, this protocol is designed to be robust to both channeland tra\ufb03c uncertainties."}}
