In this challenge, it will be computationally inefficient using existing global BN structure learning algorithms to find an entire BN structure to achieve the part of a BN structure in which we are interested. And local BN structure learning algorithms encounter the false edge orientation problem when they are directly used to tackle this challenging problem. In this paper, we first present a new concept of Expand-Backtracking to explain why local BN structure learning methods have the false edge orientation problem, then propose APSL, an efficient and accurate Any Part of BN Structure Learning algorithm. Specifically, APSL divides the V-structures in a Markov blanket (MB) into two types: collider V-structure and non-collider V-structure, then it starts from a node of interest and recursively finds both collider V-structures and non-collider V-structures in the found MBs, until the part of a BN structure in which we are interested are oriented. To improve the efficiency of APSL, we further design the APSL-FS algorithm using Feature Selection, APSL-FS. Using six benchmark BNs, the extensive experiments have validated the efficiency and accuracy of our methods."}}

In recent years, a need for estimating the heterogeneous treatment effects conditioning on the different characteristics of individuals has emerged from research fields such as personalized healthcare, social science, and online marketing. To meet the need, researchers and practitioners from different communities have developed algorithms by taking the treatment effect heterogeneity modeling approach and the uplift modeling approach, respectively. In this paper, we provide a unified survey of these two seemingly disconnected yet closely related approaches under the potential outcome framework. We then provide a structured survey of existing methods by emphasizing on their inherent connections with a set of unified notations to make comparisons of the different methods easy. We then review the main applications of the surveyed methods in personalized marketing, personalized medicine, and social studies. Finally, we summarize the existing software packages and present discussions based on the use of methods on synthetic, semi-synthetic and real world data sets and provide some general guidelines for choosing methods."}}

Abstract Adverse drug events (ADEs) may occur and lead to severe consequences for the public, even though clinical trials are conducted in the stage of pre-market. Computational methods are still needed to fulfil the task of pharmacosurveillance. In post-market surveillance, the spontaneous reporting system (SRS) has been widely used to detect suspicious associations between medicines and ADEs. However, the passive mechanism of SRS leads to the hysteresis in ADE detection by SRS based methods, not mentioning the acknowledged problem of under-reporting and duplicate reporting in SRS. Therefore, there is a growing demand for other complementary methods utilising different types of healthcare data to assist with global pharmacosurveillance. Among those data sources, prescription data is of proved usefulness for pharmacosurveillance. However, few works have used prescription data for signalling ADEs. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to discover medicines that are responsible for a given ADE purely from prescription data. Our method uses a logistic regression model to evaluate the associations between up to hundreds of suspected medicines and an ADE spontaneously and selects the medicines possessing the most significant associations via Lasso regularisation. To prepare data for training the logistic regression model, we adapt the design of the case-crossover study to construct case time and control time windows for the extraction of medicine use information. While the case time window can be readily determined, we propose several criteria to select the suitable control time windows providing the maximum power of comparisons. In order to address confounding situations, we have considered diverse factors in medicine utilisation in terms of the temporal effect of medicine and the frequency of prescription, as well as the individual effect of patients on the occurrence of an ADE. To assess the performance of the proposed method, we conducted a case study with a real-world prescription dataset. Validated by the existing domain knowledge, our method successfully traced a wide range of medicines that are potentially responsible for the ADE. Further experiments were also carried out according to a recognised gold standard, our method achieved a sensitivity of 65.9% and specificity of 96.2%."}}

This type of predictions should be trusted less as absent words can be interpreted in multiple ways. In this work, we propose to improve the comprehensibility and accuracy of ensemble models by distinguishing word presence and absence. The presented method weights predictions based on word presence. Experimental results on 35 real text datasets indicate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art ensemble methods on various text classification tasks."}}

Propensity score is a common way to deal with a large covariate set, but the accuracy of propensity score estimation (normally done by logistic regression) is also challenged by large number of covariates. In this paper, we prove that a large covariate set can be reduced to a lower dimensional representation which captures the complete information for adjustment in causal effect estimation. The theoretical result enables effective data-driven algorithms for causal effect estimation. We develop an algorithm which employs a supervised kernel dimension reduction method to search for a lower dimensional representation for the original covariates, and then utilizes nearest neighbor matching in the reduced covariate space to impute the counterfactual outcomes to avoid large-sized covariate set problem. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on two semi-synthetic and three real-world datasets and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the algorithm."}}

For example, which customers are persuadable by a product promotion? which patients should be treated with a certain type of treatment? These are typical causal questions involving the effect or the change in outcomes made by an intervention. The questions cannot be answered with traditional classification methods as they only use associations to predict outcomes. For personalised marketing, these questions are often answered with uplift modelling. The objective of uplift modelling is to estimate causal effect, but its literature does not discuss when the uplift represents causal effect. Causal heterogeneity modelling can solve the problem, but its assumption of unconfoundedness is untestable in data. So practitioners need guidelines in their applications when using the methods. In this paper, we use causal classification for a set of personalised decision making problems, and differentiate it from classification. We discuss the conditions when causal classification can be resolved by uplift (and causal heterogeneity) modelling methods. We also propose a general framework for causal classification, by using off-the-shelf supervised methods for flexible implementations. Experiments have shown two instantiations of the framework work for causal classification and for uplift (causal heterogeneity) modelling, and are competitive with the other uplift (causal heterogeneity) modelling methods."}}

Unlike standard supervised learning, only the bag labels are observed whereas the label for each instance is not available to the learner. Previous MIL studies typically follow the i.i.d. assumption, that the training and test samples are independently drawn from the same distribution. However, such assumption is often violated in real-world applications. Efforts have been made towards addressing distribution changes by importance weighting the training data with the density ratio between the training and test samples. Unfortunately, models often need to be trained without seeing the test distributions. In this paper we propose possibly the first framework for addressing distribution change in MIL without requiring access to the unlabeled test data. Our framework builds upon identifying a novel connection between MIL and the potential outcome framework in causal effect estimation. Experimental results on synthetic distribution change datasets, real-world datasets with synthetic distribution biases and real distributional biased image classification datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach."}}

Such an \u201cexperiment on data\u201d to estimate the causal effect of the manipulated variable is useful for validating an experiment design using historical data or for exploring confounders when studying a new relationship. However, existing data-driven methods for causal effect estimation face some major challenges, including poor scalability with high dimensional data, low estimation accuracy due to heuristics used by the global causal structure learning algorithms, and the assumption of causal sufficiency when hidden variables are inevitable in data. In this paper, we develop theorems for using local search to find a superset of the adjustment (or confounding) variables for causal effect estimation from observational data under a realistic pretreatment assumption. The theorems ensure that the unbiased estimate of causal effect is included in the set of causal effects estimated by the superset of adjustment variables. Based on the developed theorems, we propose a data-driven algorithm for causal query. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is faster and produces better causal effect estimation than an existing data-driven causal effect estimation method with hidden variables. The causal effects estimated by the proposed algorithm are as accurate as those by the state-of-the-art methods using domain knowledge."}}
