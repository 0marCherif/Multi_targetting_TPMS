Compared with the conventional adversarial attacks that generate adversarial samples at the instance level, UAP can fool the target model for different instances with only a single perturbation, enabling us to evaluate the robustness of the model from a more effective and accurate perspective. The existing universal attack methods fail to exploit the differences and connections between the instance and universal levels to produce dominant perturbations. To address this challenge, we propose a new universal attack method that unifies instance-specific and universal attacks from a feature perspective to generate a more dominant UAP. Specifically, we reformulate the UAP generation task as a minimax optimization problem and then utilize the instance-specific attack method to solve the minimization problem thereby obtaining better training data for generating UAP. At the same time, we also introduce a consistency regularizer to explore the relationship between training data, thus further improving the dominance of the generated UAP. Furthermore, our method is generic with no additional assumptions about the training data and hence can be applied to both data-dependent (supervised) and data-independent (unsupervised) manners. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by a significant margin over the existing methods in both data-dependent and data-independent settings.

Previous works mostly study the transferability on non-targeted setting. However, recent studies show that targeted adversarial examples are more difficult to transfer than non-targeted ones. In this paper, we find there exist two defects that lead to the difficulty in generating transferable examples. First, the magnitude of gradient is decreasing during iterative attack, causing excessive consistency between two successive noises in accumulation of momentum, which is termed as noise curing. Second, it is not enough for targeted adversarial examples to just get close to target class without moving away from true class. To overcome the above problems, we propose a novel targeted attack approach to effectively generate more transferable adversarial examples. Specifically, we first introduce the Poincare distance as the similarity metric to make the magnitude of gradient self-adaptive during iterative attack to alleviate noise curing. Furthermore, we regularize the targeted attack process with metric learning to take adversarial examples away from true label and gain more transferable targeted adversarial examples. Experiments on ImageNet validate the superiority of our approach achieving 8% higher attack success rate over other state-of-the-art methods on average in black-box targeted attack."}}

Howerver, these methods perform unsatisfactorily when applied into real-world situations. The reason of this phenomenon is that learning new tasks leads the trained model quickly forget the knowledge of old tasks, which is referred to as catastrophic forgetting. Current state-of-the-art incremental learning methods tackle catastrophic forgetting problem in traditional classification networks and ignore the problem existing in embedding networks, which are the basic networks for image retrieval, face recognition, zero-shot learning, etc. Different from traditional incremental classification networks, the semantic gap between the embedding spaces of two adjacent tasks is the main challenge for embedding networks under incremental learning setting. Thus, we propose a novel class-incremental method for embedding network, named as zero-shot translation class-incremental method (ZSTCI), which leverages zero-shot translation to estimate and compensate the semantic gap without any exemplars. Then, we try to learn a unified representation for two adjacent tasks in sequential learning process, which captures the relationships of previous classes and current classes precisely. In addition, ZSTCI can easily be combined with existing regularization-based incremental learning methods to further improve performance of embedding networks. We conduct extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011 and CIFAR100, and the experiment results prove the effectiveness of our method. The code of our method has been released."}}
