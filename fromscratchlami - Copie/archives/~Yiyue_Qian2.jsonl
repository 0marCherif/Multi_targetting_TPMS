Among different existing graph self-supervised learning strategies, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been one of the most prevalent approaches to this problem.

Yet, there are still some gaps in directly applying existing GCL methods to real-world data. First, handcrafted graph augmentations require trials and errors, but still can not yield consistent performance on multiple tasks. Second, most real-world graph data present class-imbalanced distribution but existing GCL methods are not immune to data imbalance. Therefore, this work proposes to explicitly tackle these challenges, via a principled framework called \\textit{\\textbf{C}o-\\textbf{M}odality \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{C}ontrastive \\textbf{L}earning} (\\textbf{CM-GCL}) to automatically generate contrastive pairs and further learn balanced representation over unlabeled data. Specifically, we design inter-modality GCL to automatically generate contrastive pairs (e.g., node-text) based on rich node content. Inspired by the fact that minority samples can be ``forgotten'' by pruning deep neural networks, we naturally extend network pruning to our GCL framework for mining minority nodes. Based on this, we co-train two pruned encoders (e.g., GNN and text encoder) in different modalities by pushing the corresponding node-text pairs together and the irrelevant node-text pairs away. Meanwhile, we propose intra-modality GCL by co-training non-pruned GNN and pruned GNN, to ensure node embeddings with similar attribute features stay closed. Last, we fine-tune the GNN encoder on downstream class-imbalanced node classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models and learns more balanced representations on real-world graphs.

As one of the fundamental tasks, multi-hop KG reasoning aims at generating effective and explainable relation prediction through reasoning paths. The current methods often require sufficient amount of training data (i.e., fact triples) for each query relation, impairing their applicabilities and performances over few-shot relations (with limited data) which are common in KGs. Despite that some few-shot relation reasoning methods have been proposed, their effectiveness and efficiency remain to be improved. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model called ADK-KG for multi-hop few-shot relation reasoning over KGs. In ADK-KG, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework to model the sequential reasoning process. We further develop a text-enhanced heterogeneous graph neural network to encode node embeddings, where entity and relation embeddings are pre-trained using content information. Later, we employ a task-aware meta-learning algorithm to optimize the model parameters that could be fast adapted for few-shot relations. A knowledge distillation module is further designed to make use of unlabeled data for improving model training. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that ADK-KG has satisfactory efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches."}}

Recently, the opioid epidemic is increasingly serious across the US as its related deaths have risen at alarming rates. To combat the deadly opioid epidemic, a state-run prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) has been established to alleviate the drug over-prescribing problem in the US. Although PDMP provides a detailed prescription history related to opioids, it is still not enough to prevent opioid overdose because it cannot predict over-prescribing risk. In addition, existing machine learning-based methods mainly focus on drug doses while ignoring other prescribing patterns behind patients' historical records, thus resulting in suboptimal performance. To this end, we propose a novel model DDHGNN - Disentangled Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, for over-prescribing prediction. Specifically, we abstract the PDMP data into a dynamic heterogeneous graph which comprehensively depicts the prescribing and dispensing (P&D) relationships. Then, we design a dynamic heterogeneous graph neural network to learn patients' representations. Furthermore, we devise an adversarial disentangler to learn a disentangled representation which is particularly related to the prescribing patterns. Extensive experiments on a 1-year anonymous PDMP data demonstrate that DDHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, revealing its promising future in preventing opioid overdose."}}

GitHub, as the largest platform, not only attracts developers and researchers to contribute legitimate software and research-related source code but has also become a popular platform for an increasing number of cybercriminals to perform continuous cyberattacks. Hence, some tools have been developed to learn representations of repositories on GitHub for various related applications (e.g., malicious repository detection) recently. However, most of them merely focus on code content while ignoring the rich relational data among repositories. In addition, they usually require a mass of resources to obtain sufficient labeled data for model training while ignoring the usefully handy unlabeled data. To this end, we propose a novel model Rep2Vec which integrates the code content, the structural relations, and the unlabeled data to learn the repository representations. First, to comprehensively model the repository data, we build a repository heterogeneous graph (Rep-HG) which is encoded by a graph neural network. Afterwards, to fully exploit unlabeled data in Rep-HG, we introduce adversarial attacks to generate more challenging contrastive pairs for the contrastive learning module to train the encoder in node view and meta-path view simultaneously. To alleviate the workload of the encoder against attacks, we further design a dual-stream contrastive learning module that integrates contrastive learning on adversarial graph and original graph together. Finally, the pre-trained encoder is fine-tuned to the downstream task, and further enhanced by a knowledge distillation module. Extensive experiments on the collected dataset from GitHub demonstrate the effectiveness of Rep2Vec in comparison with state-of-the-art methods for multiple repository tasks."}}

To address the imminent problem, some tools were developed to detect malicious repositories based on the code content. However, most of them ignore the rich relational information among repositories and usually require abundant labeled data to train the model. To this end, one effective way is to exploit unlabeled data to pre-train a model which considers both structural relation and code content of repositories, and further transfer the pre-trained model to the downstream tasks with labeled repository data. In this paper, we propose a novel model adversarial contrastive learning on heterogeneous graph (CLA-HG) to detect malicious repository in GitHub. First of all, CLA-HG builds a heterogeneous graph (HG) to comprehensively model repository data. Afterwards, to exploit unlabeled information in HG, CLA-HG introduces a dual-stream graph contrastive learning mechanism that distinguishes both adversarial subgraph pairs and standard subgraph pairs to pre-train graph neural networks using unlabeled data. Finally, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned to the downstream malicious repository detection task enhanced by a knowledge distillation (KD) module. Extensive experiments on two collected datasets from GitHub demonstrate the effectiveness of CLA-HG in comparison with state-of-the-art methods and popular commercial anti-malware products."}}
