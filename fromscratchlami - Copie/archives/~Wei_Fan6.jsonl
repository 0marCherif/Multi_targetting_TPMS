The advantages of FT, such as high efficiency and a global view, have been rapidly explored and exploited in various time series tasks and applications, demonstrating the promising potential of FT as a new deep learning paradigm for time series analysis. Despite the growing attention and the proliferation of research in this emerging field, there is currently a lack of a systematic review and in-depth analysis of deep learning-based time series models with FT. It is also unclear why FT can enhance time series analysis and what its limitations in the field are. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive review that systematically investigates and summarizes the recent research advancements in deep learning-based time series analysis with FT. Specifically, we explore the primary approaches used in current models that incorporate FT, the types of neural networks that leverage FT, and the representative FT-equipped models in deep time series analysis. We propose a novel taxonomy to categorize the existing methods in this field, providing a structured overview of the diverse approaches employed in incorporating FT into deep learning models for time series analysis. Finally, we highlight the advantages and limitations of FT for time series modeling and identify potential future research directions that can further contribute to the community of time series analysis."}}

The performance of traffic flow imputation has a big impact on a wide range of downstream applications, such as traffic forecasting and control. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Multi-grAph Convolutional Recurrent netwOrk (MACRO\\footnote{Code available at https://github.com/Jingci/MACRO}) framework for supporting fine-grained lane-level traffic flow imputation, which can help to reconstruct more  complete traffic flows at the lane level. \nSpecifically, we first design a spatial dependency module to model the diversified spatial correlations within traffic flows, where multi-relation graphs are first constructed to consider correlations from various perspective, then a multi-graph convolution neural network is proposed to capture the integrated spatial dependencies of traffic flows and adequately propagate the observed traffic values to mitigate data sparsity problem from spatial domain.\n Also, to handle the temporally continuous data missing issue, we adopt a modified bi-directional recurrent neural network to capture traffic flows' temporal dependencies by considering both historical and future information, and employ a temporal decay mechanism to control the irregular information transfer between adjacent time slices. Moreover, a spatio-temporal knowledge integration module is devised to comprehensively integrate multi-resolution spatiotemporal\nknowledge for traffic flow imputation.\nFinally, extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the performance of MACRO outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines with respect to traffic flow imputation.\n"}}

In this paper, we introduce a deep expansion learning framework, DEPTS, for PTS forecasting. DEPTS starts with a decoupled formulation by introducing the periodic state as a hidden variable, which stimulates us to make two dedicated modules to tackle the aforementioned two challenges. First, we develop an expansion module on top of residual learning to perform a layer-by-layer expansion of those complicated dependencies. Second, we introduce a periodicity module with a parameterized periodic function that holds sufficient capacity to capture diversified periods. Moreover, our two customized modules also have certain interpretable capabilities, such as attributing the forecasts to either local momenta or global periodicity and characterizing certain core periodic properties, e.g., amplitudes and frequencies. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of DEPTS on handling PTS. In most cases, DEPTS achieves significant improvements over the best baseline. Specifically, the error reduction can even reach up to 20% for a few cases. All codes for this paper are publicly available."}}
