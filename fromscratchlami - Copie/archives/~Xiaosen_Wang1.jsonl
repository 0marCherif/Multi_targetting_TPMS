Based on careful studies of existing adversarial attacks, we propose a bag of tricks to enhance adversarial transferability, including momentum initialization, scheduled step size, dual example, spectral-based input transformation, and several ensemble strategies. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset validate the high effectiveness of our proposed tricks and show that combining them can further boost adversarial transferability.

Recently, several works have been proposed to boost adversarial transferability, in which the surrogate model is usually overlooked. In this work, we identify that non-linear layers (e.g., ReLU, max-pooling, etc.) truncate the gradient during backward propagation, making the gradient w.r.t. input image imprecise to the loss function. We hypothesize and empirically validate that such truncation undermines the transferability of adversarial examples. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method called Backward Propagation Attack (BPA) to increase the relevance between the gradient w.r.t. input image and loss function so as to generate adversarial examples with higher transferability. Specifically, BPA adopts a non-monotonic function as the derivative of ReLU and incorporates softmax with temperature to smooth the derivative of max-pooling, thereby mitigating the information loss during the backward propagation of gradients. Empirical results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that not only does our method substantially boost the adversarial transferability, but it is also general to existing transfer-based attacks.

Recently, various adversarial attacks have emerged to boost adversarial transferability from different perspectives. In this work, inspired by the observation that flat local minima are correlated with good generalization, we assume and empirically validate that adversarial examples at a flat local region tend to have good transferability by introducing a penalized gradient norm to the original loss function. Since directly optimizing the gradient regularization norm is computationally expensive and intractable for generating adversarial examples, we propose an approximation optimization method to simplify the gradient update of the objective function. Specifically, we randomly sample an example and adopt a first-order procedure to approximate the curvature of Hessian/vector product, which makes computing more efficient by interpolating two neighboring gradients. Meanwhile, in order to obtain a more stable gradient direction, we randomly sample multiple examples and average the gradients of these examples to reduce the variance due to random sampling during the iterative process. Extensive experimental results on the ImageNet-compatible dataset show that the proposed method can generate adversarial examples at flat local regions, and significantly improve the adversarial transferability on either normally trained models or adversarially trained models than the state-of-the-art attacks.

However, existing attacks often utilize advanced gradient calculation or input transformation but ignore the white-box model. Inspired by the fact that DNNs are over-parameterized for superior performance, we propose diversifying the high-level features (DHF) for more transferable adversarial examples. In particular, DHF perturbs the high-level features by randomly transforming the high-level features and mixing them with the feature of benign samples when calculating the gradient at each iteration. Due to the redundancy of parameters, such transformation does not affect the classification performance but helps identify the invariant features across different models, leading to much better transferability. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset show that DHF could effectively improve the transferability of existing momentum-based attacks. Incorporated into the input transformation-based attacks, DHF generates more transferable adversarial examples and outperforms the baselines with a clear margin when attacking several defense models, showing its generalization to various attacks and high effectiveness for boosting transferability."}}

However, most white-box attack methods rely heavily on the target model and quickly get stuck in local optima, resulting in poor adversarial transferability. The momentum-based methods and their variants are proposed to escape the local optima for better transferability. In this work, we notice that the transferability of adversarial examples generated by the iterative fast gradient sign method (I-FGSM) exhibits a decreasing trend when increasing the number of iterations. Motivated by this finding, we argue that the information of adversarial perturbations near the benign sample, especially the direction, benefits more on the transferability. Thus, we propose a novel strategy, which uses the Scheduled step size and the Dual example (SD), to fully utilize the adversarial information near the benign sample. Our proposed strategy can be easily integrated with existing adversarial attack methods for better adversarial transferability. Empirical evaluations on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly enhance the transferability of existing adversarial attacks."}}

As one of the prevalent black-box adversarial attacks, the existing transfer-based attacks still cannot achieve comparable performance with the white-box attacks. Among these, input transformation based attacks have shown remarkable effectiveness in boosting transferability. In this work, we find that the existing input transformation based attacks transform the input image globally, resulting in limited diversity of the transformed images. We postulate that the more diverse transformed images result in better transferability. Thus, we investigate how to locally apply various transformations onto the input image to improve such diversity while preserving the structure of image. To this end, we propose a novel input transformation based attack, called Structure Invariant Transformation (SIA), which applies a random image transformation onto each image block to craft a set of diverse images for gradient calculation. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that SIA exhibits much better transferability than the existing SOTA input transformation based attacks on CNN-based and transformer-based models, showing its generality and superiority in boosting transferability.

Although many attack methods can achieve high success rates in the white-box setting, they also exhibit weak transferability in the black-box setting. Recently, various methods have been proposed to improve adversarial transferability, in which the input transformation is one of the most effective methods. In this work, we notice that existing input transformation-based works mainly adopt the transformed data in the same domain for augmentation. Inspired by domain generalization, we aim to further improve the transferability using the data augmented from different domains. Specifically, a style transfer network can alter the distribution of low-level visual features in an image while preserving semantic content for humans. Hence, we propose a novel attack method named Style Transfer Method (STM) that utilizes a proposed arbitrary style transfer network to transform the images into different domains. To avoid inconsistent semantic information of stylized images for the classification network, we fine-tune the style transfer network and mix up the generated images added by random noise with the original images to maintain semantic consistency and boost input diversity.

However, the underlying mechanism influencing the mixup's effect on transferability remains unexplored. In this work, we posit that the adversarial examples located at the convergence of decision boundaries across various categories exhibit better transferability and identify that Admix tends to steer the adversarial examples towards such regions. However, we find the constraint on the added image in Admix decays its capability, resulting in limited transferability. To address such an issue, we propose a new input transformation-based attack called Mixing the Image but Separating the gradienT (MIST). Specifically, MIST randomly mixes the input image with a randomly shifted image and separates the gradient of each loss item for each mixed image. To counteract the imprecise gradient, MIST calculates the gradient on several mixed images for each input sample. Extensive experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that MIST outperforms existing SOTA input transformation-based attacks with a clear margin on both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) w/wo defense mechanisms, supporting MIST's high effectiveness and generality."}}
