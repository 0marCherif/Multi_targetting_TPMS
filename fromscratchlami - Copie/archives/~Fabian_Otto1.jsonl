MPs can be broadly categorized into two types: (a) dynamics-based approaches that generate smooth trajectories from any initial state, e. g., Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs), and (b) probabilistic approaches that capture higher-order statistics of the motion, e. g., Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMPs). To date, however, there is no MP method that unifies both, i. e. that can generate smooth trajectories from an arbitrary initial state while capturing higher-order statistics. In this letter, we introduce a unified perspective of both approaches by solving the ODE underlying the DMPs. We convert expensive online numerical integration of DMPs into position and velocity basis functions that can be used to represent trajectories or trajectory distributions similar to ProMPs while maintaining all the properties of dynamical systems. Since we inherit the properties of both methodologies, we call our proposed model Probabilistic Dynamic Movement Primitives (ProDMPs). Additionally, we embed ProDMPs in deep neural network architecture and propose a new cost function for efficient end-to-end learning of higher-order trajectory statistics. To this end, we leverage Bayesian Aggregation for non-linear iterative conditioning on sensory inputs. Our proposed model achieves smooth trajectory generation, goal-attractor convergence, correlation analysis, nonlinear conditioning, and online re-planing in one framework."}}

While many self-supervised representation learning approaches exist to improve performance and sample complexity for image-based RL, they usually neglect other available information, such as robot proprioception. However, using this proprioception for representation learning can help algorithms to focus on relevant aspects and guide them toward finding better representations. In this work, we systematically analyze representation learning for RL from multiple sensors by building on Recurrent State Space Models. We propose a combination of reconstruction-based and contrastive losses, which allows us to choose the most appropriate method for each sensor modality. We demonstrate the benefits of joint representations, particularly with distinct loss functions for each modality, for model-free and model-based RL on complex tasks. Those include tasks where the images contain distractions or occlusions and a new locomotion suite. We show that combining reconstruction-based and contrastive losses for joint representation learning improves performance significantly compared to a post hoc combination of image representations and proprioception and can also improve the quality of learned models for model-based RL."}}

The de-facto standard approach adopts heteroscedastic Gaussian distributions and minimizes the negative log-likelihood (NLL) under observed data. However, optimizing this objective turns out to be surprisingly intricate, and the current state-of-the-art reports several instabilities. This work breaks down the optimization problem, initially focusing on non-contextual settings where convergence can be analyzed analytically. We show that (1) in this learning scheme, the eigenvalues of the predictive covariance define stability in learning, and (2) coupling of gradients and predictions build up errors in both mean and covariance if either is poorly approximated. Building on these insights, we propose Trustable, a novel optimizer that overcomes instabilities methodically by combining systematic update restrictions in the form of trust regions with structured, tractable natural gradients. We demonstrate in several challenging experiments that Trustable outperforms current optimizers in regression with neural networks in terms of the NLL, MSE, and further performance metrics. Unlike other optimizers, Trustable yields an improved and more stable fit and can also be applied to multivariate outputs with full covariance matrices."}}

ERL offers several distinct benefits in comparison to step-based RL. It generates smooth control trajectories, can handle non-Markovian reward definitions, and the resulting exploration in parameter space is well suited for solving sparse reward settings. Yet, the high dimensionality of the movement primitive parameters has so far hampered the effective use of deep RL methods. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for deep ERL. It is based on differentiable trust region layers, a successful on-policy deep RL algorithm. These layers allow us to specify trust regions for the policy update that are solved exactly for each state using convex optimization, which enables policies learning with the high precision required for the ERL. We compare our ERL algorithm to state-of-the-art step-based algorithms in many complex simulated robotic control tasks. In doing so, we investigate different reward formulations - dense, sparse, and non-Markovian. While step-based algorithms perform well only on dense rewards, ERL performs favorably on sparse and non-Markovian rewards. Moreover, our results show that the sparse and the non-Markovian rewards are also often better suited to define the desired behavior, allowing us to obtain considerably higher quality policies compared to step-based RL."}}
