In this paper, we propose to evaluate the robustness of c-MARL agents via a model-based approach, named \\textbf{c-MBA}. Our proposed attack can craft much stronger adversarial state perturbations of c-MARL agents to lower total team rewards than existing model-free approaches. Our numerical experiments on two representative MARL benchmarks illustrate the advantage of our approach over other baselines: our model-based attack consistently outperforms other baselines in all tested environments."}}

Self-learning techniques have also played a role in pushing performance forward. However, for most recent high performant parsers, the effect of self-learning and silver data augmentation seems to be fading. In this paper we propose to overcome this diminishing returns of silver data by combining Smatch-based ensembling techniques with ensemble distillation. In an extensive experimental setup, we push single model English parser performance to a new state-of-the-art, 85.9 (AMR2.0) and 84.3 (AMR3.0), and return to substantial gains from silver data augmentation. We also attain a new state-of-the-art for cross-lingual AMR parsing for Chinese, German, Italian and Spanish. Finally we explore the impact of the proposed technique on domain adaptation, and show that it can produce gains rivaling those of human annotated data for QALD-9 and achieve a new state-of-the-art for BioAMR."}}

In addition, we propose the first victim-agent selection strategy and the first data-driven approach to define targeted failure states where each of them allows us to develop even stronger adversarial attack without the expert knowledge to the underlying environment.

Prior work tried to solve it by building new data processing platforms such as MapReduce or Spark, and then implementing new libraries of ML algorithms for those. But despite the availability of these platforms, many ML practitioners continue to use scikit-learn instead, owing to its clean design and rich set of algorithms. Therefore, this paper proposes a different approach: instead of extending a data processing platform for ML, extend an ML library for data processing. Specifically, this paper proposes RASL, an open-source library of relational algebra (RA) operators for scikit-learn (SL). We illustrate RASL with a detailed case study involving joins and aggregation across multi-table input data. We hope our approach will lead to cleaner integration of data preparation with machine learning in practice."}}

In this paper, we focus on evaluating the robustness of MARL agents in continuous control tasks. In particular, we propose the first model-based approach to perform adversarial attacks for cooperative MARL. We design effective attacks to degrade the MARL agent's performance by adversarially perturbing the states of agent(s) and solving an optimization problem. In addition, we also developed several strategies to select the most vulnerable agents that help to further decrease the team reward of MARL. Extensive numerical experiments on multi-agent Mujoco tasks verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach."}}

For example, in natural language processing, it is very common to parse texts into dependency trees or abstract meaning representation (AMR) graphs. On the other hand, ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple models to create a new one that is more robust and accurate than individual predictions. In the literature, there are many ensembling techniques proposed for classification or regression problems, however, ensemble graph prediction has not been studied thoroughly. In this work, we formalize this problem as mining the largest graph that is the most supported by a collection of graph predictions. As the problem is NP-Hard, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm to approximate the optimal solution. To validate our approach, we carried out experiments in AMR parsing problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can combine the strength of state-of-the-art AMR parsers to create new predictions that are more accurate than any individual models in five standard benchmark datasets.
