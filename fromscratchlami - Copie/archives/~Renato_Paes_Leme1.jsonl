For the important special case of gross substitute valuations, our algorithm queries the aggregate demand oracle $${\\widetilde{O}}(n)$$ O~(n) times and takes $${\\widetilde{O}}(n^3)$$ O~(n3) time, where n is the number of goods and the $${\\widetilde{O}}(\\cdot )$$ O~(\u00b7) notation denotes an asymptotic bound up to polylogarithmic factors. Both algorithms are randomized. At the heart of our solution is a method for exactly minimizing certain convex functions which cannot be evaluated but for which the subgradients can be computed. We also give the fastest known algorithm for computing Walrasian equilibrium for gross substitute valuations in the value oracle model. Our algorithm has running time $${\\widetilde{O}}((mn + n^3) T_V)$$ O~((mn+n3)TV) where $$T_V$$ TV is the cost of querying the value oracle. A key technical ingredient is to regularize a convex programming formulation of the problem in a way that subgradients are cheap to compute. En route, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of robust Walrasian prices, i.e., prices for which each agent has a unique demanded bundle and the demanded bundles clear the market. When such prices exist, the market can be perfectly coordinated by solely using prices."}}

The regret measures the difference between the revenue the seller could have obtained knowing the buyer valuation and what can be obtained by the learning algorithm. We give a poly-time algorithm for contextual pricing with $O(d \\log \\log T + d \\log d)$ regret which matches the $\\Omega(d \\log \\log T)$ lower bound up to the $d \\log d$ additive factor. If we replace pricing loss by the symmetric loss, we obtain an algorithm with nearly optimal regret of $O(d \\log d)$ matching the $\\Omega(d)$ lower bound up to $\\log d$. These algorithms are based on a novel technique of bounding the value of the Steiner polynomial of a convex region at various scales. The Steiner polynomial is a degree $d$ polynomial with intrinsic volumes as the coefficients. We also study a generalized version of contextual search where the hidden linear function over the Euclidean space is replaced by a hidden function $f : \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y}$ in a certain hypothesis class $\\mathcal{H}$. We provide a generic algorithm with $O(d^2)$ regret where $d$ is the covering dimension of this class. This leads in particular to a $\\tilde{O}(s^2)$ regret algorithm for linear contextual search if the linear function is guaranteed to be $s$-sparse. Finally we also extend our results to the noisy feedback model, where each round our feedback is flipped with a fixed probability $p < 1/2$."}}
