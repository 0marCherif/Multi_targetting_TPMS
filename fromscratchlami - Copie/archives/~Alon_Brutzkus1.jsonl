But not much is known about learning such functions using neural networks. Here we focus on learning read-once disjunctive normal forms (DNFs) under the uniform distribution with a convex neural network and gradient methods. We first observe empirically that gradient methods converge to compact solutions with neurons that are aligned with the terms of the DNF. This is despite the fact that there are many zero training error networks that do not have this property. Thus, the learning process has a clear inductive bias towards such logical formulas. Following recent results which connect the inductive bias of gradient flow (GF) to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of minimum norm problems, we study these KKT points in our setting. We prove that zero training error solutions that memorize training points are not KKT points and therefore GF cannot converge to them. On the other hand, we prove that globally optimal KKT points correspond exactly to networks that are aligned with the DNF terms. These results suggest a strong connection between the inductive bias of GF and solutions that align with the DNF. We conclude with extensive experiments which verify our findings."}}

In practice, however, CNNs are learned successfully on natural image data. In this work, we study a semi-supervised algorithm, that learns a linear classifier over data-dependent features which were obtained from unlabeled data. We show that the algorithm provably learns CNNs, under some natural distributional assumptions. Specifically, it efficiently learns CNNs, assuming the distribution of patches in the input images has low-dimensional structure (e.g., when the patches are sampled from a low-dimensional manifold).  We complement our result with a lower bound, showing that the dependence of our algorithm on the dimension of the patch distribution is essentially optimal."}}

Although widely used in practice, it is not well understood theoretically. Here we analyze the sample complexity of this scheme for regression with linear teachers in several settings. Intuitively, the success of fine-tuning depends on the similarity between the source tasks and the target task. But what is the right way of measuring this similarity? We show that the relevant measure has to do with the relation between the source task, the target task and the covariance structure of the target data. In the setting of linear regression, we show that under realistic settings there can be substantial sample complexity reduction when the above measure is low. For deep linear regression, we propose a novel result regarding the inductive bias of gradient-based training when the network is initialized with pretrained weights. Using this result we show that the similarity measure for this setting is also affected by the depth of the network. We conclude with results on shallow ReLU models, and analyze the dependence of sample complexity there on source and target tasks. We empirically demonstrate our results for both synthetic and realistic data."}}

But not much is known about learning such functions by neural networks. Because learning these functions in the distribution free setting is NP-Hard, they are unlikely to be efficiently learnable by networks in this case. However, assuming the inputs are sampled from the uniform distribution, an important subset of functions that are known to be efficiently learnable is read-once DNFs. Here we focus on this setting where the functions are learned by a convex neural network and gradient descent. \nWe first observe empirically that the learned neurons are aligned with the terms of the DNF, despite the fact that there are many zero-error networks that do not have this property. Thus, the learning process has a clear inductive bias towards such logical formulas. To gain a better theoretical understanding of this phenomenon we focus on minimizing the population risk. We show that this risk can be minimized by multiple networks: from ones that memorize data to ones that compactly represent the DNF. We then set out to understand why gradient descent ``\"chooses\" the compact representation. \nWe use a computer assisted proof to prove the inductive bias for relatively small DNFs, and use it to design a process for reconstructing the DNF from the learned network. We then continue to provide theoretical insights on the learning process and the loss surface to better understand the resulting inductive bias. For example, we show that the neurons in solutions with minimum $l_2$-norm of the weights are also aligned with the terms of the DNF. Finally, we empirically show that our results are validated in the empirical case for high dimensional DNFs, more general network architectures and tabular datasets."}}

However, their generalization properties are far from understood. In this work, we consider a simplified image classification task where images contain orthogonal patches and are learned with a 3-layer overparameterized convolutional network and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We empirically identify a novel phenomenon of SGD in our setting, where the dot-product between the learned pattern detectors and their detected patterns are governed by the pattern statistics in the training set. We call this phenomenon Pattern Statistics Inductive Bias (PSI) and empirically verify it in a large number of instances. We prove that in our setting, if a learning algorithm satisfies PSI then its sample complexity is $O(d^2\\log(d))$ where $d$ is the filter dimension. In contrast, we show a VC dimension lower bound which is exponential in $d$. We perform experiments with overparameterized CNNs on a variant of MNIST with non-orthogonal patches, and show that the empirical observations are in line with our analysis."}}

Recent studies have shown that Homomorphic Encryption (HE) can be used for protecting against information leakage while applying neural networks. However, this comes with the cost of limiting the kind of neural networks that can be used (and hence the accuracy) and with latency of the order of several minutes even for relatively simple networks. In this study we improve on previous results both in the kind of networks that can be applied and in terms of the latency. Most of the improvement is achieved by novel ways to represent the data to make better use of the capabilities of the encryption scheme."}}

This is the first theoretical demonstration that SGD can avoid overfitting, when learning over-specified neural network classifiers."}}
