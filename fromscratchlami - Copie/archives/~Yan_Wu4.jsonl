While methods have been proposed to generate realistic hand-object interaction for object grasping and manipulation, these typically only consider interacting hand alone. Our goal is to synthesize whole-body grasping motions. Starting from an arbitrary initial pose, we aim to generate diverse and natural whole-body human motions to approach and grasp a target object in 3D space. This task is challenging as it requires modeling both whole-body dynamics and dexterous finger movements. To this end, we propose SAGA (StochAstic whole-body Grasping with contAct), a framework which consists of two key components: (a) Static whole-body grasping pose generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-task generative model, to jointly learn static whole-body grasping poses and human-object contacts. (b) Grasping motion infilling. Given an initial pose and the generated whole-body grasping pose as the start and end of the motion respectively, we design a novel contact-aware generative motion infilling module to generate a diverse set of grasp-oriented motions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which is a novel generative framework to synthesize realistic and expressive whole-body motions that approach and grasp randomly placed unseen objects.

To that end, recently, neural architecture search (NAS) approaches have shown some tremendous potential. Following the same underlying, in this paper, we suggest a novel trilevel NAS method that provides a better balance between different efficiency metrics and performance to solve SISR. Unlike available NAS, our search is more complete, and therefore it leads to an efficient, optimized, and compressed architecture. We innovatively introduce a trilevel search space modeling, i.e., hierarchical modeling on network-, cell-, and kernel-level structures. To make the search on trilevel spaces differentiable and efficient, we exploit a new sparsestmax technique that is excellent at generating sparse distributions of individual neural architecture candidates so that they can be better disentangled for the final selection from the enlarged search space. We further introduce the sorting technique to the sparsestmax relaxation for better network-level compression. The proposed NAS optimization additionally facilitates simultaneous search and training in a single phase, reducing search time and train time. Comprehensive evaluations on the benchmark datasets show our method's clear superiority over the state-of-the-art NAS in terms of a good trade-off between model size, performance, and efficiency."}}

Based on the supernet modeling, we exploit a differentiable NAS algorithm on our relaxed continuous search space for SPD neural architecture search. Statistical evaluation of our method on drone, action, and emotion recognition tasks mostly provides better results than the state-of-the-art SPD networks and traditional NAS algorithms. Empirical results show that our algorithm excels in discovering better performing SPD network design and provides models that are more than three times lighter than searched by the state-of-the-art NAS algorithms."}}

In particular, we model the NAS problem as a sparse supernet using a new continuous architecture representation with a mixture of sparsity constraints. The sparse supernet enables us to automatically achieve sparsely-mixed paths upon a compact set of nodes. To optimize the proposed sparse supernet, we exploit a hierarchical accelerated proximal gradient algorithm within a bi-level optimization framework. Extensive experiments on Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network search demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of searching for compact, general and powerful neural architectures."}}
