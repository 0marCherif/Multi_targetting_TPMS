Typical transfer learning tasks include unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and few-shot learning (FSL), which both attempt to sufficiently transfer discriminative knowledge from the training environment to the test environment to improve the model's generalization performance. Previous transfer learning methods usually ignore the potential conditional distribution shift between environments. This leads to the discriminability degradation in the test environments. Therefore, how to construct a learnable and interpretable metric to measure and then reduce the gap between conditional distributions is very important in the literature. In this article, we design the Conditional Kernel Bures (CKB) metric for characterizing conditional distribution discrepancy, and derive an empirical estimation with convergence guarantee. CKB provides a statistical and interpretable approach, under the optimal transportation framework, to understand the knowledge transfer mechanism. It is essentially an extension of optimal transportation from the marginal distributions to the conditional distributions. CKB can be used as a plug-and-play module and placed onto the loss layer in deep networks, thus, it plays the bottleneck role in representation learning. From this perspective, the new method with network architecture is abbreviated as BuresNet, and it can be used extract conditional invariant features for both UDA and FSL tasks. BuresNet can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiment results on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of BuresNet."}}

Plenty of methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved promising results in the past decades. Inspired by the success of Transformers, some methods attempt to tackle UDA problem by adopting pure transformer architectures, and interpret the models by applying the long-range dependency strategy at image patch-level. However, the algorithmic complexity is high and the interpretability seems weak. In this paper, we propose the Domain-Transformer (DoT) for UDA, which integrates the CNN-backbones and the core attention mechanism of Transformers from a new perspective. Specifically, a plug-and-play domain-level attention mechanism is proposed to learn the sample correspondence between domains. This is significantly different from existing methods which only capture the local interactions among image patches. Instead of explicitly modeling the distribution discrepancy from either domain-level or class-level, DoT learns transferable features by achieving the local semantic consistency across domains, where the domain-level attention and manifold regularization are explored. Then, DoT is free of pseudo-labels and explicit domain discrepancy optimization. Theoretically, DoT is connected with the optimal transportation algorithm and statistical learning theory. The connection provides a new insight to understand the core component of Transformers. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of DoT."}}

Existing methods mainly focus on matching the marginal distributions of the source and target domains, which probably lead a misalignment of samples from the same class but different domains. In this paper, we deal with this misalignment by achieving the class-conditioned transferring from a new perspective. We aim to maximize the conditional independence of feature and domain given class in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The optimization of the conditional independence measure can be viewed as minimizing a surrogate of a certain mutual information between feature and domain. An interpretable empirical estimation of the conditional dependence is deduced and connected with the unconditional case. Besides, we provide an upper bound on the target error by taking the class-conditional distribution into account, which provides a new theoretical insight for most class-conditioned transferring methods. In addition to unsupervised domain adaptation, we extend our method to the multi-source scenario in a natural and elegant way. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed models in both unsupervised domain adaptation and multiple source domain adaptation."}}

Though deep learning and adversarial strategy made a significant breakthrough in the adaptability of features, there are two issues to be further studied. First, hard-assigned pseudo labels on the target domain are arbitrary and error-prone, and direct application of them may destroy the intrinsic data structure. Second, batch-wise training of deep learning limits the characterization of the global structure. In this paper, a Riemannian manifold learning framework is proposed to achieve transferability and discriminability simultaneously. For the first issue, this framework establishes a probabilistic discriminant criterion on the target domain via soft labels. Based on pre-built prototypes, this criterion is extended to a global approximation scheme for the second issue. Manifold metric alignment is adopted to be compatible with the embedding space. The theoretical error bounds of different alignment metrics are derived for constructive guidance. The proposed method can be used to tackle a series of variants of domain adaptation problems, including both vanilla and partial settings. Extensive experiments have been conducted to investigate the method and a comparative study shows the superiority of the discriminative manifold learning framework."}}

Previous methods assume the changes are induced by covariate, which is less practical for complex real-world data. We consider the Generalized Label Shift (GLS), which provides an interpretable insight into the learning and transfer of desirable knowledge. Current GLS methods: 1) are not well-connected with the statistical learning theory; 2) usually assume the shifting conditional distributions will be matched with an implicit transformation, but its explicit modeling is unexplored. In this paper, we propose a conditional adaptation framework to deal with these challenges. From the perspective of learning theory, we prove that the generalization error of conditional adaptation is lower than previous covariate adaptation. Following the theoretical results, we propose the minimum uncertainty principle to learn conditional invariant transformation via discrepancy optimization. Specifically, we propose the \\textit{conditional metric operator} on Hilbert space to characterize the distinctness of conditional distributions. For finite observations, we prove that the empirical estimation is always well-defined and will converge to underlying truth as sample size increases. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance under different GLS scenarios."}}

Most existing methods cannot address the domain alignment and class discrimination well, which may distort the intrinsic data structure for downstream tasks (e.g., classification). To this end, we propose a novel geometry-aware model to learn the transferability and discriminability simultaneously via nuclear norm optimization. We introduce the domain coherence and class orthogonality for UDA from the perspective of subspace geometry. The domain coherence will ensure the model has a larger capacity for learning separable representations, and class orthogonality will minimize the correlation between clusters to alleviate the misalignment. So, they are consistent and can benefit from each other. Besides, we provide a theoretical insight into the norm-based learning literature in UDA, which ensures the interpretability of our model. We show that the norms of domains and clusters are expected to be larger and smaller to enhance the transferability and discriminability, respectively. Extensive experimental results on standard UDA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our theory and model."}}

Due to its superior performance, it has grown into a significant topic in recent years. However, images with complicated variations, e.g., postures and human ages, are difficult to address, as these variations are continuous and gradual with respect to image appearance. Consequently, the crucial point of image set recognition is to mine the intrinsic connection or structural information from the image batches with variations. In this work, a Discriminant Residual Analysis (DRA) method is proposed to improve the classification performance by discovering discriminant features in related and unrelated groups. Specifically, DRA attempts to obtain a powerful projection which casts the residual representations into a discriminant subspace. Such a projection subspace is expected to magnify the useful information of the input space as much as possible, then the relation between the training set and the test set described by the given metric or distance will be more precise in the discriminant subspace. We also propose a nonfeasance strategy by defining another approach to construct the unrelated groups, which help to reduce furthermore the cost of sampling errors. Two regularization approaches are used to deal with the probable small sample size problem. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark databases, and the results show superiority and efficiency of the new methods."}}
