The former can discover more potential online games of their interests, and the latter can attract users to dwell longer in the platform. This paper investigates the characteristics of user behaviors with respect to the online games on the Steam platform. Based on the observations, we argue that a satisfying recommender system for online games is able to characterize: personalization, game contextualization and social connection. However, simultaneously solving all is rather challenging for game recommendation. Firstly, personalization for game recommendation requires the incorporation of the dwelling time of engaged games, which are ignored in existing methods. Secondly, game contextualization should reflect the complex and high-order properties of those relations. Last but not least, it is problematic to use social connections directly for game recommendations due to the massive noise within social connections. To this end, we propose a Social-aware Contextualized Graph Neural Recommender System (SCGRec), which harnesses three perspectives to improve game recommendation. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of users\u2019 online game behaviors, which motivates the necessity of handling those three characteristics in the online game recommendation."}}

Recently the literature has adopted neural graph networks (GNNs) on the collaborative knowledge graph and built an end-to-end KG-enhanced RecSys. However, the majority of these approaches have three limitations: (1) treat the collaborative knowledge graph as a homogeneous graph and overlook the highly heterogeneous relationships among items, (2) lack of design to explicitly leverage the rich side information, and (3) overlook the rich knowledge in user preference. To fill this gap, in this paper, we explore the rich, heterogeneous relationship among items and propose a new KG-enhanced recommendation model called Collaborative Meta-Knowledge Enhanced Recommender System (MetaKRec). In particular, we focus on modeling the rich, heterogeneous semantic relationships among items and construct several collaborative Meta-KGs to explicitly depict the relatedness of the items under the guidance of meta-knowledge. In addition to the knowledge obtained from KG, we leverage user knowledge that extracts from user preference to construct the Meta-KGs. The constructed Meta-KGs can capture the knowledge from both the knowledge graph and user preference. Furthermore. we utilize a light convolution encoder to recursively integrate the item relationship in each collaborative Meta-KGs. This scheme allows us to explicitly gather the heterogeneous semantic relationships among items and encode them into the representations of items. In addition, we propose channel attention to fuse the item and user representations from different Meta-KGs. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant gains over the state-of-the-art baselines on both regular and cold-start recommendation settings."}}

Representing user-item interactions as a bipartite graph, a GNN model generates user and item representations by aggregating embeddings of their neighbors. However, such an aggregation procedure often accumulates information purely based on the graph structure, overlooking the redundancy of the aggregated neighbors and resulting in poor diversity of the recommended list. In this paper, we propose diversifying GNN-based recommender systems by directly improving the embedding generation procedure. Particularly, we utilize the following three modules: submodular neighbor selection to find a subset of diverse neighbors to aggregate for each GNN node, layer attention to assign attention weights for each layer, and loss reweighting to focus on the learning of items belonging to long-tail categories. Blending the three modules into GNN, we present DGRec(Diversified GNN-based Recommender System) for diversified recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve the best diversity while keeping the accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art GNN-based recommender systems."}}
