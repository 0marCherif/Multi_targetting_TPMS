We study privacy in the fair allocation of indivisible resources using the well-established framework of differential privacy. We present algorithms for approximate envy-freeness and proportionality when two instances are considered to be adjacent if they differ only on the utility of a single agent for a single item. On the other hand, we provide strong negative results for both fairness criteria when the adjacency notion allows the entire utility function of a single agent to change."}}

Two special cases have been considered in the literature: how to release a synthetic dataset for answering multiple linear queries over a single table, and how to release the answer for a single counting (join size) query over a set of database tables. Compared to the single-table case, the join operator makes query answering challenging, since the sensitivity (i.e., by how much an individual data record can affect the answer) could be heavily amplified by complex join relationships. We present an algorithm for the general problem, and prove a lower bound illustrating that our general algorithm achieves parameterized optimality (up to logarithmic factors) on some simple queries (e.g., two-table join queries) in the most commonly-used privacy parameter regimes. For the case of hierarchical joins, we present a data partition procedure that exploits the concept of {\\em uniformized sensitivities} to further improve the utility."}}

We give a simple reduction from Maximum (Unbalanced) Biclique problem to approximating VC Dimension and Littlestone\u2019s Dimension. With this connection, we derive a range of hardness of approximation results and running time lower bounds. For example, under the (randomized) Gap-Exponential Time Hypothesis or the Strongish Planted Clique Hypothesis, we show a tight inapproximability result: both dimensions are hard to approximate to within a factor of o(log n) in polynomial-time. These improve upon constant-factor inapproximability results from [Pasin Manurangsi and Aviad Rubinstein, 2017]."}}

In the approximate-DP setting, we design new algorithms achieving significant improvements over known ones."}}
