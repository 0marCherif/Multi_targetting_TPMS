The validity of existing works heavily rely on either a restrictive Lower- Level Strong Convexity (LLSC) condition or on solving a series of approximation subproblems with high accuracy or both. In this work, by averaging the upper and lower level objectives, we propose a single loop Bi-level Averaged Method of Multipliers (sl-BAMM) for BLO that is simple yet efficient for large-scale BLO and gets rid of the limited LLSC restriction. We further provide non-asymptotic convergence analysis of sl-BAMM towards KKT stationary points, and the comparative advantage of our analysis lies in the absence of strong gradient boundedness assumption, which is always required by others. Thus our theory safely captures a wider variety of applications in deep learning, especially where the upper-level objective is quadratic w.r.t. the lower-level variable. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method."}}

Most of them simply formulate dehazing and rehazing cycles, yet ignore the physical properties of the real-world hazy environment, i.e. the haze varies with density and depth. In this paper, we propose a self-augmented image dehazing framework, termed D^4 (Dehazing via Decomposing transmission map into Density and Depth) for haze generation and removal. Instead of merely estimating transmission maps or clean content, the proposed framework focuses on exploring scattering coefficient and depth information contained in hazy and clean images. With estimated scene depth, our method is capable of re-rendering hazy images with different thicknesses which further benefits the training of the dehazing network. It is worth noting that the whole training process needs only unpaired hazy and clean images, yet succeeded in recovering the scattering coefficient, depth map and clean content from a single hazy image. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method outperforms state-of-the-art unpaired dehazing methods with much fewer parameters and FLOPs.Our code is available at https://github.com/YaN9-Y/D4"}}

Aiming at generating an image of high visual quality, previous approaches discover commons underlying the two modalities and fuse upon the common space either by iterative optimization or deep networks. These approaches neglect that modality differences implying the complementary information are extremely important for both fusion and subsequent detection task. This paper proposes a bilevel optimization formulation for the joint problem of fusion and detection, and then unrolls to a target-aware Dual Adversarial Learning (TarDAL) network for fusion and a commonly used detection network. The fusion network with one generator and dual discriminators seeks commons while learning from differences, which preserves structural information of targets from the infrared and textural details from the visible. Furthermore, we build a synchronized imaging system with calibrated infrared and optical sensors, and collect currently the most comprehensive benchmark covering a wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments on several public datasets and our benchmark demonstrate that our method outputs not only visually appealing fusion but also averagely 10:9% higher detection mAP than the stateof- the-art approaches on various challenging scenarios."}}

In this paper, we develop a new Self-Calibrated Illumination (SCI) learning framework for fast, flexible, and robust brightening images in real-world low-light scenarios. To be specific, we establish a cascaded illumination learning process with weight sharing to handle this task. Considering the computational burden of the cascaded pattern, we construct the selfcalibrated module which realizes the convergence between results of each stage, producing the gains that only use the single basic block for inference (yet has not been exploited in previous works), which drastically diminishes computation cost. We then define the unsupervised training loss to elevate the model capability that can adapt general scenes. Further, we make comprehensive explorations to excavate SCI' s inherent properties (lacking in existing works) including operation-insensitive adaptability (acquiring stable performance under the settings of different simple operations) and model-irrelevant generality (can be applied to illumination-based existing works to improve performance). Finally, plenty of experiments and ablation studies fully indicate our superiority in both quality and efficiency. Applications on low-light face detection and nighttime semantic segmentation fully reveal the latent practical values for SCI. The source code will be made publicly available.\n\n"}}
