Current architectures, however, cannot be applied beyond a small set of stereotyped settings, as they bake in domain & task assumptions or scale poorly to large inputs or outputs. In this work, we propose Perceiver IO, a general-purpose architecture that handles data from arbitrary settings while scaling linearly with the size of inputs and outputs. Our model augments the Perceiver with a flexible querying mechanism that enables outputs of various sizes and semantics, doing away with the need for task-specific architecture engineering. The same architecture achieves strong results on tasks spanning natural language and visual understanding, multi-task and multi-modal reasoning, and StarCraft II. As highlights, Perceiver IO outperforms a Transformer-based BERT baseline on the GLUE language benchmark despite removing input tokenization and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sintel optical flow estimation with no explicit mechanisms for multiscale correspondence."}}

A recent line of research casts \u2018RL as inference\u2019 and suggests a particular framework to generalize the RL problem as probabilistic inference. Our paper surfaces a key shortcoming in that approach, and clarifies the sense in which RL can be coherently cast as an inference problem. In particular, an RL agent must consider the effects of its actions upon future rewards and observations: The exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In all but the most simple settings, the resulting inference is computationally intractable so that practical RL algorithms must resort to approximation. We demonstrate that the popular \u2018RL as inference\u2019 approximation can perform poorly in even very basic problems. However, we show that with a small modification the framework does yield algorithms that can provably perform well, and we show that the resulting algorithm is equivalent to the recently proposed K-learning, which we further connect with Thompson sampling.\n"}}

In this work we aim to learn object representations that are useful for control and reinforcement learning (RL). To this end, we introduce Transporter, a neural network architecture for discovering concise geometric object representations in terms of keypoints or image-space coordinates. Our method learns from raw video frames in a fully unsupervised manner, by transporting learnt image features between video frames using a keypoint bottleneck. The discovered keypoints track objects and object parts across long time-horizons more accurately than recent similar methods. Furthermore, consistent long-term tracking enables two notable results in control domains -- (1) using the keypoint co-ordinates and corresponding image features as inputs enables highly sample-efficient reinforcement learning; (2) learning to explore by controlling keypoint locations drastically reduces the search space, enabling deep exploration (leading to states unreachable through random action exploration) without any extrinsic rewards."}}

How do we design agents with generic inductive biases so that they can explore in a consistent manner instead of just using local exploration schemes like epsilon-greedy? We propose an unsupervised reinforcement learning agent which learns a discrete pixel grouping model that preserves spatial geometry of the sensors and implicitly of the environment as well. We use this representation to derive geometric intrinsic reward functions, like centroid coordinates and area, and learn policies to control each one of them with off-policy learning. These policies form a basis set of behaviors (options) which allows us explore in a consistent way and use them in a hierarchical reinforcement learning setup to solve for extrinsically defined rewards. We show that our approach can scale to a variety of domains with competitive performance, including navigation in 3D environments and Atari games with sparse rewards."}}

There is no good reason for this restriction. Synapses have dynamics at many different time-scales and this suggests that artificial neural networks might benefit from variables that change slower than activities but much faster than the standard weights. These ``fast weights'' can be used to store temporary memories of the recent past and they provide a neurally plausible way of implementing the type of attention to the past that has recently proven helpful in sequence-to-sequence models. By using fast weights we can avoid the need to store copies of neural activity patterns."}}

The power of deep networks stems both from their ability to perform local computations followed by pointwise non-linearities over increasingly larger receptive fields, and from the simplicity and scalability of the gradient-descent training procedure based on backpropagation. An open problem is the inclusion of layers that perform global, structured matrix computations like segmentation (e.g. normalized cuts) or higher-order pooling (e.g. log-tangent space metrics defined over the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices) while preserving the validity and efficiency of an end-to-end deep training framework. In this paper we propose a sound mathematical apparatus to formally integrate global structured computation into deep computation architectures. At the heart of our methodology is the development of the theory and practice of backpropagation that generalizes to the calculus of adjoint matrix variations. We perform segmentation experiments using the BSDS and MSCOCO benchmarks and demonstrate that deep networks relying on second-order pooling and normalized cuts layers, trained end-to-end using matrix backpropagation, outperform counterparts that do not take advantage of such global layers."}}

Besides increasing the size of the datasets in the current state-of-the-art by several orders of magnitude, we also aim to complement such datasets with a diverse set of motions and poses encountered as part of typical human activities (taking photos, talking on the phone, posing, greeting, eating, etc.), with additional synchronized image, human motion capture, and time of flight (depth) data, and with accurate 3D body scans of all the subject actors involved. We also provide controlled mixed reality evaluation scenarios where 3D human models are animated using motion capture and inserted using correct 3D geometry, in complex real environments, viewed with moving cameras, and under occlusion. Finally, we provide a set of large-scale statistical models and detailed evaluation baselines for the dataset illustrating its diversity and the scope for improvement by future work in the research community. Our experiments show that our best large-scale model can leverage our full training set to obtain a 20% improvement in performance compared to a training set of the scale of the largest existing public dataset for this problem. Yet the potential for improvement by leveraging higher capacity, more complex models with our large dataset, is substantially vaster and should stimulate future research. The dataset together with code for the associated large-scale learning models, features, visualization tools, as well as the evaluation server, is available online at http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m."}}

The availability of depth information plays a critical role, so an important question is whether a similar representation can be developed with sufficient robustness in order to estimate 3D pose from RGB images. This paper provides evidence for a positive answer, by leveraging (a) 2D human body part labeling in images, (b) second-order label-sensitive pooling over dynamically computed regions resulting from a hierarchical decomposition of the body, and (c) iterative structured-output modeling to contextualize the process based on 3D pose estimates. For robustness and generalization, we take advantage of a recent large-scale 3D human motion capture dataset, Human3.6M[18] that also has human body part labeling annotations available with images. We provide extensive experimental studies where alternative intermediate representations are compared and report a substantial 33% error reduction over competitive discriminative baselines that regress 3D human pose against global HOG features."}}
