Previous voxel-based generation methods represent the CT as discrete voxels, resulting in high memory requirements and limited spatial resolution due to the use of 3D decoders. In this paper, we formulate the CT volume as a continuous intensity field and develop a novel DIF-Net to perform high-quality CBCT reconstruction from extremely sparse (fewer than 10) projection views at an ultrafast speed. The intensity field of a CT can be regarded as a continuous function of 3D spatial points. Therefore, the reconstruction can be reformulated as regressing the intensity value of an arbitrary 3D point from given sparse projections. Specifically, for a point, DIF-Net extracts its view-specific features from different 2D projection views. These features are subsequently aggregated by a fusion module for intensity estimation. Notably, thousands of points can be processed in parallel to improve efficiency during training and testing. In practice, we collect a knee CBCT dataset to train and evaluate DIF-Net. Extensive experiments show that our approach can reconstruct CBCT with high image quality and high spatial resolution from extremely sparse views within 1.6 seconds, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/DIF-Net."}}

We observe the key limitation of the existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised solution cross pseudo supervision is the unsatisfactory precision of foreground classes, leading to a degenerated result under barely-supervised learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Compete-to-Win method (ComWin) to enhance the pseudo label quality. In contrast to directly using one model's predictions as pseudo labels, our key idea is that high-quality pseudo labels should be generated by comparing multiple confidence maps produced by different networks to select the most confident one (a compete-to-win strategy). To further refine pseudo labels at near-boundary areas, an enhanced version of ComWin, namely, ComWin+, is proposed by integrating a boundary-aware enhancement module. Experiments show that our method can achieve the best performance on three public medical image datasets for cardiac structure segmentation, pancreas segmentation and colon tumor segmentation, respectively. The source code is now available at https://github.com/Huiimin5/comwin."}}

In this paper, we present a Random Sampling Consensus Federated learning, namely RSCFed, by considering the uneven reliability among models from labeled clients and unlabeled clients. Our key motivation is that given models with large deviations from either labeled clients or unlabeled clients, the consensus could be reached by performing random sup-sampling over clients. To achieve it, instead of directly aggregating local models, we first distill several sub-consensus models by random sub-sampling over clients and then aggregating the sub-consensus models to the global model. To enhance the robustness of sub-consensus models, we also develop a novel distance-reweighted model aggregation method.

Like other medical data, the volume-wise labeling of knee MR images is expertise-demanded and time-consuming; hence semi-supervised learning (SSL), particularly barely-supervised learning, is highly desirable for training with insufficient labeled data. We observed that the class imbalance problem is severe in the knee MR images as the cartilages only occupy 6% of foreground volumes, and the situation becomes worse without sufficient labeled data. To address the above problem, we present a novel framework for barely-supervised knee segmentation with noisy and imbalanced labels. Our framework leverages label distribution to encourage the network to put more effort into learning cartilage parts. Specifically, we utilize 1.) label quantity distribution for modifying the objective loss function to a class-aware weighted form and 2.) label position distribution for constructing a cropping probability mask to crop more sub-volumes in cartilage areas from both labeled and unlabeled inputs. In addition, we design dual uncertainty-aware sampling supervision to enhance the supervision of low-confident categories for efficient unsupervised learning. Experiments show that our proposed framework brings significant improvements by incorporating the unlabeled data and alleviating the problem of class imbalance. More importantly, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art SSL methods, demonstrating the potential of our framework for the more challenging SSL setting."}}

However, the annotations require professional knowledge and are limited in number. Recently, semi-supervised learning has demonstrated great potential in medical segmentation tasks. Most existing methods related to cardiac magnetic resonance images only focus on regular images with similar domains and high image quality. A semi-supervised domain generalization method was developed in [2], which enhances the quality of pseudo labels on varied datasets. In this paper, we follow the strategy in [2] and present a domain generalization method for semi-supervised medical segmentation. Our main goal is to improve the quality of pseudo labels under extreme MRI Analysis with various domains. We perform Fourier transformation on input images to learn low-level statistics and cross-domain information. Then we feed the augmented images as input to the double cross pseudo supervision networks to calculate the variance among pseudo labels. We evaluate our method on the CMRxMotion dataset [1]. With only partially labeled data and without domain labels, our approach consistently generates accurate segmentation results of cardiac magnetic resonance images with different respiratory motions. Code will be available after the conference."}}

Mainstream methods predict the missing shapes by decoding a global feature learned from the input point cloud, which often leads to deficient results in preserving topology consistency and surface details. In this work, we present MEPCN, a point completion network that leverages emptiness in 3D shape space. Given a single depth scan, previous methods often encode the occupied partial shapes while ignoring the empty regions (e.g. holes) in depth maps. In contrast, we argue that these \u2018emptiness\u2019 clues indicate shape boundaries that can be used to improve topology representation and detail granularity on surfaces. Specifically, our ME-PCN encodes both the occupied point cloud and the neighboring \u2018empty points\u2019. It estimates coarse-grained but complete and reasonable surface points in the first stage, followed by a refinement stage to produce fine-grained surface details. Comprehensive experiments verify that our ME-PCN presents better qualitative and quantitative performance against the state-of-the-art. Besides, we further prove that our \u2018emptiness\u2019 design is lightweight and easy to embed in existing methods, which shows consistent effectiveness in improving the CD and EMD scores."}}
