Traditional qMRI methods usually deal separately with artifacts arising from accelerated data acquisition, involuntary physical motion, and magnetic-field inhomogeneities, leading to suboptimal end-to-end performance. This paper presents CoRRECT, a unified deep unfolding (DU) framework for qMRI consisting of a model-based end-to-end neural network, a method for motion-artifact reduction, and a self-supervised learning scheme. The network is trained to produce R2* maps whose k-space data matches the real data by also accounting for motion and field inhomogeneities. When deployed, CoRRECT only uses the k-space data without any pre-computed parameters for motion or inhomogeneity correction. Our results on experimentally collected multi-Gradient-Recalled Echo (mGRE) MRI data show that CoRRECT recovers motion and inhomogeneity artifact-free R2* maps in highly accelerated acquisition settings. This work opens the door to DU methods that can integrate physical measurement models, biophysical signal models, and learned prior models for high-quality qMRI."}}

An image can be compressed by training an INR model with fewer weights than the number of image pixels to map the coordinates of the image to corresponding pixel values. While traditional training approaches for INRs are based on enforcing pixel-wise image consistency, we propose to further improve image quality by using a new structural regularizer. We present structural regularization for INR compression (SINCO) as a novel INR method for image compression. SINCO imposes structural consistency of the compressed images to the groundtruth by using a segmentation network to penalize the discrepancy of segmentation masks predicted from compressed images. We validate SINCO on brain MRI images by showing that it can achieve better performance than some recent INR methods."}}

We present self-supervised deep equilibrium model (SelfDEQ) as the first self-supervised reconstruction framework for training model-based implicit networks from undersampled and noisy MRI measurements. Our theoretical results show that SelfDEQ can compensate for unbalanced sampling across multiple acquisitions and match the performance of fully supervised DEQ.

This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a novel unsupervised deep registration-augmented reconstruction method (U-Dream) for training deep neural nets to reconstruct high-quality images by directly mapping pairs of unregistered and artifact-corrupted images. The ability of U-Dream to circumvent the need for accurately registered data makes it widely applicable to many biomedical image reconstruction tasks. We validate it in accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by training an image reconstruction model directly on pairs of undersampled measurements from images that have undergone nonrigid deformations."}}

We propose SCRED-Net as a novel methodology that introduces a stochastic approximation to the unfolded regularization by denoising (RED) algorithm. Our method uses only a subset of measurements within each cascade block, making it scalable to a large number of measurements for efficient end-to-end training. We present numerical results showing the effectiveness of SCRED-Net on intensity diffraction tomography (IDT) and sparse-view computed tomography (CT). Our results show that SCRED-Net matches the performance of a batch deep unfolding network at a fraction of training and operational complexity."}}
