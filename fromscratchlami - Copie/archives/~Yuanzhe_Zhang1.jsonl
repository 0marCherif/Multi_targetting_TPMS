Question answering over knowledge base (KB-QA) is one of the promising approaches to access the substantial knowledge. Meanwhile, as the neural network-based (NN-based) methods develop, NN-based KB-QA has already achieved impressive results. However, previous work did not put more emphasis on question representation, and the question is converted into a fixed vector regardless of its candidate answers. This simple representation strategy is not easy to express the proper information in the question. Hence, we present an end-to-end neural network model to represent the questions and their corresponding scores dynamically according to the various candidate answer aspects via cross-attention mechanism. In addition, we leverage the global knowledge inside the underlying KB, aiming at integrating the rich KB information into the representation of the answers. As a result, it could alleviates the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem, which helps the cross-attention model to represent the question more precisely. The experimental results on WebQuestions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}

The most significant distinction between multiple KB-QA and single KB-QA is that the former must consider the alignments between KBs. The pipeline strategy first constructs the alignments independently, and then uses the obtained alignments to construct queries. However, alignment construction is not a trivial task, and the introduced noises would be passed on to query construction. By contrast, we notice that alignment construction and query construction are interactive steps, and jointly considering them would be beneficial. To this end, we present a novel joint model based on integer linear programming (ILP), uniting these two procedures into a uniform framework. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art systems, and is able to improve the performance of both alignment construction and query construction."}}

This technique can help common users to directly access open-structured knowledge on the Web and, accordingly, has attracted much attention. To this end, we propose a novel method using first-order logic. We formulate the knowledge for resolving the ambiguities in the main three steps of QALD (phrase detection, phrase-tosemantic-item mapping and semantic item grouping) as first-order logic clauses in a Markov Logic Network. All clauses can then produce interacted effects in a unified framework and can jointly resolve all ambiguities. Moreover, our method adopts a pattern-learning strategy for semantic item grouping. In this way, our method can cover more text expressions and answer more questions than previous methods using manually designed patterns. The experimental results using open benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}
