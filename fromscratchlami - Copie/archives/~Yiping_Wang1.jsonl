Most existing WSSS methods exploit the class activation maps (CAMs) as the seeds and generate the pseudo-pixel-level ground truth to train a segmentation network. In this work, we introduce a causal inference framework to ameliorate the quality of CAMs, conducing to the performance raise of existing WSSS algorithms that rely on CAMs. Our motivation is to deconfound a set of class-specific latent \\textit{confounders} in a dataset, which are the potential cause of low-quality and poorly-localized CAMs. Due to the unobservable nature of the confounders, we present the utilization of \\textit{front-door adjustment} for causal intervention to deconfound a classification neural network, without presuming and estimating the confounders explicitly. Our proposed algorithm, Causal CAM ($c^2am$), outperformed the prior causal framework for WSSS by a large margin, \\underline{without} any additional parameters, network architecture modification, or manipulation of images, and only needs to add \\underline{one} more line of code in a standard classifier training loop. Furthermore, we provide an optimization interpretation of the front-door adjustment for training a classifier to explain the improvements by \\ccam. We evaluated $c^2am$ on PASCAL VOC 2012 and achieved mIoU 69.6\\% of pseudo-mask generation on the training set, and mIoU 67.5\\% and 67.7\\% on validation and test set after training DeepLabV2 on the pseudo-masks. Our implementation and model weights for reproducibility are released at With Held."}}

The method or process of defining these environments directly impacts robustness and generalization of the learned agent policies. In single agent reinforcement learning, this problem is often solved by domain randomization, or randomizing the environment and tasks within the scope of the desired operating domain of the agent. The challenge here is to generate both structured and solvable environments that guide the agent's learning process. Most recently, works have sought to produce the environments under the Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) formulation. However, these methods lead to a proliferation of adversarial agents to train one agent for a single agent problem in a discretized task domain. In this work, we aim to automatically generate environments that are solvable and challenging for the continuous multi-agent setting. We base our solution on the Teacher-Student relationship with parameter sharing $\\textit{Students}$ where we re-imagine the $\\textit{Teacher}$ as an environment generator for UED. Our approach uses one environment generator agent ($\\textit{Teacher}$) for any number of learning agents ($\\textit{Students}$). We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that, in terms of multi-agent ($\\geq$ 8 agents) navigation and steering, $\\textit{Students}$ trained by our approach outperform agents using heuristic search, as well as agents trained by domain randomization.

There are $5$ major histological subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer, each with distinct morphological, genetic, and clinical features. Currently, these histotypes are determined by a pathologist's microscopic examination of tumor whole-slide images (WSI). This process has been hampered by poor inter-observer agreement (Cohen\u2019s kappa $0.54$-$0.67$). We utilized a two-stage deep transfer learning algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and progressive resizing for automatic classification of epithelial ovarian carcinoma WSIs. The proposed algorithm achieved a mean accuracy of $87.54\\%$ and Cohen's kappa of $0.8106$ in the slide-level classification of $305$ WSIs; performing better than a standard CNN and pathologists without gynecology-specific training.
