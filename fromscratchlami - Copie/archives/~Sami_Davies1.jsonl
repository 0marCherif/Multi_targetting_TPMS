In this work, we build on this idea to improve the performance of the widely used Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for computing maximum flows by seeding Ford-Fulkerson with predicted flows. Our proposed method offers strong theoretical performance in terms of the quality of the prediction. We then consider image segmentation, a common use-case of flows in computer vision, and complement our theoretical analysis with strong empirical results."}}

Our algorithms are the first purely combinatorial approximation algorithms for this problem. We construct a novel semi-metric on the set of vertices, which we call the correlation metric, that indicates to our clustering algorithms whether pairs of nodes should be in the same cluster. The paper demonstrates empirically that, compared to prior work, our algorithms sacrifice little in the objective quality to obtain significantly better run-time. Moreover, our algorithms scale to larger networks that are effectively intractable for known algorithms."}}

Associated with every precedence constraint between a pair of jobs is a communication delay, the time duration the scheduler has to wait between the two jobs if they are scheduled on different machines. The objective is to assign the jobs to machines to minimize the makespan of the schedule. Despite being a fundamental problem in theory and a consequential problem in practice, the approximability of scheduling problems with communication delays is not very well understood. One of the top ten open problems in scheduling theory, in the influential list by Schuurman and Woeginger and its latest update by Bansal, asks if the problem admits a constant-factor approximation algorithm. In this paper, we answer this question in the negative by proving a logarithmic hardness for the problem under the standard complexity theory assumption that NP-complete problems do not admit quasi-polynomial-time algorithms. Our hardness result is obtained using a surprisingly simple reduction from a problem that we call Unique Machine Precedence constraints Scheduling (UMPS). We believe that this problem is of central importance in understanding the hardness of many scheduling problems and we conjecture that it is very hard to approximate. Among other things, our conjecture implies a logarithmic hardness of related machine scheduling with precedences, a long-standing open problem in scheduling theory and approximation algorithms."}}

However, it is likely that important combinatorial or algebraic insights are needed in order to break the $n^{o(1)}$ threshold. One way to develop new understanding in graph coloring is to study special subclasses of graphs. For instance, Blum studied the 3-coloring of random graphs, and Arora and Ge studied the 3-coloring of graphs with low threshold-rank. In this work, we study graphs which arise from a tensor product, which appear to be novel instances of the 3-coloring problem. We consider graphs of the form $H = (V,E)$ with $V =V( K_3 \\times G)$ and $E = E(K_3 \\times G) \\setminus E'$, where $E' \\subseteq E(K_3 \\times G)$ is any edge set such that no vertex has more than an $\\epsilon$ fraction of its edges in $E'$. We show that one can construct $\\widetilde{H} = K_3 \\times \\widetilde{G}$ with $V(\\widetilde{H}) = V(H)$ that is close to $H$. For arbitrary $G$, $\\widetilde{H}$ satisfies $|E(H) \\Delta E(\\widetilde{H})| \\leq O(\\epsilon|E(H)|)$. Additionally when $G$ is a mild expander, we provide a 3-coloring for $H$ in polynomial time. These results partially generalize an exact tensor factorization algorithm of Imrich. On the other hand, without any assumptions on $G$, we show that it is NP-hard to 3-color $H$."}}

Here, instead of learning a binary string perfectly from noisy samples, as in the original trace reconstruction problem, the goal is to output a string that is close in edit distance to the original string using few traces. We present several algorithms that can approximately reconstruct strings that belong to certain classes, where the estimate is within <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$n$</tex> / polylog (n) edit distance and where we only use polylog (n) traces (or sometimes just a single trace). These classes contain strings that require a linear number of traces for exact reconstruction and that are quite different from a typical random string. From a technical point of view, our algorithms approximately reconstruct consecutive substrings of the unknown string by aligning dense regions of traces and using a run of a suitable length to approximate each region.
