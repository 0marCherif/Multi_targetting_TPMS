Our system, FastRLAP, trains autonomously in the real world, without human interventions, and without requiring any simulation or expert demonstrations. Our system integrates a number of important components to make this possible: we initialize the representations for the RL policy and value function from a large prior dataset of other robots navigating in other environments (at low speed), which provides a navigation-relevant representation. From here, a sample-efficient online RL method uses a single low-speed user-provided demonstration to determine the desired driving course, extracts a set of navigational checkpoints, and autonomously practices driving through these checkpoints, resetting automatically on collision or failure. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that with appropriate initialization and choice of algorithm, our system can learn to drive over a variety of racing courses with less than 20 minutes of online training. The resulting policies exhibit emergent aggressive driving skills, such as timing braking and acceleration around turns and avoiding areas which impede the robot's motion, approaching the performance of a human driver using a similar first-person interface over the course of training."}}

Humans can rapidly navigate new environments, particularly indoor environments that are laid out logically, by leveraging semantics --- e.g., a kitchen often adjoins a living room, an exit sign indicates the way out, and so forth. Language models can provide robots with such knowledge, but directly using language models to instruct a robot how to reach some destination can also be impractical: while language models might produce a narrative about how to reach some goal, because they are not grounded in real-world observations, this narrative might be arbitrarily wrong. Therefore, in this paper we study how the ``semantic guesswork'' produced by language models can be utilized as a guiding heuristic for planning algorithms. Our method, Language Frontier Guide (LFG), uses the language model to bias exploration of novel real-world environments by incorporating the semantic knowledge stored in language models as a search heuristic for planning with either topological or metric maps. We evaluate LFG in challenging real-world environments and simulated benchmarks, outperforming uninformed exploration and other ways of using language models."}}

Such models are typically trained on large and diverse datasets with weak supervision, consuming much more training data than is available for any individual downstream application. In this paper, we describe the Visual Navigation Transformer (ViNT), a foundation model that aims to bring the success of general-purpose pre-trained models to vision-based robotic navigation. ViNT is trained with a general goal-reaching objective that can be used with any navigation dataset, and employs a flexible Transformer-based architecture to learn navigational affordances and enable efficient adaptation to a variety of downstream navigational tasks. ViNT is trained on a number of existing navigation datasets, comprising hundreds of hours of robotic navigation from a variety of different robotic platforms, and exhibits positive transfer, outperforming specialist models trained on narrower datasets. ViNT can be augmented with diffusion-based goal proposals to explore novel environments, and can solve kilometer-scale navigation problems when equipped with long-range heuristics. ViNT can also be adapted to novel task specifications with a technique inspired by prompt-tuning, where the goal encoder is replaced by an encoding of another task modality (e.g., GPS waypoints or turn-by-turn directions) embedded into the same space of goal tokens. This flexibility and ability to accommodate a variety of downstream problem domains establish ViNT as an effective foundation model for mobile robotics."}}

Computer vision, natural language processing, and other applications can often reuse public datasets to train many different models. However, due to  differences in physical configurations, it is challenging to leverage public datasets for training robotic control policies on new robot platforms or for new tasks. In this work, we propose a novel framework, ExAug to augment the experiences of different robot platforms from multiple datasets in diverse environments. ExAug leverages a simple principle: by extracting 3D information in the form of a point cloud, we can create much more complex and structured augmentations, utilizing both generating synthetic images and geometric-aware penalization that would have been suitable in the same situation for a different robot, with different size, turning radius, and camera placement. The trained policy is evaluated on two new robot platforms with three different cameras in indoor and outdoor environments with obstacles."}}

If we could combine data from all available sources, including multiple kinds of robots, we could train more powerful navigation models. In this paper, we study how goal-conditioned policies for vision-based navigation can be trained on data obtained from many distinct but structurally similar robots, and enable broad generalization across environments and embodiments. We analyze the necessary design decisions for effective data sharing across different robots, including the use of temporal context and standardized action spaces, and demonstrate that an omnipolicy trained from heterogeneous datasets outperforms policies trained on any single dataset. We curate 60 hours of navigation trajectories from 6 distinct robots, and deploy the trained omnipolicy on a range of new robots, including an underactuated quadrotor. We also find that training on diverse, multi-robot datasets leads to robustness against degradation in sensing and actuation. Using a pre-trained base navigational omnipolicy with broad generalization capabilities can bootstrap navigation applications on novel robots going forward, and we hope that GNM represents a step in that direction."}}

However, particularly in vision-based settings where specifying goals requires an image, this makes for an unnatural interface. Language provides a more convenient modality for communication with robots, but contemporary methods typically require expensive supervision, in the form of trajectories annotated with language descriptions. We develop a system, LM-Nav, for robotic navigation that enjoys the benefits of training on unannotated large datasets of trajectories, while still providing a high-level interface to the user. Instead of utilizing a labeled instruction following dataset, we show that such a system can be constructed entirely out of pre-trained models for navigation (ViNG), image-language association (CLIP), and language modeling (GPT-3), without requiring any fine-tuning or language-annotated robot data.  We instantiate LM-Nav on a real-world  mobile robot and demonstrate long-horizon navigation through complex, outdoor environments from natural language instructions.\n"}}
