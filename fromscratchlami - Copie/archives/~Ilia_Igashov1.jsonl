An open challenge in this area is designing linkers between disconnected molecular fragments of interest to obtain chemically-relevant candidate drug molecules. In this work, we propose DiffLinker, an E(3)-equivariant 3D-conditional diffusion model for molecular linker design. Given a set of disconnected fragments, our model places missing atoms in between and designs a molecule incorporating all the initial fragments. Unlike previous approaches that are only able to connect pairs of molecular fragments, our method can link an arbitrary number of fragments. Additionally, the model automatically determines the number of atoms in the linker and its attachment points to the input fragments. We demonstrate that DiffLinker outperforms other methods on the standard datasets generating more diverse and synthetically-accessible molecules. Besides, we experimentally test our method in real-world applications, showing that it can successfully generate valid linkers conditioned on target protein pockets."}}

Traditional SBDD pipelines start with large-scale docking of compound libraries from public databases, thus limiting the exploration of chemical space to existent previously studied regions.\nRecent machine learning methods approached this problem using an atom-by-atom generation approach, which is computationally expensive. \nIn this paper, we formulate SBDD as a 3D-conditional generation problem and present DiffSBDD, an E(3)-equivariant 3D-conditional diffusion model that generates novel ligands conditioned on protein pockets. \nFurthermore, we curate a new dataset of experimentally determined binding complex data from Binding MOAD to provide realistic binding scenario rather than the synthetic CrossDocked dataset. Comprehensive in silico experiments demonstrate the efficiency of DiffSBDD in generating novel and diverse drug-like ligands that engage protein pockets with high binding energies as predicted by in silico docking."}}

This molecular format presents a number of advantages, e.g. long half-lives and cell permeability, making it possible to access a wide range of therapeutic targets. However, finding small molecules that engage \u201chard-to-drug\u201d protein targets specifically and potently remains an arduous process, requiring experimental screening of extensive compound libraries to identify candidate leads. The search continues with further optimization of compound leads to meet the required potency and toxicity thresholds for clinical applications. Here, we propose a new computational workflow for high-throughput fragment-based screening and binding affinity prediction where we leverage the available protein-ligand complex structures using a state-of-the-art protein surface embedding framework (dMaSIF). We developed a tool capable of finding suitable ligands and fragments for a given protein pocket solely based on protein surface descriptors, that capture chemical and geometric features of the target pocket. The identified fragments can be further combined into novel ligands. Using the structural data, our ligand discovery pipeline learns the signatures of interactions between surface patches and small pharmacophores. On a query target pocket, the algorithm matches known target pockets and returns either potential ligands or identifies multiple ligand fragments in the binding site. Our binding affinity predictor is capable of predicting the affinity of a given protein-ligand pair, requiring only limited information about the ligand pose. This enables screening without the costly step of first docking candidate molecules. Our framework will facilitate the design of ligands based on the target\u2019s surface information. It may significantly reduce the experimental screening load and ultimately reveal novel chemical compounds for targeting challenging proteins."}}
