However, it is not clear how to best apply foundation models without labeled data. A potential approach is to fuse foundation models with weak supervision frameworks, which use weak label sources\u2014pre-trained models, heuristics, crowd-workers\u2014to construct pseudolabels. The challenge is building a combination that best exploits the signal available in both foundation models and weak sources. We propose LIGER, a combination that uses foundation model embeddings to improve two crucial elements of existing weak supervision techniques. First, we produce finer estimates of weak source quality by partitioning the embedding space and learning per-part source accuracies. Second, we improve source coverage by extending source votes in embedding space. Despite the black-box nature of foundation models, we prove results characterizing how our approach improves performance and show that lift scales with the smoothness of label distributions in embedding space. On six benchmark NLP and video tasks, LIGER outperforms vanilla weak supervision by 14.1 points, weakly-supervised kNN and adapters by 11.8 points, and kNN and adapters supervised by traditional hand labels by 7.2 points."}}

The key idea of our approach is to design a 3D renderer and embodied navigation simulator around the principle of \u201cbatch simulation\u201d: accepting and executing large batches of requests simultaneously.  Beyond exposing large amounts of work at once, batch simulation allows implementations to amortize in-memory storage of scene assets, rendering work, data loading, and synchronization costs across many simulation requests, dramatically improving the number of simulated agents per GPU and overall simulation throughput.  To balance DNN inference and training costs with faster simulation, we also build a computationally efficient policy DNN that maintains high task performance, and modify training algorithms to maintain sample efficiency when training with large mini-batches. By combining batch simulation and DNN performance optimizations, we demonstrate that PointGoal navigation agents can be trained in complex 3D environments on a single GPU in 1.5 days to 97% of the accuracy of agents trained on a prior state-of-the-art system using a 64-GPU cluster over three days.  We provide open-source reference implementations of our batch 3D renderer and simulator to facilitate incorporation of these ideas into RL systems."}}
