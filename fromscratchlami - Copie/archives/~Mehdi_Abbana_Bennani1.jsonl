While recent years have seen a surge in methodological improvements in this area, they mostly focused on building specialist models. Specialist models are capable of learning to neurally execute either only one algorithm or a collection of algorithms with identical control-flow backbone. Here, instead, we focus on constructing a generalist neural algorithmic learner---a single graph neural network processor capable of learning to execute a wide range of algorithms, such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, path-finding and geometry. We leverage the CLRS benchmark to empirically show that, much like recent successes in the domain of perception, generalist algorithmic learners can be built by \"incorporating\" knowledge. That is, it is possible to effectively learn algorithms in a multi-task manner, so long as we can learn to execute them well in a single-task regime. Motivated by this, we present a series of improvements to the input representation, training regime and processor architecture over CLRS, improving average single-task performance by over 20% from prior art. We then conduct a thorough ablation of multi-task learners leveraging these improvements. Our results demonstrate a generalist learner that effectively incorporates knowledge captured by specialist models."}}

Although major advances have been made in the field, one recurring problem which remains unsolved is that of Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). While the issue has been extensively studied empirically, little attention has been paid from a theoretical angle. In this paper, we show that the impact of CF increases as two tasks increasingly align. We introduce a measure of task similarity called the NTK overlap matrix which is at the core of CF. We analyze common projected gradient algorithms and demonstrate how they mitigate forgetting. Then, we propose a variant of Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD) which leverages structure of the data through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experiments support our theoretical findings and show how our method can help reduce CF on classical CL datasets. "}}

Orthogonal Gradient Descent (Farajtabar et al., 2019) was proposed to tackle the challenge. However, no theoretical guarantees have been proven yet. We present a theoretical framework to study Continual Learning algorithms in the NTK regime. This framework comprises closed form expression of the model through tasks and proxies for transfer learning, generalisation and tasks similarity. In this framework, we prove that OGD is robust to Catastrophic Forgetting then derive the first generalisation bound for SGD and OGD for Continual Learning. Finally, we study the limits of this framework in practice for OGD and highlight the importance of the NTK variation for Continual Learning."}}

Orthogonal Gradient Descent (Farajtabar et al., 2019) achieves state-of-the-art results in practice for continual learning, although no theoretical guarantees have been proven yet. We derive the first generalisation guarantees for the algorithm OGD for continual learning, for overparameterized neural networks. We find that OGD is only provably robust to catastrophic forgetting across a single task. We propose OGD+, prove that it is robust to catastrophic forgetting across an arbitrary number of tasks, and that it verifies tighter generalisation bounds. The experiments show that OGD+ outperforms OGD on settings with long range memory dependencies, even though the models are not overparameterized. Also, we derive a closed form expression of the learned models through tasks, as a recursive kernel regression relation, which captures the transferability of knowledge through tasks. Finally, we quantify theoretically the impact of task ordering on the generalisation error, which highlights the importance of the curriculum for lifelong learning."}}
