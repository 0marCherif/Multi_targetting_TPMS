SV-approximation is stronger than previous notions of spectral approximation considered in the literature, including spectral approximation of Laplacians for undirected graphs (Spielman Teng STOC 2004), standard approximation for directed graphs (Cohen et. al. STOC 2007), and unit-circle approximation for directed graphs (Ahmadinejad et. al. FOCS 2020). Moreover, SV approximation enjoys several useful properties not known to be possessed by previous notions of approximation, such as being preserved under products of random-walk matrices and with matrices of bounded norm. Notably, we show that there is a simple black-box reduction from SV-sparsifying Eulerian directed graphs to SV-sparsifying undirected graphs. With this reduction in hand, we provide a nearly linear-time algorithm for SV-sparsifying undirected and hence also Eulerian directed graphs. This also yields the first nearly linear-time algorithm for unit-circle-sparsifying Eulerian directed graphs. In addition, we give a nearly linear-time algorithm for SV-sparsifying (and UC-sparsifying) random-walk polynomials of Eulerian directed graphs with second normalized singular value bounded away from $1$ by $1/\\text{poly}(n)$. Finally, we show that a simple repeated-squaring and sparsification algorithm for solving Laplacian systems, introduced by (Peng Spielman STOC 2014) for undirected graphs, also works for Eulerian digraphs whose random-walk matrix is normal (i.e. unitarily diagonalizable), if we use SV-sparsification at each step. Prior Laplacian solvers for Eulerian digraphs are significantly more complicated."}}

Standard statistical formulations of the problem are provably solved by general convex programming techniques and more practical, fast (nearly-linear time) iterative methods. However, these latter \"fast algorithms\" have previously been observed to be brittle in various real-world settings.\n\nWe investigate the brittleness of fast sparse recovery algorithms to generative model changes through the lens of studying their robustness to a \"helpful\" semi-random adversary, a framework which tests whether an algorithm overfits to input assumptions. We consider the following basic model: let $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ be a measurement matrix which contains an unknown subset of rows $\\mathbf{G} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$ which are bounded and satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP), but is otherwise arbitrary. Letting $x^\\star \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ be $s$-sparse, and given either exact measurements $b = \\mathbf{A} x^\\star$ or noisy measurements $b = \\mathbf{A} x^\\star + \\xi$, we design algorithms recovering $x^\\star$ information-theoretically optimally in nearly-linear time. We extend our algorithm to hold for weaker generative models relaxing our planted RIP row subset assumption to a natural weighted variant, and show that our method's guarantees naturally interpolate the quality of the measurement matrix to, in some parameter regimes, run in sublinear time.\n\nOur approach differs from that of prior fast iterative methods with provable guarantees under semi-random generative models (Cheng-Ge '18, Li et al. '20), which typically separate the problem of learning the planted instance from the estimation problem, i.e. they attempt to first learn the planted \"good\" instance (in our case, $\\mathbf{G}$). However, natural conditions which make sparse recovery tractable, such as RIP, are NP-hard to verify and hence first learning a sufficient row reweighting appears challenging. We eschew this approach and design a new iterative method, tailored to the geometry of sparse recovery, which is provably robust to our semi-random model. We hope our approach opens the door to new robust, efficient algorithms for other natural statistical inverse problems."}}
