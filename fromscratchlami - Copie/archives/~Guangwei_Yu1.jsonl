A\ncommon approach is to train a frame-level classifier where\nframes with the highest class probability are selected to\nmake a video-level prediction. Frame-level activations are\nthen used for localization. However, the absence of frame-level\n annotations cause the classifier to impart class bias on\nevery frame. To address this, we propose the Action Selection\nLearning (ASL) approach to capture the general concept of action,\n a property we refer to as \u201cactionness\u201d. Under ASL, the model\nis trained with a novel class-agnostic task to predict which frames\nwill be selected by the classifier. Empirically, we show that ASL\noutperforms leading baselines on two popular benchmarks\n THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-1.2, with 12.3% and 5.7% relative\n improvement respectively. We further analyze the properties of ASL\n and demonstrate the importance of actionness. The full code for\nthis work will be released at the time of publication.\n"}}

However, research in this area has primarily focused on modeling user-item interactions, and few latent models have been developed for cold start. Deep learning has recently achieved remarkable success showing excellent results for diverse input types. Inspired by these results we propose a neural network based latent model called DropoutNet to address the cold start problem in recommender systems. Unlike existing approaches that incorporate additional content-based objective terms, we instead focus on the optimization and show that neural network models can be explicitly trained for cold start through\ndropout. Our model can be applied on top of any existing latent model effectively providing cold start capabilities, and full power of deep architectures. Empirically we demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on publicly available benchmarks. Code\nis available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/DropoutNet."}}

Given a nearest neighbor graph produced by the\nglobal descriptor model, we traverse it by alternating between exploit and explore steps. The exploit step maximally utilizes the immediate neighborhood of each vertex, while the explore step traverses vertices that are farther\naway in the descriptor space. By combining these two steps we can better capture the underlying image manifold, and successfully retrieve relevant images that are visually dissimilar to the query. Our traversal algorithm is conceptually simple, has few tunable parameters and can be implemented with basic data structures. This enables fast real-time inference for previously unseen queries\nwith minimal memory overhead. Despite relative simplicity, we show highly competitive results on multiple\npublic benchmarks, including the largest image retrieval dataset that is currently publicly available.

Numerous variations such as view angle, lighting and occlusion make it difficult to design models that are both robust and efficient. Many leading methods traverse the nearest neighbor graph to exploit higher order neighbor information and uncover the highly complex underlying manifold. In this work we propose a different approach where we leverage graph convolutional networks to directly encode neighbor information into image descriptors. We further leverage ideas from clustering and manifold learning, and introduce an unsupervised loss based on pairwise separation of image similarities. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model is able to successfully learn a new descriptor space that significantly improves retrieval accuracy while still allowing efficient inner product inference. Experiments on five public benchmarks show highly competitive performance with up to 24% relative improvement in mAP over leading baselines."}}
