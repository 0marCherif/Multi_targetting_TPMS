However, models trained with standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are known to not capture it. Their behaviors such as subgroup performance, or adversarial robustness can be very different during training and testing. We show that Differentially-Private (DP) training provably ensures the high-level WYSIWYG property, which we quantify using a notion of Distributional Generalization (DG). Applying this connection, we introduce new conceptual tools for designing deep-learning methods by reducing generalization concerns to optimization ones: to mitigate unwanted behavior at test time, it is provably sufficient to mitigate this behavior on the train datasets. By applying this novel design principle, which bypasses ``pathologies'' of SGD, we construct simple algorithms that are competitive with SOTA in several distributional robustness applications, significantly improve the privacy vs. disparate impact tradeoff of DP-SGD, and mitigate robust overfitting in adversarial training. Finally, we also improve on known theoretical bounds relating DP, stability, and distributional generalization."}}

In this work, we ask whether it is possible to achieve similar results with substantially less training time and data. We achieve this by taking advantage of existing pretrained unimodal encoders and careful curation of alignment data relevant to the downstream task of interest. We study a natural approach to aligning existing encoders via small auxiliary functions, and we find that this method is competitive with (or outperforms) state of the art in many settings while being less prone to overfitting, less costly to train, and more robust to distribution shift. With a carefully chosen alignment distribution, our method surpasses prior state of the art for ImageNet zero-shot classification on public data while using two orders of magnitude less time and data and training 77% fewer parameters."}}

In this work, we propose a new approach: we measure the performance of a collection of models when evaluated at *single input point*. Specifically, we study a point's *profile*: the relationship between models' average performance on the test distribution and their pointwise performance on this individual point. We find that profiles can yield new insights into the structure of both models and data---in and out-of-distribution. For example, we empirically show that real data distributions consist of points with qualitatively different profiles. On one hand, there are ``compatible'' points with strong correlation between the pointwise and average performance. On the other hand, there are points with weak and even *negative* correlation: cases where improving overall model accuracy actually *hurts* performance on these inputs. As an application, we use profiles to construct a dataset we call CIFAR-10-NEG: a subset of CINIC-10 such that for standard models, accuracy on CIFAR-10-NEG is *negatively correlated* with CIFAR-10 accuracy. Illustrating for the first time an OOD dataset that completely inverts ``accuracy-on-the-line'' (Miller et al., 2021)."}}

In this work, we study NTKs through the lens of scaling laws, and demonstrate that they fall short of explaining important aspects of neural network generalization. In particular, we demonstrate realistic settings where finite-width neural networks have significantly better data scaling exponents as compared to their corresponding empirical and infinite NTKs at initialization. This reveals a more fundamental difference between the real networks and NTKs, beyond just a few percentage points of test accuracy. Further, we show that even if the empirical NTK is allowed to be pre-trained on a constant number of samples, the kernel scaling does not catch up to the neural network scaling. Finally, we show that the empirical NTK continues to evolve throughout most of the training, in contrast with prior work which suggests that it stabilizes after a few epochs of training. Altogether, our work establishes concrete limitations of the NTK approach in understanding generalization of real networks on natural datasets."}}

Empirically, certain interpolating methods can fit noisy training data without catastrophically bad test performance, which defies standard intuitions from statistical learning theory. Aiming to explain this, a large body of recent work has studied \\emph{benign overfitting}, a behavior seen in certain asymptotic settings under which interpolating methods approach Bayes-optimality, even in the presence of noise. In this work, we argue that, while benign overfitting has been instructive to study, real interpolating methods like deep networks do not fit benignly. That is, noise in the train set leads to suboptimal generalization, suggesting that these methods fall in an intermediate regime between benign and catastrophic overfitting, in which asymptotic risk is neither is neither Bayes-optimal nor unbounded, with the confounding effect of the noise being ``tempered\" but non-negligible. We call this behavior \\textit{tempered overfitting}. We first provide broad empirical evidence for our three-part taxonomy, demonstrating that deep neural networks and kernel machines fit to noisy data can be reasonably well classified as benign, tempered, or catastrophic. We then specialize to kernel (ridge) regression (KR), obtaining conditions on the ridge parameter and kernel eigenspectrum under which KR exhibits each of the three behaviors, demonstrating the consequences for KR with common kernels and trained neural networks of infinite width using experiments on natural and synthetic datasets."}}

Recent work of Nakkiran and Bansal has empirically observed that such networks behave as \u201cconditional samplers\u201d from the noisy distribution. That is, they replicate the noise in the train data to unseen examples. We give a theoretical framework for studying this conditional sampling behavior in the context of learning theory. We relate the notion of such samplers to knowledge distillation, where a student network imitates the outputs of a teacher on unlabeled data. We show that samplers, while being bad classifiers, can be good teachers. Concretely, we prove that distillation from samplers is guaranteed to produce a student which approximates the Bayes optimal classifier. Finally, we show that some common learning algorithms (e.g., Nearest-Neighbours and Kernel Machines) can often generate samplers when applied in the overparameterized regime."}}
