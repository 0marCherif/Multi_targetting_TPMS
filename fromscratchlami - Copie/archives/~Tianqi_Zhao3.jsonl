Despite the success, deep RL algorithms are known to be sample inefficient, often requiring many rounds of interactions with the environments to obtain satisfactory performances. Recently, episodic memory based RL has attracted attention due to its ability to latch on good actions quickly. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective biologically inspired RL algorithm called Episodic Memory Deep Q-Networks (EMDQN), which leverages episodic memory to supervise an agent during training. Experiments show that our proposed method leads to better sample efficiency and is more likely to find good policy. It only requires 1/5 of the interactions of DQN to achieve many state-of-the-art performances on Atari games, significantly outperforming regular DQN and other episodic memory based RL algorithms."}}

A point is defined to be a $(\\delta,\\rho)$-mode if it is a local optimum of the density within a $\\delta$-neighborhood under metric $\\rho$. As we increase the ``scale'' parameter $\\delta$, the neighborhood size increases and the total number of modes monotonically decreases. The sequence of the $(\\delta,\\rho)$-modes reveal intrinsic topographical information of the underlying distributions. Though the mode finding problem is generally intractable in high dimensions, this paper unveils that, if the distribution can be approximated well by a tree graphical model, mode characterization is significantly easier. An efficient algorithm with provable theoretical guarantees is proposed and is applied to applications like data analysis and multiple predictions."}}
