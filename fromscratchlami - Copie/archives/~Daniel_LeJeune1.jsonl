INR performance depends strongly on the choice of the nonlinear activation function employed in its multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. A wide range of nonlinearities have been explored, but, unfortunately, current INRs designed to have high accuracy also suffer from poor robustness (to signal noise, parameter variation, etc.). Inspired by harmonic analysis, we develop a new, highly accurate and robust INR that does not exhibit this tradeoff. Wavelet Implicit neural REpresentation (WIRE) uses a continuous complex Gabor wavelet activation function that is well-known to be optimally concentrated in space-frequency and to have excellent biases for representing images. A wide range of experiments (image denoising, image inpainting, super-resolution, computed tomography reconstruction, image overfitting, and novel view synthesis with neural radiance fields) demonstrate that WIRE defines the new state of the art in INR accuracy, training time, and robustness."}}

In the multiple measurement vector (MMV) framework, a set of signals with the same support must be recovered from their corresponding measurements. Here, we present the first exploration of the MMV problem where signals are independently drawn from a sparse, multivariate Poisson distribution. We are primarily motivated by a suite of biosensing applications of microfluidics where analytes (such as whole cells or biomarkers) are captured in small volume partitions according to a Poisson distribution. We recover the sparse parameter vector of Poisson rates through maximum likelihood estimation with our novel Sparse Poisson Recovery (SPoRe) algorithm. SPoRe uses batch stochastic gradient ascent enabled by Monte Carlo approximations of otherwise intractable gradients. By uniquely leveraging the Poisson structure, SPoRe substantially outperforms a comprehensive set of existing and custom baseline CS algorithms. Notably, SPoRe can exhibit high performance even with one-dimensional measurements and high noise levels. This resource efficiency is not only unprecedented in the field of CS but is also particularly potent for applications in microfluidics in which the number of resolvable measurements per partition is often severely limited. We prove the identifiability property of the Poisson model under such lax conditions, analytically develop insights into system performance, and confirm these insights in simulated experiments. Our findings encourage a new approach to biosensing and are generalizable to other applications featuring spatial and temporal Poisson signals."}}

In this work, we study the effect that the number of parameters has on a classifier's vulnerability to membership inference attacks. We first demonstrate how the number of parameters of a model can induce a privacy--utility trade-off: increasing the number of parameters generally improves generalization performance at the expense of lower privacy. However, remarkably, we then show that if coupled with proper regularization, increasing the number of parameters of a model can actually simultaneously increase both its privacy and performance, thereby eliminating the privacy--utility trade-off. Theoretically, we demonstrate this curious phenomenon for logistic regression with ridge regularization in a bi-level feature ensemble setting. Pursuant to our theoretical exploration, we develop a novel leave-one-out analysis tool to precisely characterize the vulnerability of a linear classifier to the optimal membership inference attack. We empirically exhibit this \"blessing of dimensionality\" for neural networks on a variety of tasks using early stopping as the regularizer."}}

We focus on real-valued regularization and extend previous results on an asymptotic equivalence of random matrices to the real setting, providing a precise characterization of the equivalence even under negative regularization, including a precise characterization of the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the sketched matrix, which may be of independent interest. We then further characterize the second-order equivalence of the sketched pseudoinverse. We also apply our results to the analysis of the sketch-and-project method and to sketched ridge regression. Lastly, we prove that these results generalize to asymptotically free sketching matrices, obtaining the resulting equivalence for orthogonal sketching matrices and comparing our results to several common sketches used in practice."}}

Recent work has shown that for a variety of classification and signal reconstruction problems, the out-of-distribution performance is strongly linearly correlated with the in-distribution performance. If this relationship or more generally a monotonic one holds, it has important consequences. For example, it allows to optimize performance on one distribution as a proxy for performance on the other. In this paper, we study conditions under which a monotonic relationship between the performances of a model on two distributions is expected. We prove an exact asymptotic linear relation for squared error and a monotonic relation for misclassification error for ridge-regularized general linear models under covariate shift, as well as an approximate linear relation for linear inverse problems."}}

While ridge-regularized machine learning methods are widely used in many important applications, direct training via optimization could become challenging in huge data scenarios with millions of examples and features. We tackle such challenges by proposing a general approach that achieves ridge-like regularization through implicit techniques named Minipatch Ridge (MPRidge). Our approach is based on taking an ensemble of coefficients of unregularized learners trained on many tiny, random subsamples of both the examples and features of the training data, which we call minipatches. We empirically demonstrate that MPRidge induces an implicit ridge-like regularizing effect and performs nearly the same as explicit ridge regularization for a general class of predictors including logistic regression, SVM, and robust regression. Embarrassingly parallelizable, MPRidge provides a computationally appealing alternative to inducing ridge-like regularization for improving generalization performance in challenging big-data settings."}}

Techniques abound to reduce the dimensionality of fixed-length sequences, yet these methods rarely generalize to variable-length sequences. To address this gap, we extend existing methods that rely on the use of kernels to variable-length sequences via use of the Recurrent Neural Tangent Kernel (RNTK). Since a deep neural network with ReLu activation is a Max-Affine Spline Operator (MASO), we dub our approach Max-Affine Spline Kernel (MASK).
