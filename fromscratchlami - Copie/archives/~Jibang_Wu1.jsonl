Such a problem is modeled as a Stackelberg game between the principal and the agent, where the principal announces a scoring rule that specifies the payment, and then the agent then chooses an effort level that maximizes her own profit and reports the information. We study the online setting of such a problem from the principal's perspective, i.e., designing the optimal scoring rule by repeatedly interacting with the strategic agent. We design a provably sample efficient algorithm that tailors the UCB algorithm (Auer et al., 2002) to our model, which achieves a sublinear $T^{2/3}$-regret after $T$ iterations. Our algorithm features a delicate estimation procedure for the optimal profit of the principal, and a conservative correction scheme that ensures the desired agent's actions are incentivized. Furthermore, a key feature of our regret bound is that it is independent of the number of states of the environment."}}

Myerson pointed out an elegant solution that relies on the revelation principle, which states that without loss of generality optimal coordination mechanisms of this problem can be assumed to be truthful and direct. Consequently, the problem can be solved by a linear program when the support sets of the action and type spaces are finite. In this paper, we extend Myerson's results to the setting where the principal's action space might be infinite and subject to additional design constraints. This generalized principal-agent model unifies several important design problems -- including contract design, information design, and Bayesian Stackelberg games -- and encompasses them as special cases. We present a revelation principle for this general model, based on which a polynomial-time algorithm is derived for computing the optimal coordination mechanism. This algorithm not only implies new efficient algorithms simultaneously for all the aforementioned special cases but also significantly simplifies previous approaches in the literature."}}

Previous works on peer review calibration usually only use the ordinal information or assume simplistic reviewer scoring functions such as linear functions. In practice, applications like academic conferences often rely on manual methods, such as open discussions, to mitigate miscalibration. It remains an important question to develop algorithms that can   handle different types of miscalibrations based on available prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework, namely \\emph{least square calibration} (LSC), for selecting top candidates from peer ratings. Our framework provably performs perfect calibration from noiseless linear scoring functions under mild assumptions, yet also provides competitive calibration results when the scoring function is from broader classes beyond linear functions and with arbitrary noise. On our synthetic dataset, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms the baseline which select top papers based on the highest average ratings.\n"}}

Thus similar to standard bandit learning, a basic learning question in multi-agent systems is whether agents can learn to efficiently eliminate all dominated actions in an unknown game if they can only observe noisy bandit feedback about the payoff of their played actions. Surprisingly, despite a seemingly simple task, we show a quite negative result; that is, standard no regret algorithms -- including the entire family of Dual Averaging algorithms -- provably take exponentially many rounds to eliminate all dominated actions. Moreover, algorithms with the stronger no swap regret also suffer similar exponential inefficiency. To overcome these barriers, we develop a new algorithm that adjusts Exp3 with Diminishing Historical rewards (termed Exp3-DH); Exp3-DH gradually forgets history at carefully tailored rates. We prove that when all agents run Exp3-DH (a.k.a., self-play in multi-agent learning), all dominated actions can be iteratively eliminated within polynomially many rounds. Our experimental results further demonstrate the efficiency of Exp3-DH, and that state-of-the-art bandit algorithms, even those developed specifically for learning in games, fail to eliminate all dominated actions efficiently."}}

Modeling the dependence of the next action on the past actions accurately is crucial to this problem. Moreover, sequential recommendation often faces serious sparsity of item-to-item transitions in a user's action sequence, which limits the practical utility of such solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Category-aware Collaborative Sequential Recommender. Our preliminary statistical tests demonstrate that the in-category item-to-item transitions are often much stronger indicators of the next items than the general item-to-item transitions observed in the original sequence. Our method makes use of item category in two ways. First, the recommender utilizes item category to organize a user's own actions to enhance dependency modeling based on her own past actions. It utilizes self-attention to capture in-category transition patterns, and determines which of the in-category transition patterns to consider based on the categories of recent actions. Second, the recommender utilizes the item category to retrieve users with similar in-category preferences to enhance collaborative learning across users, and thus conquer sparsity. It utilizes attention to incorporate in-category transition patterns from the retrieved users for the target user. Extensive experiments on two large datasets prove the effectiveness of our solution against an extensive list of state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models."}}
