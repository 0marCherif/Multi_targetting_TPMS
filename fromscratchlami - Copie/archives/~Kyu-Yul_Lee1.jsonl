We propose a novel cloudy image synthesis model and develop a cloud removal algorithm using convolutional neural network. We extract the cloud masks from real cloudy satellite images and from real sky images with clouds. Then we investigate the characteristics of real cloudy images and devise a reliable cloudy image synthesis model which considers the background surface color, misalignement of channel images, and blur in clouds. We train a hierarchical cloud removal network using the synthetic cloudy images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm removes the clouds from cloudy satellite images faithfully and outperforms the existing methods."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel video stitching algorithm for such challenging multi-view videos. We estimate the parameters of ground plane homography, fundamental matrix, and vertical vanishing points reliably, using both of the appearance and activity-based feature matches validated by geometric constraints. We alleviate the parallax artifacts in stitching by adaptively warping the off-plane pixels into geometrically accurate matching positions through their ground plane pixels based on the epipolar geometry. We also exploit the inter-view and inter-frame correspondence matching information together to estimate the ground plane pixels reliably, which are then refined by energy minimization. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides geometrically accurate stitching results of multi-view videos with large parallax and outperforms the state-of-the-art stitching methods qualitatively and quantitatively."}}

When the captured 3D scene is not planar and the camera baseline is large, two images exhibit parallax where the relative positions of scene structures are quite different from each view. The existing image stitching methods often fail to work on the images with large parallax. In this paper, we propose an image stitching algorithm robust to large parallax based on the novel concept of warping residuals. We first estimate multiple homographies and find their inlier feature matches between two images. Then we evaluate warping residual for each feature match with respect to the multiple homographies. To alleviate the parallax artifacts, we partition input images into superpixels and warp each superpixel adaptively according to an optimal homography which is computed by minimizing the error of feature matches weighted by the warping residuals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for images with large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods qualitatively and quantitatively."}}
