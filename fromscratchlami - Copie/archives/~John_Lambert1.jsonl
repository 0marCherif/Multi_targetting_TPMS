Argoverse was collected by a fleet of autonomous vehicles in Pittsburgh and Miami. The Argoverse 3D Tracking dataset includes 360\u25e6 images from 7 cameras with overlapping fields of view, 3D point clouds from long range LiDAR, 6-DOF pose, and 3D\ntrack annotations. Notably, it is the only modern AV dataset that provides forward-facing stereo imagery. The Argoverse Motion Forecasting dataset includes more than 300,000 5 second tracked scenarios with a particular vehicle identified for trajectory forecasting. Argoverse is the first autonomous vehicle dataset to include \u201cHD maps\u201d with 290 km of mapped lanes with geometric and semantic metadata.\nAll data is released under a Creative Commons license at  www.argoverse.org. In our baseline experiments, we illustrate how detailed map information such as lane direction, driveable area, and ground height improves the accuracy of 3D object tracking and motion forecasting. Our tracking and forecasting experiments represent only an initial exploration of the use of rich maps in robotic perception. We hope that Argoverse will enable the research community to explore these problems in greater depth."}}

The annotated Sensor Dataset contains 1,000 sequences of multimodal data, encompassing high-resolution imagery from seven ring cameras, and two stereo cameras in addition to lidar point clouds, and 6-DOF map-aligned pose. Sequences contain 3D cuboid annotations for 26 object categories, all of which are sufficiently-sampled to support training and evaluation of 3D perception models. The Lidar Dataset contains 20,000 sequences of unlabeled lidar point clouds and map-aligned pose. This dataset is the largest ever collection of lidar sensor data and supports self-supervised learning and the emerging task of point cloud forecasting. Finally, the Motion Forecasting Dataset contains 250,000 scenarios mined for interesting and challenging interactions be- tween the autonomous vehicle and other actors in each local scene. Models are tasked with the prediction of future motion for \u201cscored actors\" in each scenario and are provided with track histories that capture object location, heading, velocity, and category. In all three datasets, each scenario contains its own HD Map with 3D lane and crosswalk geometry \u2014 sourced from data captured in six distinct cities. We believe these datasets will support new and existing machine learning research problems in ways that existing datasets do not. All datasets are released under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license."}}

We collect the first dataset for the task, which we entitle the Trust, but Verify (TbV) dataset, by mining thousands of hours of data from over 9 months of autonomous vehicle fleet operations. We present learning-based formulations for solving the problem in the bird's eye view and ego-view. Because real map changes are infrequent and vector maps are easy to synthetically manipulate, we lean on simulated data to train our model. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that such models can generalize to real world distributions. The dataset consists of maps and logs collected in six North American cities, is one of the largest AV datasets to date with more than 7.9 million images. We make the data available to the public, along with code and models under the the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license."}}

In baseline experiments, we use map information such as lane direction, driveable area, and ground height to improve the accuracy of 3D object tracking. We use 3D object tracking to mine for more than 300k interesting vehicle trajectories to create a trajectory forecasting benchmark. Motion forecasting experiments ranging in complexity from classical methods (k-NN) to LSTMs demonstrate that using detailed vector maps with lane-level information substantially reduces prediction error. Our tracking and forecasting experiments represent only a superficial exploration of the potential of rich maps in robotic perception. We hope that Argoverse will enable the research community to explore these problems in greater depth."}}

The role of a teacher is not simply to hammer home right or wrong answers, but rather to provide intuitive comments, comparisons, and explanations to a pupil. This is what the Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm endeavors to model by utilizing extra knowledge only available during training. We propose a new LUPI algorithm specifically designed for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We propose to use a heteroscedastic dropout (ie. dropout with a varying variance) and make the variance of the dropout a function of privileged information. Intuitively, this corresponds to using the privileged information to control the uncertainty of the model output. We perform experiments using CNNs and RNNs for the tasks of image classification and machine translation. Our method significantly increases the sample efficiency during learning, resulting in higher accuracy with a large margin when the number of training examples is limited. We also theoretically justify the gains in sample efficiency by providing a generalization error bound decreasing with O(1/n), where n is the number of training examples, in an oracle case."}}
