An interesting phenomenon has been observed in the training process: the loss of poisoned samples tends to drop significantly faster than that of clean samples, which we call the early-fitting phenomenon. Early-fitting provides a simple but effective method to defend against backdoor attacks, as the poisoned samples can be identified by picking the samples with the lowest loss values in the early training epochs. Therefore, two natural questions arise: (1) What characteristics of poisoned samples cause early-fitting? (2) Is it possible to design stronger attacks to circumvent existing defense methods? To answer the first question, we find that early-fitting could be attributed to a unique property of poisoned samples called synchronization, which depicts the latent similarity between two samples. Meanwhile, the degree of synchronization could be explicitly controlled based on whether it is captured by shallow or deep layers of the model. Then, we give an affirmative answer to the second question by proposing a new backdoor attack method, Deep Backdoor Attack (DBA), which utilizes deep synchronization to reversely generate trigger patterns by activating neurons in the deep layer. Experimental results validate our propositions and the effectiveness of DBA. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Deep-Backdoor-Attack-8875"}}

However, the black-box nature of GNNs prevents users from understanding and trusting the models, thus hampering their applicability. Whereas explaining GNNs remains a challenge, most existing methods fall into approximation based and perturbation based approaches with suffer from faithfulness problems and unnatural artifacts respectively. To tackle these problems, we propose DEGREE (Decomposition based Explanation for GRaph nEural nEtworks) to provide a faithful explanation for GNN predictions. By decomposing the information generation and aggregation mechanism of GNNs, DEGREE allows tracking the contributions of specific components of the input graph to the final prediction. Based on this, we further design a subgraph level interpretation algorithm to reveal complex interactions between graph nodes that are overlooked by previous methods. The efficiency of our algorithm can be further improved by utilizing GNN characteristics. Finally, we conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of DEGREE on node classification and graph classification tasks."}}

Feature Sharing for Robust and Transferable Watermarks", "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly being deployed in cloud-based services via various APIs, e.g., prediction APIs. Recent studies show that these public APIs are vulnerable to the model extraction attack, where an adversary attempts to train a local copy of the private model using predictions returned by the API. Existing defenses mainly focus on perturbing prediction distribution to undermine the training objective of the attacker and thus inevitably impact the API utility. In this work, we extend the concept of watermarking to protect APIs. The main idea is to insert a watermark which is only known to defender into the protected model and the watermark will then be transferred into all stolen models. The defender can leverage the knowledge of watermarks to detect and certify stolen models. However, the effectiveness of the watermark remains limited since watermarks are distinct from the task data, and the adversary in extraction attacks only adopts inputs sampled from the task distribution. Hence the watermark tends to be discarded during the extraction attack. To bridge the gap, we propose a feature-sharing framework to improve the transferability of watermarks. For legitimate data and watermarks, we encourage the model to only show the difference in final decision layers and use the same features for all other layers. Comprehensive experiments on text and image domains indicate that the proposed framework is effective in terms of API watermarking while keeping the utility of the API. Besides, experimental analysis also validates the robustness of the watermark against various watermark removal attacks."}}

To this end, we propose a new mitigation technique, namely, Representation Neutralization for Fairness (RNF) that achieves fairness by debiasing only the task-specific classification head of DNN models. To this end, we leverage samples with the same ground-truth label but different sensitive attributes, and use their neutralized representations to train the classification head of the DNN model. The key idea of RNF is to discourage the classification head from capturing spurious correlation between fairness sensitive information in encoder representations with specific class labels.

To obtain satisfying explainability, many methods introduce ad hoc constraints into the classification loss to regularize these relevance scores. However, the large information gap between the classification loss and these constraints increases the difficulty of tuning hyper-parameters. To bridge this gap, in this paper we present a simple but effective mask predictor. Specifically, we model the above constraints with a distribution controller, and integrate it with a neural network to directly guide the distribution of relevance scores. The benefit of this strategy is to facilitate the setting of involved hyper-parameters, and enable discriminative scores over supporting features. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms others in terms of faithfulness and explainability. Meanwhile, it also provides effective saliency maps for explaining each decision.

However, these models are often regarded as black-boxes and are criticized due to the lack of interpretability. In this paper, we enhance the interpretability of RNNs by providing interpretable rationales for RNN predictions. Nevertheless, interpreting RNNs is a challenging problem. Firstly, unlike existing methods that rely on local approximation, we aim to provide rationales that are more faithful to the decision making process of RNN models. Secondly, a flexible interpretation method should be able to assign contribution scores to text segments of varying lengths, instead of only to individual words. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel attribution method, called REAT, to provide interpretations to RNN predictions. REAT decomposes the final prediction of a RNN into additive contribution of each word in the input text. This additive decomposition enables REAT to further obtain phrase-level attribution scores. In addition, REAT is generally applicable to various RNN architectures, including GRU, LSTM and their bidirectional versions. Experimental results demonstrate the faithfulness and interpretability of the proposed attribution method. Comprehensive analysis shows that our attribution method could unveil the useful linguistic knowledge captured by RNNs. Some analysis further demonstrates our method could be utilized as a debugging tool to examine the vulnerability and failure reasons of RNNs, which may lead to several promising future directions to promote generalization ability of RNNs."}}

Existing attempts based on local interpretations aim to identify relevant features contributing the most to the prediction of DNN by monitoring the neighborhood of a given input. They usually simply ignore the intermediate layers of the DNN that might contain rich information for interpretation. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose to investigate a guided feature inversion framework for taking advantage of the deep architectures towards effective interpretation. The proposed framework not only determines the contribution of each feature in the input but also provides insights into the decision-making process of DNN models. By further interacting with the neuron of the target category at the output layer of the DNN, we enforce the interpretation result to be class-discriminative. We apply the proposed interpretation model to different CNN architectures to provide explanations for image data and conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and PASCAL VOC07 datasets. The interpretation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in providing class-discriminative interpretation for DNN-based prediction."}}
