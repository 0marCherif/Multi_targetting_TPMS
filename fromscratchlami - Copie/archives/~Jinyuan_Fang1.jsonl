In this paper, we propose a novel structure-aware random Fourier (SRF) kernel for GPs that brings several benefits when modeling graph-structured data. First, SRF kernel is defined with a spectral distribution based on the Fourier duality given by the Bochner's theorem, transforming the kernel learning problem to a distribution inference problem. Second, SRF kernel admits a random Fourier feature formulation that makes the kernel scalable for optimization. Third, SRF kernel enables to leverage geometric structures by taking subgraphs as inputs. To effectively optimize GPs with SRF kernel, we develop a variational EM algorithm, which alternates between an inference procedure (E-step) and a learning procedure (M-step). Experimental results on five real-world datasets show that our model can achieve state-of-the-art performance in two typical graph learning tasks, i.e., object classification and link prediction. "}}

In contrast, this paper focuses on a more complex online setting, where tasks arrive sequentially and follow a non-stationary distribution. Accordingly, we propose a Variational Continual Bayesian Meta-Learning (VC-BML) algorithm. VC-BML maintains a Dynamic Gaussian Mixture Model for meta-parameters, with the number of component distributions determined by a Chinese Restaurant Process. Dynamic mixtures at the meta-parameter level increase the capability to adapt to diverse tasks due to a larger parameter space, alleviating the negative knowledge transfer problem. To infer posteriors of model parameters, compared to the previously used point estimation method, we develop a more robust posterior approximation method -- structured variational inference for the sake of avoiding forgetting knowledge. Experiments on tasks from non-stationary distributions show that VC-BML is superior in transferring knowledge among diverse tasks and alleviating catastrophic forgetting in an online setting.\n\n"}}

Semi-supervised variational auto-encoders (SVAE) as a classical DGM offers a principled framework to effective generalize from small labelled data to large unlabelled ones, but it is difficult to incorporate rich unstructured relationships within the multiple heterogeneous entities. In this paper, to deal with the problem, we present a semi-supervised co-embedding model for attributed networks (SCAN) based on the generalized SVAE for the heterogeneous data, which collaboratively learns low- dimensional vector representations of both nodes and attributes for partially labelled attributed networks semi-supervisedly. The node and attribute embeddings obtained in a unified manner by our SCAN can benefit not only for capturing the proximities between nodes but also the affinities between nodes and attributes. Moreover, our model also trains a discriminative network to learn the label predictive distribution of nodes. Experimental results on real-world networks demonstrate that our model yields excellent performance in a number of applications such as attribute inference, user profiling and node classification compared to the state-of-the-art baselines."}}
