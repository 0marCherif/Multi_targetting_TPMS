The method is applicable to a broad range of objects, including challenging ones with global or partial symmetries. An object is represented by compact surface fragments which allow handling symmetries in a systematic manner. Correspondences between densely sampled pixels and the fragments are predicted using an encoder-decoder network. At each pixel, the network predicts: (i) the probability of each object's presence, (ii) the probability of the fragments given the object's presence, and (iii) the precise 3D location on each fragment. A data-dependent number of corresponding 3D locations is selected per pixel, and poses of possibly multiple object instances are estimated using a robust and efficient variant of the PnP-RANSAC algorithm. In the BOP Challenge 2019, the method outperforms all RGB and most RGB-D and D methods on the T-LESS and LM-O datasets. On the YCB-V dataset, it is superior to all competitors, with a large margin over the second-best RGB method."}}

Recently, learning-based feature extractors on top of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we further explore the usage of CNN and present a new approach that ensembles randomly initialized CNNs without any training. Our observation is that the CNN architecture inherently extracts features with certain extents of robustness to viewpoint/illumination changes and thus, it can be regarded as visual descriptors. Consequently, randomized CNNs serve as descriptor extractors and a subsequent consensus mechanism detects keypoints using them. Such description and detection pipeline can be used to match keypoints in images and achieves higher generalization ability than the state-of-the-art methods in our experiments. "}}

Instead of estimating the noise sigma, it is marginalized over a range of noise scales. The optimized model is obtained by weighted least-squares fitting where the weights come from the marginalization over sigma of the point likelihoods of being inliers. A new quality function is proposed not requiring sigma and, thus, a set of inliers to determine the model quality. Also, a new termination criterion for RANSAC is built on the proposed marginalization approach. Applying sigma-consensus, MAGSAC is proposed with no need for a user-defined sigma and improving the accuracy of robust estimation significantly. It is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of geometric accuracy on publicly available real-world datasets for epipolar geometry (F and E) and homography estimation. In addition, applying sigma-consensus only once as a post-processing step to the RANSAC output always improved the model quality on a wide range of vision problems without noticeable deterioration in processing time, adding a few milliseconds."}}
{"id": "rJZ0BA-uWS", "cdate": 1514764800000, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Graph-Cut RANSAC", "abstract": "A novel method for robust estimation, called Graph-Cut RANSAC, GC-RANSAC in short, is introduced. To separate inliers and outliers, it runs the graph-cut algorithm in the local optimization (LO) step which is applied when a so-far-the-best model is found. The proposed LO step is conceptually simple, easy to implement, globally optimal and efficient. GC-RANSAC is shown experimentally, both on synthesized tests and real image pairs, to be more geometrically accurate than state-of-the-art methods on a range of problems, e.g. line fitting, homography, affine transformation, fundamental and essential matrix estimation. It runs in real-time for many problems at a speed approximately equal to that of the less accurate alternatives (in milliseconds on standard CPU)."}}

The proposed minimal solver first estimates a homography from three correspondences assuming that they are co-planar and exploiting their rotational components. Then the fundamental matrix is obtained from the homography and two additional point pairs in general position. The proposed approach, combined with robust estimators like Graph-Cut RANSAC, is superior to other state-of-the-art algorithms both in terms of accuracy and number of iterations required. This is validated on synthesized data and 561 real image pairs. Moreover, the tests show that requiring three points on a plane is not too restrictive in urban environment and locally optimized robust estimators lead to accurate estimates even if the points are not entirely co-planar. As a potential application, we show that using the proposed method makes two-view multi-motion estimation more accurate."}}

We extend the commonly used $$\\alpha $$ -expansion-based technique with a new move in the label space. The move replaces a set of labels with the corresponding density mode in the model parameter domain, thus achieving fast and robust optimization. Key optimization parameters like the bandwidth of the mode seeking are set automatically within the algorithm. Considering that a group of outliers may form spatially coherent structures in the data, we propose a cross-validation-based technique removing statistically insignificant instances. Multi-X outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art on publicly available datasets for diverse problems: multiple plane and rigid motion detection; motion segmentation; simultaneous plane and cylinder fitting; circle and line fitting."}}

To the best of our knowledge, this problem is unsolved. The proposed approach extends point correspondence-based techniques with linear constraints derived from local affine transformations. The obtained multivariate polynomial system is efficiently solved by the hidden-variable technique. Observing the geometry of local affinities, we introduce novel conditions eliminating invalid roots. To select the best one out of the remaining candidates, a root selection technique is proposed outperforming the recent ones especially in case of high-level noise. The proposed 2-point algorithm is validated on both synthetic data and 104 publicly available real image pairs. A Matlab implementation of the proposed solution is included in the paper."}}
