We argue that a key desideratum of an explanation method is its robustness to input hyperparameters which are often randomly set or empirically tuned. High sensitivity to arbitrary hyperparameter choices does not only impede reproducibility but also questions the correctness of an explanation and impairs the trust of end-users. In this paper, we provide a thorough empirical study on the sensitivity of existing attribution methods. We found an alarming trend that many methods are highly sensitive to changes in their common hyperparameters e.g. even changing a random seed can yield a different explanation! Interestingly, such sensitivity is not reflected in the average explanation accuracy scores over the dataset as commonly reported in the literature. In addition, explanations generated for robust classifiers (i.e. which are trained to be invariant to pixel-wise perturbations) are surprisingly more robust than those generated for regular classifiers"}}

However, these representations are highly entangled and complex to interpret by machine learning developers and practitioners. Recent works have shown visualizations of image regions that VLMs focus on but fail to describe the change in explanations generated for visual-language classifiers in zero-shot (using image and text representations) vs. fine-tuned settings (using image representations). In this work, we perform the first empirical study to establish the trustworthy properties of explanations generated for VLMs used in zero-shot vs. fine-tune settings. We show that explanations for zero-shot visual-language classifiers are more faithful than their fine-tuned counterpart. Further, we demonstrate that VLMs tend to attribute high importance to gender, despite being non-indicative of the downstream task. Our experiments on multiple real-world datasets show interesting VLM behavior in zero-shot vs. fine-tuned settings, opening up new frontiers in understanding the trustworthiness of large-scale visual-language models."}}

To this end, several algorithms have been proposed in recent literature to generate recourses. Recent research has also demonstrated that the recourses generated by these algorithms often correspond to adversarial examples. This key finding emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of the impact of adversarially robust models (which are designed to guard against adversarial examples) on algorithmic recourse. In this work, we make one of the first attempts at studying the impact of adversarially robust models on algorithmic recourse. We theoretically and empirically analyze the cost (ease of implementation) and validity (probability of obtaining a positive model prediction) of the recourses output by state-of-the-art algorithms when the underlying models are adversarially robust. More specifically, we construct theoretical bounds on the differences between the cost and the validity of the recourses generated by various state-of-the-art algorithms when the underlying models are adversarially robust vs. non-robust. We also carry out extensive empirical analysis with multiple real-world datasets to not only validate our theoretical results, but also analyze the impact of varying degrees of model robustness on the cost and validity of the resulting recourses. Our theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that adversarially robust models significantly increase the cost and reduce the validity of the resulting recourses, thereby shedding light on the inherent trade-offs between achieving adversarial robustness in predictive models and providing easy-to-implement and reliable algorithmic recourse."}}

In this work, we propose HASTE (HArd Subset TransfErability), a new strategy to estimate the transferability of a source model to a particular target task using only a harder subset of target data. By leveraging the model\u2019s internal and output representations, we introduce two techniques \u2013 one class-agnostic and another class-specific \u2013 to identify harder subsets and show that HASTE can be used with any existing transferability metric to improve their reliability. We further analyze the relation between HASTE and the optimal average log-likelihood as well as negative conditional entropy and empirically validate our theoretical bounds. Our experimental results across multiple source model architectures, target datasets, and transfer learning tasks show that HASTE-modified metrics are consistently better or on par with the state-of-the-art transferability metrics."}}

However, existing methods for graph unlearning either deteriorate model weights shared across all nodes or fail to effectively delete edges due to their strong dependence on local graph neighborhoods. To address these limitations, we introduce GNNDelete, a novel model-agnostic layer-wise operator that optimizes two critical properties, namely, Deleted Edge Consistency and Neighborhood Influence, for graph unlearning. Deleted Edge Consistency ensures that the influence of deleted elements is removed from both model weights and neighboring representations, while Neighborhood Influence guarantees that the remaining model knowledge is preserved after deletion. GNNDelete updates representations to delete nodes and edges from the model while retaining the rest of the learned knowledge. We conduct experiments on seven real-world graphs, showing that GNNDelete outperforms existing approaches by up to 38.8% (AUC) on edge, node, and node feature deletion tasks, and 32.2% on distinguishing deleted edges from non-deleted ones. Additionally, GNNDelete is efficient, taking 12.3x less time and 9.3x less space than retraining GNN from scratch on WordNet18."}}

However, there has been no work in generating explanations on the fly during model training and utilizing them to improve the expressive power of the underlying GNN models. In this work, we introduce a novel explanation-directed neural message passing framework for GNNs, EXPASS (EXplainable message PASSing), which aggregates only embeddings from nodes and edges identified as important by a GNN explanation method. EXPASS can be used with any existing GNN architecture and subgraph-optimizing explainer to learn accurate graph embeddings. We theoretically show that EXPASS alleviates the oversmoothing problem in GNNs by slowing the layer-wise loss of Dirichlet energy and that the embedding difference between the vanilla message passing and EXPASS framework can be upper bounded by the difference of their respective model weights. Our empirical results show that graph embeddings learned using EXPASS improve the predictive performance and alleviate the oversmoothing problems of GNNs, opening up new frontiers in graph machine learning to develop explanation-based training frameworks."}}

Here, we introduce OpenXAI, a comprehensive and extensible open-source framework for evaluating and benchmarking post hoc explanation methods. OpenXAI comprises of the following key components: (i) a flexible synthetic data generator and a collection of diverse real-world datasets, pre-trained models, and state-of-the-art feature attribution methods, (ii) open-source implementations of twenty-two quantitative metrics for evaluating faithfulness, stability (robustness), and fairness of explanation methods, and (iii) the first ever public XAI leaderboards to readily compare several explanation methods across a wide variety of metrics, models, and datasets. OpenXAI is easily extensible, as users can readily evaluate custom explanation methods and incorporate them into our leaderboards. \nOverall, OpenXAI provides an automated end-to-end pipeline that not only simplifies and standardizes the evaluation of post hoc explanation methods, but also promotes transparency and reproducibility in benchmarking these methods. While the first release of OpenXAI supports only tabular datasets, the explanation methods and metrics that we consider are general enough to be applicable to other data modalities. OpenXAI datasets and data loaders, implementations of state-of-the-art explanation methods and evaluation metrics, as well as leaderboards are publicly available at https://open-xai.github.io/. OpenXAI will be regularly updated to incorporate text and image datasets, other new metrics and explanation methods, and welcomes inputs from the community."}}
