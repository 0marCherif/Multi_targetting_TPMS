However, almost all existing works have to face large communication burdens and the risk of disruption if the central server fails. Only limited efforts have been used in a decentralized way but still suffers from inferior representation ability due to sharing the full model with its neighbors. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a personalized FL framework with a decentralized partial model training called DFedAlt. It personalizes the \"right\" components in the modern deep models by alternately updating the shared and personal parameters to train partially personalized models in a peer-to-peer manner. To further promote the shared parameters aggregation process, we propose DFedSalt integrating the local Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer to update the shared parameters. It adds proper perturbation in the direction of the gradient to overcome the shared model inconsistency across clients. Theoretically, we provide convergence analysis of both algorithms in the general non-convex setting for decentralized partial model training in PFL. Our experiments on several real-world data with various data partition settings demonstrate that (i) decentralized training is more suitable for partial personalization, which results in state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy compared with the SOTA PFL baselines; (ii) the shared parameters with proper perturbation make partial personalized FL more suitable for decentralized training, where DFedSalt achieves most competitive performance."}}

However, existing DPFL methods tend to make a sharp loss landscape and have poor weight perturbation robustness, resulting in severe performance degradation. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel DPFL algorithm named DP-FedSAM, which leverages gradient perturbation to mitigate the negative impact of DP. Specifically, DP-FedSAM integrates Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer to generate local flatness models with improved stability and weight perturbation robustness, which results in the small norm of local updates and robustness to DP noise, thereby improving the performance. To further reduce the magnitude of random noise while achieving better performance, we propose DP-FedSAM-$top_k$ by adopting the local update sparsification technique. From the theoretical perspective, we present the convergence analysis to investigate how our algorithms mitigate the performance degradation induced by DP. Meanwhile, we give rigorous privacy guarantees with R\\'enyi DP, the sensitivity analysis of local updates, and generalization analysis. At last, we empirically confirm that our algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared with existing SOTA baselines in DPFL."}}
