Although these models achieve state-of-the-art performance for many language related tasks, their applicability outside of the neural language processing field has been minimal. In this work, we propose the use of transformer models for the prediction of dynamical systems representative of physical phenomena. The use of Koopman based embeddings provide a unique and powerful method for projecting any dynamical system into a vector representation which can then be predicted by a transformer model. The proposed model is able to accurately predict various dynamical systems and outperform classical methods that are commonly used in the scientific machine learning literature."}}
