Herein, we present an SEIR model with a spatial spread component as well as four infectious compartments to account for the variety of symptom levels and transmission rate. The model takes into account the pattern of spatial vulnerability in South Africa through a vulnerability index that is based on socioeconomic and health susceptibility characteristics. Another spatially relevant factor in this context is level of mobility throughout. The thesis of this study is that without the contextual spatial spread modelling, the heterogeneity in COVID-19 prevalence in the South African setting would not be captured. The model is illustrated on South African COVID-19 case counts and hospitalisations."}}

Reduced mobility was essential due to it being the largest impact possible against the spread of the little understood SARS-CoV-2 virus. To understand the spread, a comprehension of human mobility patterns is needed. The use of mobility data in modelling is thus essential to capture the intrinsic spread through the population. It is necessary to determine to what extent mobility data sources convey the same message of mobility within a region. This paper compares different mobility data sources by constructing spatial weight matrices at a variety of spatial resolutions and further compares the results through hierarchical clustering. We consider four methods for constructing spatial weight matrices representing mobility between spatial units, taking into account distance between spatial units as well as spatial covariates. This provides insight for the user into which data provides what type of information and in what situations a particular data source is most useful."}}

The power of the operators is demonstrated by deriving the discrete pulse transform (DPT), which is a hierarchical decomposition of the input array into pulses. Similar to its 1-D counterpart this transform satisfies a basic consistency property."}}

This transform generalizes the DPT of sequences and replicates its essential properties, e.g. total variation preservation. Furthermore, the discrete pulses in the transform capture the contrast in the original image on the boundary of their supports. Since images are perceived via the contrast between neighbour pixels, the DPT may be a convenient new tool for image analysis."}}
