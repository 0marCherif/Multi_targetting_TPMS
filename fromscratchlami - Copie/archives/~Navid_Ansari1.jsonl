The most important property of a successful neural inverse method is the performance of its solutions when deployed in the real world, i.e., on the native forward process (and not only the learned surrogate). We propose Autoinverse, a highly automated approach for inverting neural network surrogates. Our main insight is to seek inverse solutions in the vicinity of reliable data which have been sampled form the forward process and used for training the surrogate model. Autoinverse finds such solutions by taking into account the predictive uncertainty of the surrogate and minimizing it during the inversion. Apart from high accuracy, Autoinverse enforces the feasibility of solutions, comes with embedded regularization, and is initialization free. We verify our proposed method through addressing a set of real-world problems in control, fabrication, and design."}}

A long-standing, intertwined question is that of inverse design: how to compute a design that satisfies a desired target performance? Here, we show that the piecewise linear property, very common in everyday neural networks, allows for an inverse design formulation based on mixed-integer linear programming. Our mixed-integer inverse design uncovers globally optimal or near optimal solutions in a principled manner. Furthermore, our method significantly facilitates emerging, but challenging, combinatorial inverse design tasks, such as material selection. For problems where finding the optimal solution is not desirable or tractable, we develop an efficient yet near-optimal hybrid optimization. Eventually, our method is able to find solutions provably robust to possible fabrication perturbations among multiple designs with similar performances."}}

The ink selection algorithm takes a spectral image and a set of inks as input, and selects a subset of those inks that results in optimal spectral reproduction. We put forward an optimization formulation that searches a huge combinatorial space based on mixed integer programming. We show that solving this optimization in the conventional reflectance space is intractable. The main insight of this work is to solve our problem in the spectral absorbance space with a linearized formulation. The proposed ink selection copes with large-size problems for which previous methods are hopeless. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a concrete setting by lifelike reproduction of handmade paintings. For a successful spectral reproduction of high-resolution paintings, we explore their spectral absorbance estimation, efficient coreset representation, and accurate data-driven reproduction."}}
