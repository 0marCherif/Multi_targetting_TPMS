The dataset is collected using programmable hardware in which an event camera consistently moves around a monitor displaying images from ImageNet. N-ImageNet serves as a challenging benchmark for event-based object recognition, due to its large number of classes and samples. We empirically show that pretraining on N-ImageNet improves the performance of event-based classifiers and helps them learn with few labeled data. In addition, we present several variants of N-ImageNet to test the robustness of event-based classifiers under diverse camera trajectories and severe lighting conditions, and propose a novel event representation to alleviate the performance degradation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to quantitatively investigate the consequences caused by various environmental conditions on event-based object recognition algorithms. N-ImageNet and its variants are expected to guide practical implementations for deploying event-based object recognition algorithms in the real world."}}

The raw 3D reconstruction of an indoor environment suffers from occlusions, noise, and is produced without any meaningful distinction between individual entities. For high-level intelligent tasks from a large scale scene, 3D instance segmentation recognizes individual instances of objects. We approach the instance segmentation by simply learning the correct embedding space that maps individual instances of objects into distinct clusters that reflect both spatial and semantic information. Unlike previous approaches that require complex pre-processing or post-processing, our implementation is compact and fast with competitive performance, maintaining scalability on large scenes with high resolution voxels. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our algorithm in the ScanNet 3D instance segmentation benchmark on AP score."}}

However, if our goal is to develop an algorithm that learns as humans do, this setting is far from realistic, and it is essential to develop a methodology that works in a task-free manner. Meanwhile, among several branches of continual learning, expansion-based methods have the advantage of eliminating catastrophic forgetting by allocating new resources to learn new data. In this work, we propose an expansion-based approach for task-free continual learning. Our model, named Continual Neural Dirichlet Process Mixture (CN-DPM), consists of a set of neural network experts that are in charge of a subset of the data. CN-DPM expands the number of experts in a principled way under the Bayesian nonparametric framework. With extensive experiments, we show that our model successfully performs task-free continual learning for both discriminative and generative tasks such as image classification and image generation."}}
