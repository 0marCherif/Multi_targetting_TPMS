In the case of multivariate time series prediction, the outcome is also determined by patterns of different frequencies. These encapsulate both long-term and short-term effects, which have so far not been sufficiently leveraged by deep learning time series models. We fill this gap by introducing a framework, called MultiWave, which augments any deep learning time series model with components operating at the intrinsic frequencies of the signals. MultiWave applies wavelet decomposition on each signal to obtain subsignals of different frequencies and groups all subsignals in the same frequency band together to train a component. The output of the components is combined through a gating mechanism that removes irrelevant frequencies for the given predictive task. We show that MultiWave accurately determines the informative frequency bands and that the augmented models including components trained to operate on those bands outperform the original models. We further show that applying MultiWave on top of different deep learning models improves their performance in several real-world applications."}}

It is difficult to jointly model these two sources of information because clinical notes, unlike vital signals, are collected at irregular intervals and their contents are relatively unstructured. In this paper, we present a model that combines both sources of information about ICU patients to make accurate in-hospital mortality predictions.\nWe apply a fine-tuned BERT model to each of the patient's clinical notes. The resulting embeddings are then combined to obtain the overall embedding for the entire text part of the data. This is then combined with the output of an LSTM model that encodes patients' vital signals.\nOur model improves upon the state of the art for mortality prediction, attaining an AUC score of 0.9, compared to the previous $0.87$, setting a new standard for mortality prediction on the MIMIC III benchmark."}}

Kinases are the enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of other proteins in a target-specific manner. The dysregulation of phosphorylation is associated with many diseases including cancer. Although the advances in phosphoproteomics enable the identification of phosphosites at the proteome level, most of the phosphoproteome is still in the dark: more than 95% of the reported human phosphosites have no known kinases. Determining which kinase is responsible for phosphorylating a site remains an experimental challenge. Existing computational methods require several examples of known targets of a kinase to make accurate kinase-specific predictions, yet for a large body of kinases, only a few or no target sites are reported."}}

In this paper, we present a general platform for personalized predictive modeling of behavioural states like students' level of stress. Through the use of Auto-encoders and Multitask learning we extend the prediction of stress to both sequences of passive sensor data and high-level covariates. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in the prediction of stress level from mobile sensor data, obtaining a 45.6 % improvement in F1 score on the StudentLife dataset."}}

These challenges are especially prevalent in the healthcare domain, where patients' vital signs and electronic records are collected at different frequencies and have occasionally missing information due to the imperfections in equipment or patient circumstances. Researchers have handled each of these issues differently, often handling missing data through mean value imputation and then using sequence models over the multivariate signals while ignoring the different resolution of signals. We propose a unified model named Multi-resolution Flexible Irregular Time series Network (Multi-FIT). The building block for Multi-FIT is the FIT network. The FIT network creates an informative dense representation at each time step using signal information such as last observed value, time difference since the last observed time stamp and overall mean for the signal. Vertical FIT (FIT-V) is a variant of FIT which also models the relationship between different temporal signals while creating the informative dense representations for the signal. The multi-FIT model uses multiple FIT networks for sets of signals with different resolutions, further facilitating the construction of flexible representations. Our model has three main contributions: a.) it does not impute values but rather creates informative representations to provide flexibility to the model for creating task-specific representations b.) it models the relationship between different signals in the form of support signals c.) it models different resolutions in parallel before merging them for the final prediction task. The FIT, FIT-V and Multi-FIT networks improve upon the state-of-the-art models for three predictive tasks, including the forecasting of patient survival."}}

However, using special characteristics of genomic data, background knowledge that can be obtained from the Web, and family relationship between the individuals, it is possible to infer the hidden parts of shared (and unshared) genomes. Existing work in this field considers simple correlations in the genome (as well as Mendel's law and partial genomes of a victim and his family members). In this paper, we improve the existing work on inference attacks on genomic privacy. We mainly consider complex correlations in the genome by using an observable Markov model and recombination model between the haplotypes. We also utilize the phenotype information about the victims. We propose an efficient message passing algorithm to consider all aforementioned background information for the inference. We show that the proposed framework improves inference with significantly less information compared to existing work."}}
