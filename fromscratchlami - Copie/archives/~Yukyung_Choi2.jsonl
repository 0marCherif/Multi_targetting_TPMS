However, very few studies on adopting transformers in self-supervised depth estimation have been conducted. When replacing the CNN architecture with the transformer in self-supervised learning of depth, we encounter several problems such as problematic multi-scale photometric loss function when used with transformers and, insufficient ability to capture local details. In this letter, we propose an attention-based decoder module, Pixel-Wise Skip Attention (PWSA), to enhance fine details in feature maps while keeping global context from transformers. In addition, we propose utilizing self-distillation loss with single-scale photometric loss to alleviate the instability of transformer training by using correct training signals. We demonstrate that the proposed model performs accurate predictions on large objects and thin structures that require global context and local details. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance among the self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods on KITTI and DDAD benchmarks."}}

For realizing such a system, it is a critical issue of how the robot imitates human motions with natural and exact. So, we suggested a new method that human arm motion is captured with a stereo vision system and transferred to the robotic avatar in real-time. For capturing 3D arm motions based on the markerless method, we proposed a new metaball-based method that was designed in order to have some robust and efficient properties: a modified iso-surface equation of metaball for overcoming local minima and a downsizing method of 3D point cloud for improving time complexity. With our meeting system, we have implemented our new algorithm and run at approximately 12\u201316 Hz. Also, its accuracy in motion capturing could be acceptable for robot motion generation."}}

Many systems encourage users to search paintings by prior knowledge on paintings. We discover the limitation for existing methods on how well the query is represented by the user, and propose a simple, yet effective way to search the painting by exploiting the color to express human visual memory. To achieve our goal, we suggest color clustering based on human color perception, and hierarchical metric learning to accommodate the locality of colors. With user-interactive drawing through learned colors, the user completes the abstract image to resemble the visual memory. We show that our system is easy to use, fast to process, accurate to search and fully extensible to cover deviation among users."}}

In the past decade, Many efforts have been made to solve these problems, however, most of the already existing methods are designed for visible light cameras, which are inherently inefficient under low light conditions. In this paper, we present a drivable region detection algorithm designed for thermal-infrared cameras in order to overcome the aforementioned problems. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the utilization of on-line road initialization with a highly scene-adaptive sampling mask. Furthermore, our prior road information extraction is tailored to enforce temporal consistency among a series of images. In this paper, we also propose a large number of experiments in various scenarios (on-road, off-road and cluttered road). A total of about 6000 manually annotated images are made available in our website for the research community. Using this dataset, we compared our method against multiple state-of-the-art approaches including convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods to emphasize the robustness of our approach under challenging situations."}}

Building a vocabulary tree is carried out offline, because the clustering of a large amount of training data takes a long time. Recently proposed adaptive vocabulary trees do not require offline training, but suffer from the burden of online computation. The necessity for clustering high dimensional large data has arisen in offline and online training. In this paper, we present a novel clustering method to reduce the burden of computation without losing accuracy. Feature selection is used to reduce the computational complexity with high dimensional data, and an ensemble learning model is used to improve the efficiency with a large number of data. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the-state of the art approaches in terms of computational complexity on various synthetic and real datasets."}}

In this context, we present a robust binary feature using the intensity order. By analyzing feature regions, we devise a simple but effective strategy to detect keypoints. We adopt an ordinal description and encode the intensity order into a binary descriptor with proper binarization. As a result, our method obtains high repeatability and shows better performance with regard to feature matching with much less storage usage than other conventional features. We evaluate the performance of the proposed binary feature with various experiments, demonstrate its efficiency in terms of storage and computation time, and show its robustness under various geometric and photometric transformations."}}

This need has caused the approaches using multimodal sensors, which could be complementary to each other. The choice for the thermal camera provides a rich source of temperature information, less affected by changing illumination or background clutters. However, existing thermal cameras have a relatively smaller resolution than RGB cameras that has trouble for fully utilizing the information in recognition tasks. To mitigate this, we aim to enhance the low-resolution thermal image according to the extensive analysis of existing approaches. To this end, we introduce Thermal Image Enhancement using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), called in TEN, which directly learns an end-to-end mapping a single low resolution image to the desired high resolution image. In addition, we examine various image domains to find the best representative of the thermal enhancement. Overall, we propose the first thermal image enhancement method based on CNN guided on RGB data. We provide extensive experiments designed to evaluate the quality of image and the performance of several object recognition tasks such as pedestrian detection, visual odometry, and image registration.

For the all-day perception of autonomous systems, we propose the use of a different spectral sensor, i.e., a thermal imaging camera. Toward this goal, we develop a multi-sensor platform, which supports the use of a co-aligned RGB/Thermal camera, RGB stereo, 3-D LiDAR, and inertial sensors (GPS/IMU) and a related calibration technique. We design a wide range of visual perception tasks including object detection, drivable region detection, localization, image enhancement, depth estimation, and colorization using a single/multi-spectral approach.

Beyond these limitations, the innovation introduced here is a multispectral solution in the form of depth estimation from a thermal sensor without an additional depth sensor.Based on an analysis of multispectral properties and the relevance to depth predictions, we propose an efficient and novel multi-task framework called the Multispectral Transfer Network (MTN) to estimate a depth image from a single thermal image. By exploiting geometric priors and chromaticity clues, our model can generate a pixel-wise depth image in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, we propose a new type of multitask module called Interleaver as a means of incorporating the chromaticity and fine details of skip-connections into the depth estimation framework without sharing feature layers. Lastly, we explain a novel technical means of stably training and covering large disparities and extending thermal images to data-driven methods for all-day conditions. In experiments, we demonstrate the better performance and generalization of depth estimation through the proposed multispectral stereo dataset, including various driving conditions."}}

However, most existing datasets focus on a color channel, while a thermal channel is helpful for detection even in a dark environment. With this in mind, we propose a multispectral pedestrian dataset which provides well aligned color-thermal image pairs, captured by beam splitter-based special hardware. The color-thermal dataset is as large as previous color-based datasets and provides dense annotations including temporal correspondences. With this dataset, we introduce multispectral ACF, which is an extension of aggregated channel features (ACF) to simultaneously handle color-thermal image pairs. Multi-spectral ACF reduces the average miss rate of ACF by 15%, and achieves another breakthrough in the pedestrian detection task."}}
