Yet in practice, a request may not be possible due to language ambiguity or environment changes. To study VLN with unknown command feasibility, we introduce a new dataset Mobile app Tasks with Iterative Feedback (MoTIF), where the goal is to complete a natural language command in a mobile app. Mobile apps provide a scalable domain to study real downstream uses of VLN methods. Moreover, mobile app commands provide instruction for interactive navigation, as they result in action sequences with state changes via clicking, typing, or swiping. MoTIF is the first to include feasibility annotations, containing both binary feasibility labels and fine-grained labels for why tasks are unsatisfiable. We further collect follow-up questions for ambiguous queries to enable research on task uncertainty resolution. Equipped with our dataset, we propose the new problem of feasibility prediction, in which a natural language instruction and multimodal app environment are used to predict command feasibility. MoTIF provides a more realistic app dataset as it contains many diverse environments, high-level goals, and longer action sequences than prior work. We evaluate interactive VLN methods using MoTIF, quantify the generalization ability of current approaches to new app environments, and measure the effect of task feasibility on navigation performance."}}

While prior work has focused on generative methods for disentangled representation learning, these approaches do not scale to large datasets due to current limitations of generative models. Instead, we explore regularization methods with contrastive learning, which could result in disentangled representations that are powerful enough for large scale datasets and downstream applications. However, we find that unsupervised disentanglement is difficult to achieve due to optimization and initialization sensitivity, with trade-offs in task performance. We evaluate disentanglement with downstream tasks, analyze the benefits and disadvantages of each regularization used, and discuss future directions."}}

However, the datasets used for these problems fail to capture the complexity of real inputs and multimodal environments, such as ambiguous natural language requests and diverse digital domains. We introduce Mobile app Tasks with Iterative Feedback (MoTIF), a dataset with natural language commands for the greatest number of interactive environments to date. MoTIF is the first to contain natural language requests for interactive environments that are not satisfiable, and we obtain follow-up questions on this subset to enable research on task uncertainty resolution. We perform initial feasibility classification experiments and only reach an F1 score of 37.3, verifying the need for richer vision-language representations and improved architectures to reason about task feasibility."}}

In this paper, we-9*6 propose a Scalable Multilingual Aligned Language Representation (SMALR) that supports many languages with few model parameters without sacrificing downstream task performance. SMALR learns a fixed size language-agnostic representation for most words in a multilingual vocabulary, keeping language-specific features for just a few. We use a masked cross-language modeling loss to align features with context from other languages. Additionally, we propose a cross-lingual consistency module that ensures predictions made for a query and its machine translation are comparable. The effectiveness of SMALR is demonstrated with ten diverse languages, over twice the number supported in vision-language tasks to date. We evaluate on multilingual image-sentence retrieval and outperform prior work by 3\u20134% with less than 1/5th the training parameters compared to other word embedding methods."}}
