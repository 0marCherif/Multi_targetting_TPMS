This information is crucial because it can be used to support the analysis of a document's vocabulary and context. Supervised learning methods in recent years have advanced the task of language identification. However, these methods usually require large labeled datasets, which often need to be included for various domains of images, such as documents or scene images. In this work, we propose DocLangID, a transfer learning approach to identify the language of unlabeled historical documents. We achieve this by first leveraging labeled data from a different but related domain of historical documents. Secondly, we implement a distance-based few-shot learning approach to adapt a convolutional neural network to new languages of the unlabeled dataset. By introducing small amounts of manually labeled examples from the set of unlabeled images, our feature extractor develops a better adaptability towards new and different data distributions of historical documents. We show that such a model can be effectively fine-tuned for the unlabeled set of images by only reusing the same few-shot examples. We showcase our work across 10 languages that mostly use the Latin script. Our experiments on historical documents demonstrate that our combined approach improves the language identification performance, achieving 74% recognition accuracy on the four unseen languages of the unlabeled dataset."}}

However, not all knowledge is certain and correct, especially under adverse conditions. For example, label noise usually leads to less reliable models due to undesired memorization. Wrong knowledge harms the learning rather than helps it. This problem can be handled by two aspects: (i) knowledge source, improving the reliability of each model (knowledge producer) improving the knowledge source\u2019s reliability; (ii) selecting reliable knowledge for distillation. Making a model more reliable is widely studied while selective MKD receives little attention. Therefore, we focus on studying selective MKD and highlight its importance in this work. Concretely, a generic MKD framework, Confident knowledge selection followed by Mutual Distillation (CMD), is designed. The key component of CMD is a generic knowledge selection formulation, making the selection threshold either static (CMD-S) or progressive (CMD-P). Additionally, CMD covers two special cases: zero knowledge and all knowledge, leading to a\nunified MKD framework. Extensive experiments are present to demonstrate the effectiveness of CMD and thoroughly justify the design of CMD."}}

The problem is that labeling samples is a time-consuming task because it requires human expertise and thus, cannot be automated well. In this work, we propose a novel method to construct synthetic labeled datasets for historical documents where no annotations are available. We train a StyleGAN model to synthesize document images that capture the core features of the original documents. While originally, the StyleGAN architecture was not intended to produce labels, it indirectly learns the underlying semantics to generate realistic images. Using our approach, we can extract the semantic information from the intermediate feature maps and use it to generate ground truth labels. To investigate if our synthetic dataset can be used to segment the text in historical documents, we use it to train multiple supervised segmentation models and evaluate their performance. We also train these models on another dataset created by a state-of-the-art synthesis approach to show that the models trained on our dataset achieve better results while requiring even less human annotation effort."}}

Existing research focuses primarily on utilizing the labeled set at the methodological level, with less emphasis on the analysis of the labeled set itself. Thus, in this paper, we rethink novel class discovery from the labeled set and focus on two core questions: (i) Given a specific unlabeled set, what kind of labeled set can best support novel class discovery? (ii) A fundamental premise of NCD is that the labeled set must be related to the unlabeled set, but how can we measure this relation? For (i), we propose and substantiate the hypothesis that NCD could benefit more from a labeled set with a large degree of semantic similarity to the unlabeled set. Specifically, we establish an extensive and large-scale benchmark with varying degrees of semantic similarity between labeled/unlabeled datasets on ImageNet by leveraging its hierarchical class structure. As a sharp contrast, the existing NCD benchmarks are developed based on labeled sets with different number of categories and images, and completely ignore the semantic relation. For (ii), we introduce a mathematical definition for quantifying the semantic similarity between labeled and unlabeled sets. In addition, we use this metric to confirm the validity of our proposed benchmark and demonstrate that it highly correlates with NCD performance.

However, the significant accuracy gap to the full-precision counterparts restricts their creative potential for mobile applications. In this work, we revisit the potential of binary neural networks and focus on a compelling but unanswered problem: how can a binary neural network achieve the crucial accuracy level (e.g., 80%) on ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet? We achieve this goal by enhancing the optimization process from three complementary perspectives: (1) We design a novel binary architecture BNext based on a comprehensive study of binary architectures and their optimization process. (2) We propose a novel knowledge-distillation technique to alleviate the counter-intuitive overfitting problem observed when attempting to train extremely accurate binary models. (3) We analyze the data augmentation pipeline for binary networks and modernize it with up-to-date techniques from full-precision models. The evaluation results on ImageNet show that BNext, for the first time, pushes the binary model accuracy boundary to 80.57% and significantly outperforms all the existing binary networks.

Despite their decent performance, the models still have numerous parameters and high computational complexity, impeding their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), which enables low-bit computations without extra training, could be a promising tool. In this work, we conduct an empirical evaluation of three PTQ methods on BERT-Base and BERT-Large: Linear Quantization (LQ), Analytical Clipping for Integer Quantization (ACIQ), and Outlier Channel Splitting (OCS). OCS theoretically surpasses the others in minimizing the Mean Square quantization Error and avoiding distorting the weights' outliers. That is consistent with the evaluation results of most language tasks of GLUE benchmark and a reading comprehension task, SQuAD. Moreover, low-bit quantized BERT models could outperform the corresponding 32-bit baselines on several small language tasks, which we attribute to the alleviation of over-parameterization. We further explore the limit of quantization bit and show that OCS could quantize BERT-Base and BERT-Large to 3-bits and retain 98% and 96% of the performance on the GLUE benchmark accordingly. Moreover, we conduct quantization on the whole BERT family, i.e., BERT models in different configurations, and comprehensively evaluate their performance on the GLUE benchmark and SQuAD, hoping to provide valuable guidelines for their deployment in various computation environments."}}

Furthermore, most previous BNNs use 32-bit values for feature maps and residual shortcuts, which helps to maintain the accuracy, but is not friendly to hardware accelerators with limited memory, energy, and computing resources. Thus, we raise the following question: How can accuracy and energy consumption be balanced in a BNN design? We extensively study this fundamental problem in this work and propose BoolNet: an architecture without most commonly used 32-bit components that uses 1-bit values to store feature maps. Experimental results on ImageNet demonstrate that BoolNet can achieve 63.0% Top-1 accuracy coupled with an energy reduction of 2.95x compared to recent state-of-the-art BNN architectures.

While existing works discuss the difficulty of compressing GANs during training, requiring novel methods designed with the instability of GANs training in mind, we show that existing compression methods (namely clipping and quantization) may be directly applied to compress GANs post-training, without any additional changes. High compression levels may distort the generated set, likely leading to an increase of outliers that may negatively affect the overall assessment of existing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) based metrics. We propose two new precision and recall metrics based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), which, on top of increasing the outlier robustness, decrease the complexity of assessing an evaluation sample against $n$ reference samples from $O(n)$ to $O(\\log(n))$, if using LSH and KNN, and to $O(1)$, if only applying LSH. We show that low-bit compression of several pre-trained GANs on multiple datasets induces a trade-off between precision and recall, retaining sample quality while sacrificing sample diversity."}}

However, using these models on mobile or embedded devices is difficult due to the limited memory and computation resources. Recently, the inverted residual block becomes the dominating solution for the architecture design of compact CNNs. In this work, we comprehensively investigated the existing design concepts, rethink the functional characteristics of two pointwise convolutions in the inverted residuals. We propose a novel design, called asymmetrical bottlenecks. Precisely, we adjust the first pointwise convolution dimension, enrich the information flow by feature reuse, and migrate saved computations to the second pointwise convolution. Doing so we can further improve the accuracy without increasing the computation overhead. The asymmetrical bottlenecks can be adopted as a drop-in replacement for the existing CNN blocks. We can thus create AsymmNet by easily stack those blocks according to proper depth and width conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed block design is more beneficial than the original inverted residual bottlenecks for mobile networks, especially useful for those ultralight CNNs within the regime of <220M MAdds.
