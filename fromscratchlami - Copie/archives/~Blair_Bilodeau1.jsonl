In light of these results, it remains unclear for practitioners how to use these methods and choose between them in a principled way. In this paper, we show that for even moderately rich model classes (easily satisfied by neural networks), any feature attribution method that is complete and linear--for example, Integrated Gradients and SHAP--can provably fail to improve on random guessing for inferring model behaviour. Our results apply to common end-tasks such as identifying local model behaviour, spurious feature identification, and algorithmic recourse. One takeaway from our work is the importance of concretely defining end-tasks. In particular, we show that once such an end-task is defined, a simple and direct approach of repeated model evaluations can outperform many other complex feature attribution methods."}}

For joint density estimation, minimax rates have been characterized for general density classes in terms of uniform (metric) entropy, a well-studied notion of statistical capacity. When applying these results to conditional density estimation, the use of uniform entropy -- which is infinite when the covariate space is unbounded and suffers from the curse of dimensionality -- can lead to suboptimal rates. Consequently, minimax rates for conditional density estimation cannot be characterized using these classical results. \nWe resolve this problem for well-specified models, obtaining matching (within logarithmic factors) upper and lower bounds on the minimax Kullback--Leibler risk in terms of the empirical Hellinger entropy for the conditional density class. The use of empirical entropy allows us to appeal to concentration arguments based on local Rademacher complexity, which -- in contrast to uniform entropy -- leads to matching rates for large, potentially nonparametric classes and captures the correct dependence on the complexity of the covariate space. Our results require only that the conditional densities are bounded above, and do not require that they are bounded below or otherwise satisfy any tail conditions."}}

Our results apply to the uniform relative error in the approximate posterior density, the coverage probabilities of approximate credible sets, and approximate moments and quantiles, therefore guaranteeing fast asymptotic convergence of approximate summary statistics used in practice. The family of quadrature rules includes adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature, and we apply this rule in two challenging low-dimensional examples. Further, we demonstrate how adaptive quadrature can be used as a crucial component of a modern approximate Bayesian inference procedure for high-dimensional additive models. The method is implemented and made publicly available in the aghq package for the R language, available on CRAN."}}

Without additional assumptions, minimax optimal performance (measured by cumulative regret) is well-understood. With access to additional observed variables that d-separate the intervention from the outcome (i.e., they are a d-separator), recent \"causal bandit\" algorithms provably incur less regret. However, in practice it is desirable to be agnostic to whether observed variables are a d-separator. Ideally, an algorithm should be adaptive; that is, perform nearly as well as an algorithm with oracle knowledge of the presence or absence of a d-separator. In this work, we formalize and study this notion of adaptivity, and provide a novel algorithm that simultaneously achieves (a) optimal regret when a d-separator is observed, improving on classical minimax algorithms, and (b) significantly smaller regret than recent causal bandit algorithms when the observed variables are not a d-separator. Crucially, our algorithm does not require any oracle knowledge of whether a d-separator is observed. We also generalize this adaptivity to other conditions, such as the front-door criterion."}}

More recently, the semi-adversarial paradigm (Bilodeau, Negrea, and Roy 2020) provides an alternative relaxation of adversarial online learning by considering data that may be neither fully adversarial nor stochastic (I.I.D.).  We achieve the minimax optimal regret in both paradigms using FTRL with separate, novel, root-logarithmic regularizers, both of which can be interpreted as yielding variants of NormalHedge. We extend existing KL regret upper bounds, which hold uniformly over target distributions, to possibly uncountable expert classes with arbitrary priors; provide the first full-information lower bounds for quantile regret on finite expert classes (which are tight); and provide an adaptively minimax optimal algorithm for the semi-adversarial paradigm that adapts to the true, unknown constraint faster, leading to uniformly improved regret bounds over existing methods."}}

Assumption: Adaptive Minimax Optimal Sequential Prediction with Expert Advice", "abstract": "We consider prediction with expert advice when data are generated from distributions varying arbitrarily within an unknown constraint set. This semi-adversarial setting includes (at the extremes) the classical i.i.d. setting, when the unknown constraint set is restricted to be a singleton, and the unconstrained adversarial setting, when the constraint set is the set of all distributions. The Hedge algorithm -- long known to be minimax (rate) optimal in the adversarial regime -- was recently shown to be simultaneously minimax optimal for i.i.d. data. In this work, we propose to relax the i.i.d. assumption by seeking adaptivity at all levels of a natural ordering on constraint sets. We provide matching upper and lower bounds on the minimax regret at all levels, show that Hedge with deterministic learning rates is suboptimal outside of the extremes, and prove that one can adaptively obtain minimax regret at all levels. We achieve this optimal adaptivity using the follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) framework, with a novel adaptive regularization scheme that implicitly scales as the square root of the entropy of the current predictive distribution, rather than the entropy of the initial predictive distribution. Finally, we provide novel technical tools to study the statistical performance of FTRL along the semi-adversarial spectrum."}}
