This task is complex as it requires finding patterns and linked meta-data across micro-clusters such as the geographical spread of ads, cluster sizes, etc. Additionally, drawing insights from the data is challenging without visualizing these micro-clusters. To address this, in close-collaboration with domain experts, we built VisPaD, a novel interactive way for characterizing and visualizing micro-clusters and their associated meta-data, all in one place. VisPaD helps discover underlying patterns in the data by projecting micro-clusters in a lower dimensional space. It also allows the user to select micro-clusters involved in suspicious patterns and interactively examine them leading to faster detection and identification of trends in the data. A demo of VisPaD is also released1."}}

We used a machine learning approach to distill latent topics related to NPI from large-scale international news media. We hypothesize that these topics are informative about the timing and nature of implemented NPI, dependent on the source of the information (e.g., local news versus official government announcements) and the target countries. Given a set of latent topics associated with NPI (e.g., self-quarantine, social distancing, online education, etc), we assume that countries and media sources have different prior distributions over these topics, which are sampled to generate the news articles. To model the source-specific topic priors, we developed a semi-supervised, multi-source, dynamic, embedded topic model. Our model is able to simultaneously infer latent topics and learn a linear classifier to predict NPI labels using the topic mixtures as input for each news article. To learn these models, we developed an efficient end-to-end amortized variational inference algorithm. We applied our models to news data collected and labelled by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN). Through comprehensive experiments, we observed superior topic quality and intervention prediction accuracy, compared to the baseline embedded topic models, which ignore information on media source and intervention labels. The inferred latent topics reveal distinct policies and media framing in different countries and media sources, and also characterize reaction to COVID-19 and NPI in a semantically meaningful manner. Our PyTorch code is available on Github (htps://github.com/li-lab-mcgill/covid19_media)."}}

In this paper, we design an approach that efficiently tackles the above problems. We address the first issue of high sparsity in CF by modifying the popular parallel seeding technique proposed by Bahmani et al. for use in a spherical setting, for the clustering of users. Experimental evaluations on highly sparse real world datasets demonstrate the better performance of our algorithm than existing Spherical K-Means algorithms. Contrary to the common belief that users are only interested in items similar to those of their previous liking, it has been well established that including serendipitous recommendations improves their satisfaction. Thus, to tackle the second problem of overspecialization, we effectuate serendipity in movie recommender systems with an end-to-end algorithm, Serendipitous Clustering for Collaborative Filtering (SC-CF) that considers diversity, unexpectedness and relevance. SC-CF takes advantage of carefully generated user profiles to then assign users to a \"serendipitous cluster.\" The overall clustering process leverages these user profiles and improves recommendation quality through serendipity. A series of experiments on Serendipity 2018 (part of Movielens) dataset built on real user feedback has shown that SC-CF outperforms the existing popular recommendation methods like K-Means and deep learning based CF."}}

Although their algorithm is simple and easy to implement, a drawback of the same is that it doesn\u2019t provide any provable guarantee on the clustering result. (Endo and Miyamoto, 2015) suggest an adaptive sampling based algorithm (Spherical $k$-means$++$) which gives near optimal results, with high probability. However, their algorithm requires $k$ sequential passes over the entire dataset, which may not be feasible when the dataset and/or the values of $k$ are large. In this work, we propose a Markov chain based sampling algorithm that takes only one pass over the data, and gives close to optimal clustering similar to Spherical $k$-means$++$, i.e., a faster algorithm while maintaining almost the same approximation. We present a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, and complement it with rigorous experiments on real-world datasets. Our proposed algorithm is simple and easy to implement, and can be easily adopted in practice."}}
