Recently, end-to-end predict-then-optimize has emerged as an attractive alternative to the two-stage approach of separately fitting a predictive model for the unknown parameters, then optimizing. In this work, we present the PyEPO package, a PyTorch-based end-to-end predict-then-optimize library in Python for linear and integer programming. It provides two base algorithms: the first is based on the convex surrogate loss function from the seminal work of Elmachtoub & Grigas (2021), and the second is based on the differentiable black-box solver approach of Vlastelica et al. (2019). PyEPO provides a simple interface for the definition of new optimization problems, the implementation of state-of-the-art predict-then-optimize training algorithms, the use of custom neural network architectures, and the comparison of end-to-end approaches with the two-stage approach."}}

In this paper, we investigate interactive graph-based segmentation algorithms that enforce connectivity. To be more precise, we introduce an instance-aware heuristic of a discrete Potts model, and a class-aware Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation that ensures global optimum. Both algorithms can take RGB, or utilize the feature maps from any DCNN, whether trained on the target dataset or not, as input. We present competitive semantic (and panoptic) segmentation results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes dataset given initial scribbles. We also demonstrate that our interactive approach can reach $90.6\\%$ mIoU on VOC validation set with an overhead of just $3$ correction scribbles. They are thus suitable for  interactive annotation on new or existing datasets, or can be used inside any weakly supervised learning framework on new datasets."}}
