Due to the powerful feature extraction ability, convolutional neural network (CNN) based texture classification methods have attracted extensive attention in recent years. However, there are still some challenges, such as the extraction of multi-level texture features and their relationships. To address these problems, this letter proposes the wavelet multi-level attention capsule network (WMACapsNet), which integrates multi-scale wavelet decomposition and multi-level attention blocks into the capsule network. Specifically, multi-scale spectral features in frequency domain are extracted by multi-level wavelet transform; and then the self-attention block explores the dependencies of capsule features within each scale; finally, the cross-attention block refines capsule features and their relationships with attention mechanism across different scales. The proposed WMACapsNet provides an efficient way to explore spatial domain features, frequency domain features and their dependencies, useful for most texture classification tasks. Experimental results on several texture datasets show that the proposed WMACapsNet outperforms the state-of-the-art texture classification methods not only in accuracy but also in robustness."}}

Inspired by the great success of deep learning, we propose a novel neural network called Multi-head Attentional Point Cloud Classification and Segmentation Using Strictly Rotation-invariant Representations. Our research focuses on processing the point cloud rotated in any direction effectively and precisely. First of all, the strictly rotation-invariant point cloud representations are obtained through point projection. Then we apply a multi-head attentional convolution layer (MACL) using attention coding to develop the performance of point cloud feature extraction. Finally, our network assigns different responses and recognizes the overall geometry well through a key point descriptor, adding to the global feature. Our method can explore more in-depth information for accuracy enhancement with attention pooling and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based on an advanced DenseNet. Our network enjoys 90.63% and 87.50% classification accuracy testing on ModelNet10 and ModelNet40, and 75.15% intersection over union metric (mIoU) evaluating on ShapeNet Part dataset, remaining under any rotation. Rotating experimental results indicate that our framework realizes better point cloud classification and segmentation performance than most state-of-the-art methods."}}
