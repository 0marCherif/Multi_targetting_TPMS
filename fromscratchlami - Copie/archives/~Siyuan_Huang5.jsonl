As the size of network models begins to vastly outstrip traditional silicon computing resources, functional memories based on flash, resistive switches, magnetic tunnel junctions, and other technologies can store these new ultra-large models. However, new approaches are then needed to minimize hardware overhead, especially on the movement and calculation of gradient information that cannot be efficiently contained in these new memory resources. To do this, we introduce streaming batch principal component analysis (SBPCA) as an update algorithm. Streaming batch principal component analysis uses stochastic power iterations to generate a stochastic rank-k approximation of the network gradient. We demonstrate that the low-rank updates produced by streaming batch principal component analysis can effectively train convolutional neural networks on a variety of common datasets, with performance comparable to standard mini-batch gradient descent. Our approximation is made in an expanded vector form that can efficiently be applied to the rows and columns of crossbars for array-level updates. These results promise improvements in the design of application-specific integrated circuits based around large vector-matrix multiplier memories."}}

This is due to the impact of fake news on the internet especially on social media. Numerous of the models proposed in the previous studies are based on supervised learning. Therefore, these models are unable to deal with the huge amount of unlabeled data about fake news. Few studies focused on early detection. In this study, we built a semi-supervised learning model to detect fake news on social media at an early stage. By using a semi-supervised learning, we make our model able to deal with the huge amount of unlabeled data on social media. We first built a model to extract users' opinion expressed in comments, then we used CredRank Algorithm to evaluate users' credibility and built a small network of users involved in the spread of a given news. The outputs of these three steps serve as inputs of our news classifier SSLNews. SSLNews is composed of three networks: a shared CNN, an unsupervised CNN and a supervised CNN. We used real world datasets to evaluate our model, Politifact and Gossipcop. When using 25% of labeled data, SSLNews reaches an accuracy of 72.25% on Politifact and 70.35% on Gossipcop. When using data produced in the first 10 minutes of the beginning of the spread of the news, SSLNews reaches an accuracy of 71.10% on Politifact and 68.07% on Gossipcop."}}

Though immense acceleration of the training process can be achieved by leveraging the fact that the time complexity of training does not scale with the network size, it is limited by the space complexity of stochastic gradient descent, which grows quadratically. The main objective of this work is to reduce this space complexity by using low-rank approximations of stochastic gradient descent. This low spatial complexity combined with streaming methods allows for significant reductions in memory and compute overhead, opening the doors for improvements in area, time and energy efficiency of training. We refer to this algorithm and architecture to implement it as the streaming batch eigenupdate (SBE) approach."}}

And the traffic flow analysis based on trajectory data has become one of the most popular research topics in recent years. With the wide application of deep learning and for its higher accuracy than other approaches, methods such as convolution neural network and deep residual network have been introduced in traffic flow research and achieve good results. However, these methods usually require the training of a large number of parameters, which leads to some problems. For example, frequent manual adjustment is needed, and some parameters cannot be dynamically adjusted with the training process. We find that learning rate plays a crucial role in all parameters, which has important influence on the training speed of the residual network. In other words, the soundness of traffic flow predication results depends on the learning rate. Hence, we propose G4 algorithm to automatically determine the learning rate. It can be adjusted automatically in the process of trajectory data mining, and therefore solve the traffic flow prediction problem. Experiments on real data sets show that our method is effective and superior over some traditional optimizing methods of traffic flow analysis."}}
