As there are lower bound instances that show that an online algorithm cannot achieve a competitive ratio that is a function of $n$ and $k$, we consider a beyond worst-case analysis model in which the algorithm is provided a priori with a predicted budget $B$ that upper bounds the optimal objective value. We give an algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio that is exponential in the the number $k$ of clusters, and show that the competitive ratio of every algorithm must be linear in $k$. To the best of our knowledge this is the first investigation in the literature that considers cluster consistency using competitive analysis."}}

Our algorithms are the first purely combinatorial approximation algorithms for this problem. We construct a novel semi-metric on the set of vertices, which we call the correlation metric, that indicates to our clustering algorithms whether pairs of nodes should be in the same cluster. The paper demonstrates empirically that, compared to prior work, our algorithms sacrifice little in the objective quality to obtain significantly better run-time. Moreover, our algorithms scale to larger networks that are effectively intractable for known algorithms."}}

We give a combinatorial algorithm that returns a single clustering solution that is simultaneously $O(1)$-approximate for all $\\ell_p$-norms of the disagreement vector. This proves that minimal sacrifice is needed in order to optimize different norms of the disagreement vector. Our algorithm is the first combinatorial approximation algorithm for the $\\ell_2$-norm objective, and more generally the first combinatorial algorithm for the $\\ell_p$-norm objective when $2 \\leq p < \\infty$. It is also faster than all previous algorithms that minimize the $\\ell_p$-norm of the disagreement vector, with run-time $O(n^\\omega)$, where $O(n^\\omega)$ is the time for matrix multiplication on $n \\times n$ matrices. When the maximum positive degree in the graph is at most $\\Delta$, this can be improved to a run-time of $O(n\\Delta^2 \\log n)$."}}

Such a rounding algorithm was recently given by Karlin, Klein, and Oveis Gharan based on sampling from max-entropy distributions. We build on an approach of Haddadan and Newman to show how sampling from the matroid intersection polytope, and a new use of max-entropy sampling, can give better guarantees."}}
