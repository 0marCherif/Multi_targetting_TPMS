The derivative of these solvers is zero or undefined, therefore a meaningful replacement is crucial for effective gradient-based learning. Prior works rely on smoothing the solver with input perturbations, relaxing the solver to continuous problems, or interpolating the loss landscape with techniques that typically require additional solver calls, introduce extra hyper-parameters, or compromise performance. We propose a principled approach to exploit the geometry of the discrete solution space to treat the solver as a negative identity on the backward pass and further provide a theoretical justification. Our experiments demonstrate that such a straightforward hyper-parameter-free approach is able to compete with previous more complex methods on numerous experiments such as backpropagation through discrete samplers, deep graph matching, and image retrieval. Furthermore, we substitute the previously proposed problem-specific and label-dependent margin with a generic regularization procedure that prevents cost collapse and increases robustness."}}

The Defender must instantly switch to a new strategy optimized for the new environment, not disrupting the ongoing patrolling task, and the new strategy must be computed promptly under all circumstances. Since strategy switching may cause unintended security risks compromising the achieved protection, our solution includes mechanisms for detecting and mitigating this problem. The efficiency of our framework is evaluated experimentally."}}

One possible approach is to introduce combinatorial building blocks into neural networks. Such end-to-end architectures have the potential to tackle combinatorial problems on raw input data such as ensuring global consistency in multi-object tracking or route planning on maps in robotics. In this work, we present a method that implements an efficient backward pass through blackbox implementations of combinatorial solvers with linear objective functions. We provide both theoretical and experimental backing. In particular, we incorporate the Gurobi MIP solver, Blossom V algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithm into architectures that extract suitable features from raw inputs for the traveling salesman problem, the min-cost perfect matching problem and the shortest path problem."}}
