It is often achieved by adapting with access to the whole target domain data. In a more realistic scenario, target distribution is often unpredictable until inference stage. This motivates us to explore adapting an object detection model at test-time, a.k.a. test-time adaptation (TTA). In this work, we approach test-time adaptive object detection (TTAOD) from two perspective. First, we adopt a self-training paradigm to generate pseudo labeled objects with an exponential moving average model. The pseudo labels are further used to supervise adapting source domain model. As self-training is prone to incorrect pseudo labels, we further incorporate aligning feature distributions at two output levels as regularizations to self-training. To validate the performance on TTAOD, we create benchmarks based on three standard object detection datasets and adapt generic TTA methods to object detection task. Extensive evaluations suggest our proposed method sets the state-of-the-art on test-time adaptive object detection task."}}

Test-time training (TTT) emerges as a solution to this adaptation under a realistic scenario where access to full source domain data is not available, and instant inference on the target domain is required. Despite many efforts into TTT, there is a confusion over the experimental settings, thus leading to unfair comparisons. In this work, we first revisit TTT assumptions and categorize TTT protocols by two key factors. Among the multiple protocols, we adopt a realistic sequential test-time training (sTTT) protocol, under which we develop a test-time anchored clustering (TTAC) approach to enable stronger test-time feature learning. TTAC discovers clusters in both source and target domains and matches the target clusters to the source ones to improve adaptation. When source domain information is strictly absent (i.e. source-free) we further develop an efficient method to infer source domain distributions for anchored clustering. Finally, self-training~(ST) has demonstrated great success in learning from unlabeled data and we empirically figure out that applying ST alone to TTT is prone to confirmation bias. Therefore, a more effective TTT approach is introduced by regularizing self-training with anchored clustering, and the improved model is referred to as TTAC++. We demonstrate that, under all TTT protocols, TTAC++ consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on five TTT datasets, including corrupted target domain, selected hard samples, synthetic-to-real adaptation and adversarially attacked target domain. We hope this work will provide a fair benchmarking of TTT methods, and future research should be compared within respective protocols."}}

Existing approaches mainly focus on exploiting manifold and pseudo-labeling to make use of large unlabeled data points. A fundamental challenge here lies in the large intra-class variations of local geometric structure, resulting in subclasses within a semantic class. In this work, we leverage this intuition and opt for maintaining an individual classifier for each subclass. Technically, we design a multi-prototype classifier, each prototype serves as the classifier weights for one subclass. To enable effective updating of multi-prototype classifier weights, we propose two constraints respectively for updating the prototypes w.r.t. all point features and for encouraging the learning of diverse prototypes. Experiments on weakly supervised 3D point cloud segmentation tasks validate the efficacy of proposed method in particular at low-label regime. Our hypothesis is also verified given the consistent discovery of semantic subclasses at no cost of additional annotations."}}
