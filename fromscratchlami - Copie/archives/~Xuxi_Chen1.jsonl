However, YS can only be accurately measured by very expensive and time-consuming real-world experiments, hence cannot be acquired at scale. Learning-based methods could facilitate the discovery process, but the lack of a comprehensive dataset on HEA yield strength has created barriers. We present X-Yield, a materials science benchmark with 240 experimentally measured (\"high-quality\") and over 100K simulated (imperfect or \"low-quality\") HEA yield strength data. Due to the scarcity of experimental data and the quality gap with imperfectly simulated data, existing transfer learning methods cannot generalize well on our dataset. We address this cross-quality few-shot transfer problem by leveraging model sparsification \"twice\" --- as a noise-robust feature learning regularizer at the pre-training stage, and as a data-efficient learning regularizer at the few-shot transfer stage. We then propose a bi-level optimization framework termed Bi-RPT that jointly learns optimal masks and automatically allocates sparsity levels for both stages. \nThe effectiveness of Bi-RPT is validated through extensive experiments on our new challenging X-Yield dataset, alongside other synthesized testbeds. Specifically, we achieve an 8.9-19.8% reduction in terms of the test MSE and 0.98-1.53% in terms of test accuracy, merely using 5-10% of the hard-to-generate experimental data."}}

Generally, noisy supervision could stem from variation among labelers, label corruption by adversaries, etc. To combat such label noises, one popular line of approach is to apply customized weights to the training instances, so that the corrupted examples contribute less to the model learning. However, such learning mechanisms potentially erase important information about the data distribution and therefore yield suboptimal results. To leverage useful information from the corrupted instances, an alternative is the bootstrapping loss, which reconstructs new training targets on-the-fly by reweighting the real labels and the network's own predictions (i.e., pseudo labels).\nIn this paper, we propose a more generic learnable loss objective which enables a joint reweighting of instances and labels at once. Specifically, our method dynamically adjusts the $\\textit{per-sample importance weight}$ between the real observed labels and pseudo-labels, where the weights are efficiently determined in a meta process. Compared to the previous instance reweighting methods, our approach concurrently conducts implicit relabeling, and thereby yields substantial improvements with almost no extra cost. Extensive experimental results demonstrated the strengths of our approach over existing methods on multiple natural and medical image benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ISIC2019 and Clothing 1M.

Generally, L2O develops a parameterized optimization method (i.e., \"optimizer\") by learning from solving sample problems. This data-driven procedure yields L2O that can efficiently solve problems similar to those seen in training, that is, drawn from the same \"task distribution\". However, such learned optimizers often struggle when new test problems come with a substantially deviation from the training task distribution. This paper investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an L2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to a out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps. We theoretically characterize the generalization of L2O, and further show that our proposed framework (termed as M-L2O) provably facilitates rapid task adaptation by locating well-adapted initial points for the optimizer weight. Empirical observations on several classic tasks like LASSO and Quadratic, demonstrate that M-L2O converges significantly faster than vanilla L2O with only $5$ steps of adaptation, echoing our theoretical results.

While prior works on NeRFs optimize a scene representation by inverting a handcrafted rendering equation, GNT achieves neural representation and rendering that generalizes across scenes using transformers at two stages. (1) The view transformer leverages multi-view geometry as an inductive bias for attention-based scene representation, and predicts coordinate-aligned features by aggregating information from epipolar lines on the neighboring views. (2) The ray transformer renders novel views using attention to decode the features from the view transformer along the sampled points during ray marching. Our experiments demonstrate that when optimized on a single scene, GNT can successfully reconstruct NeRF without an explicit rendering formula due to the learned ray renderer. When trained on multiple scenes, GNT consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance when transferring to unseen scenes and outperform all other methods by ~10% on average. Our analysis of the learned attention maps to infer depth and occlusion indicate that attention enables learning a physically-grounded rendering. Our results show the promise of transformers as a universal modeling tool for graphics. Please refer to our project page for video results: https://vita-group.github.io/GNT/"}}

The dominant role of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) seems to be challenged by increasingly effective transformer-based models. Very recently, a couple of advanced convolutional models strike back with large kernels motivated by the local-window attention mechanism, showing appealing performance and efficiency. While one of them, i.e. RepLKNet, impressively manages to scale the kernel size to 31x31 with improved performance, the performance starts to saturate as the kernel size continues growing, compared to the scaling trend of advanced ViTs such as Swin Transformer. In this paper, we explore the possibility of training extreme convolutions larger than 31x31 and test whether the performance gap can be eliminated by strategically enlarging convolutions. This study ends up with a recipe for applying extremely large kernels from the perspective of sparsity, which can smoothly scale up kernels to 61x61 with better performance. Built on this recipe, we propose Sparse Large Kernel Network (SLaK), a pure CNN architecture equipped with sparse factorized 51x51 kernels that can perform on par with or better than state-of-the-art hierarchical Transformers and modern ConvNet architectures like ConvNeXt and RepLKNet, on ImageNet classification as well as a wide range of downstream tasks including semantic segmentation on ADE20K, object detection on PASCAL VOC 2007, and object detection/segmentation on MS COCO.

Similar to their dense counterparts, recent SNNs generalize just as well and are equipped with numerous favorable benefits (e.g., low complexity, high scalability, and robustness), sometimes even better than the original dense networks. As research effort is focused on developing increasingly sophisticated sparse algorithms, it is startling that a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms has been highly overlooked. In absence of a carefully crafted evaluation benchmark, most if not all, sparse algorithms are evaluated against fairly simple and naive tasks (eg. CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, GLUE, etc.), which can potentially camouflage many advantages as well unexpected predicaments of SNNs. In pursuit of a more general evaluation and unveiling the true potential of sparse algorithms, we introduce \u201cSparsity May Cry\u201d Benchmark (SMC-Bench), a collection of carefully-curated 4 diverse tasks with 10 datasets, that accounts for capturing a wide range of domain-specific and sophisticated knowledge. Our systemic evaluation of the most representative sparse algorithms reveals an important obscured observation: the state-of-the-art magnitude- and/or gradient-based sparse algorithms seemingly fail to perform on SMC-Bench when applied out-of-the-box, sometimes at significantly trivial sparsity as low as 5%. The observations seek the immediate attention of the sparsity research community to reconsider the highly proclaimed benefits of SNNs. We further conduct a thorough investigation into the reasons for the failure of common SNNs. Our analysis points out that such failure is intimately related to the \u201clazy regime\u201d of large model training, which hints us with stronger pruning recipes that alleviate the failure on SMC-Bench (though still more or less suffering). By incorporating these well-thought and diverse tasks, SMC-Bench is designed to favor and encourage the development of more scalable and generalizable sparse algorithms. We open-source SMC-Bench to assist researchers in building next-generation sparse algorithms that scale and generalize: https://github.com/VITA-Group/SMC-Bench."}}

Based on extensive experiments, we find that in low data regimes (datasets of 50-100 examples per class), sparse winning tickets substantially outperform the original dense networks. This approach, when combined with augmentations or fine-tuning from a self-supervised backbone network, shows further improvements in performance by as much as 16% (absolute) on low-sample datasets and long-tailed classification. Further, sparse winning tickets are more robust to synthetic noise and distribution shifts compared to their dense counterparts. Our analysis of winning tickets on small datasets indicates that, though sparse, the networks retain density in the initial layers and their representations are more generalizable.
