However, existing segmentation methods often overlook incorporating prior information and symptoms of teeth, which can cause unsatisfactory segmentation performance on teeth with symptoms. To this respect, we propose Tooth Symptom Network (TSNet), consisting of Dental Prior Guiding Data Augmentation (DPGDA) and Dental Symptom Shape Loss (DSSL), to improve segmentation performance for teeth with different clinical symptoms. Experiments show that TSNet outperforms all state-of-the-art methods across datasets with all kinds of symptoms with an average increase of 1.13\\% in Dice and 2.00\\% in IoU."}}
