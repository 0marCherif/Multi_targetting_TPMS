To reduce the search time, zero-shot NAS aims at designing training-free proxies that can predict the test performance of a given architecture. However, as shown recently, none of the zero-shot proxies proposed to date can actually work consistently better than a naive proxy, namely, the number of network parameters (#Params). To improve this state of affairs, as the main theoretical contribution, we first reveal how some specific gradient properties across different samples impact the convergence rate and generalization capacity of neural networks. Based on this theoretical analysis, we propose a new zero-shot proxy, ZiCo, the first proxy that works consistently better than #Params. We demonstrate that ZiCo works better than State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) proxies on several popular NAS-Benchmarks (NASBench101, NATSBench-SSS/TSS, TransNASBench-101) for multiple applications (e.g., image classification/reconstruction and pixel-level prediction). Finally, we demonstrate that the optimal architectures found via ZiCo are as competitive as the ones found by one-shot and multi-shot NAS methods, but with much less search time. For example, ZiCo-based NAS can find optimal architectures with 78.1%, 79.4%, and 80.4% test accuracy under inference budgets of 450M, 600M, and 1000M FLOPs, respectively, on ImageNet within 0.4 GPU days.

However, in real applications, the depth estimation may be halted at any time, due to the random interruptions or low energy capacity of battery when using powerful sensors like 3D LiDAR. To address this problem, we propose a depth estimation method that is robust to random halts and relies on energy-saving 2D LiDAR and a monocular camera. To this end, we formulate the depth estimation as an anytime problem and propose a new metric to evaluate its robustness under random interruptions. Our final model has only 2M parameters with a marginal accuracy loss compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Indeed, our experiments on NYU Depth v2 dataset show that our model is capable of processing 224$\\times$224 resolution images and 2D point clouds with any computation budget larger than 6.37ms (157 FPS) and 0.2J on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 system. Evaluations on KITTI dataset under supervised and self-supervised training show similar results."}}
