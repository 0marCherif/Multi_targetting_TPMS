However, learning policies that can perform multiple tasks and leverage prior experience to learn faster remains challenging. Despite previous attempts to improve on these areas, our understanding of multi-task training and generalization in reinforcement learning remains limited. In this work we propose to investigate the generalization capabilities of a popular actor-critic method, IMPALA. We build on previous work that has advocated for the use of modes and difficulties of Atari 2600 games as a benchmark for transfer learning in reinforcement learning. We do so by pretraining an agent on multiple flavours of the same game before finetuning on the remaining unseen ones. This protocol simplifies the multi-task pretraining phase by limiting negative interference between tasks and allows us to better understand the dynamics of multi-task training and generalization. We find that, given a fixed amount of pretraining data, agents trained with more variations of a game are able to generalize better. Surprisingly we observe that this advantage can be more pronounced after finetuning for 200M environment frames than when doing zero-shot transfer. This highlights the importance of the learned representation and that performance after finetuning might more appropriate to evaluate generalization in reinforcement learning. We also find that, even though small networks have remained popular to solve Atari 2600 games increasing the capacity of the value and policy network is critical to achieve good performance as we increase the number of pretraining modes and difficulties. Overall our findings emphasize key points that are crucial for efficient multi-task training and generalization in reinforcement learning."}}

Despite previous attempts to improve on these areas, our understanding of multi-task training and generalization in RL remains limited. To fill this gap, we investigate the generalization capabilities of a popular actor-critic method, IMPALA. Specifically, we build on previous work that has advocated for the use of modes and difficulties of Atari 2600 games as a challenging benchmark for transfer learning in RL. We do so by pretraining an agent on multiple variants of the same Atari game before fine-tuning on the remaining never-before-seen variants.

We find that, given a fixed amount of pretraining data, agents trained with more variations are able to generalize better. Surprisingly, we also observe that this advantage can still be present after fine-tuning for 200M environment frames than when doing zero-shot transfer. This highlights the potential effect of a good learned representation.

However many problems are better addressed by the concurrent reinforcement learning paradigm, where multiple agents operate in a common environment. Recent work has tackled the challenge of exploration in this particular setting \\citep{dimakopoulou2018coordinated,dimakopoulou2018scalable}.\nNonetheless, they do not completely leverage the characteristics of this framework and agents end up behaving independently from each other. In this work we argue that coordination among concurrent agents is crucial for efficient exploration.\nWe introduce coordination in Thompson Sampling based methods by drawing correlated samples from an agent's posterior.\nWe apply this idea to extend existing exploration schemes such as randomized least squares value iteration (RLSVI).\nEmpirical results emphasize the merits of our approach and call attention to coordination as a key objective for efficient exploration in concurrent reinforcement learning."}}

In this paper, we consider episodic reinforcement learning with a continuous state-action space which is assumed to be equipped with a natural metric that characterizes the proximity between different states and actions. We propose ZoomRL, an online algorithm that leverages ideas from continuous bandits to learn an adaptive discretization of the joint space by zooming in more promising and frequently visited regions while carefully balancing the exploitation-exploration trade-off. We show that ZoomRL achieves a worst-case regret $\\tilde{O}(H^{\\frac{5}{2}} K^{\\frac{d+1}{d+2}})$ where $H$ is the planning horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes and $d$ is the covering dimension of the space with respect to the metric. Moreover, our algorithm enjoys improved metric-dependent guarantees that reflect the geometry of the underlying space. Finally, we show that our algorithm is robust to small misspecification errors."}}

Recently, bonus-based exploration methods, which explore by augmenting the environment reward, have reached above-human average performance on such domains. In this paper we reassess popular bonus-based exploration methods within a common evaluation framework. We combine Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018) with different exploration bonuses and evaluate its performance on Montezuma's Revenge, Bellemare et al.'s set of hard of exploration games with sparse rewards, and the whole Atari 2600 suite. We find that while exploration bonuses lead to higher score on Montezuma's Revenge they do not provide meaningful gains over the simpler epsilon-greedy scheme. In fact, we find that methods that perform best on that game often underperform epsilon-greedy on easy exploration Atari 2600 games. We find that our conclusions remain valid even when hyperparameters are tuned for these easy-exploration games. Finally, we find that none of the methods surveyed benefit from additional training samples (1 billion frames, versus Rainbow's 200 million) on Bellemare et al.'s hard exploration games. Our results suggest that recent gains in Montezuma's Revenge may be better attributed to architecture change, rather than better exploration schemes; and that the real pace of progress in exploration research for Atari 2600 games may have been obfuscated by good results on a single domain."}}

We demonstrate that using value functions as auxiliary tasks corresponds to an expected-error relaxation of our formulation, with AVFs a natural candidate, and identify a close relationship with proto-value functions (Mahadevan, 2005).
