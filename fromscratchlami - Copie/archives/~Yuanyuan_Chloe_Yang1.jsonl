The goal is to design an online algorithm to find a minimizer $\\bm{x}^{\\star}$ for a function $f\\colon \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, where $\\mathcal{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$. In each round, the algorithm submits a pair of guesses, i.e., $\\bm{x}^{(1)}$ and $\\bm{x}^{(2)}$, and the adversary responds with \\textit{any} point in the space that is at least as good as both guesses. The cost of each query is the suboptimality of the worse of the two guesses; i.e., ${\\max} \\left( f(\\bm{x}^{(1)}), f(\\bm{x}^{(2)}) \\right) - f(\\bm{x}^{\\star})$. The goal is to minimize the number of iterations required to find an $\\eps$-optimal point and to minimize the total cost (regret) of the guesses over many rounds. Our main result is an efficient randomized algorithm for several natural choices of the function $f$ and set $\\mathcal{X}$ that incurs cost $O(d)$ and iteration complexity $O(d\\log(1/\\varepsilon)^2)$. Moreover, our dependence on $d$ is asymptotically optimal, as we show examples in which any randomized algorithm for this problem must incur $\\Omega(d)$ cost and iteration complexity."}}
