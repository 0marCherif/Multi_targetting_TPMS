We propose a discrete multi-segment model in which each segment is a 6-DoF Gough-Stewart parallel platform. Our model is novel in that it can reproduce all generic motions of an octopus arm, including elongation, shortening, bending, and particularly twisting, which is usually not included in such models, while enforcing the constant-volume property of the octopus arm. We use an approach that is inspired by the unique decentralized nervous system of the octopus arm to overcome challenges in solving the Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem, including the large number of solutions for this problem and the impracticality of numerical methods for real-time applications. We apply the pseudo-inverse Jacobian method to design a kinematic controller that drives the tip of the hyper-redundant robot to track a reference trajectory. We evaluate our proposed model and controller in simulation for a variety of 3D reference trajectories: a straight line, an ellipse, a sinusoidal path, and trajectories that emulate octopus-like reaching and fetching movements. The tip of the simulated hyper-redundant robot tracks the reference trajectories with average root-mean-square errors that are less than 0.3% of the robot's initial length, demonstrating the effectiveness of our modeling and control approaches."}}

H\u221e-Optimal Estimation", "abstract": "In this paper, we develop an SOS-based approach for design of observers for time-delay systems. The method is an extension of recently developed algorithms for control of infinite-dimensional systems. The observers we design are more general than the class of observers most commonly associated with time-delay systems in that they directly correct both the estimate of present state and the history of the state. As a result, the observer is itself a PDE. In this case the traditional notions of strong and weak observability do not apply and the resulting observer-based controllers can significantly outperform existing approaches."}}

First, we give a generalized version of the dual stability condition formulated in terms of Lyapunov operators which are positive, self-adjoint, and preserve the structure of the state space. Second, we provide a class of such operators and express the stability conditions as positivity and negativity of quadratic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional forms. Next, we adapt the Sum of Squares (SOS) methodology to express positivity and negativity of these forms as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), describing a new set of polynomial manipulation tools designed for this purpose. We apply the resulting LMIs to a battery of numerical examples and demonstrate that the stability conditions are not significantly conservative. Finally, we formulate a test for controller synthesis for systems with multiple delays, apply the test to a numerical example, and simulate the resulting closed-loop system."}}

This work expands on a newly developed state-space theory for coupled PDEs and extends the positive-real and bounded-real lemmas to infinite dimensional systems. We show that conditions for passivity and bounded L2 gain can be expressed as linear operator inequalities on R\u00d7 L2. A method to convert these operator inequalities to LMIs by using parameterization of the operator variables is proposed. This method does not rely on discretization and as such, the properties obtained are prima facie provable. We use numerical examples to demonstrate that the bounds obtained are not conservative in any significant sense and that the bounds are computable on desktop computers for systems consisting of up to 20 coupled PDEs."}}

We refer to kernels of this class as Tessellated Kernels (TKs) due to the observation that if applied to kernel-based learning algorithms, the resulting discriminants are defined by continuous piecewise-polynomial functions with hyper-rectangular domains whose vertices are determined by the training data. The number of parameters used to define these TKs is determined by the length of an associated monomial basis. However, even for a single monomial basis function the TKs are universal in the sense that the resulting discriminants occupy a hypothesis space which is dense in L <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> . This implies that the use of TKs for learning the kernel (aka kernel learning) can obviate the need for Gaussian kernels and associated problem of selecting bandwidth - a conclusion verified through extensive numerical testing on soft margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) problems. Furthermore, our results show that when the ratio of the number of training data to features is high, the proposed method will significantly outperform other algorithms for learning the kernel. Finally, TKs can be integrated efficiently with existing Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) algorithms such as SimpleMKL."}}

These sets may be explicitly defined, as in the case of discrete points or unions of sets; or implicitly defined, as in the case of attractors of nonlinear systems. We define optimality in the sense of minimum volume, while satisfying constraints that can include set containment, convexity, or Lyapunov stability conditions. Our admittedly heuristic approach to volume minimization is based on the use of a determinant-like objective function. We provide numerical examples for the Lorenz attractor and the Van der Pol limit cycle."}}

We then show that there exist polynomial upper and lower bounds to this value function and furthermore, these polynomial \"sub-value\" and \"super-value\" functions provide provable upper and lower bounds to the forward reachable set.

The class of distributions over which we optimize, result from using a polynomial map to lift the data into a higher-dimensional space, solving for an optimal Gaussian fit in this space, and then projecting a polynomial slice of the resulting joint density into physical space. The resulting distribution, to be called Sliced Normal, is able to characterize multimodal responses and strong parameter dependencies. We investigate several formulations of the problem, first maximizing a log-likelihood function, then a worst-case log-likelihood function, and finally using a heuristic to increase sparsity within the maximum log-likelihood formulation - thereby identifying independent subsets of the random variables. Using the optimal density functions in each scenario, we then propose semi-algebraic sets representing confidence regions, or \u201csafe sets,\u201d for future data. Finally, we show numerically that these \u201csafe sets\u201d are reliable and, hence, can be used for system identification, fault detection, robustness analysis, and robust control design."}}
