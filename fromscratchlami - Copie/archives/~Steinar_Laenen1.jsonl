Traditional objectives of graph clustering are to find clusters with low conductance. Not only are these objectives just applicable for undirected graphs, they are also incapable to take the relationships between clusters into account, which could be crucial for many applications. To overcome these downsides, we study directed graphs (digraphs) whose clusters exhibit further \u201cstructural\u201d information amongst each other. Based on the Hermitian matrix representation of digraphs, we present a nearly-linear time algorithm for digraph clustering, and further show that our proposed algorithm can be implemented in sublinear time under reasonable assumptions. The significance of our theoretical work is demonstrated by extensive experimental results on the UN Comtrade Dataset: the output clustering of our algorithm exhibits not only how the clusters (sets of countries) relate to each other with respect to their import and export records, but also how these clusters evolve over time, in accordance with known facts in international trade."}}

It consists of organising training in a series of learning problems, each relying on small \u201csupport\u201d and \u201cquery\u201d sets to mimic the few-shot circumstances encountered during evaluation.\nIn this paper, we investigate the usefulness of episodic learning in Prototypical Networks, one of the most popular algorithms making use of this practice.\nSurprisingly, in our experiments we found that, for Prototypical Networks, it is detrimental to use the episodic learning strategy of separating training samples between support and query set, as it is\na data-inefficient way to exploit training batches. This \u201cnon-episodic\u201d version of Prototypical Networks, which corresponds to the classic Neighbourhood Component Analysis, reliably improves over its episodic counterpart in multiple datasets, achieving an accuracy that is competitive with the state-of-the-art, despite being extremely simple."}}
