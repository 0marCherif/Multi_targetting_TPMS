Proper explanations for the model behavior increase model transparency and help researchers develop more accountable models. Graph neural networks (GNN) have recently shown superior performance in many graph ML problems than traditional methods, and explaining them has attracted increased interest. However, GNN explanation for link prediction (LP) is lacking in the literature. LP is an essential GNN task and corresponds to web applications like recommendation and sponsored search on web. Given existing GNN explanation methods only address node/graph-level tasks, we propose Path-based GNN Explanation for heterogeneous Link prediction (PaGE-Link) that generates explanations with connection interpretability, enjoys model scalability, and handles graph heterogeneity. Qualitatively, PaGE-Link can generate explanations as paths connecting a node pair, which naturally captures connections between the two nodes and easily transfer to human-interpretable explanations. Quantitatively, explanations generated by PaGE-Link improve AUC for recommendation on citation and user-item graphs by 9 - 35% and are chosen as better by 78.79% of responses in human evaluation."}}

Despite their effectiveness, GNNs often suffer from high latency due to non-trivial neighborhood data dependency in practical deployments. To address this issue, researchers have proposed methods based on knowledge distillation (KD) to transfer the knowledge from teacher GNNs to student MLPs, which are known to be efficient even with industrial scale data, and have shown promising results on node classification. Nonetheless, using KD to accelerate link prediction is still unexplored. In this work, we start with exploring two direct analogs of traditional KD for link prediction, i.e., predicted logit-based matching and node representation-based matching. Upon observing direct KD analogs do not perform well for link prediction, we propose a relational KD framework, Linkless Link Prediction (LLP). Unlike simple KD methods that match independent link logits or node representations, LLP distills relational knowledge that is centered around each (anchor) node to the student MLP. Specifically, we propose two matching strategies that complement each other: rank-based matching and distribution-based matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP boosts the link prediction performance of MLPs with significant margins, and even outperforms the teacher GNNs on 6 out of 9 benchmarks. LLP also achieves a 776.37x speedup in link prediction inference compared to GNNs on the large scale Citation2 dataset. "}}

The Shapley value from game theory has been proposed as a prime approach to compute feature importance towards model predictions on images, text, tabular data, and recently graph neural networks (GNNs) on graphs. In this work, we revisit the appropriateness of the Shapley value for GNN explanation, where the task is to identify the most important subgraph and constituent nodes for GNN predictions. We claim that the Shapley value is a non-ideal choice for graph data because it is by definition not structure-aware. We propose a Graph Structure-aware eXplanation (GStarX) method to leverage the critical graph structure information to improve the explanation. Specifically, we define a scoring function based on a new structure-aware value from the cooperative game theory proposed by Hamiache and Navarro (HN). When used to score node importance, the HN value utilizes graph structures to attribute cooperation surplus between neighbor nodes, resembling message passing in GNNs, so that node importance scores reflect not only the node feature importance, but also the node structural roles. We demonstrate that GStarX produces qualitatively more intuitive explanations, and quantitatively improves explanation fidelity over strong baselines on chemical graph property prediction and text graph sentiment classification.

To alleviate the concerns, we propose and study the problem of graph condensation for graph neural networks (GNNs).  Specifically, we aim to condense the large, original graph into a small, synthetic and highly-informative graph, such that GNNs trained on the small graph and large graph have comparable performance. We approach the condensation problem by imitating the GNN training trajectory  on the original graph through the optimization of a gradient matching loss and design a strategy to condense node futures and structural information simultaneously. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in condensing different graph datasets into informative smaller graphs. In particular, we are able to approximate the original test accuracy by 95.3\\% on Reddit, 99.8\\% on Flickr and 99.0\\% on Citeseer,  while reducing their graph size by more than 99.9\\%, and the condensed graphs can be used to train various GNN architectures.

Yet, they are less popular for practical deployments in the industry owing to their scalability challenges incurred by data dependency. Namely, GNN inference depends on neighbor nodes multiple hops away from the target, and fetching them burdens latency-constrained applications. Existing inference acceleration methods like pruning and quantization can speed up GNNs by reducing Multiplication-and-ACcumulation (MAC) operations, but the improvements are limited given the data dependency is not resolved. Conversely, multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) have no graph dependency and infer much faster than GNNs, even though they are less accurate than GNNs for node classification in general. Motivated by these complementary strengths and weaknesses, we bring GNNs and MLPs together via knowledge distillation (KD). Our work shows that the performance of MLPs can be improved by large margins with GNN KD. We call the distilled MLPs Graph-less Neural Networks (GLNNs) as they have no inference graph dependency. We show that GLNNs with competitive accuracy infer faster than GNNs by 146X-273X and faster than other acceleration methods by 14X-27X. Under a production setting involving both transductive and inductive predictions across 7 datasets, GLNN accuracies improve over stand-alone MLPs by 12.36% on average and match GNNs on 6/7 datasets. Comprehensive analysis shows when and why GLNNs can achieve competitive accuracies to GNNs and suggests GLNN as a handy choice for latency-constrained applications. "}}

For example, in the chemical domain, functional groups are motifs that can determine molecule properties. Mining and utilizing motifs, however, is a non-trivial task for large graph datasets. Traditional motif discovery approaches mostly rely on exact counting or statistical estimation, which are hard to scale for a large number of graphs with continuous and high-dimension features. In light of the significance and challenges of motif mining, we propose : MICRO-Graph: a framework for \\underline{M}ot\\underline{I}f-driven \\underline{C}ontrastive lea\\underline{R}ning \\underline{O}f \\underline{G}raph representations to: 1) pre-train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in a self-supervised manner to automatically extract graph motifs from large graph datasets; 2) leverage learned motifs to guide the contrastive learning of graph representations, which further benefit various graph downstream tasks. Specifically, given a graph dataset, a motif learner cluster similar and significant subgraphs into corresponding motif slots. Based on the learned motifs, a motif-guided subgraph segmenter is trained to generate more informative subgraphs, which are used to conduct graph-to-subgraph contrastive learning of GNNs. Our discovering strategy is to simutaneously do clustering and contrastive learning on dynamically sampled subgraphs. The clustering part pull together similar subgraphs across different whole graphs, as the contrastive part push away dissimilar ones. Meanwhile, our learnable sampler will generate subgraph samples better aligned with the discoverying procedure. By pre-training on ogbn-molhiv molecule dataset with our proposed MICRO-Graph, the pre-trained GNN model can enhance various chemical property prediction downstream tasks with scarce label by 2.0%, and significantly higher than other state-of-the-art self-supervised learning baselines. \n"}}
