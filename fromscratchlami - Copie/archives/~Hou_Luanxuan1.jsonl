In this work, we propose a data augmentation method (ReMix) to tackle this issue. We interpolate training samples at the feature level and propose a novel content loss based on the perceptual relations among samples. The generator learns to translate the in-between samples rather than memorizing the training set, and thereby forces the discriminator to generalize. The proposed approach effectively reduces the ambiguity of generation and renders content-preserving results. The ReMix method can be easily incorporated into existing GAN models with minor modifications. Experimental results on numerous tasks demonstrate that GAN models equipped with the ReMix method achieve significant improvements.\n"}}

At the same time, better performance is obtained under the premise of reducing the computational overhead. The dataset of the PAIR competition has the characteristics of imbalanced categories, low quality of images and inconsistent annotations. To address this issue, firstly we adopt an improved cross entropy loss function and data augmentations to rebalance the data distribution. Then the extra datasets are involved to neutralize the low images quality and annotation inconsistency issues. Secondly, this competition focuses on object detection on embedded device. So we apply knowledge distillation to fine-tune a lightweight detection model. Our detection model uses MobileNetV3 Small as backbone and SSDLite as detector head. In order to improve detection performance on small targets, FPNLite is included so that low-level features can be utilized. And we also apply TensorRT library to accelerate the inference procedure further. Eventually, our method achieves the 3 <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rd</sup> place in the final score list of competition as the fastest, lightest and the most computation economically solution. Our code will soon be open source."}}

During data preprocessing, we proposed a differentiable auto data augmentation ($DA^2$) method. We formulate the problem of searching data augmentaion policy in a differentiable form, so that the optimal policy setting can be easily updated by back propagation during training. $DA^2$ improves the training efficiency. A parallel-pyramid structure is followed to compensate the information loss introduced by the network. We innovate two fusion structures, i.e. Parallel Fusion and Progressive Fusion, to process pyramid features from backbone network. Both fusion structures leverage the advantages of spatial information affluence at high resolution and semantic comprehension at low resolution effectively. We propose a refinement stage for the pyramid features to further boost the accuracy of our network. By introducing dilated bottleneck and attention module, we increase the receptive field for the features with limited complexity and tune the importance to different feature channels. To further refine the feature maps after completion of feature extraction stage, an Attention Module ($AM$) is defined to extract weighted features from different scale feature maps generated by the parallel-pyramid structure. Compared with the traditional up-sampling refining, $AM$ can better capture the relationship between channels. Experiments corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, our method achieves the best performance on the challenging MSCOCO and MPII datasets."}}
