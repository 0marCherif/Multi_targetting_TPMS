By viewing image formation as the sequential accumulation of photons on a detector grid, we show that a network trained to predict where the next photon could arrive is in fact solving the minimum mean square error (MMSE) denoising task. This new perspective allows us to make three contributions: We present a new strategy for self-supervised denoising, We present a new method for sampling from the posterior of possible solutions by iteratively sampling and adding small numbers of photons to the image. We derive a full generative model by starting this process from an empty canvas. We call this approach generative accumulation of photons (GAP). We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on 4 new fluorescence microscopy datasets, which will be made available to the community. We find that it outperforms supervised, self-supervised and unsupervised baselines or performs on-par."}}

Especially in the domain of microscopy images, various content-aware image restoration (CARE) approaches are now used to improve the interpretability of acquired data. Naturally, there are limitations to what can be restored in corrupted images, and like for all inverse problems, many potential solutions exist, and one of them must be chosen. Here, we propose DivNoising, a denoising approach based on fully convolutional variational autoencoders (VAEs), overcoming the problem of having to choose a single solution by predicting a whole distribution of denoised images. First we introduce a principled way of formulating the unsupervised denoising problem within the VAE framework by explicitly incorporating imaging noise models into the decoder. Our approach is fully unsupervised, only requiring noisy images and a suitable description of the imaging noise distribution. We show that such a noise model can either be measured, bootstrapped from noisy data, or co-learned during training. If desired, consensus predictions can be inferred from a set of DivNoising predictions, leading to competitive results with other unsupervised methods and, on occasion, even with the supervised state-of-the-art. DivNoising samples from the posterior enable a plethora of useful applications. We are (i) showing denoising results for 13 datasets, (ii) discussing how optical character recognition (OCR) applications can benefit from diverse predictions, and are (iii) demonstrating how instance cell segmentation improves when using diverse DivNoising predictions."}}

This problem is often addressed via (supervised) deep learning based denoising. Recently, by making assumptions about the noise statistics, self-supervised methods have emerged. Such methods are trained directly on the images that are to be denoised and do not require additional paired training data. While achieving remarkable results, self-supervised methods can produce high-frequency artifacts and achieve inferior results compared to supervised approaches. Here we present a novel way to improve the quality of self-supervised denoising.Considering that light microscopy images are usually diffraction-limited, we propose to include this knowledge in the denoising process. We assume the clean image to be the result of a convolution with a point spread function (PSF) and explicitly include this operation at the end of our neural network. As a consequence, we are able to eliminate high-frequency artifacts and achieve self-supervised results that are very close to the ones achieved with traditional supervised methods."}}

Here we propose DenoiSeg, a new method that can be trained end-to-end on only a few annotated ground truth segmentations. We achieve this by extending Noise2Void, a self-supervised denoising scheme that can be trained on noisy images alone, to also predict dense 3-class segmentations. The reason for the success of our method is that segmentation can profit from denoising, especially when performed jointly within the same network. The network becomes a denoising expert by seeing all available raw data, while co-learning to segment, even if only a few segmentation labels are available. This hypothesis is additionally fueled by our observation that the best segmentation results on high quality (very low noise) raw data are obtained when moderate amounts of synthetic noise are added. This renders the denoising-task non-trivial and unleashes the desired co-learning effect. We believe that DenoiSeg offers a viable way to circumvent the tremendous hunger for high quality training data and effectively enables learning of dense segmentations when only very limited amounts of segmentation labels are available."}}

As in many previous works, we utilize a Particle Filter (PF) framework. In order to have a fast tracker,the key aspect is to design a clever  proposal  distribution  which  works reliably even with a small number of particles. To achieve this we build on a recently developed state-of-the-art system for single image 6D pose estimation of known 3D objects, using the concept of so-called 3D object coordinates. The idea is to train a random forest that regresses the 3D object coordinates from the RGB-D image. Our key technical contribution is a two-way procedure to integrate the random forest predictions in the proposal distribution generation. This has many practical advantages, in particular better generalization ability with respect to occlusions, changes in lighting and fast-moving objects. We demonstrate experimentally that we exceed state-of-the-art on a given, public dataset.To raise the bar in terms of fast-moving objects and object occlusions,we also create a new dataset, which will be made publicly available."}}

In particular, we consider object instances with the topology of a kinematic chain, ie assemblies of rigid parts connected by prismatic or revolute joints. This object type occurs often in daily live, for instance in the form of furniture or electronic devices. Instead of treating each object part separately we are using the relationship between parts of the kinematic chain and propose a new minimal pose sampling approach. This enables us to create a pose hypothesis for a kinematic chain consisting of K parts by sampling K 3D-3D point correspondences. To asses the quality of our method, we gathered a large dataset containing four objects and 7000+ annotated RGB-D frames 1. On this dataset we achieve considerably better results than a modified state-of-the-art pose estimation system for rigid objects."}}

They are traditionally trained on pairs of images, which are often hard to obtain for practical applications. This motivates self-supervised training methods such as Noise2Void~(N2V) that operate on single noisy images. Self-supervised methods are, unfortunately, not competitive with models trained on image pairs. Here, we present 'Probabilistic Noise2Void' (PN2V), a method to train CNNs to predict per-pixel intensity distributions. Combining these with a suitable description of the noise, we obtain a complete probabilistic model for the noisy observations and true signal in every pixel. We evaluate PN2V on publicly available microscopy datasets, under a broad range of noise regimes, and achieve competitive results with respect to supervised state-of-the-art methods."}}

Recently it has been shown that such methods can also be trained without clean targets. Instead, independent pairs of noisy images can be used, in an approach known as Noise2Noise (N2N). Here, we introduce Noise2Void (N2V), a training scheme that takes this idea one step further. It does not require noisy image pairs, nor clean target images. Consequently, N2V allows us to train directly on the body of data to be denoised and can therefore be applied when other methods cannot. Especially interesting is the application to biomedical image data, where the acquisition of training targets, clean or noisy, is frequently not possible. We compare the performance of N2V to approaches that have either clean target images and/or noisy image pairs available. Intuitively, N2V cannot be expected to outperform methods that have more information available during training. Still, we observe that the denoising performance of Noise2Void drops in moderation and compares favorably to training-free denoising methods."}}

A new category of DL methods such as Noise2Void or Noise2Self can be used fully unsupervised, requiring nothing but the noisy data. However, this comes at the price of reduced reconstruction quality. The recently proposed Probabilistic Noise2Void (PN2V) improves results, but requires an additional noise model for which calibration data needs to be acquired. Here, we present improvements to PN2V that (i) replace histogram based noise models by parametric noise models, and (ii) show how suitable noise models can be created even in the absence of calibration data. This is a major step since it actually renders PN2V fully unsupervised. We demonstrate that all proposed improvements are not only academic but indeed relevant."}}

Hence, we propose to use denoising networks to improve the performance of other DL-based image segmentation methods. More specifically, we present ideas on how state-of-the-art self-supervised CARE networks can improve cell/nuclei segmentation in microscopy data. Using two state-of-the-art baseline methods, U-Net and StarDist, we show that our ideas consistently improve the quality of resulting segmentations, especially when only limited training data for noisy micrographs are available."}}
