However, DA's potential in pixel-wise dense predictions is unexplored. To bridge this gap, we present the Directed Accumulator Grid (DAGrid), which allows geometric-preserving filtering in neural networks, thus broadening the scope of DA's applications to include pixel-level dense prediction tasks. DAGrid utilizes homogeneous data types in conjunction with designed sampling grids to construct geometrically transformed representations, retaining intricate geometric information and promoting long-range information propagation within the neural networks. Contrary to its symmetric counterpart, grid sampling, which might lose information in the sampling process, DAGrid aggregates all pixels, ensuring a comprehensive representation in the transformed space. The parallelization of DAGrid on modern GPUs is facilitated using CUDA programming, and also back propagation is enabled for deep neural network training. Empirical results show DAGrid-enhanced neural networks excel in supervised skin lesion segmentation and unsupervised cardiac image registration. Specifically, the network incorporating DAGrid has realized a 70.8% reduction in network parameter size and a 96.8% decrease in FLOPs, while concurrently improving the Dice score for skin lesion segmentation by 1.0% compared to state-of-the-art transformers. Furthermore, it has achieved improvements of 4.4% and 8.2% in the average Dice score and Dice score of the left ventricular mass, respectively, indicating an increase in registration accuracy for cardiac images.

In this paper, we propose spatially covariant pixel-aligned classifier (SCP) to improve the computational efficiency and meantime maintain or increase accuracy for lesion segmentation. SCP relaxes the spatial invariance constraint imposed by convolutional operations and optimizes an underlying implicit function that maps image coordinates to network weights, the parameters of which are obtained along with the backbone network training and later used for generating network weights to capture spatially covariant contextual information. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SCP using two lesion segmentation tasks from different imaging modalities: white matter hyperintensity segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging and liver tumor segmentation in contrast-enhanced abdominal computerized tomography. The network using SCP has achieved 23.8, 64.9 and 74.7 reduction in GPU memory usage, FLOPs, and network size with similar or better accuracy for lesion segmentation."}}

However, it is also facing a reproducibility crisis, especially in medicine. ML models that are carefully constructed from and evaluated on a training set might not generalize well on data from different patient populations or acquisition instrument settings and protocols. We tackle this problem in the context of neuroimaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia (SZ) and brain aging. We develop a weighted empirical risk minimization approach that optimally combines data from a source group, e.g., subjects are stratified by attributes such as sex, age group, race and clinical cohort to make predictions on a target group, e.g., other sex, age group, etc. using a small fraction (10%) of data from the target group. We apply this method to multi-source data of 15,363 individuals from 20 neuroimaging studies to build ML models for diagnosis of AD and SZ, and estimation of brain age. We found that this approach achieves substantially better accuracy than existing domain adaptation techniques: it obtains area under curve greater than 0.95 for AD classification, area under curve greater than 0.7 for SZ classification and mean absolute error less than 5 years for brain age prediction on all target groups, achieving robustness to variations of scanners, protocols, and demographic or clinical characteristics. In some cases, it is even better than training on all data from the target group, because it leverages the diversity and size of a larger training set. We also demonstrate the utility of our models for prognostic tasks such as predicting disease progression in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Critically, our brain age prediction models lead to new clinical insights regarding correlations with neurophysiological tests."}}

Despite their geometrically simple structure, characterized by radially oriented gradients at the lesion edge with a greater gradient magnitude compared to non-rim+ (rim-) lesions, recent studies indicate that the identification performance for these lesions is subpar due to limited data and significant class imbalance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective image processing operation, deep directed accumulator (DeDA), which provides a new perspective for injecting domain-specific inductive biases (priors) into neural networks for rim+ lesion identification. Given a feature map and a set of sampling grids, DeDA creates and quantizes an accumulator space into finite intervals and accumulates corresponding feature values. This DeDA operation can be regarded as a symmetric operation to the grid sampling within the forward-backward neural network framework, the process of which is order-agnostic, and can be efficiently implemented with the native CUDA programming. Experimental results on a dataset with 177 rim+ and 3986 rim- lesions show that $$10.1\\%$$ of improvement in a partial (false positive rate $$<0.1$$ ) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (pROC AUC) and $$10.2\\%$$ of improvement in an area under the precision recall curve (PR AUC) can be achieved respectively comparing to other state-of-the-art methods.

Leveraging anatomical priors in neural networks can greatly enhance their utility in resource-constrained clinical settings. Prior research has harnessed such information for image segmentation, yet progress in deformable image registration has been modest. Our work introduces textSCF, a novel method that integrates spatially covariant filters and textual anatomical prompts encoded by visual-language models, to fill this gap. This approach optimizes an implicit function that correlates text embeddings of anatomical regions to filter weights, relaxing the typical translation-invariance constraint of convolutional operations. TextSCF not only boosts computational efficiency but can also retain or improve registration accuracy. By capturing the contextual interplay between anatomical regions, it offers impressive inter-regional transferability and the ability to preserve structural discontinuities during registration. TextSCF's performance has been rigorously tested on inter-subject brain MRI and abdominal CT registration tasks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models in the MICCAI Learn2Reg 2021 challenge and leading the leaderboard. In abdominal registrations, textSCF's larger model variant improved the Dice score by 11.3% over the second-best model, while its smaller variant maintained similar accuracy but with an 89.13% reduction in network parameters and a 98.34\\% decrease in computational operations."}}

In the current study, and in the context of three brain diseases, we provide experimental data which support that when properly trained, machine learning models can generalize well across diverse conditions and do not suffer from biases. Specifically, by using multi-study magnetic resonance imaging consortia for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder, we find that, the accuracy of well-trained models is consistent across different subgroups pertaining to attributes such as gender, age, and racial groups, as also different clinical studies. We find that models that incorporate multi-source data from demographic, clinical, genetic factors and cognitive scores are also unbiased. These models have better predictive accuracy across subgroups than those trained only with structural measures in some cases but there are also situations when these additional features do not help."}}

We showed that traditional region-based and boundary-aware loss functions can be associated with the formula. We further develop and instantiate two loss functions containing first- and second-order geometric information of lesion regions to enforce regularization on optimizing deep segmentation models.

This paper leverages a recently proposed normalizing-flow-based method to perform counterfactual inference upon a structural causal model (SCM), in order to achieve harmonization of such data. A causal model is used to model observed effects (brain magnetic resonance imaging data) that result from known confounders (site, gender and age) and exogenous noise variables. Our formulation exploits the bijection induced by flow for the purpose of harmonization. We infer the posterior of exogenous variables, intervene on observations, and draw samples from the resultant SCM to obtain counterfactuals. This approach is evaluated extensively on multiple, large, real-world medical datasets and displayed better cross-domain generalization compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Further experiments that evaluate the quality of confounder-independent data generated by our model using regression and classification tasks are provided."}}
