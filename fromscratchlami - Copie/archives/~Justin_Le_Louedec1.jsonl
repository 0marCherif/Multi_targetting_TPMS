Abstract Automation and robotisation of the agricultural sector are seen as a viable solution to socio-economic challenges faced by this industry. This technology often relies on intelligent perception systems providing information about crops, plants and the entire environment. The challenges faced by traditional 2D vision systems can be addressed by modern 3D vision systems which enable straightforward localisation of objects, size and shape estimation, or handling of occlusions. So far, the use of 3D sensing was mainly limited to indoor or structured environments. In this paper, we evaluate modern sensing technologies including stereo and time-of-flight cameras for 3D perception of shape in agriculture and study their usability for segmenting out soft fruit from background based on their shape. To that end, we propose a novel 3D deep neural network which exploits the organised nature of information originating from the camera-based 3D sensors. We demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed architecture compared to the state-of-the-art 3D networks. Through a simulated study, we also show the potential of the 3D sensing paradigm for object segmentation in agriculture and provide insights and analysis of what shape quality is needed and expected for further analysis of crops. The results of this work should encourage researchers and companies to develop more accurate and robust 3D sensing technologies to assure their wider adoption in practical agricultural applications."}}

Gaussian maps indicate probable object location and can be generated directly from keypoint annotations avoiding laborious and costly per-pixel annotations. We apply this method to the 3D spheroidal class of objects which can be projected into 2D shape representation enabling efficient processing by a neural network GNet, an improved UNet architecture, which generates the likely locations of surface features and their precise count. We demonstrate a practical use of this technique for counting strawberry achenes which is used as a fruit quality measure in phenotyping applications. The results of training the proposed system on several hundreds of 3D scans of strawberries from a publicly available dataset demonstrate the accuracy and precision of the system which outperforms the state-of-the-art density-based methods for this application."}}

Perception is a key aspect of autonomous harvesting and is very challenging due to difficult lighting conditions, limited sensing technologies, occlusions, plant growth, etc. 3D vision approaches can bring several benefits addressing the aforementioned challenges such as localisation, size estimation, occlusion handling and shape analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using 3D information for detecting broccoli heads based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), exploiting the organised nature of the point clouds originating from the RGBD sensors. The proposed algorithm, tested on real-world datasets, achieves better performances than the state-of-the-art, with better accuracy and generalisation in unseen scenarios, whilst significantly reducing inference time, making it better suited for real-time in-field applications."}}

Using data collected with RGB-D cameras under farm field conditions, we present two methods for processing 3D data that reliably detect mature broccoli heads. The proposed systems are efficient and enable real-time detection on depth data of broccoli crops using the organised structure of the point clouds delivered by a depth sensor. The systems are tested with datasets of two broccoli varieties collected in planted fields from two different countries. Our evaluation shows the new methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches for broccoli detection based on both 2D vision-based segmentation techniques and depth clustering using the Euclidean proximity of neighbouring points. The results show the systems are capable of accurately detecting the 3D locations of broccoli heads relative to the vehicle at high frame rates."}}
