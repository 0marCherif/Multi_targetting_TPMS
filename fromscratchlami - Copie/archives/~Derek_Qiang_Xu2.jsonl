We propose GLSearch, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based learning to search model. Our model is built upon the branch and bound algorithm, which selects one pair of nodes from the two input graphs to expand at a time. We propose a novel GNN-based Deep Q-Network (DQN) to select the node pair, making the search process much faster. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graph pairs demonstrate that our model learns a search strategy that is able to detect significantly larger common subgraphs than existing MCS solvers given the same computation budget. GLSearch can be potentially extended to solve many other combinatorial problems with constraints on graphs."}}

One promising approach to this classical problem is the \u201clearning-to-search\u201d paradigm, where a reinforcement learning (RL) agent is designed with a learned policy to guide a search algorithm to quickly find the solution without any solved instances for supervision. However, for the specific task of Subgraph Matching, though the query graph is usually small given by the user as input, the target graph is often orders-of-magnitude larger. It poses challenges to the neural network design and can lead to solution and reward sparsity. In this paper, we propose NSUBS with two innovations to tackle the challenges: (1) A novel encoder-decoder neural network architecture to dynamically compute the matching information between the query and the target graphs at each search state; (2) A novel look-ahead loss function for training the policy network. Experiments on six large real-world target graphs show that NSUBS can significantly improve the subgraph matching performance."}}

However, MCS computation is NP-hard, and state-of-the-art MCS solvers rely on heuristics in search which in practice cannot find good solution for large graph pairs under a limited search budget. Here we propose GLSearch, a Graph Neural Network based model for MCS detection, which learns to search. Our model uses a state-of-the-art branch and bound algorithm as the backbone search algorithm to extract subgraphs by selecting one node pair at a time. In order to make better node selection decision at each step, we replace the node selection heuristics with a novel task-specific Deep Q-Network (DQN), allowing the search process to find larger common subgraphs faster. To enhance the training of DQN, we leverage the search process to provide supervision in a pre-training stage and guide our agent during an imitation learning stage. Therefore, our framework allows search and reinforcement learning to mutually benefit each other. Experiments on synthetic and real-world large graph pairs demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art MCS solvers and neural graph matching network models."}}

Exact MCS detection is NP-hard, and its state-of-the-art exact solver based on heuristic search is slow in practice without any time complexity guarantee. Given the huge importance of this task yet the lack of fast solver, we propose an efficient MCS detection algorithm, NeuralMCS, consisting of a novel neural network model that learns the node-node correspondence from the ground-truth MCS result, and a subgraph extraction procedure that uses the neural network output as guidance for final MCS prediction. The whole model guarantees polynomial time complexity with respect to the number of the nodes of the larger of the two input graphs. Experiments on four real graph datasets show that the proposed model is 48.1x faster than the exact solver and more accurate than all the existing competitive approximate approaches to MCS detection."}}
