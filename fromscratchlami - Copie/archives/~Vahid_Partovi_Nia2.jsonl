For customer churn reduction, uplift models are used to identify the customers who are likely to respond positively to a retention activity only if targeted, and to avoid wasting resources on customers that are very likely to switch to another company. We introduce a Qini-based uplift regression model to analyze a large insurance company's retention marketing campaign. Our approach is based on logistic regression models. We show that a Qini-optimized uplift model acts as a regularizing factor for uplift, much as a penalized likelihood model does for regression. This results in interpretable parsimonious models with few relevant xplanatory variables. Our results show that performing Qini-based parameters estimation significantly improves the uplift models performance."}}
