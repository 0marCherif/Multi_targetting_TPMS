The proposed framework starts with a simple merge cost based on\nsymmetric KL divergence. We extend the recent body of\nwork related to Bregman divergence based agglomerative\nclustering and prove that the symmetric KL divergence is\nan upper-bound for uni-modal Gaussian distributions. This\nleads to a very powerful yet elegant method for bottomup agglomerative clustering with strong theoretical guarantees. We introduce albedo and reflectance fields as features\nfor the distance computations. We compare against other\nestablished methods to bring out possible pros and cons of\nthe proposed method."}}

The novelty of our work\nis an iterative loop that alternates between recognition and\nrestoration stages. In the restoration stage we model the\nimage as an undirected graphical model over the image\npatches with the compatibility functions represented as nonparametric kernel densities. Compatibility functions are\ninitially learned using uniform random samples from the\ntraining data. We solve the inference problem by an extended version of the non-parametric belief propagation algorithm in which we introduce the notion of partial messages. We close the loop by using the confidence scores of\nthe recognition to non-uniformly sample from the training\nset in order to retrain the compatibility functions. We show\nexperimental results on synthetic and license plate images.\n"}}

The definition of the affinity term can be relaxed to suit different applications. An approximate bi-affinity filter whose output is shown to be very similar to the traditional bilateral filter is defined. The present technique has the added advantage that no color space changes are required and hence an input image can be handled in its original color space. This is a big benefit over the traditional bilateral filter, which needs conversion to perception based spaces, such as CIELAB, to generate results close to the present invention. The full bi-affinity filter preserves very minute details of the input image, and thus permits an enhanced zooming functionality."}}

Non-negative bases allow strictly additive combinations which have been shown to be part-based as well as relatively sparse. We pursue a discriminative decomposition by coupling NMF objective with a maximum margin classifier, specifically a support vector machine (SVM). Conversely, we propose an NMF based regularizer for SVM. We formulate the joint update equations and propose a new method which identifies the decomposition as well as the classification parameters. We present classification results on synthetic as well as real datasets."}}

Given an image of a fashion item, what is the most optimum search query that will retrieve the exact same or closely related product (s) with high probability. In this paper we introduce the task of VPQ generation which takes a product image and its title as its input and provides aword level extractive summary of the title, containing a list of salient attributes, which can now be used as a query to search for similar products. We collect a large dataset of fashion images and their titles and merge it with an existing research dataset which was created for a different task. Given the image and title pair, VPQ problem is posed as identifying a non-contiguous collection of spans within the title."}}

ADEM (Lowe et al. 2017) formulated the automatic evaluation of dialogue systems as a learning problem and showed that such a model was able to predict responses which correlate significantly with human judgements, both at utterance and system level. Their system was shown to have beaten word-overlap metrics such as BLEU with large margins. We start with the question of whether an adversary can game the ADEM model. We design a battery of targeted attacks at the neural network based ADEM evaluation system and show that automatic evaluation of dialogue systems still has a long way to go. ADEM can get confused with a variation as simple as reversing the word order in the text! We report experiments on several such adversarial scenarios that draw out counterintuitive scores on the dialogue responses. We take a systematic look at the scoring function proposed by ADEM and connect it to linear system theory to predict the shortcomings evident in the system. We also devise an attack that can fool such a system to rate a response generation system as favorable. Finally, we allude to future research directions of using the adversarial attacks to design a truly automated dialogue evaluation system."}}

We pose NMS as a subset selection problem and posit that directly incorporating DPP like framework can improve the overall performance of the object detection system. We propose an optimization problem which takes the same inputs as NMS, but introduces a novel sub-modularity based diverse subset selection functional. Our results strongly indicate that the modifications proposed in this paper can provide consistent improvements to state-of-the-art object detection pipelines."}}
