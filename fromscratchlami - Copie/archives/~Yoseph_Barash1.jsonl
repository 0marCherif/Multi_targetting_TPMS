Specifically, sub-typing based on changes in RNA splicing has been motivated by several recent studies. We thus develop CHESSBOARD, an unsupervised algorithm tailored for RNA splicing data that captures \u201ctiles\u201d in the data, defined by a subset of unique splicing changes in a subset of patients. CHESSBOARD allows for a flexible number of tiles, accounts for uncertainty of splicing quantification, and is able to model missing values as additional signals. We first apply CHESSBOARD to synthetic data to assess its domain specific modeling advantages, followed by analysis of several leukemia datasets. We show detected tiles are reproducible in independent studies, investigate their possible regulatory drivers and probe their relation to known AML mutations. Finally, we demonstrate the potential clinical utility of CHESSBOARD by supplementing mutation based diagnostic assays with discovered splicing profiles to improve drug response correlation."}}

The many genes that have been genetically associated with cancer or shown to directly contribute to oncogenesis vary widely between tumor types, but common gene signatures that relate to core cancer pathways have also been identified, signifying that cancer cases display common hallmark molecular features. It is not clear however whether there exist additional sets of genes or transcriptomic features that are less well known in cancer biology but that are also commonly deregulated across several cancer types. Here, in order to agnostically identify transcriptomic features that are commonly shared between cancer types, we used RNA-Seq datasets encompassing thousands of samples from 19 healthy tissue types and 18 solid tumor types to train three feed-forward neural networks, based either on protein-coding gene expression, lncRNA expression or splice junction use, to distinguish between healthy and tumor samples. All three models achieve high precision, recall and accuracy on test sets derived from 13 datasets used during training and on an independent test dataset, indicating that our models recognize transcriptome signatures that are consistent across tumors. Analysis of attribution values extracted from our models reveals that genes that are commonly altered in cancer by expression or splicing variations are under strong evolutionary and selective constraints, suggesting that they have important cellular functions. Importantly, we found that genes composing our cancer transcriptome signatures are not frequently affected by mutations or genomic alterations and that their functions differ widely from the genes genetically associated with cancer. Finally, our results also highlighted that deregulation of RNA-processing genes and aberrant splicing are pervasive features across a large array of solid tumor types. The transcriptomic features that we highlight here define cancer signatures that may reflect causal variations or consequences of disease state, or a combination of both."}}

Many of these events are complex, resulting in numerous possible isoforms that quickly become difficult to visualize, interpret and experimentally validate. To address these challenges we developed MAJIQ-SPEL, a web-tool that takes as input local splicing variations (LSVs) quantified from RNA-Seq data and provides users with visualization and quantification of gene isoforms associated with those. Importantly, MAJIQ-SPEL is able to handle both classical (binary) and complex, non-binary, splicing variations. Using a matching primer design algorithm it also suggests to users possible primers for experimental validation by RT-PCR and displays those, along with the matching protein domains affected by the LSV, on UCSC Genome Browser for further downstream analysis."}}

This role of AS, combined with the relation of aberrant splicing to malignant states, motivated two streams of research, experimental and computational. The first involves a myriad of techniques such as RNA-Seq and CLIP-Seq to identify splicing regulators and their putative targets. The second involves probabilistic models, also known as splicing codes, which infer regulatory mechanisms and predict splicing outcome directly from genomic sequence. To date, these models have utilized only expression data. In this work, we address two related challenges: Can we improve on previous models for AS outcome prediction and can we integrate additional sources of data to improve predictions for AS regulatory factors."}}
