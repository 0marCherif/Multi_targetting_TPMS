Particularly, we analyze mirror descent value iteration (MDVI) by Geist et al. (2019) and Vieillard et al. (2020a), which uses the Kullback-Leibler divergence and entropy regularization in its value and policy updates. Our analysis shows that it is nearly minimax-optimal for finding an \u03b5-optimal policy when \u03b5 is sufficiently small. This is the first theoretical result that demonstrates that a simple model-free algorithm without variance-reduction can be nearly minimax-optimal under the considered setting."}}

BYOL-Explore learns the world representation, the world dynamics and the exploration policy all-together by optimizing a single prediction loss in the latent space with no additional auxiliary objective. We show that BYOL-Explore is effective in DM-HARD-8, a challenging partially-observable continuous-action hard-exploration benchmark with visually rich 3-D environment. On this benchmark, we solve the majority of the tasks purely through augmenting the extrinsic reward with BYOL-Explore intrinsic reward, whereas prior work could only get off the ground with human demonstrations. As further evidence of the generality of BYOL-Explore, we show that it achieves superhuman performance on the ten hardest exploration games in Atari while having a much simpler design than other competitive agents.

Despite the apparent similarity between value-based RL and distributional RL, our study reveals intriguing and fundamental differences between the two cases in the multi-step setting. We identify a novel notion of path-dependent distributional TD error, which is indispensable for principled multi-step distributional RL. The distinction from the value-based case bears important implications on concepts such as backward-view algorithms. Our work provides the first theoretical guarantees on multi-step off-policy distributional RL algorithms, including results that apply to the small number of existing approaches to multi-step distributional RL. In addition, we derive a novel algorithm, Quantile Regression-Retrace, which leads to a deep RL agent QR-DQN-Retrace that shows empirical improvements over QR-DQN on the Atari-57 benchmark. Collectively, we shed light on how unique challenges in multi-step distributional RL can be addressed both in theory and practice."}}

Such examples arise commonly in evolutionary computation, but also more recently, neuroevolution and architecture search for Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies. Unfortunately however, previous mutation-based approaches suffer in high dimensional continuous spaces both theoretically and practically. We thus instead propose ES-ENAS, a simple joint optimization procedure by combining Evolutionary Strategies (ES) and combinatorial optimization techniques in a highly scalable and intuitive way, inspired by the \\textit{one-shot} or \\textit{supernet} paradigm introduced in Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS). Through this relatively simple marriage between two different lines of research, we are able to gain the best of both worlds, and empirically demonstrate our approach by optimizing BBOB functions over hybrid spaces as well as combinatorial neural network architectures via edge pruning and quantization on popular RL benchmarks. Due to the modularity of the algorithm, we also are able incorporate a wide variety of popular techniques ranging from use of different continuous and combinatorial optimizers, as well as constrained optimization."}}

This is challenging from an implementation perspective, as repeatedly differentiating policy gradient estimates may lead to biased Hessian estimates. In this work, we provide a unifying framework for estimating higher-order derivatives of value functions, based on off-policy evaluation. Our framework interprets a number of prior approaches as special cases and elucidates the bias and variance trade-off of Hessian estimates. This framework also opens the door to a new family of estimates, which can be easily implemented with auto-differentiation libraries, and lead to performance gains in practice."}}

We show that by utilizing the dual formulation of the WD, we can learn score functions over trajectories that can be in turn used to lead policy optimization towards (or away from) (un)desired behaviors. Combined with smoothed WDs, the dual formulation allows us to devise efficient algorithms that take stochastic gradient descent steps through WD regularizers. We incorporate these regularizers into two novel on-policy algorithms, Behavior-Guided Policy Gradient and Behavior-Guided Evolution Strategies, which we demonstrate can outperform existing methods in a variety of challenging environments. We also provide an open source demo."}}

By defining the combinatorial search space of NAS to be the set of different edge-partitionings (colorings) into same-weight classes, we represent compact architectures via efficient learned edge-partitionings. For several RL tasks, we manage to learn colorings translating to effective policies parameterized by as few as 17 weight parameters, providing >90 % compression over vanilla policies and 6x compression over state-of-the-art compact policies based on Toeplitz matrices, while still maintaining good reward. We believe that our work is one of the first attempts to propose a rigorous approach to training structured neural network architectures for RL problems that are of interest especially in mobile robotics with limited storage and computational resources."}}

We show how ES can be applied to MAML to obtain an algorithm which avoids the problem of estimating second derivatives, and is also conceptually simple and easy to implement. Moreover, ES-MAML can handle new types of nonsmooth adaptation operators, and other techniques for improving performance and estimation of ES methods become applicable. We show empirically that ES-MAML is competitive with existing methods and often yields better adaptation with fewer queries."}}

We show that normalizing flows policy significantly improves upon factorized Gaussian policy baseline, with both TRPO and ACKTR, especially on tasks with complex dynamics such as Humanoid."}}
