In Phase A, a classification network is used to guide the image translation to preserve the content and generate images. In Phase B, the generated images are used to train the classification network. With each step, the classification network and generator improve each other to learn the target domain representation. Detailed analysis and the experiments are testimony of the strength of our approach."}}

This results in an inaccurate categorical alignment and diminishes the classification performance on the target domain. In this paper, we alter existing adversarial domain alignment methods to adhere to category alignment by imputing category information. We partition the samples based on category using source labels and target pseudo labels and then apply domain alignment for every category. Our proposed modification provides a boost in performance even with a modest pseudo label estimator. We evaluate our approach on 4 popular domain alignment loss functions using object recognition and digit datasets."}}
