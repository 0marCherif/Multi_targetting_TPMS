Such models represent the behavior of individuals (agents) and their interactions, based on the geography and demography of the city, and the resulting spread of infections. However, they are computationally very expensive. This seriously limits the usage of such models for simulations, which often have to be run hundreds of times for policy planning and even model parameter estimation. An alternative is to develop an emulator, a surrogate model that can predict the Agent-Based Simulator's output based on its initial conditions and parameters. In this work, we propose a Deep Learning model, based on the Dilated Convolutional Neural Network, that can emulate such an Agent-Based Model with high accuracy. We show that use of this model instead of the original Agent-Based Model provides us major gains in the speed of simulations, allowing much quicker calibration to observations, and more extensive scenario analysis. The models we consider are spatially explicit, as the locations of the infected individuals are simulated instead of the gross counts. Our framework uses a divide-and-conquer approach that divides the city into several small overlapping blocks and carries out the emulation in them parallelly, after which these results are merged together. This ensures that the same emulator can work for a city of any size, and also provides significant improvement of time complexity of the emulator, compared to the original simulator."}}

One way to achieve this is by analyzing high-resolution satellite imagery. Deep Learning has been successful in analyzing images, including remote sensing imagery. However, capturing intricate crop patterns is challenging due to their complexity and variability. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep learning approach that integrates HRNet with Separable Convolutional layers to capture spatial patterns and Self-attention to capture temporal patterns of the data. The HRNet model acts as a backbone and extracts high-resolution features from crop images. Spatially separable convolution in the shallow layers of the HRNet model captures intricate crop patterns more effectively while reducing the computational cost. The multi-head attention mechanism captures long-term temporal dependencies from the encoded vector representation of the images. Finally, a CNN decoder generates a crop map from the aggregated representation. Adaboost is used on top of this to further improve accuracy. The proposed algorithm achieves a high classification accuracy of 97.5\\% and IoU of 55.2\\% in generating crop maps. We evaluate the performance of our pipeline on the Zuericrop dataset and demonstrate that our results outperform state-of-the-art models such as U-Net++, ResNet50, VGG19, InceptionV3, DenseNet, and EfficientNet. This research showcases the potential of Deep Learning for Earth Observation Systems."}}

In each district, the party with maximum votes wins the corresponding \"seat\" in the governing body. The election result is based on the number of seats won by different parties. In this system, locations of voters across the districts may severely affect the election result even if the total number of votes obtained by different parties remains unchanged. A less popular party may win more seats if their supporters are suitably distributed spatially. This happens due to various regional and social influences on individual voters which modulate their voting choice, especially in heterogeneous societies. In this paper, we explore agent-based models for district-based elections, where we consider each voter as an agent, and try to represent their social and geographical attributes and political inclinations using probability distributions. We propose several models which aim to represent one or more of these aspects. These models can be used to simulate election results by Monte Carlo sampling. The models allow us to explore the possible outcomes of an election, and can be calibrated to actual election results for suitable values of parameters obtained by Approximate Bayesian Computation. Our model can reproduce results of elections in India and USA, and also simulate counterfactual scenarios."}}
