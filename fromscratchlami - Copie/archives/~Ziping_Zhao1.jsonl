To enhance its interpretability and predicting performance, many approaches have been developed. Among them, the sparse reduced-rank regression with covariance estimation (SRRRCE) method has been shown to be promising. SRRRCE is powerful, which jointly considers the dimension reduction and variable selection of the regression coefficient, as well as a covariance selection target. In this paper, we will propose a new optimization formulation for SRRRCE by modifying the variable coupling constraint in the existing formulation. For efficient problem solving, a convergent single-loop algorithm based on the block majorization-minimization algorithmic framework is developed. Numerical experiments demonstrate the proposed estimation method possesses better prediction performance and faster convergence speed compared to the existing one."}}

In this paper, we focus on the model parameter estimation of GARCH based on the Gaussian maximum likelihood estimation method. Due to the recursively coupling nature of parameters in GARCH, the optimization problem is highly non-convex. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on the block majorization-minimization algorithmic framework, which can take care of the per-block variable structures for efficient problem solving. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve comparable and even better performance in terms of parameter estimation errors. More importantly, estimated parameters from our algorithm always guarantee a stationary model, which is a desirable property in time series volatility modeling."}}

Numerical simulations with comparison to the benchmark methods demonstrate the computational efficiency and good estimation performance of C-ISTA."}}

The working mechanism behind it, however, remains mysterious. GNN models are designed to learn effective representations for graph-structured data, which intrinsically coincides with the principle of graph signal denoising (GSD). Algorithm unrolling, a \"learning to optimize\" technique, has gained increasing attention due to its prospects in building efficient and interpretable neural network architectures. In this paper, we introduce a class of unrolled networks built based on truncated optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent and proximal gradient descent) for GSD problems. They are shown to be tightly connected to many popular GNN models in that the forward propagations in these GNNs are in fact unrolled networks serving specific GSDs. Besides, the training process of a GNN model can be seen as solving a bilevel optimization problem with a GSD problem at the lower level. Such a connection brings a fresh view of GNNs, as we could try to understand their practical capabilities from their GSD counterparts, and it can also motivate designing new GNN models. Based on the algorithm unrolling perspective, an expressive model named UGDGNN, i.e., unrolled gradient descent GNN, is further proposed which inherits appealing theoretical properties. Extensive numerical simulations on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that UGDGNN can achieve superior or competitive performance over the state-of-the-art models."}}

To tackle the resulting highly nonconvex optimization problem, a problem-tailored low-complexity and globally convergent algorithm based on block minorization-maximization (BMM) is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed BMM approach and the performance improvement gained with multi-hop RISs are both demonstrated through numerical simulations.
