First, it is nontrivial to train a metric-depth prediction model that can generalize well to diverse scenes mainly due to limited training data. Thus, researchers have built large-scale relative depth datasets that are much easier to collect. However, existing relative depth estimation models often fail to recover accurate 3D scene shapes due to the unknown depth shift caused by training with the relative depth data. We tackle this problem here and attempt to estimate accurate scene shapes by training on large-scale relative depth data, and estimating the depth shift. To do so, we propose a two-stage framework that first predicts depth up to an unknown scale and shift from a single monocular image, and then exploits 3D point cloud data to predict the depth shift and the camera's focal length that allow us to recover 3D scene shapes. As the two modules are trained separately, we do not need strictly paired training data. In addition, we propose an image-level normalized regression loss and a normal-based geometry loss to improve training with relative depth annotation. We test our depth model on nine unseen datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot evaluation.

Existing approaches can be categorized into geometry-based and learning-based methods. The former leverages multi-view geometry but can face catastrophic failures due to the reliance on accurate pixel correspondence across views. The latter was proffered to mitigate these issues by learning 2D or 3D representation directly. However, without a large-scale video or 3D training data, it can hardly generalize to diverse real-world scenarios due to the presence of tens of millions or even billions of optimization parameters in the deep network. Recently, robust monocular depth estimation models trained with large-scale datasets have been proven to possess weak 3D geometry prior, but they are insufficient for reconstruction due to the unknown camera parameters, the affine-invariant property, and inter-frame inconsistency. Here, we propose a novel test-time optimization approach that can transfer the robustness of affine-invariant depth models such as LeReS to challenging diverse scenes while ensuring inter-frame consistency, with only dozens of parameters to optimize per video frame. Specifically, our approach involves freezing the pre-trained affine-invariant depth model's depth predictions, rectifying them by optimizing the unknown scale-shift values with a geometric consistency alignment module, and employing the resulting scale-consistent depth maps to robustly obtain camera poses and achieve dense scene reconstruction, even in low-texture regions. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset reconstruction on five zero-shot testing datasets."}}

While traditional depth estimation methods leverage labeled datasets to directly predict absolute depth, recent advancements advocate for mix-dataset training, enhancing generalization across diverse scenes. However, such mixed dataset training yields depth predictions only up to an unknown scale and shift, hindering accurate 3D reconstructions. Existing solutions necessitate extra 3D datasets or geometry-complete depth annotations, constraints that limit their versatility. In this paper, we propose a learning framework that trains models to predict geometry-preserving depth without requiring extra data or annotations. To produce realistic 3D structures, we render novel views of the reconstructed scenes and design loss functions to promote depth estimation consistency across different views. Comprehensive experiments underscore our framework's superior generalization capabilities, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets without leveraging extra training information. Moreover, our innovative loss functions empower the model to autonomously recover domain-specific scale-and-shift coefficients using solely unlabeled images."}}

Due to the ill-posedness of the single-image reconstruction problem, most well-established methods are built upon multi-view geometry. State-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular metric depth estimation methods can only handle a single camera model and are unable to perform mixed-data training due to the metric ambiguity. Meanwhile, SOTA monocular methods trained on large mixed datasets achieve zero-shot generalization by learning affine-invariant depths, which cannot recover real-world metrics. In this work, we show that the key to a zero-shot single-view metric depth model lies in the combination of large-scale data training and resolving the metric ambiguity from various camera models. We propose a canonical camera space transformation module, which explicitly addresses the ambiguity problems and can be effortlessly plugged into existing monocular models. Equipped with our module, monocular models can be stably trained with over 8 million images with thousands of camera models, resulting in zero-shot generalization to in-the-wild images with unseen camera settings. Experiments demonstrate SOTA performance of our method on 7 zero-shot benchmarks. Notably, our method won the championship in the 2nd Monocular Depth Estimation Challenge. Our method enables the accurate recovery of metric 3D structures on randomly collected internet images, paving the way for plausible single-image metrology. The potential benefits extend to downstream tasks, which can be significantly improved by simply plugging in our model. For example, our model relieves the scale drift issues of monocular-SLAM (Fig. 1), leading to high-quality metric scale dense mapping. The code is available at https://github.com/YvanYin/Metric3D."}}

To enable training of deep monocular estimation models with various sources of datasets, state-of-the-art methods adopt image-level normalization strategies to generate affine-invariant depth representations. However, learning with the image-level normalization mainly emphasizes the relations of pixel representations with the global statistic in the images, such as the structure of the scene, while the fine-grained depth difference may be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale depth normalization method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on \nspatial information and depth distributions. Compared with previous normalization strategies applied only at the holistic image level, the proposed hierarchical normalization can effectively preserve the fine-grained details and improve accuracy. We present two strategies that define the hierarchical normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain, respectively. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed normalization strategy remarkably outperforms previous normalization methods, and we set new state-of-the-art on five zero-shot transfer benchmark datasets.

It relies on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, however, that is violated in dynamic object regions and occlusions. Consequently, existing methods show poor accuracy in dynamic scenes, and the estimated depth map is blurred at object boundaries because they are usually occluded in other training views. In this paper, we propose SC-DepthV3 for addressing the challenges. Specifically, we introduce an external pretrained monocular depth estimation model for generating single-image depth prior, namely pseudo-depth, based on which we propose novel losses to boost self-supervised training. As a result, our model can predict sharp and accurate depth maps, even when training from monocular videos of highly-dynamic scenes. We demonstrate the significantly superior performance of our method over previous methods on six challenging datasets, and we provide detailed ablation studies for the proposed terms.

RAC consists of a standard base image encoder fused with a parallel retrieval branch that queries a non-parametric external memory of pre-encoded images and associated text snippets. We apply RAC to the problem of long-tail classification and demonstrate a significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art on Places365-LT and iNaturalist-2018 (14.5% and 6.7% respectively), despite using only the training datasets themselves as the external information source. We demonstrate that RAC's retrieval module, without prompting, learns a high level of accuracy on tail classes. This, in turn, frees the base encoder to focus on common classes, and improve its performance thereon. RAC represents an alternative approach to utilizing large, pretrained models without requiring fine-tuning, as well as a first step towards more effectively making use of external memory within common computer vision architectures."}}

Although recent methods have achieved impressive progress in the evaluation metrics such as the pixel-wise relative error, most methods neglect the geometric constraints in the 3D space. In this work, we show the importance of the high-order 3D geometric constraints for depth prediction. By designing a loss term that enforces a simple geometric constraint, namely, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">virtual normal</i> directions determined by randomly sampled three points in the reconstructed 3D space, we significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of monocular depth estimation. Importantly, the virtual normal loss can not only improve the performance of learning metric depth, but also disentangle the scale information and enrich the model with better shape information. Therefore, when not having access to absolute metric depth training data, we can use virtual normal to learn a robust affine-invariant depth generated on diverse scenes. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results of learning metric depth on NYU Depth-V2 and KITTI. From the high-quality predicted depth, we are now able to recover good 3D structures of the scene such as the point cloud and surface normal directly, eliminating the necessity of relying on additional models as was previously done. To demonstrate the excellent generalization capability of learning affine-invariant depth on diverse data with the virtual normal loss, we construct a large-scale and diverse dataset for training affine-invariant depth, termed Diverse Scene Depth dataset (DiverseDepth), and test on five datasets with the zero-shot test setting.

The core of our framework is a monocular depth estimation module with a strong generalization capability for diverse scenes. It consists of two separate working modes to assist the localization and mapping. With a single monocular image input, the depth estimation module predicts a relative depth to help the localization module on improving the accuracy. With a sparse depth map and an RGB image input, the depth estimation module can generate accurate scale-consistent depth for dense mapping. Compared with current learning-based VO methods, our method demonstrates a stronger generalization ability to diverse scenes. More significantly, our framework is able to boost the performances of existing geometry-based VO methods by a large margin."}}
