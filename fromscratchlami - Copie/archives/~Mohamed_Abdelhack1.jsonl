A ConvNet Classification Task", "abstract": "Blood pressure (BP) increases throughout life, and is controlled by several feedback mechanisms in mammals. Therefore, high resolution BP data may contain information related to the health and functionality of those systems, and the organism as a whole. We used beat-to-beat BP data at different sampling rates collected from a heterogeneous population of rats to predict their age, and achieved 90%+ test accuracy, AUROC, and AUPRC across all sampling rates. Higher frequency components appeared to contribute less to 100 Hz sample rate BP data classification, but nonetheless could point to previously unknown Spectro-temporal patterns that the model identified."}}

This is achieved through interacting bottom-up, recurrent, and top-down pathways that process the visual input in concordance with stored prior information. The interaction mechanism by which they integrate visual input and prior information is still enigmatic. We present a new approach using deep neural network (DNN) representation to reveal the effects of such integration on degraded visual inputs. We transformed measured human brain activity resulting from viewing blurred images to the hierarchical representation space derived from a feedforward DNN. Transformed representations were found to veer toward the original nonblurred image and away from the blurred stimulus image. This indicated deblurring or sharpening in the neural representation, and possibly in our perception. We anticipate these results will help unravel the interplay mechanism between bottom-up, recurrent, and top-down pathways, leading to more comprehensive models of vision."}}

Joining data from multiple origins with unmapped and only partially overlapping features is a prerequisite to developing and testing robust, generalizable algorithms, especially in health care. We approach this issue in the common but difficult case of numeric features such as nearly Gaussian and binary features, where unit changes and variable shift make simple matching of univariate summaries unsuccessful. We develop two novel procedures to address this problem. First, we demonstrate multiple methods of \"fingerprinting\" a feature based on its associations to other features. In the setting of even modest prior information, this allows most shared features to be accurately identified. Second, we demonstrate a deep learning algorithm for translation between databases. Unlike prior approaches, our algorithm takes advantage of discovered mappings while identifying surrogates for unshared features and learning transformations. In synthetic and real-world experiments using two electronic health record databases, our algorithms outperform existing baselines for matching variable sets, while jointly learning to impute unshared or transformed variables."}}

Missing data affects accuracy, calibration, and feature attribution in complex patterns. Developers often train models on carefully curated datasets to minimize missing data bias; however, this reduces the usability of such models in production environments, such as real-time healthcare records. Making machine learning models robust to missing data is therefore crucial for practical application. While some classifiers naturally handle missing data, others, such as deep neural networks, are not designed for unknown values. We propose a novel neural network modification to mitigate the impacts of missing data. The approach is inspired by neuromodulation that is performed by biological neural networks. Our proposal replaces the fixed weights of a fully-connected layer with a function of an additional input (reliability score) at each input, mimicking the ability of cortex to up- and down-weight inputs based on the presence  of other data. The modulation function is jointly learned with the main task using a multi-layer perceptron. We tested our modulating fully connected layer on multiple classification, regression, and imputation problems, and it either improved performance or generated comparable performance to conventional neural network architectures concatenating reliability to the inputs. Models with modulating layers were more robust against degradation of data quality by introducing additional missingness at evaluation time. These results suggest that explicitly accounting for reduced information quality with a modulating fully connected layer can enable the deployment of artificial intelligence systems in real-time settings.\n"}}

Developers often train machine learning models on carefully curated datasets using only high quality data; however, this reduces the utility of such models in production environments. We propose a novel neural network modification to mitigate the impacts of low quality and missing data which involves replacing the fixed weights of a fully-connected layer with a function of an additional input. This is inspired from neuromodulation in biological neural networks where the cortex can up- and down-regulate inputs based on their reliability and the presence of other data. In testing, with reliability scores as a modulating signal, models with modulating layers were found to be more robust against degradation of data quality, including additional missingness. These models are superior to imputation as they save on training time by completely skipping the imputation process and further allow the introduction of other data quality measures that imputation cannot handle. Our results suggest that explicitly accounting for reduced information quality with a modulating fully connected layer can enable the deployment of artificial intelligence systems in real-time applications."}}

We consider a real-life example of risk estimation before surgery and investigate the potential for bias or unfairness of a variety of algorithms. Our approach creates transparent documentation of potential bias so that the users can apply the model carefully. We augment a model-card like analysis using propensity scores with a decision-tree based guide for clinicians that would identify predictable shortcomings of the model. In addition to functioning as a guide for users, we propose that it can guide the algorithm development and informatics team to focus on data sources and structures that can address these shortcomings."}}

The rapid development of computer vision systems could open new horizons to the utilization of satellite data due to the abundance of large volumes of data. However, current state-of-the-art computer vision systems mainly cater to applications that mainly involve natural images. While useful, those images exhibit a different distribution from satellite images in addition to having more spectral channels. This allows the use of pretrained deep learning models only in a subset of spectral channels that are equivalent to natural images thus discarding valuable information from other spectral channels. This calls for research effort to optimize deep learning models for satellite imagery to enable the assessment of their utility in the domain of remote sensing. Tensorflow tool allows for rapid prototyping and testing of deep learning models, however, its built-in image generator is designed to handle a maximum of four spectral channels. This manuscript introduces an open-source tool that allows the implementation of image augmentation for hyperspectral images in Tensorflow. Given how accessible and easy-to-use Tensorflow is, this tool would provide many researchers with the means to implement, test, and deploy deep learning models for remote sensing applications."}}
