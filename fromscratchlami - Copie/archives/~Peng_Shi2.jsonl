We propose Binder, a training-free neural-symbolic framework that maps the task input to a program, which (1) allows binding a unified API of language model (LM) functionalities to a programming language (e.g., SQL, Python) to extend its grammar coverage and thus tackle more diverse questions, (2) adopts an LM as both the program parser and the underlying model called by the API during execution, and (3) requires only a few in-context exemplar annotations. Specifically, we employ GPT-3 Codex as the LM. In the parsing stage, with only a few in-context exemplars, Codex is able to identify the part of the task input that cannot be answerable by the original programming language, correctly generate API calls to prompt Codex to solve the unanswerable part, and identify where to place the API calls while being compatible with the original grammar. In the execution stage, Codex can perform versatile functionalities (e.g., commonsense QA, information extraction) given proper prompts in the API calls. Binder achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets, with explicit output programs that benefit human debugging. Note that previous best systems are all finetuned on tens of thousands of task-specific samples, while Binder only uses dozens of annotations as in-context exemplars without any training.

However, based on a pilot study, we observe three issues of existing general-purpose language models when they are applied to text-to-SQL semantic parsers: fail to detect column mentions in the utterances, fail to infer column mentions from cell values, and fail to compose complex SQL queries. To mitigate these issues, we present a model pre-training framework, Generation-Augmented Pre-training (GAP), that jointly learns representations of natural language utterances and table schemas by leveraging generation models to generate pre-train data. GAP MODEL is trained on 2M utterance-schema pairs and 30K utterance-schema-SQL triples, whose utterances are produced by generative models. Based on experimental results, neural semantic parsers that leverage GAP MODEL as a representation encoder obtain new state-of-the-art results on both SPIDER and CRITERIA-TO-SQL benchmarks."}}

However, most of the existing work focus on questions that can be answered with short-form answer, ie the answer is often a table cell or aggregation of multiple cells. This can mismatch with the intents of users who want to ask more complex questions that require free-form answers such as explanations. To bridge the gap, most recently, pre-trained sequence-tosequence language models such as T5 are used for generating free-form answers based on the question and table inputs. However, these pre-trained language models have weaker encoding abilities over table cells and schema. To mitigate this issue, in this work, we present an intermediate pre-training framework, Generation-focused Table-based Intermediate Pre-training (GENTAP), that jointly learns representations of natural language questions and tables. GENTAP learns to generate via two training objectives to enhance the question understanding and table representation abilities for complex questions. Based on experimental results, models that leverage GENTAP framework outperform the existing baselines on FETAQA benchmark. The pre-trained models are not only useful for free-form question answering, but also for few-shot data-to-text generation task, thus showing good transfer ability by obtaining new state-of-the-art results."}}

This is challenging due to two reasons: (1) the complex and intensive inner logic with the data scarcity constraint, (2) the lack of automatic evaluation metrics for logic consistency. To address these two challenges, this paper first proposes SNOWBALL, a framework for logic consistent text generation from semantic parses that employs an iterative training procedure by recursively augmenting the training set with quality control. Second, we propose a novel automatic metric, BLEC, for evaluating the logical consistency between the semantic parses and generated texts. The experimental results on two benchmark datasets, Logic2Text and Spider, demonstrate the SNOWBALL framework enhances the logic consistency on both BLEC and human evaluation. Furthermore, our statistical analysis reveals that BLEC is more logically consistent with human evaluation than general-purpose automatic metrics including BLEU, ROUGE and, BLEURT.

Nearly all state-of-the-art language models and pre-trained language models are based on the Transformer architecture. However, it distinguishes sequential tokens only with the token position index. We hypothesize that better contextual representations can be generated from the Transformer with richer positional information. To verify this, we propose a segment-aware Transformer (Segatron), by replacing the original token position encoding with a combined position encoding of paragraph, sentence, and token. We first introduce the segment-aware mechanism to Transformer-XL, which is a popular Transformer-based language model with memory extension and relative position encoding. We find that our method can further improve the Transformer-XL base model and large model, achieving 17.1 perplexity on the WikiText-103 dataset. We further investigate the pre-training masked language modeling task with Segatron. Experimental results show that BERT pre-trained with Segatron (SegaBERT) can outperform BERT with vanilla Transformer on various NLP tasks, and outperforms RoBERTa on zero-shot sentence representation learning.

To build a smarter natural language interface to database systems (NLIDB) that also processes incomplete questions, we propose a new task, prefix-to-SQL which takes question prefix from users as the input and predicts the intended SQL. We construct a new benchmark called PAGSAS that contains 124K user question prefixes and the intended SQL for 5 sub-tasks Advising, GeoQuery, Scholar, ATIS, and Spider. Additionally, we propose a new metric SAVE to measure how much effort can be saved by users. Experimental results show that PAGSAS is challenging even for strong baseline models such as T5. As we observe the difficulty of prefix-to-SQL is related to the number of omitted tokens, we incorporate curriculum learning of feeding examples with an increasing number of omitted tokens. This improves scores on various sub-tasks by as much as 9% recall scores on sub-task GeoQuery in PAGSAS."}}

As a starting point, we provide zero-shot baselines for this new dataset based on a multi-lingual adaptation of DPR that we call \"mDPR\". Experiments show that although the effectiveness of mDPR is much lower than BM25, dense representations nevertheless appear to provide valuable relevance signals, improving BM25 results in sparse-dense hybrids. In addition to analyses of our results, we also discuss future challenges and present a research agenda in multi-lingual dense retrieval.

Furthermore, we propose two value filling methods to build the bridge from the existing zero-shot semantic parsers to real-world applications, considering most of the existing parsers ignore the values filling in the synthesized SQL.

Also, we find that weakly-supervised target language transfer yields competitive performances against the generation-based target language transfer that requires external translators and query generators."}}
