To this date, there exists no method for the general-purpose design of proteins without any prior knowledge about the protein of interest, such as costly and rare structure information or seed sequence fragments. However, the Gene Ontology (GO) database provides information about the hierarchical organisation of protein functions, and thus could inform generative models about the underlying complex sequence-function relationships, replacing the need for structural data. We therefore propose to use conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) on the task of fast de novo hierarchical multi-label protein design. We generate protein sequences exhibiting properties of a large set of molecular functions extracted from the GO database, using a single model and without any prior information. We shed light on efficient conditioning mechanisms and adapted network architectures thanks to a thorough hyperparameter selection process and analysis. We further provide statistically- and biologically-driven evaluation measures for generative models in the context of protein design to assess the quality of the generated sequences and facilitate progress in the field. We show that our proposed model, ProteoGAN, outperforms several baselines when designing proteins given a functional label and generates well-formed sequences."}}

This article presents combinatorial association mapping (CASMAP), a software package that leverages recent advances in significant pattern mining to overcome the statistical and computational challenges that have hindered combinatorial association mapping. CASMAP can be used to perform region-based association studies and to detect higher-order epistatic interactions of genetic variants. Most importantly, unlike other existing significant pattern mining-based tools, CASMAP allows for the correction of categorical covariates such as age or gender, making it suitable for genome-wide association studies."}}

Moreover \u2013 and in contrast with other methods \u2013 the hierarchical nature of hyperbolic space allows us to learn highly efficient representations and to improve the taxonomic consistency of the inferred hierarchies.

The recently introduced algorithm Fast Automatic Interval Search (FAIS) enables the genome-wide search of candidate regions for genetic heterogeneity in the form of any contiguous sequence of variants, and achieves high computational efficiency and statistical power. Although FAIS can test all possible genomic regions for association with a phenotype, a key limitation is its inability to correct for confounders such as gender or population structure, which may lead to numerous false-positive associations."}}

The target patterns are statistically significantly enriched in one of two classes of objects. Our method corrects for multiple hypothesis testing and correlations between patterns via the Westfall-Young permutation procedure, which empirically estimates the null distribution of pattern frequencies in each class via permutations. In our experiments, Westfall-Young light dramatically outperforms the current state-of-the-art approach, both in terms of runtime and memory efficiency on popular real-world benchmark datasets for pattern mining. The key to this efficiency is that, unlike all existing methods, our algorithm does not need to solve the underlying frequent pattern mining problem anew for each permutation and does not need to store the occurrence list of all frequent patterns. Westfall-Young light opens the door to significant pattern mining on large datasets that previously involved prohibitive runtime or memory costs.

Recently, the concept of testability was proposed as one approach to correct for multiple testing in pattern mining while retaining statistical power. Still, these strategies based on testability do not allow one to condition the test of significance on the observed covariates, which severely limits its utility in biomedical applications. Here we propose a strategy and an efficient algorithm to perform significant pattern mining in the presence of categorical covariates with K states."}}
