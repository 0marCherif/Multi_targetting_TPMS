This indicates that there are certain correlations between font shapes and their impressions. To understand the correlations, this paper realizes a shared latent space where a font and its impressions are embedded nearby. The difficulty is that the impression words attached to a font are often very noisy. This is because impression words are very subjective and diverse. More importantly, some impression words have no direct relevance to the font shapes and will disturb the realization of the shared latent space. We, therefore, use DeepSets for enhancing shape-relevant words and suppressing shape irrelevant words automatically while training the shared latent space. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results with a large-scale font-impression dataset demonstrate that the shared latent space by the proposed method describes the correlation appropriately, especially for the shape-relevant impression words."}}

Abstract For signature verification systems, micro deformations can be defined as the small differences in the same strokes of signatures or special writing habits of different signers. These micro deformations can reveal the core distinction between the genuine signatures and skilled forgeries. In this paper, we prove that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have the potential to extract those micro deformations by max-pooling. More specifically, the micro deformations can be determined by watching the location coordinates of the maximum values in pooling windows of max-pooling. Extensive analysis and experiments demonstrate that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance by using this location information as a new feature for capturing micro deformations, along with convolutional features. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on four publicly available datasets of different languages, i.e., English (GPDSsynthetic, CEDAR), Persian (UTSig), and Hindi (BHSig260)."}}

In addition, it needs to be an appropriate font for the rest of the book cover. Thus, we propose a method of generating a book title image based on its context within a book cover. We propose an end-to-end neural network that inputs the book cover, a target location mask, and a desired book title and outputs stylized text suitable for the cover. The proposed network uses a combination of a multi-input encoder-decoder, a text skeleton prediction network, a perception network, and an adversarial discriminator. We demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively produce desirable and appropriate book cover text through quantitative and qualitative results."}}

However, most of existing image-based person re-identification methods neglect the spatial and temporal constraint, the information in neighbor frames of each person image is rarely exploited by previous studies. In this paper, we propose a novel neighbor frames mining framework (NFM) to exploit the spatial-temporal information. For each gallery image, we use a dynamic programming-based global optimal tracking method to search images of the same person in its neighbor frames. From those images, the image features extracted by the shared convolutional neural network (CNN) in the constructed neighbor sequence are merged via an attention weighted averaging technology. To this end, a novel supervised attention mechanism is designed for dealing with tracking errors. The final feature with multi-view and robust information is used for matching. Experimental results show the superiority and efficiency of the proposed method on two benchmark datasets including DukeMTMC-reID and PRW."}}

This paper aims to analyze the correlation between the local shapes, or parts, and the impression of fonts. By focusing on local shapes instead of the whole letter shape, we can realize more general analysis independent from letter shapes. The analysis is performed by newly combining SIFT and DeepSets, to extract an arbitrary number of essential parts from a particular font and aggregate them to infer the font impressions by nonlinear regression. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses prove that (1)\u00a0fonts with similar parts have similar impressions, (2)\u00a0many impressions, such as legible and rough, largely depend on specific parts, and (3)\u00a0several impressions are very irrelevant to parts."}}

This paper proposes a novel neural network-based approach for robust yet discriminative time series classification and verification. This approach adapts a parameterized attention model to time warping for greater and more adaptive temporal invariance. It is robust against not only local but also large global distortions, so that even matching pairs that do not satisfy the monotonicity, continuity, and boundary conditions can still be successfully identified. Learning of this model is further guided by dynamic time warping to impose temporal constraints for stabilized training and higher discriminative power. It can learn to augment the inter-class variation through warping, so that similar but different classes can be effectively distinguished. We experimentally demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over previous non-parametric and deep models by combining it with a deep online signature verification framework, after confirming its promising behavior in single-letter handwriting classification on the Unipen dataset."}}

In order to take advantage of the complementary information from the different modalities, the self-augmented multi-modal feature embedding employs a shared feature space. Through experimental results on classification with online handwriting and leaf images, we demonstrate that the proposed method can create effective embeddings."}}
