Nearly all existing BART models rely on decision tree weak learners with axis-parallel univariate split rules to partition the Euclidean feature space into rectangular regions. In practice, however, many regression problems involve features with multivariate structures (e.g., spatial locations) possibly lying in a manifold, where rectangular partitions may fail to respect irregular intrinsic geometry and boundary con- straints of the structured feature space. In this paper, we develop a new class of Bayesian additive multivariate decision tree models that combine univariate split rules for handling possibly high dimensional features without known multivariate structures and novel multivariate split rules for features with multivariate structures in each weak learner. The proposed multivariate split rules are built upon stochastic predictive spanning tree bi- partition models on reference knots, which are ca- pable of achieving highly flexible nonlinear deci- sion boundaries on manifold feature spaces while enabling efficient dimension reduction computa- tions. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method using simulation data and a Sacramento housing price data set."}}

Cell phone mobility data provide unique and rich information on studying this impact. The motivating dataset of this study is the daily leaving-home index data at Harris County in Texas provided by SafeGraph. To study changes in daily leaving-home index and how they relate to public policy and sociodemographic variables, we propose a new Bayesian wavelet model for modeling and clustering spatial functional data, where domain partitioning is achieved by operating on the spanning trees. The resulting clusters can have arbitrary shapes and are spatially contiguous in the input domain. An efficient tailored reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed to implement the model. The method is applied to the spatial functional data of the daily percentages of people who left home. We focus on the time period covering both lockdown and phased reopening in Texas during the COVID-19 pandemic and study the changing behaviors of those functional curves. By linking the clustering results with the sociodemographic information, we identify several covariates of census blocks that have a noticeable impact on the clustering patterns of people\u2019s mobility behaviors."}}

The proposed method guarantees contiguity in clustering and allows to detect clusters with arbitrary shapes and sizes, whereas most existing partition models such as binary trees and Voronoi tessellations do not possess such properties. We embed this partition model within a hierarchical modeling framework to detect a clus- tered pattern in latent variables. We focus on illustrating the method through a clustered regression coefficient model for spatial data and propose extensions to other hierarchical models. We prove Bayesian posterior concentration results under an asymptotic frame- work with random graphs. We design an efficient collapsed Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC) algorithm to estimate the clustered coefficient values and their uncertainty measures. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the model with simulation studies and a real data analysis of detecting the temperature-salinity relationship from water masses in the Atlantic Ocean."}}

Although MTM has gained great popularity owing to its faster empirical convergence and mixing than the standard MH algorithm, its theoretical mixing property is rarely studied in the literature due to its complex proposal scheme. We prove that MTM can achieve a mixing time bound smaller than that of MH by a factor of the number of trials under a general setting applicable to high-dimensional model selection problems with discrete state spaces. Our theoretical results motivate a new class of weight functions called locally balanced weight functions and guide the choice of the number of trials, which leads to improved performance over standard MTM algorithms. We support our theoretical results by extensive simulation studies and real data applications with several Bayesian model selection problems."}}

This article proposes a Bayesian additive regression spanning trees (BAST) model for nonparametric regression on manifolds, with an emphasis on complex constrained domains or irregularly shaped spaces embedded in Euclidean spaces. Our model is built upon a random spanning tree manifold partition model as each weak learner, which is capable of capturing any irregularly shaped spatially contiguous partitions while respecting intrinsic geometries and domain boundary constraints. Utilizing many nice properties of spanning tree structures, we design an efficient Bayesian inference algorithm. Equipped with a soft prediction scheme, BAST is demonstrated to significantly outperform other competing methods in simulation experiments and in an application to the chlorophyll data in Aral Sea, due to its strong local adaptivity to different levels of smoothness.

In models dealing with graph-structured data, multivariate parameters may not only exhibit sparse patterns but have structured sparsity and smoothness in the sense that both zero and non-zero parameters tend to cluster together. We propose a new prior for high-dimensional parameters with graphical relations, referred to as the Tree-based Low-rank Horseshoe (T-LoHo) model, that generalizes the popular univariate Bayesian horseshoe shrinkage prior to the multivariate setting to detect structured sparsity and smoothness simultaneously. The T-LoHo prior can be embedded in many high-dimensional hierarchical models. To illustrate its utility, we apply it to regularize a Bayesian high-dimensional regression problem where the regression coefficients are linked by a graph, so that the resulting clusters have flexible shapes and satisfy the cluster contiguity constraint with respect to the graph. We design an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that delivers full Bayesian inference with uncertainty measures for model parameters such as the number of clusters. We offer theoretical investigations of the clustering effects and posterior concentration results. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the model with simulation studies and a real data application for anomaly detection on a road network. The results indicate substantial improvements over other competing methods such as the sparse fused lasso."}}
