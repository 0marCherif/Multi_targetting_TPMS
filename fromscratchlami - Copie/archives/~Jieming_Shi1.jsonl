In the representative IMC We Chat, cybercriminals deceive frauds, causing financial loss to normal users. Through statistical analysis, we find that certain fraud interactions commonly occur among WeChat users who are not k-hop neighbors. Therefore, efficiently answering whether the distance between two vertices is not longer than k at a certain time point (i.e., k-hop reachability queries) over the dynamic social graph of WeChat becomes a crucial task for fraud feature extraction in the detection system: it can help human experts quickly identify suspicious user interactions and the query results can be further used as the input feature to the downstream machine learning based detection methods. In this paper, we illustrate Bidirectional k-hop Reachability Query Processing over a Dynamic Graph (BREAD) that is used in WeChat for extracting the k-hop reachability feature for fraud detection. BREAD adopts the idea of estimating Personalized PageRank value. It first conducts the backward search from the destination vertex to construct an intermediate vertex set. Then, it performs a certain amount of random walks from the start vertex to see whether they can hit the intermediate vertex set, and the results are returned to answer k-hop reachability queries. We further propose <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{BREAD}++$</tex> that leverages the massive parallel processing power of GPU to achieve a considerable performance gain. Experiments on several large-scale dynamic graph benchmarks and the social graph of WeChat have demonstrated that <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{BREAD}/\\text{BREAD}++$</tex> is superior than existing index-free competitors: our methods provide not only fast but also accurate responses and they are of practical value to k-hop reachability feature extraction in the fraud detection system of WeChat.

Effective BNE should preserve not only the direct connections between nodes but also the multi-hop relationships formed alternately by the two types of nodes in G, which can incur prohibitive overheads, especially on massive bipartite graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges. Existing solutions are hardly scalable to massive bipartite graphs, and often produce low-quality results. This paper proposes GEBE, a generic BNE framework achieving state-of-the-art performance on massive bipartite graphs, via four main algorithmic designs. First, we present two generic measures to capture the multi-hop similarity/proximity between homogeneous/heterogeneous nodes respectively, and the measures can be instantiated with three popular probability distributions, including Poisson, Geometric, and Uniform distributions. Second, GEBE formulates a novel and unified BNE objective to preserve the two measures of all possible node pairs. Third, GEBE includes several efficiency designs to get high-quality embeddings on massive graphs. Finally, we observe that GEBE achieves the best performance when instantiating MHS and MHP using a Poisson distribution, and thus, we further develop GEBEp based on Poisson-instantiated MHS and MHP, with non-trivial efficiency optimizations. Extensive experiments, comparing 15 competitors on 10 real datasets, demonstrate that our solutions, especially GEBEp, obtain superior result utility than all competitors for top-N recommendation and link prediction, while being up to orders of magnitude faster."}}

Recent advances in the study of Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) have shed some light on how to leverage heterogeneous information in RS. However, existing HIN-based recommendation models assume HIN is invariable and merely use HIN as a data source for assisting recommendation, which limits their performance. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning framework, called MTRec, for recommendation over HIN. MTRec relies on self-attention mechanism to learn the semantics of meta-paths in HIN and jointly optimizes the tasks of both recommendation and link prediction. Using a Bayesian task weight learner, MTRec is able to achieve the balance of two tasks during optimization automatically. Moreover, MTRec provides good interpretabilities of recommendation through a \u201ctranslation\u201d mechanism which is used to model the three-way interactions among users, items and the meta-paths connecting them. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MTRec over state-of-the-art HIN-based recommendation models, and the case studies we provide illustrate that MTRec enhances the explainability of RS."}}

This paper proposes PANE, an effective and scalable approach to ANE computation for massive graphs in a single server that achieves state-of-the-art result quality on multiple benchmark datasets for two common prediction tasks: link prediction and node classification. Under the hood, PANE takes inspiration from well-established data management techniques to scale up ANE in a single server. Specifically, it exploits a carefully formulated problem based on a novel random walk model, a highly efficient solver, and non-trivial parallelization by utilizing modern multi-core CPUs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANE consistently outperforms all existing methods in terms of result quality, while being orders of magnitude faster."}}

Traditional search methods are based on filtering conditions, burdening users to specify their requirements. This paper focuses on spatial search via examples. Particularly, the user can specify an example, which is a set of objects of interest, and the purpose is to find a list of results, each containing a set of objects with similar properties to the given example. We conducted a user study, showing that a search interface based on examples can effectively complement existing approaches. However, the existing example-based search is not scalable, hindering its applications to larger datasets. To address this challenge, we propose two new algorithms, namely HSP and LORA, to efficiently answer example-based spatial queries. HSP is an algorithm based on a hierarchical partitioning of the search space, and it achieves up to 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. LORA further improves the efficiency, running up to 5000 times faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. We present a systematic evaluation to demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning based solution called RL4OASD, which avoids all aforementioned issues of existing approaches. RL4OASD involves two networks, one responsible for learning features of road networks and trajectories and the other responsible for detecting anomalous subtrajectories based on the learned features, and the two networks can be trained iteratively without labeled data. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets, and the results show that our solution can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods (with 20-30% improvement) and is efficient for online detection (it takes less than 0.1ms to process each newly generated data point)."}}

However, under extreme cases when very few labels are available (e.g., 1 labeled node per class), GNNs suffer from severe result quality degradation. \nSpecifically, we observe that existing GNNs suffer from unstable training process on few-labeled graph data, resulting to inferior performance on node classification. Therefore, we propose an effective framework, Stabilized self-training with Negative sampling (SN), which is applicable to existing GNNs to stabilize the training process and enhance the training data, and consequently, boost classification accuracy on graphs with few labeled data. In experiments, we apply our SN framework to two existing GNN base models (GCN and DAGNN) to get SNGCN and SNDAGNN, and evaluate the two methods against 13 existing solutions over 4 benchmarking datasets. Extensive experiments show that the proposed SN framework is highly effective compared with existing solutions, especially under settings with very few labeled data. In particular, on a benchmark dataset Cora with only 1 labeled node per class, while GCN only has 44.6% accuracy, SNGCN achieves 62.5% accuracy, improving GCN by 17.9%; SNDAGNN has accuracy 66.4%, improving that of the base model DAGNN (59.8%) by 6.6%."}}

The main contributions of are twofold: (i) a novel formulation of the k-AGC problem based on an attributed multi-hop conductance quality measure custom-made for this problem setting, which effectively captures cluster coherence in terms of both topological proximities and attribute similarities, and (ii) a linear-time optimization solver that obtains high quality clusters iteratively, based on efficient matrix operations such as orthogonal iterations, an alternative optimization approach, as well as an initialization technique that significantly speeds up the convergence of in practice.
