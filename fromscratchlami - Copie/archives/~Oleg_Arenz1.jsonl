The two currently most effective methods for GMM-based variational inference, VIPS and iBayes-GMM, both employ independent natural gradient updates for the individual components and their weights. We show for the first time, that their derived updates are equivalent, although their practical implementations and theoretical guarantees differ. We identify several design choices that distinguish both approaches, namely with respect to sample selection, natural gradient estimation, stepsize adaptation, and whether trust regions are enforced or the number of components adapted. We argue that for both approaches, the quality of the learned approximations can heavily suffer from the respective design choices: By updating the individual components using samples from the mixture model, iBayes-GMM often fails to produce meaningful updates to low-weight components, and by using a zero-order method for estimating the natural gradient, VIPS scales badly to higher-dimensional problems. Furthermore, we show that information-geometric trust-regions (used by VIPS) are effective even when using first-order natural gradient estimates, and often outperform the improved Bayesian learning rule (iBLR) update used by iBayes-GMM. We systematically evaluate the effects of design choices and show that a hybrid approach significantly outperforms both prior works. Along with this work, we publish our highly modular and efficient implementation for natural gradient variational inference with Gaussian mixture models, which supports 432 different combinations of design choices, facilitates the reproduction of all our experiments, and may prove valuable for the practitioner."}}

Recent works based on state-visitation counts, curiosity and entropy-maximization generate intrinsic reward signals to motivate the agent to visit novel states for exploration. However, the agent can get distracted by perturbations to sensor inputs that contain novel but task-irrelevant information, e.g. due to sensor noise or changing background. In this work, we introduce the sequential information bottleneck objective for learning compressed and temporally coherent representations by modelling and compressing sequential predictive information in time-series observations. For efficient exploration in noisy environments, we further construct intrinsic rewards that capture task-relevant state novelty based on the learned representations. We derive a variational upper bound of our sequential information bottleneck objective for practical optimization and provide an information-theoretic interpretation of the derived upper bound. Our experiments on a set of challenging image-based simulated control tasks show that our method achieves better sample efficiency, and robustness to both white noise and natural video backgrounds compared to state-of-art methods based on curiosity, entropy maximization and information-gain."}}

Moreover, it was recently shown, that the problem of variational inference with Gaussian mixture models can be reduced to Gaussian variational inference using VIPS, which is a procedure similar to expectation maximization. Effective approaches for Gaussian variational inference are MORE, VOGN, and VON, which are zero-order, first-order, and second-order, respectively. We focus on the first-order setting, which is arguably the most relevant for variational inference, and show that the biases added by the generalized Gau\u00df-Newton approximation, which is applied by VOGN, can seriously affect the quality of the learned approximation. Hence, we propose gMORE, a method that is similar to MORE but differs by incorporating gradient information. GradientMORE achieves unbiased high-quality approximations of the Hessian that are similar to VON which has direct access to the Hessian. Our algorithm converges even in settings where VOGN does not converge. Compared to MORE, the additional information improves sample efficiency by about an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we evaluate the different approaches in the GMM setting by modifying VIPS, which has previously only been tested in combination with MORE, and show that the results from the GVA setting are transferable to GMMs, setting a new standard for GMM-based variational inference."}}

However, most robotic RL relies on a well known initial state distribution. In real-world tasks, this information is however often not available. For example, when disentangling waste objects the actual position of the robot w.r.t.\\ the objects may not match the positions the RL policy was trained for. To solve this problem, we present a novel adversarial reinforcement learning (ARL) framework. The ARL framework utilizes an adversary, which is trained to steer the original agent, the protagonist, to challenging states. We train the protagonist and the adversary jointly to allow them to adapt to the changing policy of their opponent. We show that our method can generalize from training to test scenarios by training an end-to-end system for robot control to solve a challenging object disentangling task. Experiments with a KUKA LBR+ 7-DOF robot arm show that our approach outperforms the baseline method in disentangling when starting from different initial states than provided during training. "}}

Often there are no object models, and, especially with cluttered irregularly shaped objects, the robot can not create a model of the scene due to occlusion. One of our key insights is that based on previous sensory input we are only interested in moving an object out of the disentanglement around obstacles. That is, we only need to know where the robot can successfully move in order to plan the disentangling. Due to the uncertainty we integrate information about blocked movements into a probability map. The map defines the probability of the robot successfully moving to a specific configuration. Using as cost the failure probability of a sequence of movements we can then plan and execute disentangling iteratively. Since our approach circumvents only previously encountered obstacles, new movements will yield information about unknown obstacles that block movement until the robot has learned to circumvent all obstacles and disentangling succeeds. In the experiments, we use a special probabilistic version of the Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for planning and demonstrate successful disentanglement of objects both in 2-D and 3-D simulation, and, on a KUKA LBR 7-DOF robot. Moreover, our approach outperforms baseline methods."}}
