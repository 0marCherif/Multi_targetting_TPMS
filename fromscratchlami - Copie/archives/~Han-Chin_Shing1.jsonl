However, it can also be a barrier, as the relevant information is often buried in the sheer amount of personal data, and healthcare professionals already lack time to take care of both patients and their data. This dissertation focuses on the role of natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare and how it can surface information relevant to healthcare professionals by modeling the extensive collections of documents that describe those whom they serve. In this dissertation, the extensive natural language data about a person is modeled as a set of documents, where the model inference is at the level of the individual, but evidence supporting that inference is found in a subset of their documents. The effectiveness of this modeling approach is demonstrated in the context of three healthcare applications. In the first application, clinical coding, document-level attention is used to model the hierarchy between a clinical encounter and its documents, jointly learning the encounter labels and the assignment of credits to specific documents. The second application, suicidality assessment using social media, further investigates how document-level attention can surface \"high-signal\" posts from the document set representing a potentially at-risk individual. Finally, the third application aims to help healthcare professionals write discharge summaries using an extract-then-abstract multidocument summarization pipeline to surface relevant information. As in many healthcare applications, these three applications seek to assist, not replace, clinicians. Evaluation and model design thus centers around healthcare professionals' needs. In clinical coding, document-level attention is shown to align well with professional clinical coders' expectations of evidence. In suicidality assessment, document-level attention leads to better and more time-efficient assessment by surfacing document-level evidence, shown empirically using a theoretically grounded time-aware evaluation measure and a dataset annotated by suicidality experts. Finally, extract-then-abstract summarization pipelines that assist healthcare professionals in writing discharge summaries are evaluated by their ability to surface faithful and relevant evidence."}}

This paper introduces the task of generating discharge summaries for a clinical encounter. Summaries in this setting need to be faithful, traceable, and scale to multiple long documents, motivating the use of extract-then-abstract summarization cascades. We introduce two new measures, faithfulness and hallucination rate for evaluation in this task, which complement existing measures for fluency and informativeness. Results across seven medical sections and five models show that a summarization architecture that supports traceability yields promising results, and that a sentence-rewriting approach performs consistently on the measure used for faithfulness (faithfulness-adjusted $F_3$) over a diverse range of generated sections."}}

In contrast, set-based retrieval tasks call for a technique to combine results in ways that require decisions on whether each document is in or out of the result set. This paper presents a set-generating unsupervised system combination framework that draws inspiration from evaluation techniques in sparse data settings. It argues for the existence of a duality between evaluation and system combination, and then capitalizes on this duality to perform unsupervised system combination. To do this, the framework relies on the consensus of the systems to estimate latent \u201cgoodness\u201d for each system. An implementation of this framework using data programming is compared to other unsupervised system combination approaches to demonstrate its effectiveness on CLEF and MATERIAL collections."}}

We introduce encounter-level document attention networks, which use hierarchical attention to explicitly take the hierarchical structure of encounter documentation into account. Experimental evaluation demonstrates improvements in coding accuracy as well as facilitation of human reviewers in their ability to identify which documents within an encounter play a role in determining the encounter level codes."}}
