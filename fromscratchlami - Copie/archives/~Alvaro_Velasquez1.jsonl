These guarantees are specified as part of the problem description and can be supplied by the end user in the form of various logics (e.g., Linear Temporal Logic and Computation Tree Logic) or imposed via constraints on agent-environment interactions. The latter has received significant attention in recent years within the context of constraints on the asymptotic frequency with which an agent visits states of interest. This is captured by the steady-state distribution of the agent. The formal synthesis of stochastic policies satisfying constraints on this distribution has been studied. However, the derivation of deterministic policies for the same has received little attention. In this paper, we focus on this deterministic steady-state control problem, i.e., the problem of obtaining a deterministic policy for optimal expected-reward behavior in the presence of linear constraints representing the desired steady-state behavior. Two integer linear programs are proposed and validated experimentally to solve this problem in unichain and multichain Markov decision processes. Finally, we prove that this problem is NP-hard even in the restricted setting where deterministic transitions are enforced on the MDP and there are only two actions."}}

However, the robustness of such networks has heretofore not been explored. This is particularly relevant given the broad social implications of such technologies and the fact that biologically small perturbations in the protein sequence do not generally lead to drastic changes in the protein structure. In this paper, we demonstrate that AlphaFold does not exhibit such robustness despite its high accuracy. This raises the challenge of detecting and quantifying the extent to which these predicted protein structures can be trusted. To measure the robustness of the predicted structures, we utilize (i) the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and (ii) the Global Distance Test (GDT) similarity measure between the predicted structure of the original sequence and the structure of its adversarially perturbed version. We prove that the problem of minimally perturbing protein sequences to fool protein folding neural networks is NP-complete. Based on the well-established BLOSUM62 sequence alignment scoring matrix, we generate adversarial protein sequences and show that the RMSD between the predicted protein structure and the structure of the original sequence are very large when the adversarial changes are bounded by (i) 20 units in the BLOSUM62 distance, and (ii) five residues (out of hundreds or thousands of residues) in the given protein sequence. In our experimental evaluation, we consider 111 COVID-19 proteins in the Universal Protein resource (UniProt), a central resource for protein data managed by the European Bioinformatics Institute, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, and the US Protein Information Resource. These result in an overall GDT similarity test score average of around 34%, demonstrating a substantial drop in the performance of AlphaFold."}}

Recently, approaches that automatically generate reward functions from logical task specifications have been proposed to mitigate this issue; however, they scale poorly on long-horizon tasks (i.e., tasks where the agent needs to perform a series of correct actions to reach the goal state, considering future transitions while choosing an action). Employing a curriculum (a sequence of increasingly complex tasks) further improves the learning speed of the agent by sequencing intermediate tasks suited to the learning capacity of the agent. However, generating curricula from the logical specification still remains an unsolved problem. To this end, we propose AGCL, Automaton-guided Curriculum Learning, a novel method for automatically generating curricula for the target task in the form of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). AGCL encodes the specification in the form of a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and then uses the DFA along with the Object-Oriented MDP (OOMDP) representation to generate a curriculum as a DAG, where the vertices correspond to tasks, and edges correspond to the direction of knowledge transfer. Experiments in gridworld and physics-based simulated robotics domains show that the curricula produced by AGCL achieve improved time-to-threshold performance on a complex sequential decision-making problem relative to state-of-the-art curriculum learning (e.g, teacher-student, self-play) and automaton-guided reinforcement learning baselines (e.g, Q-Learning for Reward Machines). Further, we demonstrate that AGCL performs well even in the presence of noise in the task's OOMDP description, and also when distractor objects are present that are not modeled in the logical specification of the tasks' objectives."}}

In this paper, firstly, we use the gradient class activation map (GradCAM) to analyze the behavior deviation of the VGG-16 network when its inputs are mixed with adversarial perturbation or Gaussian noise. In particular, our method can locate vulnerable layers that are sensitive to adversarial perturbation and Gaussian noise. We also show that the behavior deviation of vulnerable layers can be used to detect adversarial examples. Secondly, we propose a novel NoiseCAM algorithm that integrates information from globally and pixel-level weighted class activation maps. Our algorithm is susceptible to adversarial perturbations and will not respond to Gaussian random noise mixed in the inputs. Third, we compare detecting adversarial examples using both behavior deviation and NoiseCAM, and we show that NoiseCAM outperforms behavior deviation modeling in its overall performance. Our work could provide a useful tool to defend against certain adversarial attacks on deep neural networks."}}

Consequently, it is of great significance to ensure the robustness of these methods and thus counteract uncertain behaviors caused by adversarial attacks. In this paper, we use gradient heatmaps to analyze the response characteristics of the VGG-16 model when the input images are mixed with adversarial noise and statistically similar Gaussian random noise. In particular, we compare the network response layer by layer to determine where errors occurred. Several interesting findings are derived. First, compared to Gaussian random noise, intentionally generated adversarial noise causes severe behavior deviation by distracting the area of concentration in the networks. Second, in many cases, adversarial examples only need to compromise a few intermediate blocks to mislead the final decision. Third, our experiments revealed that specific blocks are more vulnerable and easier to exploit by adversarial examples. Finally, we demonstrate that the layers $Block4\\_conv1$ and $Block5\\_cov1$ of the VGG-16 model are more susceptible to adversarial attacks. Our work could provide valuable insights into developing more reliable Deep Neural Network (DNN) models."}}

While much of the literature has focused on discounted MDPs, robust average-reward MDPs remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we focus on robust average-reward MDPs, where the goal is to find a policy that optimizes the worst-case average reward over an uncertainty set. We first take an approach that approximates average-reward MDPs using discounted MDPs. We prove that the robust discounted value function converges to the robust average-reward as the discount factor $\\gamma$ goes to $1$, and moreover, when $\\gamma$ is large, any optimal policy of the robust discounted MDP is also an optimal policy of the robust average-reward. We further design a robust dynamic programming approach, and theoretically characterize its convergence to the optimum. Then, we investigate robust average-reward MDPs directly without using discounted MDPs as an intermediate step. We derive the robust Bellman equation for robust average-reward MDPs, prove that the optimal policy can be derived from its solution, and further design a robust relative value iteration algorithm that provably finds its solution, or equivalently, the optimal robust policy."}}

The choice of the abstract domain presents an expressiveness vs. scalability trade-off: simpler domains are less precise but yield faster algorithms. This paper investigates the octatope abstract domain in the context of neural net verification. Octatopes are affine transformations of n-dimensional octagons\u2014sets of unit-two-variable-per-inequality (utvpi) constraints. Octatopes generalize the idea of zonotopes which can be viewed as an affine transformation of a box. On the other hand, octatopes can be considered as a restriction of linear star set, which are affine transformations of arbitrary $$\\mathcal {H}$$ -Polytopes. This distinction places octatopes firmly between zonotopes and star sets in their expressive power, but what about the efficiency of decision procedures? An important analysis problem for neural networks is the exact range computation problem that asks to compute the exact set of possible outputs given a set of possible inputs. For this, three computational procedures are needed: 1) optimization of a linear cost function; 2) affine mapping; and 3) over-approximating the intersection with a half-space. While zonotopes allow an efficient solution for these approaches, star sets solves these procedures via linear programming. We show that these operations are faster for octatopes than the more expressive linear star sets. For octatopes, we reduce these problems to min-cost flow problems, which can be solved in strongly polynomial time using the Out-of-Kilter algorithm. Evaluating exact range computation on several ACAS Xu neural network benchmarks, we find that octatopes show promise as a practical abstract domain for neural network verification."}}

Existing methods for HOI detection heavily rely on appearance-based features, but these may not fully capture all the essential characteristics necessary for accurate detection. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative graph-based approach called TMGHOI (Translational Model for Human-Object Interaction Detection). Our method effectively captures the sentiment representation of HOIs by integrating both spatial and semantic knowledge. By representing HOIs as a graph, where the interaction components serve as nodes and their spatial relationships as edges. To extract crucial spatial and semantic information, TMGHOI employs separate spatial and semantic encoders. Subsequently, these encodings are combined to construct a knowledge graph that effectively captures the sentiment representation of HOIs. Additionally, the ability to incorporate prior knowledge enhances the understanding of interactions, further boosting detection accuracy. We conducted extensive evaluations on the widely-used HICO-DET datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of TMGHOI. Our approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art graph-based methods by a significant margin, showcasing its potential as a superior solution for HOI detection. We are confident that TMGHOI has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of HOI detection. Its integration of spatial and semantic knowledge, along with its computational efficiency and practicality, makes it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the computer vision community. As with any research, we acknowledge the importance of further exploration and evaluation on various datasets to establish the generalizability and robustness of our proposed method."}}
