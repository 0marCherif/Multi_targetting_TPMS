We present a new tool, Aide-m\u00e9moire, to suggest such links when a developer submits a pull request or closes an issue, smoothly integrating into existing workflows. In contrast to previous state-of-the-art approaches that repair related commit histories, Aide-m\u00e9moire is designed for continuous, real-time, and long-term use, employing Mondrian forest to adapt over a project\u2019s lifetime and continuously improve traceability. Aide-m\u00e9moire is tailored for two specific instances of the general traceability problem\u2014namely, commit to issue and pull request to issue links, with a focus on the latter\u2014and exploits data inherent to these two problems to outperform tools for general purpose link recovery. Our approach is online, language-agnostic, and scalable. We evaluate over a corpus of 213 projects and six programming languages, achieving a mean average precision of 0.95. Adopting Aide-m\u00e9moire is both efficient and effective: A programmer need only evaluate a single suggested link 94% of the time, and 16% of all discovered links were originally missed by developers."}}
