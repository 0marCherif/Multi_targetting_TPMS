One of the major challenges for the task lies in the presence of distracting objects and relationships in images; contextual reasoning is strongly distracted by irrelevant objects or backgrounds and, more importantly, a vast number of irrelevant candidate relations. To tackle the issue, we propose the Selective Quad Attention Network (SQUAT) that learns to select relevant object pairs and disambiguate them via diverse contextual interactions. SQUAT consists of two main components: edge selection and quad attention. The edge selection module selects relevant object pairs, i.e., edges in the scene graph, which helps contextual reasoning, and the quad attention module then updates the edge features using both edge-to-node and edge-to-edge cross-attentions to capture contextual information between objects and object pairs. Experiments demonstrate the strong performance and robustness of SQUAT, achieving the state of the art on the Visual Genome and Open Images v6 benchmarks."}}

However, as many recent datasets are enormous and noisy, getting a clear boundary between different clusters is challenging with existing methods that mainly focus on contracting similar samples together and overlooking samples near boundary of clusters in the latent space. In this regard, we propose an end-to-end deep clustering algorithm, i.e., Locally Normalized Soft Contrastive Clustering (LNSCC). It takes advantage of similarities among each sample's local neighborhood and globally disconnected samples to leverage positiveness and negativeness of sample pairs in a contrastive way to separate different clusters. Experimental results on various datasets illustrate that our proposed approach achieves outstanding clustering performance over most of the state-of-the-art clustering methods for both image and non-image data even without convolution."}}

Given their impressive abilities in generating highly realistic images, they are also being used in novel ways in applications in the life sciences. This raises an interesting question when GANs are used in scientific or biomedical studies. Consider the setting where we are restricted to only using the samples from a trained GAN for downstream group difference analysis (and do not have direct access to the real data). Will we obtain similar conclusions? In this work, we explore if \u201cgenerated\u201d data, i.e., sampled from such GANs can be used for performing statistical group difference tests in cases versus controls studies, common across many scientific disciplines. We provide a detailed analysis describing regimes where this may be feasible. We complement the technical results with an empirical study focused on the analysis of cortical thickness on brain mesh surfaces in an Alzheimer's disease dataset. To exploit the geometric nature of the data, we use simple ideas from spectral graph theory to show how adjustments to existing GANs can yield improvements. We also give a generalization error bound by extending recent results on Neural Network Distance. To our knowledge, our work offers the first analysis assessing whether the Null distribution in \u201chealthy versus diseased subjects\u201d type statistical testing using data generated from the GANs coincides with the one obtained from the same analysis with real data.

As the connectomes over different brain regions are naturally represented as a graph, variants of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been developed to identify topological patterns for disease early diagnosis. However, existing GNNs heavily rely on the fixed local structure given by an initial graph as they aggregate information from a direct neighborhood of each node. Such an approach overlooks useful information from further nodes, and multiple layers for node aggregations have to be stacked across the entire graph which leads to an over-smoothing issue. In this regard, we propose a flexible model that learns adaptive scales of neighborhood for individual nodes of a graph to incorporate broader information from appropriate range. Leveraging an adaptive diffusion kernel, the proposed model identifies desirable scales for each node for feature aggregation, which leads to better prediction of diagnostic labels of brain networks. Empirical results show that our method outperforms well-structured baselines on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study for classifying various stages towards AD based on the brain connectome and relevant node-wise features from neuroimages."}}

However, the invasive exposure to radiation and high imaging cost significantly restrict the application of PET in characterizing the evolution of pathology burden which often requires longitudinal PET image sequences. In this regard, we propose a proof-of-concept solution to generate the complete trajectory of pathological events throughout the brain based on very limited number of PET scans. We present a novel variational autoencoder model to learn a latent population-level representation of neurodegeneration process based on the longitudinal \u03b2-amyloid measurements at each brain region and longitudinal diagnostic stages. As the propagation of pathological burdens follow the topology of brain connectome, we further cast our neural network into a supervised sequential graph VAE, where we use the brain network to guide the representation learning. Experiments show that the disentangled representation can capture disease-related dynamics of amyloid and forecast the level of amyloid depositions at future time points."}}

To explore and identify the uncertain regions, we propose a post-training method with untargeted adversarial examples where the input image is iteratively perturbed in a direction that maximizes the loss of original and perturbed prediction. The perturbed predictions from these adversarial examples can be seen as unstable areas in terms of input variability; we theoretically observe that the gradient of negative class confidence in terms of input image plays a key role for perturbed outputs, and empirically show that a small adversarial perturbation can help find hidden regions in the output segmentation maps. Compared to previous methods for uncertainty estimation, our method yields competitive results for uncertain region findings on medical image datasets while only requiring one extra inference from a pre-trained model and short iteration of attack. We expect our novel findings can provide insights for future medical image segmentation problems where detection of subtle variations (e.g., lesions) are required."}}

However, it is challenging to reverse-engineer the working mechanism of brain function and behavior through the evolving functional neuroimages. In this work, we conceptualize that the ensemble of evolving neuronal synapses forms a dynamic system of functional connectivity, where the system behavior (aka. Brain state) of such a reaction-diffusion process can be formulated by a set of trainable PDEs (partial differential equations). To that end, we first introduce a PDE-based reaction-diffusion model (RDM) to jointly characterize the propagation of brain states throughout the functional brain network as well as the non-linear interaction between brain state and neural activity manifested in the BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) signals. Next, we translate the diffusion and reaction processes formulated in the PDE into a graph neural network, where the driving force is to establish the mapping from the evolution of brain states to the known cognitive tasks. By doing so, the layer-by-layer learning scenario allows us to not only fine-tune the RDM model for predicting cognitive tasks but also explain how brain functions support cognitive status with a great neuroscience insight. We have evaluated our proof-of-concept approach on both simulated data and functional neuroimages from HCP (Human Connectome Project) database. Since our neuro-RDM combines the power of deep learning and insight of dynamic systems, our method has significantly improved recognition performance in terms of accuracy and robustness to the non-neuronal noise, compared with the conventional deep learning models."}}

To identify an independent effect from a variable of interest (e.g., socioeconomic conditions), statistical models such as General Linear Model (GLM) are typically adopted to account for covariates (e.g., age and gender). However, statistical models may be vulnerable with insufficient sample size and outliers, and multiple tests for a whole brain analysis lead to inevitable false-positives without sufficient sensitivity. Hence, it is necessary to develop a unified framework for multiple tests that robustly fits the observation and increases sensitivity. We therefore propose a unified flexible neural network that optimizes on the contribution from the main variable of interest as introduced in original GLM, which leads to improved statistical outcomes. The results on group analysis with fractional anisotropy (FA) from Diffusion Tensor Images from Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study demonstrate that the proposed method provides much more selective and meaningful detection of ROIs related to socioeconomic status over conventional methods."}}

For this, we propose an innovative and ground-breaking Disentangled Sequential Graph Autoencoder which leverages the Sequential Variational Autoencoder (SVAE), graph convolution and semi-supervising framework together to learn a latent space composed of time-variant and time-invariant latent variables to characterize disentangled representation of the measurements over the entire ROIs. Incorporating target information in the decoder with a supervised loss let us achieve more effective representation learning towards improved classification.

The core of MENET is a novel graph edge-wise transform that we propose, which allows us to capture multi-resolution \u201cconnectomic\u201d features.
