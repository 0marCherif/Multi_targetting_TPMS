As the simplest implementation of value factorization, Linear Value Factorization (LVF) attracts wide attention. In this paper, firstly, we investigate the applicable conditions of LVF, which is important but usually neglected by previous works. We prove that due to the representation limitation, LVF is only perfectly applicable to an extremely narrow class of tasks, which we define as the decomposable Markov game. Secondly, to handle the indecomposable Markov game where the LVF is inapplicable, we turn to value factorization with complete representation capability (CRC) and explore the general form of the value factorization function that satisfies both Independent Global Max (IGM) and CRC conditions. A common problem of these value factorization functions is the representation interference among true Q values with shared local Q value functions. As a result, the policy could be trapped in local optimums due to the representation interference on the optimal true Q values. Thirdly, to address the problem, we propose a novel value factorization method, namely Q Factorization with Representation Interference Suppression (QFRIS).  QFRIS adaptively reduces the gradients of the local Q value functions contributed by the non-optimal true Q values. Our method is evaluated on various benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate the good convergence of QFIRS."}}

Motivated by the demand for an effective deep reinforcement learning algorithm that accommodates sparse reward environment, this paper presents Hindsight Trust Region Policy Optimization (HTRPO), a method that efficiently utilizes interactions in sparse reward conditions to optimize policies within trust region and, in the meantime, maintains learning stability. Firstly, we theoretically adapt the TRPO objective function, in the form of the expected return of the policy, to the distribution of hindsight data generated from the alternative goals. Then, we apply Monte Carlo with importance sampling to estimate KL-divergence between two policies, taking the hindsight data as input. Under the condition that the distributions are sufficiently close, the KL-divergence is approximated by another f-divergence. Such approximation results in the decrease of variance and alleviates the instability during policy update.  Experimental results on both discrete and continuous benchmark tasks demonstrate that HTRPO converges significantly faster than previous policy gradient methods. It achieves effective performances and high data-efficiency for training policies in sparse reward environments."}}

To compress zero-shot classes by the trained quantizer for efficient search, it tends to induce large quantization error because distributions between seen and unseen classes are different. However, as semantic attributes of classes are available in ZSL, both seen and unseen classes have the same distribution for one specific property, e.g., animals have or not have spots. Based on this intuition, a Product Quantization Zero-Shot Learning (PQZSL) method is proposed to learn embeddings as well as quantizers to compress visual features into compact codes for Approximate NN (ANN) search. Particularly, visual features are projected into an orthogonal semantic space, and then the Product Quantization (PQ) is utilized to quantize individual properties. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that unseen classes are represented by the Cartesian product of quantized properties with little quantization error. As classes in orthogonal common space are more discriminative, the classification based on PQZSL achieves state-of-the-art performance in Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) task, meanwhile, the speed of ANN search is 10-100 times higher than traditional NN search."}}

With the rapid development of neural networks, human action recognition has been achieved great improvement by using convolutional neural networks (CNN) or recurrent neural networks (RNN). In this paper, we propose a model based on spatial-temporal attention weighted LSTM. This model pays attention to the key part in each video frame, and also focuses on the important frames in each video sequence, thus the most important theme for our model is how to find out the key point spatially and the key frames temporally. We show a feasible architecture which can solve those two problems effectively and achieve a satisfactory result. Our model is trained and tested on three datasets including UCF-11, UCF-101, and HMDB51. Those results demonstrate a high performance of our model in human action recognition."}}

Current state-of-the-art performance of CVPI is achieved by matching appearance and motion features across videos, while the matching of pose features does not work effectively given the high inaccuracy of the 3D human pose estimation on videos/images collected in the wild. In this paper, we introduce a new metric of confidence to the 3D human pose estimation and show that the combination of the inaccurately estimated human pose and the inferred confidence metric can be used to boost the CVPI performance---the estimated pose information can be integrated to the appearance and motion features to achieve the new state-of-the-art CVPI performance. More specifically, the estimated confidence metric is measured at each human-body joint and the joints with higher confidence are weighted more in the pose matching for CVPI. In the experiments, we validate the proposed method on three wearable-camera video datasets and compare the performance against several other existing CVPI methods."}}
