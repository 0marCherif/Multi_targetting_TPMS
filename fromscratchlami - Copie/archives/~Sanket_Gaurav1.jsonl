We have used Microsoft Kinect depth camera as our input sensors in our goal-predictive robotic teleoperation systems. Since Kinect depth camera is inexpensive but has a lot of errors in human skeleton tracking, especially position noise as it is difficult to track human positions in real-time. We have tried to de-noise the Kinect outputs using Inverse Optimal Control for Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) using current time step data for intended goal prediction. But there is some amount of log loss in the Inverse LQR goal prediction. Using predictive filters like linear regression has improved the goal prediction and decrease the log loss for true goal. Sometimes human also changes their intended goal in-between the trajectory or path to the previous intended goal, which makes it more difficult for the robot to cope up with humans. The trajectory followed by the demonstrator and the goal intended can be modeled as Hidden Markov Model (HMM), where goal probability change can be observed at each time step in the trajectory. Goal change model is used to find the probability of intended goal change at any time step in the trajectory, calculated effectively through the forward-backward algorithm."}}

This thesis studies prediction and learning methods to understand human intentions and address challenges posed to collaborative robots related to translating between human and robotic behavior. The first topic discusses the correspondence learning problem of estimating a mapping of human embodiment to robot-joint configuration for robotic teleoperation using virtual reality. The second topic seeks to enable robots to more accurately predict human intentions from partial trajectories so that the robot can plan complementary activities. Finally, the research extends to learn a daily human activity (mopping the floor) from human demonstration videos to a robotic arm. By projecting into a 3-D workspace, robotic teleoperation using virtual reality allows for a more intuitive method of control for the operator than using a 2-D view from the robot's visual sensors. This chapter investigates a setup that places the teleoperator in a virtual representation of the robot's environment and develops a deep learning based architecture modeling the correspondence between the operator's movements in the virtual space and joint angles for a humanoid robot using data collected from a series of demonstrations. We evaluate the correspondence model's performance in a pick-and-place teleoperation experiment. More accurately inferring human intentions/goals can help robots complete collaborative human-robot tasks more safely and efficiently. Bayesian reasoning has become a popular approach for predicting the intention or goal of a partial sequence of actions/controls using a trajectory likelihood model. However, the mismatch between the training objective for these models (maximizing trajectory likelihood) and the application objective (maximizing intention likelihood) can be detrimental. In this chapter, we seek to improve the goal prediction of maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (MaxEnt IRL) models by training to maximize goal likelihood. We demonstrate the benefits of our method on pointing task goal prediction with multiple possible goals and predicting goal based activities in the Cornell Activity Dataset (CAD-120). Though mopping the floor is a mundane and tedious daily task, enabling robots to perform it comparably to humans remains a challenge. Hand-coding desired mopping behaviors for variable surfaces and situations is particularly difficult. In this chapter, we develop a robotic system for mopping the floor by mimicking the human behavior demonstrated in videos. Our approach builds upon the recent successes of imitation learning of other capabilities from human video demonstration (e.g., pouring tasks. Our first proposed robotic system uses traditional computer vision techniques for tracking and inverse kinematics. Our second system comprises advanced computer vision techniques, Time Contrastive Network (TCN), and reinforcement learning. From these, we devise a reward function for the mopping task. We use a Universal 10e robotic arm attached with a mop to perform the mopping task and a first-person camera attached on top of the robotic arm to provide feedback for robot learning."}}

However, the imprecision of low-cost depth cameras and the difficulty of calibrating a frame of reference for the operator introduce inefficiencies in this process when performing tasks that require interactions with objects in the robot's workspace. We develop a goal-predictive teleoperation system that aids in \u201cde-noising\u201d the controls of the operator to be more goal-directed. Our approach uses inverse optimal control to predict the intended object of interaction from the current motion trajectory in real time and then adapts the degree of autonomy between the operator's demonstrations and autonomous completion of the predicted task.

However, the data in the webpages are not clearly perceived by search engines. As a result, it provides a lot of irrelevant data with little desired information. In addition, it takes a lot of time in searching the appropriate result. By studying the online educational needs of Indian school children, we aim to retrieve appropriate educational information in less time through effective search. Schema.org [5] is a collection of markups which helps webmasters to mark up the webpages for retrieval of relevant information. But, properties related to education are not covered completely. Learning Resource Metadata Initiative (LRMI) [9] has created few properties for education and added in schema.org. We map our study with LRMI's work, and propose some new properties as an extension to the schema, which can be useful for students and teachers."}}
