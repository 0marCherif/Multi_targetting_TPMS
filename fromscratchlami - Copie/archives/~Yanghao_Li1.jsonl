We randomly mask out spacetime patches in videos and learn an autoencoder to reconstruct them in pixels. Interestingly, we show that our MAE method can learn strong representations with almost no inductive bias on spacetime (only except for patch and positional embeddings), and spacetime-agnostic random masking performs the best. We observe that the optimal masking ratio is as high as 90% (vs. 75% on images), supporting the hypothesis that this ratio is related to information redundancy of the data. A high masking ratio leads to a large speedup, e.g., > 4x in wall-clock time or even more. We report competitive results on several challenging video datasets using vanilla Vision Transformers. We observe that MAE can outperform supervised pre-training by large margins. We further report encouraging results of training on real-world, uncurated Instagram data. Our study suggests that the general framework of masked autoencoding (BERT, MAE, etc.) can be a unified methodology for representation learning with minimal domain knowledge."}}

We further compare MViTv2s' pooling attention to window attention mechanisms where it outperforms the latter in accuracy/compute. Without bells-and-whistles, MViTv2 has state-of-the-art performance in 3 domains: 88.8% accuracy on ImageNet classification, 58.7 AP <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">box</sup>  on COCO object detection as well as 86.1% on Kinetics-400 video classification.

This design enables the original ViT architecture to be fine-tuned for object detection without needing to redesign a hierarchical backbone for pre-training. With minimal adaptations for fine-tuning, our plain-backbone detector can achieve competitive results. Surprisingly, we observe: (i) it is sufficient to build a simple feature pyramid from a single-scale feature map (without the common FPN design) and (ii) it is sufficient to use window attention (without shifting) aided with very few cross-window propagation blocks. With plain ViT backbones pre-trained as Masked Autoencoders (MAE), our detector, named ViTDet, can compete with the previous leading methods that were all based on hierarchical backbones, reaching up to 61.3 AP $$^\\text {box}$$ on the COCO dataset using only ImageNet-1K pre-training. We hope our study will draw attention to research on plain-backbone detectors. Code for ViTDet is available ( https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/main/projects/ViTDet )."}}

By decoupling the GPU memory footprint from the depth of the model, Reversible Vision Transformers enable memory efficient scaling of transformer architectures. We adapt two popular models, namely Vision Transformer and Multiscale Vision Transformers, to reversible variants and benchmark extensively across both model sizes and tasks of image classification, object detection and video classification. Reversible Vision Transformers achieve a reduced memory footprint of up to 15.5\u00d7 at identical model complexity, parameters and accuracy, demonstrating the promise of reversible vision transformers as an efficient backbone for resource limited training regimes. Finally, we find that the additional computational burden of recomputing activations is more than overcome for deeper models, where throughput can increase up to 3.9 \u00d7 over their non-reversible counterparts.

It offers 3,670 hours of dailylife activity video spanning hundreds of scenarios (household, outdoor, workplace, leisure, etc.) captured by 931 unique camera wearers from 74 worldwide locations and 9 different countries. The approach to collection is designed to uphold rigorous privacy and ethics standards, with consenting participants and robust de-identification procedures where relevant. Ego4D dramatically expands the volume of diverse egocentric video footage publicly available to the research community. Portions of the video are accompanied by audio, 3D meshes of the environment, eye gaze, stereo, and/or synchronized videos from multiple egocentric cameras at the same event. Furthermore, we present a host of new benchmark challenges centered around understanding the first-person visual experience in the past (querying an episodic memory), present (analyzing hand-object manipulation, audio-visual conversation, and social interactions), and future (forecasting activities). By publicly sharing this massive annotated dataset and benchmark suite, we aim to push the frontier of first-person perception. Project page: https://ego4d-data.org/"}}

In Ego4D, the Visual Queries 2D Localization task aims to retrieve objects appeared in the past from the recording in the first-person view. This task requires a system to spatially and temporally localize the most recent appearance of a given object query, where query is registered by a single tight visual crop of the object in a different scene. Our study is based on the three-stage baseline introduced in the Episodic Memory benchmark. The baseline solves the problem by detection and tracking: detect the similar objects in all the frames, then run a tracker from the most confident detection result. In the VQ2D challenge, we identified two limitations of the current baseline. (1) The training configuration has redundant computation. Although the training set has millions of instances, most of them are repetitive and the number of unique object is only around 14.6k. The repeated gradient computation of the same object lead to an inefficient training; (2) The false positive rate is high on background frames. This is due to the distribution gap between training and evaluation. During training, the model is only able to see the clean, stable, and labeled frames, but the egocentric videos also have noisy, blurry, or unlabeled background frames. To this end, we developed a more efficient and effective solution. Concretely, we bring the training loop from ~15 days to less than 24 hours, and we achieve 0.17% spatial-temporal AP, which is 31% higher than the baseline. Our solution got the first ranking on the public leaderboard. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/vq2d_cvpr."}}
