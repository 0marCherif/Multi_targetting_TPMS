Like the other high-fidelity generative models, diffusion models require a large amount of data and computing time for stable training, which hinders the application of diffusion models for limited data settings. To overcome this issue, one can employ a pre-trained diffusion model built on a large-scale dataset and fine-tune it on a target dataset. Unfortunately, as we show empirically, this easily results in overfitting. In this paper, we propose an efficient fine-tuning algorithm for diffusion models that can efficiently and robustly train on limited data settings. We first show that fine-tuning only the small subset of the pre-trained parameters can efficiently learn the target dataset with much less overfitting. Then we further introduce a lightweight adapter module that can be attached to the pre-trained model with minimal overhead and show that fine-tuning with our adapter module significantly improves the image generation quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various real-world image datasets."}}

They represent an image as a continuous version of the underlying 2D signal instead of a 2D array of pixels, which opens new horizons for GAN applications (e.g., zero-shot super-resolution, image outpainting). However, training existing approaches require a heavy computational cost proportional to the image resolution, since they compute an MLP operation for every (x, y) coordinate. To alleviate this issue, we propose a multi-stage patch-based training, a novel and scalable approach that can train INR-based GANs with a flexible computational cost regardless of the image resolution. Specifically, our method allows to generate and discriminate by patch to learn the local details of the image and learn global structural information by a novel reconstruction loss to enable efficient GAN training. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our approach enhances baseline models in GPU memory while maintaining FIDs at a reasonable level."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel STE model, referred to as RewriteNet, that decomposes text images into content and style features and re-writes a text in the original image. Specifically, RewriteNet implicitly distinguishes the content from the style by introducing scene text recognition. Additionally, independent of the exact supervisions with synthetic examples, we propose a self-supervised training scheme for unlabeled real-world images, which bridges the domain gap between synthetic and real data. Our experiments present that RewriteNet achieves better generation performances than other comparisons. Further analysis proves the feature decomposition of RewriteNet and demonstrates the reliability and robustness through diverse experiments.

Recent data-driven methods using deep learning have shown their great abilities to automatically simplify sketches on raster images. Since it is difficult to collect or generate paired sketch and line images, lack of training data is a main obstacle to use these models. In this paper, we propose a training scheme that requires only unpaired sketch and line images for learning sketch-to-line translation. To do this, we first generate realistic paired sketch and line images from unpaired sketch and line images using rule-based line augmentation and unsupervised texture conversion. Next, with our synthetic paired data, we train a model for sketch-to-line translation using supervised learning. Compared to unsupervised methods that use cycle consistency losses, our model shows better performance at removing noisy strokes. We also show that our model simplifies complicated sketches better than models trained on a limited number of handcrafted paired data."}}
