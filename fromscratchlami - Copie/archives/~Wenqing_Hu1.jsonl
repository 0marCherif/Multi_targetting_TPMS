Our SIM-I is constructed via two steps: in the first step we build a piece-wise linear affinity-aware subspace model under a given partition of the dataset; in the second step we interpolate between several adjacent linear subspace models constructed previously using the `\"center of mass\" calculation on Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds. The resulting subspace indexing model built by SIM-I is a globally non-linear low-dimensional embedding of the original data set. Furthermore, the interpolation step produces a `\"smoothed\u201d version of the piece-wise linear embedding mapping constructed in the first step, and can be viewed as a regularization procedure. We provide experimental results validating the effectiveness of SIM-I, that improves PCA recovery for SIFT dataset and nearest-neighbor classification success rates for MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Inspired by the recent work in continuous-time minimizers, our work models the common trust region methods with the exploration-exploitation using a dynamical system coupling a pair of dynamical processes. While the first exploration process searches the minimum of the blackbox function through minimizing a time-evolving surrogation function, another exploitation process updates the surrogation function time-to-time using the points traversed by the exploration process. The efficiency of derivative-free optimization thus depends on ways the two processes couple. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamical system, namely \\ThePrev---\\underline{S}tochastic \\underline{H}amiltonian \\underline{E}xploration and \\underline{E}xploitation, that surrogates the subregions of blackbox function using a time-evolving quadratic function, then explores and tracks the minimum of the quadratic functions using a fast-converging Hamiltonian system. The \\ThePrev\\ algorithm is later provided as a discrete-time numerical approximation to the system. To further accelerate optimization, we present \\TheName\\ that parallelizes multiple \\ThePrev\\ threads for concurrent exploration and exploitation. Experiment results based on a wide range of machine learning applications show that \\TheName\\ outperform a boarder range of derivative-free optimization algorithms with faster convergence speed under the same settings."}}

The empirical FLD relies on two key estimations from the data -- the mean vector for each class and the (inverse) covariance matrix. To improve the accuracy of FLD under the High Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS) settings, Covariance-Regularized FLD (CRLD) has been proposed to use shrunken covariance estimators, such as Graphical Lasso, to strike a balance between biases and variances. Though CRLD could obtain better classification accuracy, it usually incurs bias and converges to the optimal result with a slower asymptotic rate. Inspired by the recent progress in de-biased Lasso, we propose a novel FLD classifier, DBLD, which improves classification accuracy of CRLD through de-biasing. Theoretical analysis shows that DBLD possesses better asymptotic properties than CRLD. We conduct experiments on both synthetic datasets and real application datasets to confirm the correctness of our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superiority of DBLD over classical FLD, CRLD and other downstream competitors under HDLSS settings."}}

(ii) How to spot and trace the trip purposes of human mobility trajectories? To answer these questions, we study large-scale and city-wide taxi trajectories; and furtherly organize them as arrival sequences according to the chronological arrival time. We figure out an important property across different regions from the arrival sequences, namely human mobility synchronization effect, which can be exploited to explain the phenomenon that two regions have similar arrival patterns in particular time periods if they share similar urban functions. In addition, the arrival sequences are mixed by arrival events with distinct trip purposes, which can be revealed by the regional environment of both the origins and destinations. To that end, in this paper, we develop a joint model that integrates Mixture of Hawkes Process (MHP) with a hierarchical topic model to capture the arrival sequences with mixed trip purposes. Essentially, the human mobility synchronization effect is encoded as a synchronization rate in the MHP; while the regional environment is modeled by introducing latent Trip Purpose and POI Topic to generate the Point of Interests (POIs) in the regions. Moreover, we provide an effective inference algorithm for parameter learning. Finally, we conduct intensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data, and the experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model."}}
