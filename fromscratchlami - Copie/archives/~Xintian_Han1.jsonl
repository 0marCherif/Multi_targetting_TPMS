Despite this training scheme, practitioners evaluate models under other criteria, such as binary classification losses at a chosen set of time horizons, e.g. Brier score (BS) and Bernoulli log likelihood (BLL). Models trained with maximum likelihood may have poor BS or BLL since maximum likelihood does not directly optimize these criteria. Directly optimizing criteria like BS requires inverse-weighting by the censoring distribution. However, estimating the censoring model under these metrics requires inverse-weighting by the failure distribution. The objective for each model requires the other, but neither are known. To resolve this dilemma, we introduce Inverse-Weighted Survival Games. In these games, objectives for each model are built from re-weighted estimates featuring the other model, where the latter is held fixed during training. When the loss is proper, we show that the games always have the true failure and censoring distributions as a stationary point. This means models in the game do not leave the correct distributions once reached. We construct one case where this stationary point is unique. We show that these games optimize BS on simulations and then apply these principles on real world cancer and critically-ill patient data."}}

However, training RNNs is hard. Vanishing gradients cause difficulties for learning long-range dependencies. Hidden states can explode for long sequences and send unbounded gradients to model parameters, even when hidden-to-hidden Jacobians are bounded. Models like the LSTM and GRU use gates to bound their hidden state, but most choices of gating functions lead to saturating gradients that contribute to, instead of alleviate, vanishing gradients. Moreover, performance of these models is not robust across random initializations. In this work, we specify desiderata for sequence models. We develop one model that satisfies them and that is capable of learning long-term dependencies, called GATO. GATO is constructed so that part of its hidden state does not have vanishing gradients, regardless of sequence length. We study GATO on copying and arithmetic tasks with long dependencies and on modeling intensive care unit and language data. Training GATO is more stable across random seeds and learning rates than GRUs and LSTMs. GATO solves these tasks using an order of magnitude fewer parameters."}}
