Linear and general transformations are investigated. The paper addresses both the \\emph{identifiability} and \\emph{achievability} aspects. Identifiability refers to determining algorithm-agnostic conditions that ensure recovering the true latent causal variables and the latent causal graph underlying them. Achievability refers to the algorithmic aspects and addresses designing algorithms that achieve identifiability guarantees. By drawing novel connections between \\emph{score functions} (i.e., the gradients of the logarithm of density functions) and CRL, this paper designs a \\emph{score-based class of algorithms} that ensures both identifiability and achievability. First, the paper focuses on \\emph{linear} transformations and shows that one stochastic hard intervention per node suffices to guarantee identifiability. It also provides partial identifiability guarantees for soft interventions, including identifiability up to ancestors for general causal models and perfect latent graph recovery for sufficiently non-linear causal models. Secondly, it focuses on \\emph{general} transformations and shows that two stochastic hard interventions per node suffice for identifiability. Notably, one does \\emph{not} need to know which pair of interventional environments have the same node intervened."}}

The objectives are: (i) recovering the unknown linear transformation (up to scaling) and (ii) determining the directed acyclic graph (DAG) underlying the latent variables. Sufficient conditions for DAG recovery are established, and it is shown that a large class of non-linear models in the latent space (e.g., causal mechanisms parameterized by two-layer neural networks) satisfy these conditions. These sufficient conditions ensure that the effect of an intervention can be detected correctly from changes in the score. Capitalizing on this property, recovering a valid transformation is facilitated by the following key property: any valid transformation renders latent variables' score function to necessarily have the minimal variations across different interventional environments. This property is leveraged for perfect recovery of the latent DAG structure using only \\emph{soft} interventions. For the special case of stochastic \\emph{hard} interventions, with an additional hypothesis testing step, one can also uniquely recover the linear transformation up to scaling and a valid causal ordering."}}

It establishes identifiability and achievability results using two hard uncoupled interventions per node in the latent causal graph. Notably, one does not know which pair of intervention environments have the same node intervened (hence, uncoupled). For identifiability, the paper establishes that perfect recovery of the latent causal model and variables is guaranteed under uncoupled interventions. For achievability, an algorithm is designed that uses observational and interventional data and recovers the latent causal model and variables with provable guarantees. This algorithm leverages score variations across different environments to estimate the inverse of the transformer and, subsequently, the latent variables. The analysis, additionally, recovers the identifiability result for two hard coupled interventions, that is when metadata about the pair of environments that have the same node intervened is known. This paper also shows that when observational data is available, additional faithfulness assumptions that are adopted by the existing literature are unnecessary."}}

In the existing literature on CBs, a critical assumption is that the causal models remain constant over time. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in complex systems, which constantly undergo temporal model fluctuations. This paper addresses the robustness of CBs to such model fluctuations. The focus is on causal systems with linear structural equation models (SEMs). The SEMs and the time-varying pre- and post-interventional statistical models are all unknown. Cumulative regret is adopted as the design criteria, based on which the objective is to design a sequence of interventions that incur the smallest cumulative regret with respect to an oracle aware of the entire causal model and its fluctuations. First, it is established that the existing approaches fail to maintain regret sub-linearity with even a few instances of model deviation. Specifically, when the number of instances with model deviation is as few as $T^\\frac{1}{2L}$, where $T$ is the time horizon and $L$ is the longest causal path in the graph, the existing algorithms will have linear regret in $T$. Next, a robust CB algorithm is designed, and its regret is analyzed, where upper and information-theoretic lower bounds on the regret are established. Specifically, in a graph with $N$ nodes and maximum degree $d$, under a general measure of model deviation $C$, the cumulative regret is upper bounded by $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{L-\\frac{1}{2}}(\\sqrt{NT} + NC))$ and lower bounded by $\\Omega(d^{\\frac{L}{2}-2}\\max\\{\\sqrt{T},d^2C\\})$. Comparing these bounds establishes that the proposed algorithm achieves nearly optimal $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret when $C$ is $o(\\sqrt{T})$ and maintains sub-linear regret for a broader range of $C$."}}

The focus is on linear structural equation models with soft interventions. The existing approaches to this problem involve extensive conditional independence tests, and they estimate the unknown intervention targets alongside learning the structure of the causal model in its entirety. This joint learning approach to estimating the intervention targets results in algorithms that are not scalable as graph sizes grow. This paper proposes an approach that does not necessitate learning the entire causal model and focuses on learning only the intervention targets. The key idea of this approach is the property that interventions impose sparse changes in the precision matrix of a linear model. Leveraging this property, the proposed framework consists of a sequence of precision difference estimation steps. Furthermore, the necessary knowledge to refine an observational Markov equivalence class (MEC) to an interventional MEC is inferred. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the scalability of the proposed algorithm and compare it with those of the existing approaches."}}

This is, naturally, posed as a causal bandit problem. The focus is on causal bandits for linear structural equation models (SEMs) and soft interventions. It is assumed that the graph's structure is known and has $N$ nodes. Two linear mechanisms, one soft intervention and one observational, are assumed for each node, giving rise to $2^N$ possible interventions. Majority of the existing causal bandit algorithms assume that at least the interventional distributions of the reward node's parents are fully specified. However, there are $2^N$ such distributions (one corresponding to each intervention), acquiring which becomes prohibitive even in moderate-sized graphs. This paper dispenses with the assumption of knowing these distributions or their marginals. Two algorithms are proposed for the frequentist (UCB-based) and Bayesian (Thompson Sampling-based) settings. The key idea of these algorithms is to avoid directly estimating the $2^N$ reward distributions and instead estimate the parameters that fully specify the SEMs (linear in $N$) and use them to compute the rewards. In both algorithms, under boundedness assumptions on noise and the parameter space, the cumulative regrets scale as $\\tilde{\\cal O} (d^{L+\\frac{1}{2}} \\sqrt{NT})$, where $d$ is the graph's maximum degree, and $L$ is the length of its longest causal path. Additionally, a minimax lower of $\\Omega(d^{\\frac{L}{2}-2}\\sqrt{T})$ is presented, which suggests that the achievable and lower bounds conform in their scaling behavior with respect to the horizon $T$ and graph parameters $d$ and $L$."}}

This paper considers learning the structural similarities shared by a pair of Ising PGMs. The objective is learning the shared structure with no regard for the structures exclusive to either of the graphs, and significantly different from the existing approaches that focus on entire structure of the graphs.
