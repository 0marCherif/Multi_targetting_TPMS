Naturally, there is an ever-escalating arms race between attackers and defenders. However, the strategies behind both sides are often not fairly compared under the same and realistic conditions. To bridge this gap, we present the Graph Robustness Benchmark (GRB) with the goal of providing a scalable, unified, modular, and reproducible evaluation for the adversarial robustness of GML models. GRB standardizes the process of attacks and defenses by 1) developing scalable and diverse datasets, 2) modularizing the attack and defense implementations, and 3) unifying the evaluation protocol in refined scenarios. By leveraging the modular GRB pipeline,  the end-users can focus on the development of robust GML models with automated data processing and experimental evaluations. To support open and reproducible research on graph adversarial learning, GRB also hosts public leaderboards for different scenarios. \nAs a starting point, we provide various baseline experiments to benchmark the state-of-the-art techniques. GRB is an open-source benchmark and all datasets, code, and leaderboards are available at https://cogdl.ai/grb/home. "}}

Previous attacks and defenses on GNNs face common problems like scalability or generality, which hinder the progress of this domain. By rethinking limitations in previous works, we propose Graph Robustness Benchmark (GRB), the first benchmark that aims to provide scalable, general, unified, and reproducible evaluation on adversarial robustness of GNNs. GRB includes (1) scalable datasets processed by a novel splitting scheme; (2) diverse set of baseline methods covering GNNs, attacks, and defenses; (3) unified evaluation pipeline that permits a fair comparison; (4) modular coding framework that facilitates implementation of various methods and ensures reproducibility; (5) leaderboards that track the progress of the field. Besides, we propose two strong baseline defenses that significantly outperform previous ones. With extensive experiments, we can fairly compare all methods and investigate their pros and cons. GRB is open-source and maintains all datasets, codes, leaderboards at https://cogdl.ai/grb/home, which will be continuously updated to promote future research in this field."}}
