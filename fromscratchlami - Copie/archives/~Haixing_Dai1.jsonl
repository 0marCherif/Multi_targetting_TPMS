Numerous efforts have been devoted to exploring the best structures, or structural signatures, of well-performing artificial neural networks (ANN). Previous studies, by post-hoc analysis, have found that the best-performing ANNs surprisingly resemble biological neural networks (BNN), which indicates that ANNs and BNNs may share some common principles to achieve optimal performance in either machine learning tasks or cognitive/behavior processes. Inspired by this phenomenon, rather than relying on post-hoc schemes, we proactively instill organizational principles of BNNs to guide the redesign of ANNs by infusing an efficient information communication mechanism of BNNs into ANNs. Specifically, we quantified the typical Core-Periphery (CP) organization of the human brain networks, infused the CorePeriphery principle into the redesign of the vision transformer (ViT), and proposed a novel CP-ViT architecture: the pair-wised densely interconnected self-attention architecture of ViT was upgraded by a sparse Core-Periphery architecture. In CPViT, the attention operation between nodes (image patches) is defined by a sparse graph with a Core-Periphery structure (CP graph), where the core nodes are redesigned and reorganized to play an integrative role and serve as a center for other periphery nodes to exchange information. We evaluated the proposed CP-ViT on multiple public datasets, including medical image datasets (INbreast) and natural image datasets (CIFAR-100). We show that there exist sweet spots of CP graphs that lead to CP-ViTs with significantly improved performance. In general, our work advances the state of the art in three aspects: 1) This work provides novel insights for brain-inspired AI: we can instill the efficient information communication mechanism of BNNs into ANNs by infusing similar organizational principles of BNNs into ANNs; 2) The optimized CP-ViT can significantly improve its predictive performance while dramatically reducing computational cost by benefiting from the infused efficient information communication mechanism existing in BNNs; and 3) The core nodes in CP-ViT can identify task-related meaningful and important image patches, which can significantly enhance the interpretability of the trained deep model.

In this study, we focus on the hyperlink prediction problem in hypernetworks, for which the current state-of-art methods are latent-feature-based. A practical algorithm via topological features, which can provide understandings of the organizational principles of hypernetworks, is still lacking. For simple networks, local clustering or loop reflects the correlations among nodes; therefore, loop-based link prediction algorithms have achieved accurate performance. Extending the idea to hyperlink prediction faces several challenges. For instance, what is an effective way of defining loops for prediction is not clear yet; besides, directly comparing topological statistics of variable-sized hyperlinks could introduce biases in hyperlink cardinality. In this study, we address the issues and propose a loop-based hyperlink prediction approach. First, we discuss and define the loops in hypernetworks; then, we transfer the loop-features into a hyperlink prediction algorithm via a simple modified logistic regression. Numerical experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}}

Recent studies suggested that cortical gyri and sulci, the two basic cortical folding patterns, play different functional roles based on various data-driven methods from local time scale to global perspective. However, given the evidence that the brain\u2019s neuronal organization follows a hierarchical principle both spatially and temporally, it is unclear whether there exists temporal and spatial hierarchical functional differences between gyri and sulci due to the lack of suitable analytical tools. To answer this question, in this paper, we proposed a novel Hierarchical Interpretable Autoencoder (HIAE) to explore the hierarchical functional difference between gyri and sulci. The core idea is that hierarchical features learned by autoencoder can be embedded into a one-dimensional vector which interprets the features as spatial-temporal patterns, with which the region-based analysis in gyri and sulci can be further performed. We evaluated our framework using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) fMRI dataset, and the experiments showed that our framework is effective in terms of revealing meaningful hierarchical spatial-temporal features. Analysis based on Activation Ratio (AR) metric suggested that gyri have more low-frequency/global features while sulci have more high-frequency/local features. Our study provided novel insights to understand the brain\u2019s folding-function relationship."}}

In this study, to answer this question, we propose a novel methodology to provide an evidence of hierarchical organization of functional brain networks. This article introduces the hybrid spatiotemporal deep learning (HSDL), by jointly using deep belief networks (DBNs) and deep least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to reveal the temporal hierarchical features and spatial hierarchical maps of brain networks based on the Human Connectome Project 900 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data sets. Briefly, the key idea of HSDL is to extract the weights between two adjacent layers of DBNs, which are then treated as the hierarchical dictionaries for deep LASSO to identify the corresponding hierarchical spatial maps. Our results demonstrate that both spatial and temporal aspects of dozens of functional networks exhibit multiscale properties that can be well characterized and interpreted based on existing computational tools and neuroscience knowledge. Our proposed novel hybrid deep model is used to provide the first insightful opportunity to reveal the potential hierarchical organization of time series and functional brain networks, using task-based fMRI signals of human brain."}}

In addition, visualization and analysis of the filters in the learned CNN models suggest that sulcal fMRI signals are more diverse and have higher frequency than gyral signals. However, it is not clear whether the gyral fMRI signals can be further divided into sub-populations, e.g., 3-hinge areas vs 2-hinge areas. It is also unclear whether the CNN models of two classes (gyral vs sulcal) classification can be further optimized for three classes (3-hinge gyral vs 2-hinge gyral vs sulcal) classification. To answer these questions, in this paper, we employed the AdaNet framework to design a neural architecture search (NAS) system for optimizing CNN models for three classes fMRI signal classification. The core idea is that AdaNet adaptively learns both the optimal structure of the CNN network and its weights so that the learnt CNN model can effectively extract discriminative features that maximize the classification accuracies of three classes of 3-hinge gyral, 2-hinge gyral and sulcal fMRI signals. We evaluated our framework on the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset, and experiments showed that our framework can obtained significantly better results, in terms of both classification accuracy and extracted features."}}

Accumulating evidence has consistently suggested the morphological, structural, and functional differences between gyri and sulci, which are further supported by recent studies adopting deep learning methodologies. For instance, one of the pioneering studies demonstrated the intrinsic functional difference of neural activities between gyri and sulci by means of a convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifier on fMRI BOLD signals. While those studies revealed the holistic gyro-sulcal neural activity difference in the whole-brain scale, the characteristics of such gyro-sulcal difference within different brain regions, which account for specific brain functions, remains to be explored. In this study, we designed a region-specific one-dimensional (1D) CNN based classifier in order to differentiate gyro-sulcal resting state fMRI signals within each brain region. Time-frequency analysis was further performed on the learned 1D-CNN model to characterize the gyro-sulcal neural activity difference in different frequency scales of each brain region. Experiments results based on 900 subjects across 4 repeated resting-state fMRI scans from Human Connectome Project consistently showed that the gyral and sulcal signals could be differentiated within a majority of regions. Moreover, the gyral and sulcal filters exhibited different frequency characteristics in different scales across brain regions, suggesting that gyri and sulci may play different functional roles for different brain functions. To our best knowledge, this study provided one of the earliest mapping of the functional segregation of gyri/sulci for different brain regions, which helps better understand brain function mechanism."}}

However, it is still an open question how to analyze and model functional brain connectivity networks via rsfMRI data due to the variability of different individual brains, noisy signals from rsfMRI data, and technical limitations of current rsfMRI data decomposition methods. In this work, we proposed a two-stage deep learning framework for both temporal and spatial analysis of functional brain networks with an application on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) rsfMRI data. This framework tackled the above mentioned challenges in these aspects: reducing noises in rsfMRI raw data, establishing functional network correspondence across various individual brains, and composing multiple functional networks into a compact representation. In general, our proposed framework offers a novel scheme for comprehensive and systematic spatial-temporal resting state network modeling. Our experimental results on the ABIDE ASD dataset showed promising results in discovering discriminative functional networks compared with traditional analysis. Furthermore, our work provided a new insight into ASD that ASD's functional activity abnormalities tend to be more composite and systematic, other than being localized."}}

The question involves an equal-length measure that captures the duration of mobile phone use but does not tackle the other temporal characteristics of user behavior, such as frequency, timing, and sequence. In the study, we proposed a variable-length measure called \"session\" to uncover the unmeasured temporal characteristics. We use an open source data to demonstrate how to quantify sessions, aggregate the sessions to higher units of analysis within and across users, evaluate the results, and apply the measure for theoretical or practical purposes."}}
