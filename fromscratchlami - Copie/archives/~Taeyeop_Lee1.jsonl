To tackle this problem, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for category-level object pose estimation, called UDA-COPE. Inspired by recent multi-modal UDA techniques, the proposed method exploits a teacher-student self-supervised learning scheme to train a pose estimation network without using target domain pose labels. We also introduce a bidirectional filtering method between the predicted normalized object coordinate space (NOCS) map and observed point cloud, to not only make our teacher network more robust to the target domain but also to provide more reliable pseudo labels for the student network training. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, without leveraging target-domain GT labels, our proposed method achieved comparable or sometimes superior performance to existing methods that depend on the GT labels."}}

We achieve this by leveraging recent advances in the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) literature that learn category-level priors and fine-tune on novel objects with minimal data and time. Our insight is that we can learn a compact shape representation and extract meaningful additional information from it, such as grasping poses. We believe this to be the first work to retrieve grasping poses directly from a NeRF-based representation using a single viewpoint (RGB-only), rather than going through a secondary network and/or representation. When compared to prior art, our method is two to three orders of magnitude smaller while achieving comparable performance at view reconstruction and grasping. Accompanying our method, we also propose a new dataset of rendered shoes for training a sim-2-real NeRF method with grasping poses for different widths of grippers."}}

However, these 2D perception methods are insufficient for complete 3D world information. Concurrently, advanced 3D shape estimation approaches focus on the shape itself, without considering metric scale. These methods cannot determine the accurate location and orientation of objects. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework that jointly estimates a metric scale shape and pose from a single RGB image. Our framework has two branches: the Metric Scale Object Shape branch (MSOS) and the Normalized Object Coordinate Space branch (NOCS). The MSOS branch estimates the metric scale shape observed in the camera coordinates. The NOCS branch predicts the normalized object coordinate space (NOCS) map and performs similarity transformation with the rendered depth map from a predicted metric scale mesh to obtain 6D pose and size. Additionally, we introduce the Normalized Object Center Estimation (NOCE) to estimate the geometrically aligned distance from the camera to the object center. We validated our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate category-level object pose and shape."}}
