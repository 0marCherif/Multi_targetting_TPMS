The most successful approaches to alleviate this forgetting require extensive replay of previously seen data, which is problematic when memory constraints or data legality concerns exist. In this work, we consider the high-impact problem of Data-Free Class-Incremental Learning (DFCIL), where an incremental learning agent must learn new concepts over time without storing generators or training data from past tasks. One approach for DFCIL is to replay synthetic images produced by inverting a frozen copy of the learner's classification model, but we show this approach fails for common class-incremental benchmarks when using standard distillation strategies. We diagnose the cause of this failure and propose a novel incremental distillation strategy for DFCIL, contributing a modified cross-entropy training and importance-weighted feature distillation, and show that our method results in up to a 25.1% increase in final task accuracy (absolute difference) compared to SOTA DFCIL methods for common class-incremental benchmarks. Our method even outperforms several standard replay based methods which store a coreset of images."}}

Typical solutions for this continual learning problem require extensive rehearsal of previously seen data, which increases memory costs and may violate data privacy. Recently, the emergence of large-scale pre-trained vision transformer models has enabled prompting approaches as an alternative to data-rehearsal. These approaches rely on a key-query mechanism to generate prompts and have been found to be highly resistant to catastrophic forgetting in the well-established rehearsal-free continual learning setting. However, the key mechanism of these methods is not trained end-to-end with the task sequence. Our experiments show that this leads to a reduction in their plasticity, hence sacrificing new task accuracy, and inability to benefit from expanded parameter capacity. We instead propose to learn a set of prompt components which are assembled with input-conditioned weights to produce input-conditioned prompts, resulting in a novel attention-based end-to-end key-query scheme. Our experiments show that we outperform the current SOTA method DualPrompt on established benchmarks by as much as 4.5% in average final accuracy. We also outperform the state of art by as much as 4.4% accuracy on a continual learning benchmark which contains both class-incremental and domain-incremental task shifts, corresponding to many practical settings.

However, it has also been shown that VL models are still brittle in Structured VL Concept (SVLC) reasoning, such as the ability to recognize object attributes, states, and inter-object relations. This leads to reasoning mistakes, which need to be corrected as they occur by teaching VL models the missing SVLC skills; often this must be done using private data where the issue was found, which naturally leads to a data-free continual (no task-id) VL learning setting. In this work, we introduce the first Continual Data-Free Structured VL Concepts Learning (ConStruct-VL) benchmark and show it is challenging for many existing data-free CL strategies. We, therefore, propose a data-free method comprised of a new approach of Adversarial Pseudo-Replay (APR) which generates adversarial reminders of past tasks from past task models. To use this method efficiently, we also propose a continual parameter-efficient Layered-LoRA (LaLo) neural architecture allowing no-memory-cost access to all past models at train time. We show this approach outperforms all data-free methods by as much as ~7% while even matching some levels of experience-replay (prohibitive for applications where data-privacy must be preserved).

A major challenge for FL is data heterogeneity (where each client's data distribution can differ) as it can lead to weight divergence among local clients and slow global convergence. The current SOTA FL methods designed for data heterogeneity typically impose regularization to limit the impact of non-IID data and are stateful algorithms, i.e., they maintain local statistics over time. While effective, these approaches can only be used for a special case of FL involving only a small number of reliable clients. For the more typical applications of FL where the number of clients is large (e.g., edge-device and mobile applications), these methods cannot be applied, motivating the need for a stateless approach to heterogeneous FL which can be used for any number of clients. We derive a first-order gradient regularization to penalize inconsistent local updates due to local data heterogeneity. Specifically, to mitigate weight divergence, we introduce a first-order approximation of the global data distribution into local objectives, which intuitively penalizes updates in the opposite direction of the global update. The end result is a stateless FL algorithm that achieves 1) significantly faster convergence (i.e., fewer communication rounds) and 2) higher overall converged performance than SOTA methods under non-IID data distribution. Importantly, our approach does not impose unrealistic limits on the client size, enabling learning from a large number of clients as is typical in most FL applications."}}

Continual/lifelong learning (LL) involves minimizing catastrophic forgetting of old tasks while maximizing a model's capability to learn new tasks. This paper addresses the challenging lifelong reinforcement learning (L2RL) setting. Pushing the state-of-the-art forward in L2RL and making L2RL useful for practical applications requires more than developing individual L2RL algorithms; it requires making progress at the systems-level, especially research into the non-trivial problem of how to integrate multiple L2RL algorithms into a common framework. In this paper, we introduce the Lifelong Reinforcement Learning Components Framework (L2RLCF), which standardizes L2RL systems and assimilates different continual learning components (each addressing different aspects of the lifelong learning problem) into a unified system. As an instantiation of L2RLCF, we develop a standard API allowing easy integration of novel lifelong learning components. We describe a case study that demonstrates how multiple independently-developed LL components can be integrated into a single realized system. We also introduce an evaluation environment in order to measure the effect of combining various system components. Our evaluation environment employs different LL scenarios (sequences of tasks) consisting of Starcraft-2 minigames and allows for the fair, comprehensive, and quantitative comparison of different combinations of components within a challenging common evaluation environment."}}

Importantly, our setting, which we refer to as online few-shot continual learning, injects the well-studied issue of catastrophic forgetting into the few-shot online learning paradigm.

Our findings motivate the need for future work in this setting, which can achieve better online performance without catastrophic forgetting."}}

While recent GZSL methods have explored various techniques to leverage the capacity of these features, there has been an extensive growth of representation learning techniques that remain under-explored. In this work, we investigate the utility of different GZSL methods when using different feature extractors, and examine how these models' pre-training objectives, datasets, and architecture design affect their feature representation ability. Our results indicate that 1) methods using generative components for GZSL provide more advantages when using recent feature extractors; 2) feature extractors pre-trained using self-supervised learning objectives and knowledge distillation provide better feature representations, increasing up to 15% performance when used with recent GZSL techniques; 3) specific feature extractors pre-trained with larger datasets do not necessarily boost the performance of GZSL methods. In addition, we investigate how GZSL methods fare against CLIP, a more recent multi-modal pre-trained model with strong zero-shot performance. We found that GZSL tasks still benefit from generative-based GZSL methods along with CLIP's internet-scale pre-training to achieve state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained datasets.

While most method designs a more efficient way to facilitate knowledge transfer, less attention has been put on comparing the effect of knowledge sources such as features, logits, and gradients. This work provides a new perspective to motivate a set of knowledge distillation strategies by approximating the classical KL-divergence criteria with different knowledge sources, making a systematic comparison possible in model compression and incremental learning. Our analysis indicates that logits are generally a more efficient knowledge source and suggests that having sufficient feature dimensions is crucial for the model design, providing a practical guideline for effective KD-based transfer learning."}}
