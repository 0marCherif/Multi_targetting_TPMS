The measured entropy is a result of the materials\u2019\nmicrostructural changes that occur as degradation due to cyclic mechanical loading. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that maximum acoustic entropy emanating from materials during the course of\ndegradation remains similar. Experiments are shown for two different types of materials: Aluminum\n6061 (a metallic alloy) and glass/epoxy (a composite laminate). The evolution of the acoustic entropy\ndemonstrates a persistent trend over the course of degradation."}}

Three methods of measuring the\nAE information entropy, regarded as a direct measure of microstructural disorder, are proposed and\ncompared with traditional damage-related AE features. Several tension\u2013tension fatigue experiments\nwere performed with dogbone samples of aluminum 7075-T6, a commonly used material in aerospace\nstructures. Unlike previous studies in which fatigue damage is measured based on visible crack\ngrowth, this work investigated fatigue damage both prior to and after crack initiation through\nthe use of instantaneous elastic modulus degradation. Results show that one of the three entropy\nmeasurement methods appears to better assess the damage than the traditional AE features, whereas\nthe other two entropies have unique trends that can differentiate between small and large cracks."}}
