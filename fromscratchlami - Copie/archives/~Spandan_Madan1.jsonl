Here we present SemanticDG (Semantic Domain Generalization): a benchmark with 15 photo-realistic domains with the same geometry, scene layout and camera parameters as the popular 3D ScanNet dataset, but with controlled domain shifts in lighting, materials, and viewpoints. Using this benchmark, we investigate the impact of each of these semantic shifts on generalization independently. Visual recognition models easily generalize to novel lighting, but struggle with distribution shifts in materials and viewpoints. Inspired by human vision, we hypothesize that scene context can serve as a bridge to help models generalize across material and viewpoint domain shifts and propose a context-aware vision transformer along with a contrastive loss over material and viewpoint changes to address these domain shifts. Our approach (dubbed as CDCNet) outperforms existing domain generalization methods by over an 18% margin. As a critical benchmark, we also conduct psychophysics experiments and find that humans generalize equally well across lighting, materials and viewpoints. The benchmark and computational model introduced here help understand the challenges associated with generalization across domains and provide initial steps towards extrapolation to semantic distribution shifts. We include all data and source code in the supplement."}}

We present evidence that DNNs are capable of generalizing to objects in novel orientations by disseminating orientation-invariance obtained from familiar objects seen from many viewpoints. This capability strengthens when training the DNN with an increasing number of familiar objects, but only in orientations that involve 2D rotations of familiar orientations. We show that this dissemination is achieved via neurons tuned to common features between familiar and unfamiliar objects. These results implicate brain-like neural mechanisms for generalization."}}

The rich notion of context incorporates several aspects including physics rules, statistical co-occurrences, and relative object sizes, among others. While previous work has focused on crowd-sourced out-of-context photographs from the web to study scene context, controlling the nature and extent of contextual violations has been a daunting task. Here we introduce a diverse, synthetic Out-of-Context Dataset (OCD) with fine-grained control over scene context. By leveraging a 3D simulation engine, we systematically control the gravity, object co-occurrences and relative sizes across 36 object categories in a virtual household environment. We conducted a series of experiments to gain insights into the impact of contextual cues on both human and machine vision using OCD. We conducted psychophysics experiments to establish a human benchmark for out-of-context recognition, and then compared it with state-of-the-art computer vision models to quantify the gap between the two. We propose a context-aware recognition transformer model, fusing object and contextual information via multi-head attention. Our model captures useful information for contextual reasoning, enabling human-level performance and better robustness in out-of-context conditions compared to baseline models across OCD and other out-of-context datasets.

A promising recent strand of research investigates adversarial attacks within the training data distribution, providing a more stringent and worrisome definition for these attacks. These theories posit that the key issue is that in high dimensional datasets, most data points are close to the ground-truth class boundaries. This has been shown in theory for some simple data distributions, but it is unclear if this theory is relevant in practice. Here, we demonstrate the existence of in-distribution adversarial examples for object recognition. This result provides evidence supporting theories attributing adversarial examples to the proximity of data to ground-truth class boundaries, and calls into question other theories which do not account for this more stringent definition of adversarial attacks. These experiments are enabled by our novel gradient-free, evolutionary strategies (ES) based approach for finding in-distribution adversarial examples in 3D rendered objects, which we call CMA-Search."}}

Recent works suggest that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fail to generalize to category-viewpoint combinations not seen during training. However, it is unclear when and how such generalization may be possible. Does the number of combinations seen during training impact generalization? What architectures better enable generalization in the multi-task setting of simultaneous category and viewpoint classification? Furthermore, what are the underlying mechanisms that drive the network\u2019s generalization? In this paper, we answer these questions by analyzing state-of-the-art CNNs trained to classify both object category and 3D viewpoint, with quantitative control over the number of category-viewpoint combinations seen during training. We also investigate the emergence of two types of specialized neurons that can explain generalization to unseen combinations\u2014neurons selective to category and invariant to viewpoint, and vice versa. We perform experiments on MNIST extended with position or scale, the iLab dataset with vehicles at different viewpoints, and a challenging new dataset for car model recognition and viewpoint estimation that we introduce in this paper - the Biased-Cars dataset. Our results demonstrate that as the number of combinations seen during training increase, networks generalize better to unseen category-viewpoint combinations, facilitated by an increase in the selectivity and invariance of individual neurons. We find that learning category and viewpoint in separate networks compared to a shared one leads to an increase in selectivity and invariance, as separate networks are not forced to preserve information about both category and viewpoint. This enables separate networks to significantly outperform shared ones at classifying unseen category-viewpoint combinations."}}
