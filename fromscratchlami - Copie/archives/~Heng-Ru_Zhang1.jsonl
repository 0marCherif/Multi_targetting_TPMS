Most LDL methods only build models on the same feature (sub)space shared by all labels. However, they ignore that each label has its own specific features, and there are some common features among labels. In this paper, we propose a novel LDL (LDL-LDF) algorithm that aims to exploit both label-dependent and common features. First, label-dependent feature reconstruction utilizes thresholding for relevant sample subset identification, density peaks clustering for representative sample selection, and Euclidean distance for feature value calculation. Second, common feature reconstruction follows a similar approach, however, on the whole dataset. Finally, the prediction neural network is composed of several components that serve each label with label-dependent features, one component that serves all labels with common features, and the fusion component. The effectiveness and competitiveness of our algorithm are verified through various experiments comparing seven algorithms on fourteen real-world datasets."}}

A variety of methods have been proposed to build artificial intelligence (AI), human-like players. However, these human-like players have a limited ability to imitate the behavior of individual players. In this paper, we propose a player behavior imitation method using imitation learning under the framework of meta-learning. A generic behavior model of game players was learned from historical records using adversarial imitation learning. Then, we personalized the policy by imitating the behavior of each individual player. Convolutional neural networks were used to construct the feature extractor of game board states. The experiments were conducted using the Reversi game, and 18,000 game records of different players were used to train the generic behavior model. The behavior of each new player was learned using only hundreds of records. The results demonstrate that our method can be utilized to imitate individual behavior in terms of action similarity well."}}

Existing methods typically construct text graphs based on words-documents to capture relevant intra-class document representations among the same documents via words-words and words-documents propagation. However, a natural problem is that polysemy words in documents may become an information medium between documents of different categories, promoting heterophily information propagation. The performance of text classification will be somewhat constrained by this issue. This paper proposes a novel text classification method based on GNN from multi-granular topic-aware perspective, referred to as Text-MGNN. Specifically, topic nodes are introduced to build a triple node set of \u201cword, document, topic,\u201d and multi-granularity relations are modeled on a text graph for this triple node set. The introduction of topic nodes has three significant advantages. The first is to strengthen the propagation of topics, words, and documents. The second is to enhance class-aware representation learning. The final is to mitigate the effect of heterophily information caused by polysemy words. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets. Results validate that our proposed method outperforms 11 baselines methods."}}

Therefore, the more complex but informative label space makes it challenging to directly model the relationship between original features and label distributions. In this paper, an algorithm called Label Distribution Learning with Discriminative Instance Mapping (LDLDIM) is proposed to select a discriminative instance pool (DIP) to map the original features into a more discriminative space. First, we design a criterion that incorporates label information to quantify the discriminative power of each instance. Second, we select several instances with the highest discriminative ability to construct the DIP, and map the instances to the discriminative space through the DIP. By exploiting label information, this criterion enables the selected DIP to ensure that instances that are close (far away) in label space remain close (far away) in the discriminative space. Finally, multiple regressions for prediction are trained on the label distributions and the new features that are obtained by distance mapping with DIP. Experiments and comparisons on 16 datasets illustrate that our algorithm outperforms 6 state-of-the-art LDL methods in most cases."}}

However, LDL usually has limited available label data, which is not conducive to training deep learning models. Data augmentation refers to methods for solving limited data problems by introducing unobserved data or latent variables to increase the size and quality of the training dataset. In this paper, we augment the dataset by mapping the features and label distributions of the generated samples to the same subspace, and using the generator to learn the distribution of the original data in this space. First, we use the encoder and generator to extract effective information from sample features and label distributions, respectively. Second, we randomly fuse the existing label distribution to generate a new label distribution, then map it to the subspace and restore the corresponding features through the decoder. Finally, these generated samples are mixed with the original training set to train a model for predicting label distribution. Experimental results on nine real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithm can improve the performance of deep learning models to a certain extent."}}

This problem is challenging because behavior is multi-semantic and hard to represent. Existing work often suffers from low generalization ability and high demand for supervisory information. In this paper, we present a behavior representation learning method (BRL) for Reversi players. It learns entirely from unlabeled game records. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture to learn the mapping between states and actions. The encoder maps game records into a latent subspace for behavior representation. Second, we mask random states to force the encoder to capture the high-level features of the policy. The decoder predicts the corresponding actions according to the latent representation. Coupling these two designs, the semantic relevance of behaviors can be more effectively measured. Experiments were conducted in Reversi, using 14,000 game records of different players to learn behavior representations. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms the supervised method and shows promising scaling ability. This work opens a new way for analyzing and modeling player behavior."}}

Existing algorithms use all features to predict label distribution. However, each label is often related to part of the features, hence considering other irrelevant features may lead to deviation in both instance searching and model prediction. In this paper, we propose a new LDL algorithm by exploiting the local correlation between features and labels (LDL-LCFL). The main idea is to exploit the local correlations between features and labels, which will be used in the improved k NN algorithm for prediction. Experiments were conducted on eight well-known label distribution data sets with four distance measurements and two similarity measurements. Results show that compared with nine popular LDL methods, our algorithm's prediction ranking is superior."}}
