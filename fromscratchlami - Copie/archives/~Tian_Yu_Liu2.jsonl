Before inference, T3AR adapts a given model to the downstream task using refined pseudo-labels and a self-supervised contrastive objective function whose noise distribution leverages retrieved real samples to improve feature adaptation on the target data manifold. The retrieval of real images is key to T3AR since it does not rely solely on synthetic data augmentations to compensate for the lack of adaptation data, as typically done by other adaptation algorithms. Furthermore, thanks to the retrieval module, our method gives the user or service provider the possibility to improve model adaptation on the downstream task by incorporating further relevant data or to fully remove samples that may no longer be available due to changes in user preference after deployment. First, we show that T3AR can be used at training time to improve downstream fine-grained classification over standard fine-tuning baselines, and the fewer the adaptation data the higher the relative improvement (up to 13%). Second, we apply T3AR for test-time adaptation and show that exploiting a pool of external images at test-time leads to more robust representations over existing methods on DomainNet-126 and VISDA-C, especially when few adaptation data are available (up to 8%)."}}

The tangent plane to the specialist model acts as a generalist guide and avoids the kind of over-fitting that leads to catastrophic forgetting, while exploiting the convexity of the optimization landscape in the tangent plane. It maintains a small fixed-size memory buffer, as low as 0.4% of the source datasets, which is updated by simple resampling. Our method achieves state-of-the-art across various buffer sizes for different datasets. Specifically, in the class-incremental setting we outperform the existing methods that do not require distillation by an average of 18.77% and 28.48%, for Seq-CIFAR-10 and Seq-TinyImageNet respectively. Our method can easily be combined with existing replay-based continual learning methods. When memory buffer constraints are relaxed to allow storage of metadata such as logits, we attain state-of-the-art accuracy with an error reduction of 17.84% towards the paragon performance on Seq-CIFAR-10."}}

We present a method to craft a single set of perturbations that, when added to any stereo image pair in a dataset, can fool a stereo network to significantly alter the perceived scene geometry. Our perturbation images are \u201cuniversal\u201d in that they not only corrupt estimates of the network on the dataset they are optimized for, but also generalize to different architectures trained on different datasets. We evaluate our approach on multiple benchmark datasets where our perturbations can increase the D1-error (akin to fooling rate) of state-of-the-art stereo networks from 1% to as much as 87%. We investigate the effect of perturbations on the estimated scene geometry and identify object classes that are most vulnerable. Our analysis on the activations of registered points between left and right images led us to find architectural components that can increase robustness against adversaries. By simply designing networks with such components, one can reduce the effect of adversaries by up to 60.5%, which rivals the robustness of networks finetuned with costly adversarial data augmentation. Our design principle also improves their robustness against common image corruptions by an average of 70%."}}

In order to leverage existing models (teachers) that produce putative depth maps, we propose an adaptive knowledge distillation approach that yields a positive congruent training process, wherein a student model avoids learning the error modes of the teachers. In the absence of ground truth for model selection and training, our method, termed Monitored Distillation, allows a student to exploit a blind ensemble of teachers by selectively learning from predictions that best minimize the reconstruction error for a given image. Monitored Distillation yields a distilled depth map and a confidence map, or \u201cmonitor\u201d, for how well a prediction from a particular teacher fits the observed image. The monitor adaptively weights the distilled depth where if all of the teachers exhibit high residuals, the standard unsupervised image reconstruction loss takes over as the supervisory signal. On indoor scenes (VOID), we outperform blind ensembling baselines by 17.53% and unsupervised methods by 24.25%; we boast a 79% model size reduction while maintaining comparable performance to the best supervised method. For outdoors (KITTI), we tie for 5th overall on the benchmark despite not using ground truth. Code available at: https://github.com/alexklwong/mondi-python ."}}
