In this paper, we propose the geometry-aware guided loss (GAGL) that enhances\nthe discrimination ability and is only applied in the training stage without extra computation and memory during inference. The GAGL consists of the feature-based geometryaware projected gradient descent method (FGA-PGD) that\napproximates the geometric distances of the features to the\nclass boundaries, and the geometry-aware update rule that\nlearns an anchor of each class as the approximation of the\nfeature expected to have the largest geometric distance to\nthe corresponding class boundary. Then the discriminative\npower can be enhanced by minimizing the distances between the features and their corresponding class anchors\nin the feature space. To address the limited availability of\nrelated benchmarks, we collect a fully annotated dataset,\nnamely, NPP2021, which involves inconsistent cracks and\nnoisy backgrounds in real-world nuclear power plants. Our\nproposed GAGL outperforms the state of the arts on various\nbenchmark datasets including CRACK2019, SDNET2018,\nand our NPP2021."}}
