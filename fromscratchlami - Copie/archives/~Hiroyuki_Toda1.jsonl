People intensify activities that come to lie within the reach of their reference point, and abstain from acts that would incur losses once they've crossed the point. However, the impact of past experiences on decision making around the reference point has not been well studied. By analyzing a long series of user-level decisions gathered from a competitive programming website, we find that history has a clear impact on user's decision making around the reference point. Past experiences can strengthen, and sometimes weaken, the decision bias around the reference point. Experiences of past difficulties can strengthen the tendency towards loss aversion after achieving the reference point. When a person crosses a reference point for the first time, the cognitive decision bias is significant. However, repeating this crossing gradually weakens the effect. We also show the value of our insights in the task of predicting user behavior. Prediction models incorporating our insights may be used for motivating people to remain more active."}}

Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference of unobserved variables under given observations is one of the essential operations in CGM. Because the MAP inference problem is known to be NP-hard in general, the current mainstream approach is to solve an alternative problem obtained by approximating the objective function and applying continuous relaxation. However, this approach has two significant drawbacks. First, the quality of the solution deteriorates when the values in the count data are negligible due to the inaccuracy of Stirling\u2019s approximation. Second, the application of continuous relaxation causes the violation of integrality constraints. This paper proposes novel algorithms for MAP inference in CGMs on path graphs to overcome these problems. Our method is based on the discrete difference of convex algorithm (DCA); DCA is a general framework to minimize the sum of a convex function and a concave function by repeatedly minimizing surrogate functions. Utilizing the particular structure of path graphs, we efficiently solve the surrogate function minimization by minimum convex cost flow algorithms. Furthermore, our approach also leads to a new method of solving another important task; MAP inference of the sample size in CGM on path graphs. Our method is naturally applicable to this task, allowing us to design very efficient algorithms. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."}}

In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating Markov chain parameters from censored transition data. Our parameter estimation method utilizes the theory of the censored Markov chain, the Markov chain that has unobservable states. Our problem formulation can be seen as the inverse of existing studies that construct censored Markov chains from (original) Markov chains and unobservable states. We confirm the effectiveness of the proposal by experiments on synthetic and real data sets."}}

The aggregate data are associated not with points but with supports (e.g., spatial regions in a city). Since the supports may have various granularities depending on attributes (e.g., poverty rate and crime rate), modeling such data is not straightforward. This article offers a multi-output Gaussian process (MoGP) model that infers functions for attributes using multiple aggregate datasets of respective granularities. In the proposed model, the function for each attribute is assumed to be a dependent GP modeled as a linear mixing of independent latent GPs. We design an observation model with an aggregation process for each attribute; the process is an integral of the GP over the corresponding support. We also introduce a prior distribution of the mixing weights, which allows a knowledge transfer across domains (e.g., cities) by sharing the prior. This is advantageous in such a situation where the spatially aggregated dataset in a city is too coarse to interpolate; the proposed model can still make accurate predictions of attributes by utilizing aggregate datasets in other cities. The inference of the proposed model is based on variational Bayes, which enables one to learn the model parameters using the aggregate datasets from multiple domains. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms in the task of refining coarse-grained aggregate data on real-world datasets: Time series of air pollutants in Beijing and various kinds of spatial datasets from New York City and Chicago."}}

Predicting such events and revealing the underlying triggering patterns are a crucial task for many applications, ranging from disease control to global politics. Traditional event prediction models based on Hawkes processes capture the spatio-temporal relationships between events, but cannot incorporate complex and heterogeneous external features, including population distribution, weather and terrain. This paper proposes an event prediction method that effectively utilizes the rich external information present in sets of unstructured data (e.g., map images, satellite images and weather map). Specifically, we extend a convolutional neural network (CNN) by combining it with continuous kernel convolution; and design the conditional intensity of Hawkes process based on the extended neural network model that accepts images as its input. Our approach of using the continuous convolution kernel provides a flexible way to discover the complex effect of external factors on the triggering process, as well as yielding tractable optimization algorithms. We use real-world event data from different domains (i.e., disease outbreaks, armed conflicts and protests) to demonstrate that the proposed method has better prediction performance than existing methods."}}

The main approaches to realize fast inference via an autoregressive model are 1) a subband-based vocoder and 2) multiple samples prediction. Our previous work demonstrated that the combination worked well up to two samples simultaneous generation without quality degradation. To further increase the number of simultaneous samples while maintaining quality, we focus on the existence of an association between subband signals and multiple samples. Our proposed vocoder jointly models these associations with a multivariate Gaussian. Experimentals show that our proposed four-sample vocoder is 1.47 times faster than the conventional two-sample equivalent. For both the acoustic features extracted from natural speech and those predicted by TTS, the proposed method realizes generation with up to four samples without any significant degradation in naturalness. This vocoder also matched the naturalness comparable of the two-sample conventional method."}}

Collective Graphical Model (CGM) is a probabilistic approach to the analysis of aggregated data. One of the most important operations in CGM is maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference of unobserved variables under given observations. Because the MAP inference problem for general CGMs has been shown to be NP-hard, an approach that solves an approximate problem has been proposed. However, this approach has two major drawbacks. First, the quality of the solution deteriorates when the values in the count tables are small, because the approximation becomes inaccurate. Second, since continuous relaxation is applied, the integrality constraints of the output are violated. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes a new method for MAP inference for CGMs on path graphs. Our method is based on the Difference of Convex Algorithm (DCA), which is a general methodology to minimize a function represented as the sum of a convex function and a concave function. In our algorithm, important subroutines in DCA can be efficiently calculated by minimum convex cost flow algorithms. Experiments show that the proposed method outputs higher quality solutions than the conventional approach. "}}
