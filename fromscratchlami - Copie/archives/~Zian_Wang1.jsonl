Recent NeRF based methods achieve impressive fidelity of 3D reconstruction, but bake the lighting and shadows into the radiance field, while mesh-based methods that facilitate intrinsic decomposition through differentiable rendering have not yet scaled to the complexity and scale of outdoor scenes. We present a novel inverse rendering framework for large urban scenes capable of jointly reconstructing the scene geometry, spatially-varying materials, and HDR lighting from a set of posed RGB images with optional depth. Specifically, we use a neural field to account for the primary rays, and use an explicit mesh (reconstructed from the underlying neural field) for modeling secondary rays that produce higher-order lighting effects such as cast shadows. By faithfully disentangling complex geometry and materials from lighting effects, our method enables photorealistic relighting with specular and shadow effects on several outdoor datasets. Moreover, it supports physics-based scene manipulations such as virtual object insertion with ray-traced shadow casting."}}

NFL combines the rendering power of neural fields with a detailed, physically motivated model of the LiDAR sensing process, thus enabling it to accurately reproduce key sensor behaviors like beam divergence, secondary returns, and ray dropping. We evaluate NFL on synthetic and real LiDAR scans and show that it outperforms explicit reconstruct-then-simulate methods as well as other NeRF-style methods on LiDAR novel view synthesis task. Moreover, we show that the improved realism of the synthesized views narrows the domain gap to real scans and translates to better registration and semantic segmentation performance."}}

Existing works on outdoor lighting estimation typically simplify the scene lighting into an environment map which cannot capture the spatially-varying lighting effects in outdoor scenes. In this work, we propose a neural approach that estimates the 5D HDR light field from a single image, and a differentiable object insertion formulation that enables end-to-end training with image-based losses that encourage realism. Specifically, we design a hybrid lighting representation tailored to outdoor scenes, which contains an HDR sky dome that handles the extreme intensity of the sun, and a volumetric lighting representation that models the spatially-varying appearance of the surrounding scene. With the estimated lighting, our shadow-aware object insertion is fully differentiable, which enables adversarial training over the composited image to provide additional supervisory signal to the lighting prediction. We experimentally demonstrate that our hybrid lighting representation is more performant than existing outdoor lighting estimation methods. We further show the benefits of our AR object insertion in an autonomous driving application, where we obtain performance gains for a 3D object detector when trained on our augmented data."}}

Most existing methods formulate the task as image-to-image translation, ignoring the 3D properties of the scene. However, indoor scenes contain complex 3D light transport where a 2D representation is insufficient. In this paper, we propose a unified, learning-based inverse rendering framework that formulates 3D spatially-varying lighting. Inspired by classic volume rendering techniques, we propose a novel Volumetric Spherical Gaussian representation for lighting, which parameterizes the exitant radiance of the 3D scene surfaces on a voxel grid. We design a physics-based differentiable renderer that utilizes our 3D lighting representation, and formulates the energy-conserving image formation process that enables joint training of all intrinsic properties with the re-rendering constraint. Our model ensures physically correct predictions and avoids the need for ground-truth HDR lighting which is not easily accessible. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior works both quantitatively and qualitatively, and is capable of producing photorealistic results for AR applications such as virtual object insertion even for highly specular objects."}}

We argue that deforming the grid to better align with the high-frequency image content is a more effective strategy. We introduce Deformable Grid (DefGrid), a learnable neural network module that predicts location offsets of vertices of a 2-dimensional triangular grid, such that the edges of the deformed grid align with image boundaries. We showcase our DefGrid in a variety of use cases, i.e., by inserting it as a module at various levels of processing. We utilize DefGrid as an end-to-end learnable geometric downsampling layer that replaces standard pooling methods for reducing feature resolution when feeding images into a deep CNN. We show significantly improved results at the same grid resolution compared to using CNNs on uniform grids for the task of semantic segmentation. We also utilize DefGrid at the output layers for the task of object mask annotation, and show that reasoning about object boundaries on our predicted polygonal grid leads to more accurate results over existing pixel-wise and curve-based approaches. We finally showcase DefGrid as a standalone module for unsupervised image partitioning, showing superior performance over existing approaches.
