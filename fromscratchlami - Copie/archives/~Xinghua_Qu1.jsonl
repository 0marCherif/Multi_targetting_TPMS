Due to the fact that policy resilience is an add-on concern to RL algorithms, it must be resource-efficient, time-conserving, and widely applicable without compromising the performance of RL algorithms.\nThis paper proposes such a policy-resilience mechanism based on an idea of sharing the environment knowledge. We summarize the policy resilience as three stages: preparation, diagnosis, recovery. Specifically, we design the mechanism as a federated architecture coupled with a meta-learning approach, pursuing an efficient extraction and sharing of environment knowledge. With the shared knowledge, a poisoned agent can quickly identify the deployment condition and accordingly recover its policy performance. We empirically evaluate the resilience mechanism for both model-based and model-free RL algorithms, showing its effectiveness and efficiency in restoring the deployment performance of a poisoned policy."}}

However, within these apps, the possible unauthorised or malicious image forwarding among users poses significant threats to personal image privacy. In specific situations, we hope to send private and confidential images (e.g., personal selfies) in an `only for you' manner. Given limited existing studies on this topic, for the first time, we propose the Deep Neural Anti-Forwarding Watermark (DeepRAFT) that enables media platforms to check and block any unauthorised forwarding of protected images through injecting non-fragile and invisible watermarks. To this end, we jointly train a DeepRAFT encoder and scanner, where the encoder embeds a confidentiality stamp into images as watermarks, and the scanner learns to detect them.\nTo ensure that the technique is robust and resistant to tampering, we involve a series of data augmentations (mounted on a stochastic concatenation process) and adversarial defenses (i.e., adversarial training and randomized smoothing) towards both common image corruptions (e.g., rotation, cropping, color jitters, defocus blur, perspective warping, pixel noise, JPEG compression) and adversarial attacks (i.e., under both black and white box settings). Experiments on Mirflickr and MetFaces datasets demonstrate that DeepRAFT can efficiently and robustly imbue and detect the anti-forwarding watermark in images. Moreover, the trained DeepRAFT encoder and scanner can be easily transferred in a zero-shot manner even with a significant domain shift. We release our code and models to inspire studies in this anti-forwarding area at \\url{link.available.upon.acceptance.}"}}

At each time stage, a new domain emerges and is taken as the target domain while all the domains in previous time stages are taken as source domains. We propose a transfer Gaussian process model GPdk with a novel dynamic transfer kernel DyTK to handle the dynamic transfer regression problem. Specifically, DyTK is with a sequential form to fit the domain stream. To adaptively control the knowledge transfer strength, DyTK is designed to be capable of modeling the inter-domain relatedness of every inter-domain pair. A theorem that ensures DyTK to be positive semi-definite is then proposed. We also theoretically analyze the transfer performance of GPdk by deriving its generalization error bounds. The error bounds further motivate us to propose a parameter reuse strategy to alleviate the scalability issue of GPdk along time. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of GPdk in handling dynamic transfer regression problems."}}

In this work, for the first time, we tackle it from a disentanglement view. Our key idea is to handle the spatial and temporal domain divergence separately through disentanglement. Specifically, we consider the generation of cross-domain videos from two sets of latent factors, one encoding the static information and another encoding the dynamic information. A Transfer Sequential VAE (TranSVAE) framework is then developed to model such generation. To better serve for adaptation, we propose several objectives to constrain the latent factors. With these constraints, the spatial divergence can be readily removed by disentangling the static domain-specific information out, and the temporal divergence is further reduced from both frame- and video-levels through adversarial learning. Extensive experiments on the UCF-HMDB, Jester, and Epic-Kitchens datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of TranSVAE compared with several state-of-the-art methods. The code with reproducible results is publicly accessible."}}

Current research on bundle recommendation is limited by: (1) noisy datasets, where bundles are defined by heuristics, e.g., products co-purchased in the same session; and (2) specific tasks, holding unrealistic assumptions, e.g., the availability of bundles for recommendation directly. In this paper, we propose to take a step back and consider the process of bundle recommendation from a holistic user experience perspective. We first construct high-quality bundle datasets with rich meta information, particularly bundle intents, through a carefully designed crowd-sourcing task. We then define a series of tasks that together, support all key steps in a typical bundle recommendation process, from bundle detection, completion, ranking, to explanation and auto-naming. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and in-depth analysis that demonstrate the challenges of bundle recommendation, arising from the need for capturing complex relations among users, products, and bundles, as well as the research opportunities, especially in graph-based neural methods. To sum up, our study delivers new data sources, opens up new research directions, and provides useful guidance for product bundling in real e-commerce platforms.

Most existing approaches for generating adversarial attacks are gradient based and are extensive, viz., perturbing every pixel of every frame. In contrast, recent advances show that gradient-free selective perturbations (i.e., attacking only selected pixels and frames) could be a more realistic adversary. However, these attacks treat every frame in isolation, ignoring the relationship between neighboring states of a Markov decision process; thus resulting in high computational complexity that tends to limit their real-world plausibility due to the tight time constraint in RL. Given the above, this article showcases the first study of how transferability across frames could be exploited for boosting the creation of minimal yet powerful attacks in image-based RL. To this end, we introduce three types of frame-correlation transfers (FCTs) (i.e., anterior case transfer, random projection-based transfer, and principal components-based transfer) with varying degrees of computational complexity in generating adversaries via a genetic algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the tradeoff between the complexity and potency of the transfer mechanism by exploring four fully trained state-of-the-art policies on six Atari games. Our FCTs dramatically speed up the attack generation compared to existing methods, often reducing the computation time required to nearly zero; thus, shedding light on the real threat of real-time attacks in RL."}}

Existing works focus on the minimization of global domain divergence. However, two domains may consist of several shared subdomains, and differ from each other in each subdomain. In this article, we take the local divergence of subdomains into account in transfer. Specifically, we propose to use the low-dimensional manifold to represent the subdomain, and align the local data distribution discrepancy in each manifold across domains. A manifold maximum mean discrepancy (M3D) is developed to measure the local distribution discrepancy in each manifold. We then propose a general framework, called transfer with manifolds discrepancy alignment (TMDA), to couple the discovery of data manifolds with the minimization of M3D. We instantiate TMDA in the subspace learning case considering both the linear and nonlinear mappings. We also instantiate TMDA in the deep learning framework. Experimental studies show that TMDA is a promising method for various transfer learning tasks."}}
