However, existing approaches to fair PCA have two main problems: theoretically, there has been no statistical foundation of fair PCA in terms of learnability; practically, limited memory prevents us from using existing approaches, as they explicitly rely on full access to the entire data. On the theoretical side, we rigorously formulate fair PCA using a new notion called probably approximately fair and optimal (PAFO) learnability. On the practical side, motivated by recent advances in streaming algorithms for addressing memory limitation, we propose a new setting called fair streaming PCA along with a memory-efficient algorithm, fair noisy power method (FNPM). We then provide its statistical guarantee in terms of PAFO-learnability, which is the first of its kind in fair PCA literature. We verify our algorithm in the CelebA dataset without any pre-processing; while the existing approaches are inapplicable due to memory limitations, by turning it into a streaming setting, we show that our algorithm performs fair PCA efficiently and effectively."}}

In principle, off-policy RL algorithms can improve sample efficiency by allowing multiple updates per environment interaction. However, these multiple updates often lead to overfitting, which decreases the network's ability to adapt to new data. We conduct an empirical analysis of this challenge and find that generalizability and plasticity constitute different roles in improving the model's adaptability. In response, we propose a combined usage of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) and a reset mechanism. SAM seeks wide, smooth minima, improving generalization, while the reset mechanism, through periodic reinitialization of the last few layers, consistently injects plasticity into the model. Through extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate that this combined usage improves sample efficiency and computational cost on the Atari-100k and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks."}}

Most practical implementations of SGDA randomly reshuffle components and sequentially use them (i.e., without-replacement sampling); however, there are few theoretical results on this approach for minimax algorithms, especially outside the easier-to-analyze (strongly-)monotone setups. To narrow this gap, we study the convergence bounds of SGDA with random reshuffling (SGDA-RR) for smooth nonconvex-nonconcave objectives with Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (P{\\L}) geometry. We analyze both simultaneous and alternating SGDA-RR for nonconvex-P{\\L} and primal-P{\\L}-P{\\L} objectives, and obtain convergence rates faster than with-replacement SGDA. Our rates extend to mini-batch SGDA-RR, recovering known rates for full-batch gradient descent-ascent (GDA). Lastly, we present a comprehensive lower bound for GDA with an arbitrary step-size ratio, which matches the full-batch upper bound for the primal-P{\\L}-P{\\L} case."}}
