Prior works mostly rely on pre-trained linguistic mod- els, but a text is often too abstract to properly specify all the spatial properties of an image, e.g., the layout config- uration of a scene, leading to the sub-optimal results of complex scene generation. In this paper, we achieve ac- curate complex scene generation by proposing a seman- tically controllable Layout-AWare diffusion model, termed LAW-Diffusion. Distinct from the previous Layout-to-Image generation (L2I) methods that primarily explore category- aware relationships, LAW-Diffusion introduces a spatial de- pendency parser to encode the location-aware semantic co- herence across objects as a layout embedding and produces a scene with perceptually harmonious object styles and con- textual relations. To be specific, we delicately instantiate each object\u2019s regional semantics as an object region map and leverage a location-aware cross-object attention mod- ule to capture the spatial dependencies among those dis- entangled representations. We further propose an adap- tive guidance schedule for our layout guidance to mitigate the trade-off between the regional semantic alignment and the texture fidelity of generated objects. Moreover, LAW- Diffusion allows for instance reconfiguration while main- taining the other regions in a synthesized image by introduc- ing a layout-aware latent grafting mechanism to recompose its local regional semantics. To better verify the plausibil- ity of generated scenes, we propose a new evaluation metric for the L2I task, dubbed Scene Relation Score (SRS) to mea- sure how the images preserve the rational and harmonious relations among contextual objects. Comprehensive ex- periments on COCO-Stuff and Visual-Genome demonstrate that our LAW-Diffusion yields the state-of-the-art genera- tive performance, especially with coherent object relations."}}

Since DSMAD has been formulated as a Markov decision-making process, many studies apply reinforcement learning methods to solve it. Unfortunately, existing works solely rely on simple diagnostic accuracy to justify the effectiveness of their DSMAD agents while ignoring the medical rationality of the inquiring process. From the perspective of medical application, it's critical to develop an agent that is able to produce reliable and convincing diagnosing processes and also is robust in making diagnosis facing noisy interaction with patients. To this end, we propose a novel DSMAD agent, INS-DS (Introspective Diagnosis System) comprising of two separate yet cooperative modules, i.e., an inquiry module for proposing symptom-inquiries and an introspective module for deciding when to inform a disease. INS-DS is inspired by the introspective decision-making process of human, where the inquiry module first proposes the most valuable symptom inquiry, and then the introspective module intervenes the potential responses of this inquiry and decides to inquire only if the diagnoses of these interventions vary."}}

Despite some successes witnessed in learning SAT (Boolean Satisfiability) solvers for propositional logic via Graph Neural Networks (GNN),  there haven't been any successes in learning solvers for more complex predicate logic. In this paper, we target the QBF (Quantified Boolean Formula) satisfiability problem, the complexity of which is in-between propositional logic and predicate logic, and investigate the feasibility of learning GNN-based solvers and GNN-based heuristics for the cases with a universal-existential quantifier alternation (so-called 2QBF problems).\n\nWe conjecture, with empirical support, that GNNs have certain limitations in learning 2QBF solvers, primarily due to the inability to reason about a set of assignments. Then we show the potential of GNN-based heuristics in CEGAR-based solvers and explore the interesting challenges to generalize them to larger problem instances. In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive surveying view of applying GNN-based embeddings to 2QBF problems and aims to offer insights in applying machine learning tools to more complicated symbolic reasoning problems.\n"}}

The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is applied by default, yet conventionally causes the unstable training energy that wrecks the generated structures, which remains unexplained. In this paper, we provide a new theoretical insight to analyze FRAME, from a perspective of particle physics ascribing the weird phenomenon to KL-vanishing issue. In order to stabilize the energy dissipation, we propose an alternative Wasserstein distance in discrete time based on the conclusion that the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) discrete flow approximates KL discrete flow when the time step size tends to 0. Besides, this metric can still maintain the model\u2019s statistical consistency. Quantitative and qualitative experiments have been respectively conducted on several widely used datasets. The empirical studies have evidenced the effectiveness and superiority of our method."}}

Learning domain-invariant features helps to achieve this goal, whereas it underpins unlabeled samples drawn from a single or multiple explicit target domains (Multi-target DA). In this paper, we consider a more realistic transfer scenario: our target domain is comprised of multiple sub-targets implicitly blended with each other so that learners could not identify which sub-target each unlabeled sample belongs to. This Blending-target Domain Adaptation (BTDA) scenario commonly appears in practice and threatens the validities of existing DA algorithms, due to the presence of domain gaps and categorical misalignments among these hidden sub-targets. To reap the transfer performance gains in this new scenario, we propose Adversarial Meta-Adaptation Network (AMEAN). AMEAN entails two adversarial transfer learning processes. The first is a conventional adversarial transfer to bridge our source and mixed target domains. To circumvent the intra-target category misalignment, the second process presents as \"learning to adapt\": It deploys an unsupervised meta-learner receiving target data and their ongoing feature-learning feedbacks, to discover target clusters as our \"meta-sub-target\" domains. This meta-sub-targets auto-design our meta-sub-target adaptation loss, which is capable to progressively eliminate the implicit category mismatching in our mixed target. We evaluate AMEAN and a variety of DA algorithms in three benchmarks under the BTDA setup. Empirical results show that BTDA is a quite challenging transfer setup for most existing DA algorithms, yet AMEAN significantly outperforms these state-of-the-art baselines and effectively restrains the negative transfer effects in BTDA."}}

These coaching manners are blind to the coherent structures among examples, categories, and tasks, which are pregnant with more knowledgeable curriculum-routed teachers. In this paper, we propose a general methodology \\emph{Teaching to Teach} (T2T). T2T is facilitated by \\emph{Structured Dark Knowledge} (SDK) that constitutes a communication protocol between structured knowledge prior and teaching strategies. On one hand, SDK adaptively extracts structured knowledge by selecting a training subset consistent with the previous teaching decisions. On the other hand, SDK teaches curriculum-agnostic teachers by transferring this knowledge to update their teaching policy. This virtuous cycle can be flexibly-deployed in most existing CL platforms and more importantly, very generic across various structured knowledge characteristics, e.g., diversity, complementarity, and causality. We evaluate T2T across different learners, teachers, and tasks, which significantly demonstrates that structured knowledge can be inherited by the teachers to further benefit learners' training.\n"}}

Whereas in practical scenario, labeled instances are typically collected from diverse sources. Moreover, those sources may not completely share their categories, which further brings a category shift challenge to multi-source (unsupervised) domain adaptation (MDA). In this paper, we propose a deep cocktail network (DCTN), to battle the domain and category shifts among multiple sources. Motivated by the theoretical results in cite{mansour2009domain}, the target distribution can be represented as the weighted combination of source distributions, and, the training of MDA via DCTN is then performed as two alternating steps: i) It deploys multi-way adversarial learning to minimize the discrepancy between the target and each of the multiple source domains, which also obtains the source-specific perplexity scores to denote the possibilities that a target sample belongs to different source domains. ii) The multi-source category classifiers are integrated with the perplexity scores to classify target sample, and the pseudo-labeled target samples together with source samples are utilized to update the multi-source category classifier and the representation module. We evaluate DCTN in three domain adaptation benchmarks, which clearly demonstrate the superiority of our framework."}}
