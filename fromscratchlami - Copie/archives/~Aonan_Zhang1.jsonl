We first prove that, with imbalanced data, the available information about unknown parameters is only tied to the relatively small number of positive instances, which justifies the usage of negative sampling. However, if the negative instances are subsampled to the same level of the positive cases, there is information loss. To maintain more information, we derive the asymptotic distribution of a general inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimator and obtain the optimal sampling probability that minimizes its variance. To further improve the estimation efficiency over the IPW method, we propose a likelihood-based estimator by correcting log odds for the sampled data and prove that the improved estimator has the smallest asymptotic variance among a large class of estimators. It is also more robust to pilot misspecification. We validate our approach on simulated data as well as a real click-through rate dataset with more than 0.3 trillion instances, collected over a period of a month. Both theoretical and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}}

However, the estimation of an unknown phase using this scheme is still missing. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an ab initio phase estimation at the shot noise limit using on\u2013off measurement and efficient Bayesian inference algorithm. The performance of the schemes with and without real-time feedback control is compared. The scheme with feedback control eliminates the ambiguity in the phase estimation and accelerates the convergence to true value. The shot noise limit that defines the ultimate precision is saturated independent of the true phase after about 150 rounds of measurement and feedback control. Our protocol may find important applications in practical precision metrology when only a limited number of measurements are allowed."}}

Though much research has concentrated on predicting entity-entity relationships in homogeneous networks, it has attracted increasing attentions to predict relationships in heterogeneous networks, which consist of multiple types of nodes and relational links. Existing work on heterogeneous network link prediction mainly focuses on using input features that are explicitly extracted by humans. This paper presents an approach to automatically learn latent features from partially observed heterogeneous networks, with a particular focus on entity-attribute networks (EANs), and making predictions for unseen pairs. To make the latent features discriminative, we adopt the max-margin idea under the framework of maximum entropy discrimination (MED). Our maximum entropy discrimination joint relational model (MED-JRM) can jointly predict entity-entity relationships as well as the missing attributes of entities in EANs. Experimental results on several real networks demonstrate that our model has improved performance over state-of-the-art homogeneous and heterogeneous network link prediction algorithms."}}

In order to deal with massive data collections and dynamic text streams, probabilistic online topic models such as online latent Dirichlet allocation (OLDA) have recently been developed. However, due to normalization constraints, OLDA can be ineffective in controlling the sparsity of discovered representations, a desirable property for learning interpretable semantic patterns, especially when the total number of topics is large. In contrast, sparse topical coding (STC) has been successfully introduced as a non-probabilistic topic model for effectively discovering sparse latent patterns by using sparsity-inducing regularization. But, unfortunately STC cannot scale to very large datasets or deal with online text streams, partly due to its batch learning procedure. In this paper, we present a sparse online topic model, which directly controls the sparsity of latent semantic patterns by imposing sparsity-inducing regularization and learns the topical dictionary by an online algorithm. The online algorithm is efficient and guaranteed to converge. Extensive empirical results of the sparse online topic model as well as its collapsed and supervised extensions on a large-scale Wikipedia dataset and the medium-sized 20Newsgroups dataset demonstrate appealing performance."}}
