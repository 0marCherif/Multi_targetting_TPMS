In addition to the everyday utilization of AI assistants, many users engage them with playful shopping requests, gauging their ability to understand \u2013 or simply seeking amusement. However, these requests are often not being responded to in the same playful manner, causing dissatisfaction and even trust issues. In this work, we focus on equipping AI assistants with the ability to respond in a playful manner to irrational shopping requests. We first evaluate several neural generation models, which lead to unsuitable results \u2013 showing that this task is non-trivial. We devise a simple, yet effective, solution, that utilizes a knowledge graph to generate template-based responses grounded with commonsense. While the commonsense-aware solution is slightly less diverse than the generative models, it provides better responses to playful requests. This emphasizes the gap in commonsense exhibited by neural language models."}}

One notable example is playful requests: for example, people ask their CAs personal questions (\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d) or joke with them, sometimes at their expense (\u201cFind Nemo\u201d). Failing to recognize playfulness causes user dissatisfaction and abandonment, destroying the precious rapport with the CA. Today, playful CA behavior is achieved through manually curated replies to hard-coded questions. We take a step towards understanding and scaling playfulness by characterizing playful opportunities. To map the problem\u2019s landscape, we draw inspiration from humor theories and analyze real user data. We present a taxonomy of playful requests and explore its prevalence in real Alexa traffic. We hope to inspire new avenues towards more human-like CAs."}}

Yet, they still struggle with playful utterances, which are not meant to be interpreted literally. Examples include jokes or absurd requests or questions such as, \"Are you afraid of the dark?\", \"Who let the dogs out?\", or \"Order a zillion gummy bears\". Today, virtual assistants often return irrelevant answers to such utterances, except for hard-coded ones addressed by canned replies. To address the challenge of automatically detecting playful utterances, we first characterize the different types of playful human-virtual assistant interaction. We introduce a taxonomy of playful requests rooted in theories of humor and refined by analyzing real-world traffic from Alexa. We then focus on one node, personification, where users refer to the virtual assistant as a person (\"What do you do for fun?\"). Our conjecture is that understanding such utterances will improve user experience with virtual assistants. We conducted a Wizard-of-Oz user study and showed that endowing virtual assistant s with the ability to identify humorous opportunities indeed has the potential to increase user satisfaction. We hope this work will contribute to the understanding of the landscape of the problem and inspire novel ideas and techniques towards the vision of giving virtual assistants a sense of humor."}}
