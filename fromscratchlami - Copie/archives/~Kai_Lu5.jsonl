However, these techniques generalize poorly to unseen objects. We conjecture that this is due to the high-dimensional action space for joint control. In this paper, we take an alternative approach and separate the task of learning \u2018what to do\u2019 from \u2018how to do it\u2019 i.e., whole-body control. We pose the RL problem as one of determining the skill dynamics for a disembodied virtual manipulator interacting with articulated objects. The whole-body robotic kinematic control is optimized to execute the high-dimensional joint motion to reach the goals in the workspace. It does so by solving a quadratic programming (QP) model with robotic singularity and kinematic constraints. Our experiments on manipulating complex articulated objects show that the proposed approach is more generalizable to unseen objects with large intra-class variations, outperforming previous approaches. The evaluation results indicate that our approach generates more compliant robotic motion and outperforms the pure RL and IL baselines in task success rates.

A point-based surface representation and an inhomogeneous, nonlinear force response model are learned from a robotic arm acquiring force-displacement curves from a small number of poking interactions. The simulator then estimates displacement and force response when the deformable object is in contact with an arbitrary rigid object. It does so by estimating displacements by solving a Hertzian contact model, and sums the expected forces at individual surface points through querying the learned point stiffness models as a function of their expected displacements. Experiments on a variety of challenging objects show that our approach learns force response with sufficient accuracy to generate plausible contact response for novel rigid objects."}}

A popular strategy is to directly detect the graspable region for specific end-effector such as suction cup, two-fingered gripper or multi-fingered hand. However, those work usually depends on the accurate object detection and precise pose estimation. Very recently, affordance map which describes the action possibilities that an environment can offer, begins to be used for grasp tasks. But it often fails in cluttered environments and degrades the efficiency of warehouse automation. In this paper, we establish an active exploration framework for robot grasp and design a deep reinforcement learning method. To verify the effectiveness, we develop a new composite hand which combines the suction cup and fingers and the experimental validations on robotic grasp tasks show the advantages of the active exploration method. This novel method significantly improves the grasp efficiency of the warehouse manipulators."}}
