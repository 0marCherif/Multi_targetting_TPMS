In real-world scenarios, a decision-maker needs to solve his/her problem iteratively until he/she satisfies solutions, but such an iterative process remains challenging. This paper studies a new explainable framework, particularly for finding meeting points, which is a key optimization problem for designing facility locations. Our framework automatically fills the gap between its input instance and instances from which a user could obtain the desired outcome, where computed solutions are judged by the user. The framework also provides users with explanations, representing the difference of instances for deeply understanding the process and its inside. Explanations are clues for users to understand their situation and implement suggested results in practice (e.g., designing a coupon for free travel). We experimentally demonstrate that our search-based framework is promising to solve instances with generating explanations in a sequential decision-making process."}}

It is necessary for the route-level coordination as well as trajectory-level coordination to solve conflicts among vehicles in congested situations. The multi-agent path finding problem (MAPF) has been studied to efficiently find collision-free paths (i.e., routes) on a graph for a large number of agents. However, the paths cannot be applied for CAVs because the vehicle's kinematic constraints are not considered in the standard MAPF. This paper proposes a new variant of MAPF that considers the orientation and dimensions for CAVs by extending the graph structure and collision definition to obtain paths that can generate feasible trajectories in the real world. The proposed MAPF is formulated by a network flow problem approach using 0-1 integer linear programming. A trajectory generation based on the paths by MAPF is also implemented and the feasibility of the paths are confirmed by simulations for CAVs."}}

For instance, vehicle platooning on highways with self-driving vehicles is known to decrease fuel consumption. This makes us construct paths on graphs, where many vehicles share sub-paths to form platoons. The platooning model has been recently generalized to model different types (e.g., trucks and UAVs) but existing exact solvers using Integer Programming (IP) are not experimentally evaluated on various settings and heuristic solvers are underdeveloped; hence solving large instances remains difficult. In this study, we propose heuristic solvers using a distance-based grouping of vehicles. Our solver first finds groups of vehicles and constructs paths in each group independently. We also experimentally investigate both exact and heuristic solvers. Experimental results suggest that IP-based solvers only solve small instances due to the overhead of compiling IP models. We observed that our solvers were almost fifth magnitude faster than the exact solver with at most 25% additional travel costs. Also, our method achieved roughly 15% additional costs if requests are clustered in terms of their locations, meaning that distance-based heuristic solvers could find moderate solutions within typically a few seconds."}}

We study a model that permits heterogeneous cooperation and discuss a route optimization problem under assumption that the heterogeneous cooperation benefits the objective function. We experimentally evaluate the formulation through using synthetic and real graphs based on a modern integer programming solver with various parameter settings, which are not tried in previous studies.

We propose the MAPF with destination choice problem (MAPF-DC) as a new variant of MAPF. Agents in MAPF-DC could implicitly select the best destinations out of assigned destination candidates partially shared with other agents. Experimental results indicate that the total travel time declines with an increase in the number of destination candidates assigned to each agent."}}

Route optimization to satisfy customer demands is an essential technology to realize the services. Most studies of the route optimization for the services have been focused on finding a better assignment from vehicles to customers and a better order of visiting customer locations under the assumption that the customers waiting at the locations without moving. In this paper, we formulate cooperative routing problem between customers and vehicles, which minimizes total travel cost by optimizing both vehicle and customer routes. We also propose a heuristic approach to find solutions for large instances. We demonstrate that customer cooperation helps to reduce the total travel cost compared to a solution of standard vehicle routing problem in synthetic experiments using the road network of Manhattan, NY, USA. We confirmed that the total travel cost of the customers and the vehicles was reduced by 20% using our heuristics comparing to solutions of the vehicle routing problem with little extra computational cost."}}

Cooperative Automated Valet Parking (Co-AVP) is a promising approach to mitigate the problem. Co-AVP system would realize high density and efficient parking by automatically navigating vehicles to vacant parking spaces. Cooperative path planning has been extensively studied as Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). In Co-AVP, vehicles would be often prioritized. For instance, vehicles would be able to spend more time to park in vacant spaces than moving from parking spaces to waiting drivers. Previous MAPF settings, however, cannot treat such priorities. In this paper, we formulate MAPF considering each agent's priority. We also develop the optimal method based on Conflict-Based Search (named CBS-Pri) and the heuristic method based on Cooperative A* (named CA*-Pri). We verified that higher prioritized vehicles tended to preferentially arrive at waiting drivers by our methods in numerical experiments. We also found that CBS-Pri always searched better solutions than or equal to CA*-Pri but requires more computational time."}}

Traditional platoons, however, cannot model cooperation among different types of vehicles because the model assumes the homogeneity of vehicle types. We then propose a model that permits heterogeneous cooperation. Targets of our model include a logistic scenario, where a truck for the long-distance delivery also carries small self-driving vehicles for the last mile delivery. For those purposes, we formalize a new route optimization problem with heterogeneous cooperation, and provide its integer programming (IP) formulation as an exact solver. We evaluate our formulation through numerical experiments using synthetic and real graphs. We also validate our concept of heterogeneous cooperation for MaaS with examples."}}
