Generally, episodic control-based approaches are solutions that leverage highly rewarded past experiences to improve sample efficiency of DRL algorithms. However, previous episodic control-based approaches fail to utilize the latent information from the historical behaviors (\\eg, state transitions, topological similarities, \\etc) and lack scalability during DRL training. This work introduces Neural Episodic Control with State Abstraction (NECSA), a simple but effective state abstraction-based episodic control containing a more comprehensive episodic memory, a novel state evaluation, and a multi-step state analysis. We evaluate our approach to the MuJoCo and Atari tasks in OpenAI gym domains. The experimental results indicate that NECSA achieves higher sample efficiency than the state-of-the-art episodic control-based approaches.

In FL, multiple models are trained independently on the users and aggregated centrally to update a global model in an iterative process. Although this approach is excellent at preserving privacy by design, FL still tends to suffer from quality issues such as attacks or byzantine faults. Some recent attempts have been made to address such quality challenges on the robust aggregation techniques for FL. However, the effectiveness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust FL techniques is still unclear and lacks a comprehensive study. Therefore, to better understand the current quality status and challenges of these SOTA FL techniques in the presence of attacks and faults, in this paper, we perform a large-scale empirical study to investigate the SOTA FL's quality from multiple angles of attacks, simulated faults (via mutation operators), and aggregation (defense) methods. In particular, we perform our study on two generic image datasets and one real-world federated medical image dataset. We also systematically investigate the effect of the distribution of attacks/faults over users and the independent and identically distributed (IID) factors, per dataset, on the robustness results. After a large-scale analysis with 496 configurations, we find that most mutators on each individual user have a negligible effect on the final model. Moreover, choosing the most robust FL aggregator depends on the attacks and datasets. Finally, we illustrate that it is possible to achieve a generic solution that works almost as well or even better than any single aggregator on all attacks and configurations with a simple ensemble model of aggregators."}}

In this article, we introduce ContraMaster\u2014an oracle-supported dynamic exploit generation framework for smart contracts. Existing approaches mutate only single transactions; ContraMaster exceeds these by mutating the transaction sequences. ContraMaster uses data-flow, control-flow, and the dynamic contract state to guide its mutations. It then monitors the executions of target contract programs, and validates the results against a general-purpose semantic test oracle to discover vulnerabilities. Being a dynamic technique, it guarantees that each discovered vulnerability is a violation of the test oracle and is able to generate the attack script to exploit this vulnerability. In contrast to rule-based approaches, ContraMaster has not shown any false positives, and it easily generalizes to unknown types of vulnerabilities (e.g., logic errors). We evaluate ContraMaster on 218 vulnerable smart contracts. The experimental results confirm its practical applicability and advantages over the state-of-the-art techniques, and also reveal three new types of attacks."}}

In this paper, we propose the DeepMix that takes historical samples\u2019 embeddings as input and generates augmented embeddings online, enhancing the state-of-the-art online learning methods for visual object tracking. More specifically, we first propose the online data augmentation for tracking that online augments the historical samples through object-aware filtering. Then, we propose MixNet which is an offline trained network for performing online data augmentation within one-step, enhancing the tracking accuracy while preserving high speeds of the state-of-the-art online learning methods. The extensive experiments on three different tracking frameworks, i.e., DiMP, DSiam, and SiamRPN++, and three large-scale and challenging datasets, i.e., OTB-2015, LaSOT, and VOT, demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method."}}

Despite the popularity of AI-enabled CPS, few benchmarks are publicly available. There is also a lack of deep understanding on the performance and reliability of AI-enabled CPS across different industrial domains. To bridge this gap, we initiate to create a public benchmark of industry-level CPS in seven domains and build AI controllers for them via state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. Based on that, we further perform a systematic evaluation of these AI-enabled systems with their traditional counterparts to identify the current challenges and explore future opportunities. Our key findings include (1) AI controllers do not always outperform traditional controllers, (2) existing CPS testing techniques (falsification, specifically) fall short of analyzing AI-enabled CPS, and (3) building a hybrid system that strategically combines and switches between AI controllers and traditional controllers can achieve better performance across different domains. Our results highlight the need for new testing techniques for AI-enabled CPS and the need for more investigations into hybrid CPS systems to achieve optimal performance and reliability."}}

Falsification, given a desired temporal specification, tries to find an input of violation instead of a proof guarantee. The state-of-the-art falsification approaches often employ stochastic hill-climbing optimization that minimizes the degree of satisfaction of the temporal specification, given by its quantitative robust semantics. However, it has been shown that the performance of falsification could be severely affected by the so-called scale problem, related to the different scales of the signals used in the specification (e.g., rpm and speed): in the robustness computation, the contribution of a signal could be masked by another one. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle this problem. We first introduce a new robustness definition, called QB-Robustness, which combines classical Boolean satisfaction and quantitative robustness. We prove that QB-Robustness can be used to judge the satisfaction of the specification and avoid the scale problem in its computation. QB-Robustness is exploited by a falsification approach based on Monte Carlo Tree Search over the structure of the formal specification. First, tree traversal identifies the sub-formulas for which it is needed to compute the quantitative robustness. Then, on the leaves, numerical hill-climbing optimization is performed, aiming to falsify such sub-formulas. Our in-depth evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates that our approach achieves better falsification results than the state-of-the-art falsification approaches guided by the classical quantitative robustness, and it is largely not affected by the scale problem."}}
