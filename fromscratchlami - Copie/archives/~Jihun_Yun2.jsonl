As modern deep learning tasks become more complex and state-of-the-art architectures grow as well, network training with SGD takes a huge amount of time; for example, training ResNet on the ImageNet dataset or BERT pre-training can take days to dozens of days. To reduce the network training time, distributed learning using a large batch size for SGD has been one of the main active research areas in recent years, but this approach entails a significant degradation in generalization. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective regularization technique, GradientMix, for large-scale distributed learning. GradientMix can enhance the generalization in large batch regimes by giving appropriate noise through a mixup of local gradients computed at multiple devices, which is contrary to the conventions that simply average local gradients. Furthermore, GradientMix is optimizer-agnostic, hence can be applied to any popular optimization algorithm as long as the overall loss is expressed as the sum of the subgroup losses. Our extensive experiments show the effectiveness in both small and large-scale problems, and especially we consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance for various optimizers on training ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset with 32K batch size."}}

While popular machine learning libraries have resorted to stochastic (adaptive) subgradient approaches, the use of proximal gradient methods in the stochastic setting has been little explored and warrants further study, in particular regarding the incorporation of adaptivity. Towards this goal, we present a general framework of stochastic proximal gradient descent methods that allows for arbitrary positive preconditioners and lower semi-continuous regularizers. We derive two important instances of our framework: (i) the first proximal version of \\textsc{Adam}, one of the most popular adaptive SGD algorithm, and (ii) a revised version of ProxQuant for quantization-specific regularizers, which improves upon the original approach by incorporating the effect of preconditioners in the proximal mapping computations. We provide convergence guarantees for our framework and show that adaptive gradient methods can have faster convergence in terms of constant than vanilla SGD for sparse data. Lastly, we demonstrate the superiority of stochastic proximal methods compared to subgradient-based approaches via extensive experiments. Interestingly, our results indicate that the benefit of proximal approaches over sub-gradient counterparts is more pronounced for non-convex regularizers than for convex ones."}}

In order to overcome the nature of transforming continuous activations and weights to discrete ones, recent study called Relaxed Quantization (RQ) [Louizos et al. 2019] successfully employ the popular Gumbel-Softmax that allows this transformation with efficient gradient-based optimization. However, RQ with this Gumbel-Softmax relaxation still suffers from bias-variance trade-off depending on the temperature parameter of Gumbel-Softmax. To resolve the issue, we propose a novel method, Semi-Relaxed Quantization (SRQ) that uses multi-class straight-through estimator to effectively reduce the bias and variance, along with a new regularization technique, DropBits that replaces dropout regularization to randomly drop the bits instead of neurons to further reduce the bias of the multi-class straight-through estimator in SRQ. As a natural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning heterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer using DropBits. We experimentally validate our method on various benchmark datasets and network architectures, and also support the quantized lottery ticket hypothesis: learning heterogeneous quantization levels outperforms the case using the same but fixed quantization levels from scratch."}}

We propose a unified framework for stochastic proximal gradient descent, which we term ProxGen, that allows for arbitrary positive preconditioners and lower semi-continuous regularizers. Our framework encompasses standard stochastic proximal gradient methods without preconditioners as special cases, which have been extensively studied in various settings. Not only that, we present two important update rules beyond the well-known standard methods as a byproduct of our approach: (i) the first closed-form proximal mappings of $\\ell_q$ regularization ($0 \\leq q \\leq 1$) for adaptive stochastic gradient methods, and (ii) a revised version of ProxQuant that fixes a caveat of the original approach for quantization-specific regularizers. We analyze the convergence of ProxGen and show that the whole family of ProxGen enjoys the same convergence rate as stochastic proximal gradient descent without preconditioners. We also empirically show the superiority of proximal methods compared to subgradient-based approaches via extensive experiments. Interestingly, our results indicate that proximal methods with non-convex regularizers are more effective than those with convex regularizers."}}

This rich class of algorithms includes Adagrad, RMSprop, Adam, and recent extensions. All these algorithms have adopted diagonal matrix adaptation, due to the prohibitive computational burden of manipulating full matrices in high-dimensions. In this paper, we show that block-diagonal matrix adaptation can be a practical and powerful solution that can effectively utilize structural characteristics of deep learning architectures to significantly improve convergence and out-of-sample generalization. We present AdaBlock, a general framework for block-diagonal matrix adaption via coordinate grouping, which includes counterparts of the aforementioned algorithms. We prove its convergence in non-convex optimization and provide generalization error bounds, highlighting benefits compared to diagonal versions. In addition, we propose two techniques enriching the AdaBlock family: i) an efficient spectrum-clipping scheme that benefits from superior generalization performance of SGD and ii) a randomized layer-wise block diagonal adaptation scheme to further reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments show that AdaBlock achieves state-of-the-art results on several deep learning tasks, and can outperform adaptive diagonal methods, vanilla SGD, as well as a modified version of full-matrix adaptation proposed very recently."}}
