In contrast to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) which aims at automating neural network architecture design, active learning aims at automating training data selection process. It is especially critical for training a long-tailed task, in which positive samples are sparsely distributed. Active learning alleviates the expensive data annotation issue through incrementally training models powered with efficient data selection. Instead of annotating all unlabeled samples, it iteratively selects and annotates the most valuable samples. Active learning has been popular in image classification, but has not been fully explored in object detection. Most of current works on object detection are evaluated with different settings, making it difficult to fairly compare their performance. To facilitate the research in this field, this paper contributes an active learning benchmark framework named as ALBench for evaluating active learning in object detection. Developed on an automatic deep model training system, this ALBench framework is easy-to-use, compatible with different active learning algorithms, and ensures the same training and testing protocols. We hope this automated benchmark system helps researchers to easily reproduce literature's performance and have fair comparisons with prior arts."}}

The platform described in this paper allows for per-campaign maximization of conversions representing purchase activities or transactions. Conversions directly translate to advertiser's revenue, and thus provide the most relevant metrics of return on advertising investment. We focus on two major challenges: how to efficiently process histories of billions of users on a daily basis, and how to build per-campaign conversion models given the extremely low conversion rates (compared to click rates in a traditional setting). We first present mechanisms for building web-scale user profiles in a daily incremental fashion. Second, we show how to reduce the latency through in-memory processing of billions of user records. Finally, we discuss a technique for scaling the number of handled campaigns/models by introducing an efficient labeling technique that allows for sharing negative training examples across multiple campaigns."}}

The user response depends on how well the ad campaign matches to the user's interest, as well as the amount of user's past exposure to the campaign - a factor shown to be impactful in controlled experimental studies. Past exposure builds brand-awareness and familiarity with the user, which in turn leads to a higher propensity of the user to buy/convert on the ad impression. In this paper we propose a model of the user response to an ad campaign as a function of both the interest match and the past exposure, where the interest match is estimated using historical search/browse activities of the user. The goal of this paper is two-fold. First, we demonstrate the role played by the user interest and the past exposure in modeling user response by jointly estimating the parameters of these factors. We test this response model over hundreds of real ad campaigns. Second, we use the findings from this joint model to identify more relevant target users for ad campaigns. In particular, we show that on real advertising data this model combines past exposure together with the user profile to identify better target users over the conventional targeting models."}}

Web-related tasks such as web page categorization, news filtering, query categorization, tag recommendation, etc. often involve the construction of multi-label categorization systems on a large scale. Existing multi-label classification methods either do not scale or have unsatisfactory performance. In this work, we propose MetaLabeler to automatically determine the relevant set of labels for each instance without intensive human involvement or expensive cross-validation. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark data show that the MetaLabeler tends to outperform existing methods. Moreover, MetaLabeler scales to millions of multi-labeled instances and can be deployed easily. This enables us to apply the MetaLabeler to a large scale query categorization problem in Yahoo!, yielding a significant improvement in performance."}}
