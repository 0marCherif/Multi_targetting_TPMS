The benefit of the inductive bias the network imposes in the DIP framework depends on the architecture. Therefore, re-searchers have studied how to automate the search to de-termine the best-performing model. However, common neu-ral architecture search (NAS) techniques are resource and time-intensive. Moreover, best-performing models are de-termined for a whole dataset of images instead of for each image independently, which would be prohibitively expen-sive. In this work, we first show that optimal neural archi-tectures in the DIP framework are image-dependent. Lever-aging this insight, we then propose an image-specific NAS strategy for the DIP framework that requires substantially less training than typical NAS approaches, effectively en-abling image-specific NAS. We justify the proposed strat-egy's effectiveness by (1) demonstrating its performance on a NAS Dataset for DIP that includes 522 models from a particular search space (2) conducting extensive experi-ments on image denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks. Our experiments show that image-specific metrics can reduce the search space to a small cohort of models, of which the best model outperforms current NAS approaches for image restoration.

Identifying bias in Machine Learning (ML) systems as a critical problem, different approaches have been proposed to mitigate such biases in the models both at data and algorithmic levels. In this work, we propose Continual Learning (CL) as an effective strategy to enhance fairness in Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems, guarding against biases arising from imbalances in data distributions. We compare different state-of-the-art bias mitigation approaches with CL-based strategies for fairness on expression recognition and Action Unit (AU) detection tasks using popular benchmarks for each; RAF-DB and BP4D. Our experiments show that CL-based methods, on average, outperform popular bias mitigation techniques, strengthening the need for further investigation into CL for the development of fairer FER algorithms."}}

There are numerous molecular approaches in literature aiming to mitigate the effects of interference, namely inter-symbol interference. Moreover, for molecular multiple-input-multiple-output systems, interference among antennas, namely inter-link interference, becomes of significance. Inspired by the state-of-the-art performances of machine learning algorithms on making decisions, we propose a novel approach of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architecture. The proposed approach is for a uniquely-designed molecular multiple-input-single-output topology in order to alleviate the damaging effects of molecular interference. In this study, we compare the performance of the proposed network with that of an index modulation approach and a symbol-by-symbol maximum likelihood estimation and show that the proposed method yields better performance."}}

Ranging from surveillance systems to diagnosing mental and emotional health conditions of individuals, these systems need to balance the accuracy vs fairness trade-off to make decisions that do not unjustly discriminate against specific under-represented demographic groups. Identifying bias as a critical problem in facial analysis systems, different methods have been proposed that aim to mitigate bias both at data and algorithmic levels. In this work, we propose the novel usage of Continual Learning (CL), in particular, using Domain-Incremental Learning (Domain-IL) settings, as a potent bias mitigation method to enhance the fairness of FER systems while guarding against biases arising from skewed data distributions. We compare different non-CL-based and CL-based methods for their classification accuracy and fairness scores on expression recognition and Action Unit (AU) detection tasks using two popular benchmarks, the RAF-DB and BP4D datasets, respectively. Our experimental results show that CL-based methods, on average, outperform other popular bias mitigation techniques on both accuracy and fairness metrics."}}
