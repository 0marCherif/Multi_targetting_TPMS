In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, Aligned Dual moDality ClaSsifier (ADDS), which includes a Dual-Modal decoder (DM-decoder) with alignment between visual and textual features, for multi-label classification tasks. Moreover, we design a simple and yet effective method called Pyramid-Forwarding to enhance the performance for inputs with high resolutions. Extensive experiments conducted on standard multi-label benchmark datasets, MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous methods and provides state-of-the-art performance for conventional multi-label classification, zero-shot multi-label classification, and an extreme case called single-to-multi label classification where models trained on single-label datasets (ImageNet-1k, ImageNet-21k) are tested on multi-label ones (MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE). We also analyze how visual-textual alignment contributes to the proposed approach, validate the significance of the DM-decoder, and demonstrate the effectiveness of Pyramid-Forwarding on vision transformer."}}

However, most existing methods unrealistically assume object classes of the overall framework are fixed over time. It makes the global model suffer from significant catastrophic forgetting on old classes in real-world scenarios, where local clients often collect new classes continuously and have very limited storage memory to store old classes. Moreover, new clients with unseen new classes may participate in the FL training, further aggravating the catastrophic forgetting of global model. To address these challenges, we develop a novel Global-Local Forgetting Compensation (GLFC) model, to learn a global class-incremental model for alleviating the catastrophic forgetting from both local and global perspectives. Specifically, to address local forgetting caused by class imbalance at the local clients, we design a class-aware gradient compensation loss and a class-semantic relation distillation loss to balance the forgetting of old classes and distill consistent inter-class relations across tasks. To tackle the global forgetting brought by the non-i.i.d class imbalance across clients, we propose a proxy server that selects the best old global model to assist the local relation distillation. Moreover, a prototype gradient-based communication mechanism is developed to protect the privacy. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.4%~15.1% in terms of average accuracy on representative benchmark datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/conditionWang/FCIL."}}

They often operate in highly dynamic, uncertain and challenging environment, and need to meet stringent timing, resource, and mission requirements. In particular, it is critical and yet very challenging to ensure the safety of these autonomous systems, given the uncertainties of the system inputs, the constant disturbances on the system operations, and the lack of analyzability for many machine learning methods (particularly those based on neural networks). In this paper, we will discuss some of these challenges, and present our work in developing automated, quantitative, and formalized methods and tools for ensuring the safety of autonomous systems in their design and during their runtime adaptation. We argue that it is essential to take a holistic approach in addressing system safety and other safety-related properties, vertically across the functional, software, and hardware layers, and horizontally across the autonomy pipeline of sensing, perception, planning, and control modules. This approach could be further extended from a single autonomous system to a multi-agent system where multiple autonomous agents perform tasks in a collaborative manner. We will use connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) as the main application domain to illustrate the importance of such holistic approach and show our initial efforts in this direction."}}

To address such challenges on data insufficiency for classification problem in a target domain, we propose a weak adaptation learning (WAL) approach that leverages unlabeled data from a similar source domain, a low-cost weak annotator that produces labels based on task-specific heuristics, labeling rules, or other methods (albeit with inaccuracy), and a small amount of labeled data in the target domain. Our approach first conducts a theoretical analysis on the error bound of the trained classifier with respect to the data quantity and the performance of the weak annotator, and then introduces a multi-stage weak adaptation learning method to learn an accurate classifier by lowering the error bound.

These HVAC systems in smart buildings rely 'on real-time sensor readings, which in practice often suffer from various faults and could also be vulnerable to malicious attacks. Such faulty sensor inputs may lead to the violation of indoor environment requirements (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) and the increase of energy consumption. While many model-based approaches have been proposed in the literature for building HVAC control, it is costly to develop accurate physical models for ensuring their performance and even more challenging to address the impact of sensor faults. In this work, we present a novel learning-based framework for sensor fault-tolerant HVAC control, which includes three deep learning based components for 1) generating temperature proposals with the consideration of possible sensor faults, 2) selecting one of the proposals based on the assessment of their accuracy, and 3) applying reinforcement learning with the selected temperature proposal. Moreover, to address the challenge of training data insufficiency in building-related tasks, we propose a model-assisted learning method leveraging an abstract model of building physical dynamics. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed fault-tolerant HVAC control framework can significantly reduce building temperature violations under a variety of sensor fault patterns while maintaining energy efficiency."}}

However, the distribution and quantity of the training data on the clients' side may lead to significant challenges such as class imbalance and non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data, which could greatly impact the performance of the common model. While much effort has been devoted to helping FL models converge when encountering non-IID data, the imbalance issue has not been sufficiently addressed. In particular, as FL training is executed by exchanging gradients in an encrypted form, the training data is not completely observable to either clients or server, and previous methods for class imbalance do not perform well for FL. Therefore, it is crucial to design new methods for detecting class imbalance in FL and mitigating its impact. In this work, we propose a monitoring scheme that can infer the composition of training data for each FL round, and design a new loss function -- Ratio Loss to mitigate the impact of the imbalance. Our experiments demonstrate the importance of acknowledging class imbalance and taking measures as early as possible in FL training, and the effectiveness of our method in mitigating the impact. Our method is shown to significantly outperform previous methods, while maintaining client privacy."}}
