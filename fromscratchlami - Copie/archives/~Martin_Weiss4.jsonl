However, collaboration between these actors is difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of geospatial data modalities (e.g., multi-spectral images of various resolutions, timeseries, weather data) and diversity of tasks (e.g., regression of human activity indicators or detecting forest fires). In this work, we present a roadmap towards the construction of a general-purpose neural architecture (GPNA) with a geospatial inductive bias, pre-trained on large amounts of unlabelled earth observation data in a self-supervised manner. We envision how such a model may facilitate cooperation between members of the community. We show preliminary results on the first step of the roadmap, where we instantiate an architecture that can process a wide variety of geospatial data modalities and demonstrate that it can achieve competitive performance with domain-specific architectures on tasks relating to the U.N.\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals."}}

This development equips doctors and medical staff with tools to evaluate their hypotheses and hence make more precise decisions. Although most current research in the literature seeks to develop techniques and methods for predicting one particular clinical outcome, this approach is far from the reality of clinical decision making in which you have to consider several factors simultaneously. In addition, it is difficult to follow the recent progress concretely as there is a lack of consistency in benchmark datasets and task definitions in the field of Genomics. To address the aforementioned issues, we provide a clinical Meta-Dataset derived from the publicly available data hub called The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) that contains 174 tasks. We believe those tasks could be good proxy tasks to develop methods which can work on a few samples of gene expression data. Also, learning to predict multiple clinical variables using gene-expression data is an important task due to the variety of phenotypes in clinical problems and lack of samples for some of the rare variables. The defined tasks cover a wide range of clinical problems including predicting tumor tissue site, white cell count, histological type, family history of cancer, gender, and many others which we explain later in the paper. Each task represents an independent dataset. We use regression and neural network baselines for all the tasks using only 150 samples and compare their performance."}}

General purpose models typically make few assumptions about the underlying data-structure and are known to perform well in the large-data regime. At the same time, there has been growing interest in modular neural architectures that represent the data using sparsely interacting modules. These models can be more robust out-of-distribution, computationally efficient, and capable of sample-efficient adaptation to new data. However, they tend to make domain-specific assumptions about the data, and present challenges in how module behavior (i.e., parameterization) and connectivity (i.e., their layout) can be jointly learned. In this work, we introduce a general purpose, yet modular neural architecture called Neural Attentive Circuits (NACs) that jointly learns the parameterization and a sparse connectivity of neural modules without using domain knowledge. NACs are best understood as the combination of two systems that are jointly trained end-to-end: one that determines the module configuration and the other that executes it on an input.  We demonstrate qualitatively that NACs learn diverse and meaningful module configurations on the Natural Language and Visual Reasoning for Real (NLVR2) dataset without additional supervision. Quantitatively, we show that by incorporating modularity in this way, NACs improve upon a strong non-modular baseline in terms of low-shot adaptation on CIFAR and Caltech-UCSD Birds dataset (CUB) by about 10 percent, and OOD robustness on Tiny ImageNet-R by about 2.5 percent. Further, we find that NACs can achieve an 8x speedup at inference time while losing less than 3 percent performance. Finally, we find NACs to yield competitive results on diverse data modalities spanning point-cloud classification, symbolic processing and text-classification from ASCII bytes, thereby confirming its general purpose nature.

A major challenge is to efficiently learn a representation that approximates the true joint distribution of contextual, social, and temporal information to enable planning. We propose Latent Variable Sequential Set Transformers which are encoder-decoder architectures that generate scene-consistent multi-agent trajectories. We refer to these architectures as \u201cAutoBots\u201d. The encoder is a stack of interleaved temporal and social multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules which alternately perform equivariant processing across the temporal and social dimensions. The decoder employs learnable seed parameters in combination with temporal and social MHSA modules allowing it to perform inference over the\nentire future scene in a single forward pass efficiently. AutoBots can produce either the trajectory of one ego-agent or a distribution over the future trajectories for all agents in the scene. For the single-agent prediction case, our model achieves top results on the global nuScenes vehicle motion prediction leaderboard, and produces strong results on the Argoverse vehicle prediction challenge. In the multi-agent setting, we evaluate on the synthetic partition of TrajNet++ dataset to showcase the model\u2019s socially-consistent predictions. We also demonstrate our model on general sequences of sets and provide illustrative experiments modelling the sequential structure of the multiple strokes that make up symbols in the Omniglot data. A distinguishing feature of AutoBots is that all models are trainable on a\nsingle desktop GPU (1080 Ti) in under 48h."}}

We verify by comparing to real data that COVIsim is able to reproduce realistic COVID-19 spread dynamics, and perform a sensitivity analysis to verify thatthe relative performance of contact tracing methods are consistent across a range of settings.  We use COVIsim to perform cost-benefit analyses comparing no DCT to: 1) standard binary contact tracing (BCT) that assigns binary recommendationsbased on binary test results; and 2) a rule-based method for feature-based contact tracing (FCT)  that assigns a graded level of recommendation based on diverse individual features.\nFindings: We find all DCT methods consistently reduce the spread of the disease, and that the advantage of FCT over BCT is maintained over a wide range of adoption rates.  Feature-based methods of contact tracing avert more disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per socioeconomic cost (measured by productive hours lost).\nInterpretation:  This research provides a useful testbed to compare and optimize real-world implementations of contact tracing (CT) schemes, a first step in re-sponsible and informed use of CT as an epidemic intervention tool.  Our results suggest any DCT method can help save lives, support re-opening of economies, and prevent second-wave outbreaks, and that FCT methods are a promising direction for enriching BCT using self-reported symptoms, yielding earlier warning signals and a significantly reduced spread of the virus per socioeconomic cost."}}

Understanding what an object or visual scene would look like from another viewpoint is a challenging problem that is made even harder if it must be performed from a single image. 3D computer vision has a long history of examining related problems. However, often what one is most interested in is the answer to a relatively simple question posed in another visual frame of reference -- as opposed to creating a full 3D reconstruction. \nMental rotations tests can also manifest as consequential questions in the real world such as: does the pedestrian that I see, see the car that I am driving?\nWe explore a controlled setting whereby questions are posed about the properties of a scene if the scene were observed from another viewpoint. To do this we have created a new version of the CLEVR VQA problem setup and dataset that we call CLEVR Mental Rotation Tests or CLEVR-MRT, where the goal is to answer questions about the original CLEVR viewpoint given a single image obtained from a different viewpoint of the same scene. Using CLEVR Mental Rotation Tests we examine standard state of the art methods, show how they fall short, then explore novel neural architectures that involve inferring representations encoded as feature volumes describing a scene. Our new methods use rigid transformations of feature volumes conditioned on the viewpoint camera. We examine the efficacy of different model variants through performing a rigorous ablation study. Furthermore, we examine the use of contrastive learning to infer a volumetric encoder in a self-supervised manner and find that this approach yields the best results of our study using CLEVR-MRT."}}

Large-scale digital contact tracing (DCT) has emerged as a potential solution to resume economic and social activity while minimizing spread of the virus. Various DCT methods have been proposed, each making trade-offs be-tween privacy, mobility restrictions, and public health. The most common approach, binary contact tracing (BCT), models infection as a binary event, informed only by an individual\u2019s test results, with corresponding binary recommendations that either all or none of the individual\u2019s contacts quarantine. BCT ignores the inherent uncertainty in contacts and the infection process, which could be used to tailor messaging to high-risk individuals, and prompt proactive testing or earlier warnings. It also does not make use of observations such as symptoms or pre-existing medical conditions, which could be used to make more accurate infectiousness predictions. In this paper, we use a recently-proposed COVID-19 epidemiological simulator to develop and test methods that can be deployed to a smartphone to locally and proactively predict an individual\u2019s infectiousness (risk of infecting others) based on their contact history and other information, while respecting strong privacy constraints. Predictions are used to provide personalized recommendations to the individual via an app, as well as to send anonymized messages to the individual\u2019s contacts, who use this information to better predict their own infectiousness, an approach we call proactive contact tracing (PCT). Similarly to other works, we find that compared to no tracing, all DCT methods tested are able to reduce spread of the disease and thus save lives, even at low adoption rates, strongly supporting a role for DCT methods in managing the pandemic. Further, we find a deep-learning based PCT method which improves over BCT for equivalent average mobility, suggesting PCT could help in safe re-opening and second-wave prevention."}}

Such a system identification problem is fundamentally ill-posed due to the loss of information during image formation. Current best solutions to the problem require precise 3D labels which are labor intensive to gather, and infeasible to create for many systems such as deformable solids or cloth. In this work we present gradSim, a framework that overcomes the dependence on 3D supervision by combining differentiable multiphysics simulation and differentiable rendering to jointly model the evolution of scene dynamics and image formation. This unique combination enables backpropagation from pixels in a video sequence through to the underlying physical attributes that generated them. Furthermore, our unified computation graph across dynamics and rendering engines enables the learning of challenging visuomotor control tasks, without relying on state-based (3D) supervision, while obtaining performance competitive to/better than techniques that require precise 3D labels."}}
