Based on these models, long-term forecasting can be achieved by two approaches: (1) recursively generating a one-step-ahead prediction and (2) adapting the models to sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning. However, in practice, these two approaches often show poor performance in long-term forecasting tasks. The recursive approach suffers from the error accumulation problem, as the model is trained based on one-step-ahead loss. On the other hand, seq2seq shows convergence issues that limit its application. To address the issues for long-term forecasting, in this paper, we propose a universal framework that directly transforms any existing state-of-the-art models for one-step-ahead prediction to achieve more accurate long-term forecasting. The proposed framework consists of two components\u2014a base model and a bias block. The base model is assumed to be a well-trained state-of-the-art one-step-ahead forecasting model, and the bias block is constructed by a spatiotemporal graph neural network composed of gated temporal convolution layers and graph convolution layers. The base model and the bias block are residually-connected so that we can substantially reduce the training complexity. Extensive experiments are conducted on existing benchmark datasets. We experiment with several state-of-the-art models in the literature as base models, and our results demonstrate the ability of the proposed universal framework to greatly improve the long-term prediction accuracy for all models."}}

Deep Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (GNNs), which capture both spatial and temporal patterns, have achieved great success in traffic forecasting applications. Understanding how GNNs-based forecasting work and the vulnerability and robustness of these models becomes critical to real-world applications. For example, if spatiotemporal GNNs are vulnerable in real-world traffic prediction applications, a hacker can easily manipulate the results and cause serious traffic congestion and even a city-scale breakdown. However, despite that recent studies have demonstrated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to carefully designed perturbations in multiple domains like objection classification and graph representation, current adversarial works cannot be directly applied to spatiotemporal forecasting due to the causal nature and spatiotemporal mechanisms in forecasting models. To fill this gap, in this paper we design Spatially Focused Attack (SFA) to break spatiotemporal GNNs by attacking a single vertex. To achieve this, we first propose the inverse estimation to address the causality issue; then, we apply genetic algorithms with a universal attack method as the evaluation function to locate the weakest vertex; finally, perturbations are generated by solving an inverse estimation-based optimization problem. We conduct experiments on real-world traffic data and our results show that perturbations in one vertex designed by SA can be diffused into a large part of the graph."}}

To solve the challenge of limited labeled data in the supervised learning world, unsupervised learning has been proposed years ago while low accuracy hinters its realistic applications. Generative adversarial network (GAN) emerges as an unsupervised learning approach with promising accuracy and are under extensively study. However, the execution of GAN is extremely memory and computation intensive and results in ultra-low speed and high-power consumption. In this work, we proposed a holistic solution for fast and energy-efficient GAN computation through a memristor-based neuromorphic system. First, we exploited a hardware and software co-design approach to map the computation blocks in GAN efficiently. We also proposed an efficient data flow for optimal parallelism training and testing, depending on the computation correlations between different computing blocks. To compute the unique and complex loss of GAN, we developed a diff-block with optimized accuracy and performance. The experiment results on big data show that our design achieves 2.8x speedup and 6.1x energy-saving compared with the traditional GPU accelerator, as well as 5.5x speedup and 1.4x energy-saving compared with the previous FPGA-based accelerator."}}
