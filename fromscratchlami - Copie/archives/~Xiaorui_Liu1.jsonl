In this task, there are often three types of information  -- graph structure, node features, and node labels. Existing GNNs usually leverage both node features and graph structure by feature transformation and aggregation, following end-to-end training via node labels. In this paper, we change our perspective by considering these three types of information as three views of nodes. This perspective motivates us to design a new GNN framework as multi-view learning which enables alternating optimization training instead of end-to-end training,  resulting in significantly improved computation and memory efficiency. Extensive experiments with different settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. \n"}}

However, fair classification can be under the risk of poisoning attacks which deliberately insert malicious training samples to manipulate the trained classifiers' performance. In this work, we study the poisoning scenario where the attacker can insert a small fraction of samples into training data, with arbitrary sensitive attributes as well as other predictive features. We demonstrate that the fairly trained classifiers can be greatly vulnerable to such poisoning attacks, with much worse accuracy & fairness trade-off, even when we apply some of the most effective defenses (originally proposed to defend traditional classification tasks). As countermeasures to defend fair classification tasks, we propose a general and theoretically guaranteed framework which accommodates traditional defense methods to fair classification against poisoning attacks. Through extensive experiments, the results validate that the proposed defense framework obtains better robustness in terms of accuracy and fairness than baseline methods."}}

When applied to semi-supervised node classification,  GNNs are widely believed to work well due to the homophily assumption (``like attracts like''), and fail to generalize to heterophilous graphs where dissimilar nodes connect. Recent works design new architectures to overcome such heterophily-related limitations, citing poor baseline performance and new architecture improvements on a few heterophilous graph benchmark datasets as evidence for this notion. In our experiments, we empirically find that standard graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can actually achieve better performance than such carefully designed methods on some commonly used heterophilous graphs. This motivates us to reconsider whether homophily is truly necessary for good GNN performance.  We find that this claim is not quite true, and in fact, GCNs can achieve strong performance on heterophilous graphs under certain conditions. Our work carefully characterizes these conditions and provides supporting theoretical understanding and empirical observations.  Finally, we examine existing heterophilous graphs benchmarks and reconcile how the GCN (under)performs on them based on this understanding."}}

Nevertheless, the performance of GNNs significantly deteriorates when the depth increases. Recent researches have attributed this phenomenon to the oversmoothing issue, which indicates that the learned node representations are highly indistinguishable. In this paper, we observe a new issue in deeper GNNs, i.e., feature overcorrelation, and perform a thorough study to deepen our understanding on this issue. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of feature overcorrelation in deeper GNNs, reveal potential reasons leading to this issue, and validate that overcorrelation and oversmoothing present different patterns though they are related. Since feature overcorrelation indicates that GNNs encode less information and can harm the downstream tasks, it is of great significance to mitigate this issue. Therefore, we propose the DeCorr, a general framework to effectively reduce feature correlation for deeper GNNs. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that DeCorr can help train deeper GNNs effectively and is complementary to methods tackling oversmoothing."}}

Specifically, the perfectly fitted DNNs can memorize the labels of many atypical samples, generalize their memorization to correctly classify test atypical samples and enjoy better test performance. While, DNNs which are optimized via adversarial training algorithms can also achieve perfect training performance by memorizing the labels of atypical samples, as well as the adversarially perturbed atypical samples. However, adversarially trained models always suffer from poor generalization, with both relatively low clean accuracy and robustness on the test set. In this work, we study the effect of memorization in adversarial trained DNNs and disclose two important findings: (a) Memorizing atypical samples is only effective to improve DNN's accuracy on clean atypical samples, but hardly improve their adversarial robustness and (b) Memorizing certain atypical samples will even hurt the DNN's performance on typical samples. Based on these two findings, we propose Benign Adversarial Training (BAT) which can facilitate adversarial training to avoid fitting \"harmful\" atypical samples and fit as more \"benign\" atypical samples as possible. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of BAT, and show it can achieve better clean accuracy vs. robustness trade-off than baseline methods, in benchmark datasets such as CIFAR100 and Tiny ImageNet."}}

However, the majority of existing studies are focused on balanced datasets, where each class has a similar amount of training examples. Research on adversarial training with imbalanced training datasets is rather limited. As the initial effort to investigate this problem, we reveal the facts that adversarially trained models present two distinguished behaviors from naturally trained models in imbalanced datasets: (1) Compared to natural training, adversarially trained models can suffer much worse performance on under-represented classes, when the training dataset is extremely imbalanced. (2) Traditional reweighting strategies may lose efficacy to deal with the imbalance issue for adversarial training. For example, upweighting under-represented classes will drastically hurt the model\u2019s performance on well-represented classes, and as a result, finding an optimal reweighting value can be tremendously challenging. In this paper, to further understand our observations, we theoretically show that the poor data separability is one key reason causing this strong tension between under-represented and well-represented classes. Motivated by this finding, we propose Separable Reweighted Adversarial Training (SRAT) to facilitate adversarial training under imbalanced scenarios, by learning more separable features for different classes. Extensive experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework."}}

Many pretext tasks, or loss functions have been designed from distinct perspectives. However, we observe that different pretext tasks affect downstream tasks differently cross datasets, which suggests that searching pretext tasks is crucial for graph self-supervised learning.  Different from existing works focusing on designing single pretext tasks, this work aims to investigate how to automatically leverage multiple pretext tasks effectively. Nevertheless, evaluating representations derived from multiple pretext tasks without direct access to ground truth labels makes this problem challenging. To address this obstacle, we make use of a key principle of many real-world graphs, i.e., homophily, or the principle that ``like attracts like,'' as the guidance to effectively search various self-supervised pretext tasks. We provide theoretical understanding and empirical evidence to justify the flexibility of homophily in this  search task. Then we propose the AutoSSL framework which can automatically search over combinations of various self-supervised tasks. By evaluating the framework on 7 real-world datasets, our experimental results show that AutoSSL can significantly boost the performance on downstream tasks including node clustering and node classification compared with training under individual tasks.

However, recent studies show that GNNs are vulnerable to carefully-crafted perturbations, called adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks can easily fool GNNs in making predictions for downstream tasks. The vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised increasing concerns for applying GNNs in safety-critical applications. Therefore, developing robust algorithms to defend adversarial attacks is of great significance. A natural idea to defend adversarial attacks is to clean the perturbed graph. It is evident that real-world graphs share some intrinsic properties. For example, many real-world graphs are low-rank and sparse, and the features of two adjacent nodes tend to be similar. In fact, we find that adversarial attacks are likely to violate these graph properties. Therefore, in this paper, we explore these properties to defend adversarial attacks on graphs. In particular, we propose a general framework Pro-GNN, which can jointly learn a structural graph and a robust graph neural network model from the perturbed graph guided by these properties. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly better performance compared with the state-of-the-art defense methods, even when the graph is heavily perturbed.

In this work, we discover an interesting phenomenon that although residual connections in the message passing of GNNs help improve the performance, they immensely amplify GNNs' vulnerability against abnormal node features. This is undesirable because in real-world applications, node features in graphs could often be abnormal such as being naturally noisy or adversarially manipulated. We analyze possible reasons to understand this phenomenon and aim to design GNNs with stronger resilience to abnormal features. Our understandings motivate us to propose and derive a simple, efficient, interpretable, and adaptive message passing scheme, leading to a novel GNN with Adaptive Residual, AirGNN. Extensive experiments under various abnormal feature scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. "}}

A single GNN layer typically consists of a feature transformation and a feature aggregation operation. The former normally uses feed-forward networks to transform features, while the latter aggregates the transformed features over the graph. Numerous recent works have proposed GNN models with different designs in the aggregation operation. In this work, we establish mathematically that the aggregation processes in a group of representative GNN models including GCN, GAT, PPNP, and APPNP can be regarded as (approximately) solving a graph denoising problem with a smoothness assumption. Such a unified view across GNNs not only provides a new perspective to understand a variety of aggregation operations but also enables us to develop a unified graph neural network framework UGNN. To demonstrate its promising potential, we instantiate a novel GNN model, ADA-UGNN, derived from UGNN, to handle graphs with adaptive smoothness across nodes. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of ADA-UGNN. "}}
