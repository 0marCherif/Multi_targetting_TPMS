Here, we evaluate an unbiased metabolomics approach based on ex vivo and in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) methods to discriminate the EZ in a mouse model of mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE).\n\nMethods:\nFour weeks after unilateral injection of kainic acid (KA) into the dorsal hippocampus of mice (KA-MTLE model), we analyzed hippocampal and cortical samples with high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Using advanced multivariate statistics, we identified the me-tabolites that best discriminate the injected dorsal hippocampus (EZ) and developed an in vivo MEGAPRESS MRS method to focus on the detection of these metabolites in the same mouse model.\n\nResults:\nMultivariate analysis of HRMAS data provided evidence that \ue01f-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is largely increased in the EZ of KA-MTLE mice and is the metabo-lite that best discriminates the EZ when compared to sham and, more importantly, when compared to adjacent brain regions. These results were confirmed by capillary electrophoresis analysis and were not reversed by a chronic exposition to an antiepi-leptic drug (carbamazepine). Then, using in vivo noninvasive GABA-edited MRS, we confirmed that a high GABA increase is specific to the injected hippocampus of KA-MTLE mice.\n\nSignificance:\nOur strategy using ex vivo MRS-based untargeted metabolomics to select the most discriminant metabolite(s), followed by in vivo MRS-based targeted metabolomics, is an unbiased approach to accurately define the EZ in a mouse model of focal epilepsy. Results suggest that GABA is a specific biomarker of the EZ in MTLE."}}

Plants sequester a large amount of atmospheric CO2 via photosynthesis, thus greatly mediating global warming. In this study, we aim to model the temporal dynamics of photosynthesis for two different vegetation types to further understand the controlling factors of photosynthesis machinery. We experimented with a feedforward neural network that does not utilize past histories, as well as two networks that integrate past and present information, long short-term memory and transformer. Our results showed that one single climate driver, shortwave radiation, carries the most information with respect to prediction of upcoming photosynthetic activities. We also demonstrated that photosynthesis and its interactions with climate drivers, such as temperature, precipitation, radiation, and vapor pressure deficit, has an internal system memory of about two weeks. Thus, the predictive model could be best trained with historical data over the past two weeks and could best predict temporal evolution of photosynthesis two weeks into the future."}}

Here, we hypothesize that a deep learning model, trained using quantitative steady-state contrast-enhanced MRI datasets in mice and humans, could generate contrast-equivalent information from a single non-contrast MRI scan. The model was first trained, optimized, and validated in mice. It was then transferred and adapted to human data, and we find that it can substitute Gadolinium-based contrast agents for detecting functional lesions caused by aging, Schizophrenia, or Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and, for enhancing structural lesions caused by brain or breast tumors. Since derived from a commonly-acquired MRI, this framework has the potential for broad clinical utility and can be applied retrospectively to research scans across a host of diseases."}}

However, the group-level analyses prevalently used for investigation and understanding of the disease are not applicable for diagnosis of individuals. More recently, deep learning, which can efficiently analyze large-scale complex patterns in 3D brain images, has helped pave the way for computer-aided individual diagnosis by providing accurate and automated disease classification. Great progress has been made in classifying AD with deep learning models developed upon increasingly available structural MRI data. The lack of scale-matched functional neuroimaging data prevents such models from being further improved by observing functional changes in pathophysiology. Here we propose a potential solution by first learning a structural-to-functional transformation in brain MRI, and further synthesizing spatially matched functional images from large-scale structural scans. We evaluated our approach by building computational models to discriminate patients with AD from healthy normal subjects and demonstrated a performance boost after combining the structural and synthesized functional brain images into the same model. Furthermore, our regional analyses identified the temporal lobe to be the most predictive structural-region and the parieto-occipital lobe to be the most predictive functional-region of our model, which are both in concordance with previous group-level neuroimaging findings. Together, we demonstrate the potential of deep learning with large-scale structural and synthesized functional MRI to impact AD classification and to identify AD's neuroimaging signatures."}}

To address this issue, we modified the U-Net architecture to segment cells in fluorescence widefield microscopy images and quantitatively evaluated its performance. We also proposed a novel loss function approach that emphasizes the segmentation accuracy on cell boundaries and encourages shape feature preservation. With a 97% sensitivity, 93% specificity, 91% Jaccard similarity, and 95% Dice coefficient, our proposed method called Residual Attention U-Net with edge-enhancement surpassed the state-of-the-art U-Net in segmentation performance as evaluated by the traditional metrics. More remarkably, the same proposed candidate also performed the best in terms of the preservation of valuable shape features, namely area, eccentricity, major axis length, solidity and orientation. These improvements on shape feature preservation can serve as useful assets for downstream cell tracking and quantification of changes in cell statistics or features over time."}}

High-resolution CBV maps can be generated using the steady-state gadolinium-enhanced MRI technique. Such a technique requires an intravenous injection of exogenous gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) and recent studies suggest that the GBCA can accumulate in the brain after frequent use. We hypothesize that endogenous sources of contrast might exist within the most conventional and commonly acquired structural MRI, potentially obviating the need for exogenous contrast. Here, we test this hypothesis by developing and optimizing a deep learning algorithm, which we call DeepContrast, in mice. We find that DeepContrast performs equally well as exogenous GBCA in mapping CBV of the normal brain tissue and enhancing glioblastoma. Together, these studies validate our hypothesis that a deep learning approach can potentially replace the need for GBCAs in brain MRI."}}
