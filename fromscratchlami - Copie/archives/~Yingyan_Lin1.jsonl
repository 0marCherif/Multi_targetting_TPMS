Specifically, ViT multi-head attention layers make it possible to embed information globally across the overall image. Nevertheless, computing and storing such attention matrices incurs a quadratic cost dependency on the number of patches, limiting its achievable efficiency and scalability and prohibiting more extensive real-world ViT applications on resource-constrained devices. Sparse attention has been shown to be a promising direction for improving hardware acceleration efficiency for NLP models. However, a systematic counterpart approach is still missing for accelerating ViT models. To close the above gap, we propose a first-of-its-kind algorithm-hardware codesigned framework, dubbed ViTALiTy, for boosting the inference efficiency of ViTs. Unlike sparsity-based Transformer accelerators for NLP, ViTALiTy unifies both low-rank and sparse components of the attention in ViTs. At the algorithm level, we approximate the dot-product softmax operation via first-order Taylor attention with row-mean centering as the low-rank component to linearize the cost of attention blocks and further boost the accuracy by incorporating a sparsity-based regularization. At the hardware level, we develop a dedicated accelerator to better leverage the resulting workload and pipeline from ViTALiTy's linear Taylor attention which requires the execution of only the low-rank component, to further boost the hardware efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that ViTALiTy offers boosted end-to-end efficiency (e.g., 3\u00d7 faster and 3\u00d7 energy-efficient) under comparable accuracy, with respect to the state-of-the-art solution."}}

However, applying NAS to a new computer vision task still requires a huge amount of effort. This is because 1) previous NAS research has been over-prioritized on image classification while largely ignoring other tasks; 2) many NAS works focus on optimizing task-specific components that cannot be favorably transferred to other tasks; and 3) existing NAS methods are typically designed to be \"proxyless\" and require significant effort to be integrated with each new task's training pipelines. To tackle these challenges, we propose FBNetV5, a NAS framework that can search for neural architectures for a variety of vision tasks with much reduced computational cost and human effort. Specifically, we design 1) a search space that is simple yet inclusive and transferable; 2) a multitask search process that is disentangled with target tasks' training pipeline; and 3) an algorithm to simultaneously search for architectures for multiple tasks with a computational cost agnostic to the number of tasks. We evaluate the proposed FBNetV5 targeting three fundamental vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Models searched by FBNetV5 in a single run of search have outperformed the previous stateof-the-art in all the three tasks: image classification (e.g., +1.3% ImageNet top-1 accuracy under the same FLOPs as compared to FBNetV3), semantic segmentation (e.g., +1.8% higher ADE20K val. mIoU than SegFormer with 3.6x fewer FLOPs), and object detection (e.g., +1.1% COCO val.

However, ubiquitous on-device ASR systems are still hindered by two bottlenecks: (1) the lack of large-scale transcribed speech data especially for low-resource spoken languages and (2) the large gap between DNNs' prohibitive complexity and mobiles' limited resources. In parallel, speech models pretrained via self-supervised learning (SSL) have emerged to reduce the reliance on the availability of transcribed speech data, which however further enlarges the efficiency gap because they often adopt large transformers to ensure expressive speech representations. Thus, it is highly desired to trim down the complexity of speech SSL models to enable real-time on-device ASR. This is particularly challenging since only structured sparsity can favor hardware efficiency in commercial devices, under which the speech representation learned by SSL could easily be demolished. To this end, we develop a framework dubbed S$^6$-DAMON to pursue structured sparsity in speech SSL models via data-model co-compression. On the data side, leveraging both the duration of each phoneme and the pauses between the words/phonemes of human utterances, we propose a salient audio token detector, dubbed SALAD, to remove input audio tokens that are redundant; On the model side, we identify that the failure of the SOTA ASR pruning method under structured sparsity is caused by the sparsity discrepancy between finetuning/deployment and their limited learnability of sparsity distributions, and then tackle it via a new ASR pruning pipeline dubbed SAFARI, which adopts a three-step pipeline - sparsify, finetune, and adjust sparsity. Extensive experiments validate that S$^6$-DAMON can enable real-time ASR with limited transcribed speech data requirements while maintaining decent recognition performance.

Consequently, tiny neural networks\u2019 (TNNs\u2019) downstream task performance is limited due to the inferior learned representations during pretraining. To this end, we propose a framework dubbed NetBooster which empowers tiny deep learning from a novel perspective by augmenting the architecture of TNNs via an expansion-then-contraction strategy. Specifically, during training, our proposed NetBooster first expands each/some layer(s) of a given TNN into multi-layer blocks, favoring the learning of more complex features to generate an expanded counterpart model (i.e., deep giant), and then contracts the expanded layers by gradually removing the non-linear layers from the expanded ones to recover efficiency. NetBooster\u2019s expansion-then-contraction training empowers its trained TNNs to benefit from the superior performance of their expanded counterparts while preserving the TNNs\u2019 original complexity and thus inference efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two tasks, seven datasets, and six networks validate that NetBooster consistently leads to a nontrivial accuracy boost (e.g., 1.3% \u223c 2.5%) on top of state-of-the-art TNNs on ImageNet and as much as 4.7% higher accuracy on various downstream datasets, while maintaining their inference complexity/efficiency."}}

However, advanced speech SSL models have become increasingly large, which contradicts the limited on-device resources. This gap could be more severe in multilingual/multitask scenarios requiring simultaneously recognizing multiple languages or executing multiple speech processing tasks. Additionally, strongly overparameterized speech SSL models tend to suffer from overfitting when being finetuned on low-resource speech corpus. This work aims to enhance the practical usage of speech SSL models towards a win-win in both enhanced efficiency and alleviated overfitting via our proposed S$^3$-Router framework, which for the first time discovers that simply discarding no more than 10% of model weights via only finetuning model connections of speech SSL models can achieve better accuracy over standard weight finetuning on downstream speech processing tasks. More importantly, S$^3$-Router can serve as an all-in-one technique to enable (1) a new finetuning scheme, (2) an efficient multilingual/multitask solution, (3) a state-of-the-art pruning technique, and (4) a new tool to quantitatively analyze the learned speech representation.

In parallel, to fulfill the goal of deploying ViTs into real-world vision applications, their robustness against potential malicious attacks has gained increasing attention. In particular, recent works show that ViTs are more robust against adversarial attacks as compared with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and conjecture that this is because ViTs focus more on capturing global interactions among different input/feature patches, leading to their improved robustness to local perturbations imposed by adversarial attacks. In this work, we ask an intriguing question: \"Under what kinds of perturbations do ViTs become more vulnerable learners compared to CNNs?\" Driven by this question, we first conduct a comprehensive experiment regarding the robustness of both ViTs and CNNs under various existing adversarial attacks to understand the underlying reason favoring their robustness. Based on the drawn insights, we then propose a dedicated attack framework, dubbed Patch-Fool, that fools the self-attention mechanism by attacking its basic component (i.e., a single patch) with a series of attention-aware optimization techniques. Interestingly, our Patch-Fool framework shows for the first time that ViTs are not necessarily more robust than CNNs against adversarial perturbations. In particular, we find that ViTs are more vulnerable learners compared with CNNs against our Patch-Fool attack which is consistent across extensive experiments, and the observations from Sparse/Mild Patch-Fool, two variants of Patch-Fool, indicate an intriguing insight that the perturbation density and strength on each patch seem to be the key factors that influence the robustness ranking between ViTs and CNNs. It can be expected that our Patch-Fool framework will shed light on both future architecture designs and training schemes for robustifying ViTs towards their real-world deployment.

In this work, we explore contrastive learning from a new perspective, inspired by the recent works showing that properly designed weight perturbations or quantization help the models learn a smoother loss landscape. Interestingly, we find that quantization, when properly engineered, can enhance the effectiveness of contrastive learning. To this end, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework, dubbed Contrastive Quant, to encourage the feature consistency under both (1) differently augmented inputs via various data transformations and (2) differently augmented weights/activations via various quantization levels, where the feature consistency under injected noises via quantization can be viewed as augmentations on both model weights and intermediate activations as a complement to the input augmentations. Extensive experiments, built on top of two state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods SimCLR and BYOL, show that Contrastive Quant consistently improves the learned visual representation, especially with limited labeled data under semi-supervised scenarios. For example, our Contrastive Quant achieves a 8.69% and 10.27% higher accuracy on ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, respectively, on ImageNet when fine-tuning with 10% labeled data. We believe this work has opened up a new perspective for future contrastive learning innovations. All codes will be released upon acceptance."}}

As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks in general under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a +7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score as compared to state-of-the-art expert-designed and neural architecture searched NNs, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively.

However, distributed GCN training incurs prohibitive overhead of communicating node features and feature gradients among partitions for every GCN layer during each training iteration, limiting the achievable training efficiency and model scalability. To this end, we propose PipeGCN, a simple yet effective scheme that hides the communication overhead by pipelining inter-partition communication with intra-partition computation. It is non-trivial to pipeline for efficient GCN training, as communicated node features/gradients will become stale and thus can harm the convergence, negating the pipeline benefit. Notably, little is known regarding the convergence rate of GCN training with both stale features and stale feature gradients. This work not only provides a theoretical convergence analysis but also finds the convergence rate of PipeGCN to be close to that of the vanilla distributed GCN training without any staleness. Furthermore, we develop a smoothing method to further improve PipeGCN's convergence. Extensive experiments show that PipeGCN can largely boost the training throughput (1.7\u00d7~28.5\u00d7) while achieving the same accuracy as its vanilla counterpart and existing full-graph training methods.

Using a recently developed spline interpretation of DNs, we develop new theory and visualization tools that provide new insights into how pruning DN nodes affects the decision boundary. We discover that a DN's spline mappings exhibit an early-bird (EB) phenomenon whereby the spline's partition converges at early training stages, bridging the recently developed max-affine spline theory and lottery ticket hypothesis of DNs. We leverage this new insight to develop a principled and efficient pruning strategy that focuses on a tiny fraction of DN nodes whose corresponding spline partition regions actually contribute to the final decision boundary. Extensive experiments on four networks and three datasets validate that our new spline-based DN pruning approach reduces training FLOPs by up to 3.5x while achieving similar or even better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.
