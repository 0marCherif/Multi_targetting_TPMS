The decision maker is oblivious to the statistical properties of reward distributions as well as the population-level distribution of different arm-types, and is precluded also from observing the type of an arm after play. We study the classical problem of minimizing the expected cumulative regret over a horizon of play n, and propose algorithms that achieve a rate-optimal finite-time instance-dependent regret of O (log n). We also show that the instance- independent (minimax) regret is O \u0303 (\u221an) when K = 2. While the order of regret and complexity of the problem suggests a great degree of similarity to the classical MAB problem, properties of the performance bounds and salient aspects of algorithm design are quite distinct from the latter, as are the key primitives that determine complexity along with the analysis tools needed to study them."}}

Jobs arrive at discrete times with \"job-types\" observable upon arrival. To capture the \"choice overload\" phenomenon, we posit an unlimited supply of workers where each worker is characterized by a vector of attributes (aka \"worker-types\") drawn from an underlying population-level distribution. The distribution as well as mean payoffs for possible worker-job type-pairs are unobservables and the platform's goal is to sequentially match incoming jobs to workers in a way that maximizes its cumulative payoffs over the planning horizon. We establish lower bounds on the \"regret\" of any matching algorithm in this setting and propose a novel rate-optimal learning algorithm that adapts to aforementioned primitives \"online.\" Our learning guarantees highlight a distinctive characteristic of the problem: achievable performance only has a \"second-order\" dependence on worker-type distributions; we believe this finding may be of interest more broadly."}}

In addition, it is assumed that some partial information about the order in which the nodes were infected, is also available. Such form of information is commonly available to network monitoring agencies. Under this premise, we propose a class of estimators that is agnostic to the underlying stochastic model of rumor spread and further, generalizes other estimators popular in literature, e.g., rumor center, distance center and Jordan center. We also develop an MCMC-based stochastic approximation framework to implement this class of estimators. Results from extensive simulations on the Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi and Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert random graph models indicate promising empirical performance and robustness of the proposed estimators to different graph topologies. Our stochastic approximation framework also extends easily to general statistical inference problems on graphs that are of combinatorial nature. In particular, we demonstrate a suitable modification of our framework that makes it amenable to be used for the popular problem of rank aggregation from noisy pairwise comparisons."}}

This leads to lower profitability for ISPs. However, increasingly bandwidth-hungry content is making the consumers demand significantly improved ISP infrastructure. With the risk of poor consumer experience on them, ISPs have to invest in their infrastructure, but with limited scope for monetization. Hence, they are asking content providers (CPs) to contribute towards ISP capacity expansion. In this paper, we explore network neutral capacity expansion sponsored by voluntary contributions from CPs. We consider the scenario where CPs contribute to ISP capacity expansion via a voluntary payment. Since ISP capacity expansion can benefit all the CPs, and possibly even the ISP, selfish CPs will determine their contributions strategically. We consider three models for CPs to interact in determining their payments\u2014a cooperative model, a non-cooperative model, and a bargaining model. Our analysis reveals a rather surprising result. We show that the bargaining model leads to a higher investment in the ISP infrastructure than even the cooperative model. This leads us to recommend the creation of transparent platforms for CPs to contribute directly to Internet capacity expansion."}}
