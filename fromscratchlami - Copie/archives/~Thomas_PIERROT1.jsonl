However, these policies tend to be overfit to the exact specifications of the task and environment they were trained on, and thus do not perform well when conditions deviate slightly or when composed hierarchically to solve even more complex tasks. Recent work has shown that training a mixture of policies, as opposed to a single one, that are driven to explore different regions of the state-action space can address this shortcoming by generating a diverse set of behaviors, referred to as skills, that can be collectively used to great effect in adaptation tasks or for hierarchical planning. This is typically realized by including a diversity term - often derived from information theory - in the objective function optimized by RL. However these approaches often require careful hyperparameter tuning to be effective. In this work, we demonstrate that less widely-used neuroevolution methods, specifically Quality Diversity (QD), are a competitive alternative to information-theory-augmented RL for skill discovery. Through an extensive empirical evaluation comparing eight state-of-the-art algorithms (four flagship algorithms from each line of work) on the basis of (i) metrics directly evaluating the skills' diversity, (ii) the skills' performance on adaptation tasks, and (iii) the skills' performance when used as primitives for hierarchical planning; QD methods are found to provide equal, and sometimes improved, performance whilst being less sensitive to hyperparameters and more scalable. As no single method is found to provide near-optimal performance across all environments, there is a rich scope for further research which we support by proposing future directions and providing optimized open-source implementations."}}

While very effective for some unstructured problems, early ME implementations relied exclusively on random search to evolve the population of solutions, rendering them notoriously sample-inefficient for high-dimensional problems, such as when evolving neural networks. Follow-up works considered exploiting gradient information to guide the search in order to address these shortcomings through techniques borrowed from either Black-Box Optimization (BBO) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). While mixing RL techniques with ME unlocked state-of-the-art performance for robotics control problems that require a good amount of exploration, it also plagued these ME variants with limitations common among RL algorithms that ME was free of, such as hyperparameter sensitivity, high stochasticity as well as training instability, including when the population size increases as some components are shared across the population in recent approaches. Furthermore, existing approaches mixing ME with RL tend to be tied to a specific RL algorithm, which effectively prevents their use on problems where the corresponding RL algorithm fails. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a flexible framework that allows the use of any RL algorithm and alleviates the aforementioned limitations by evolving populations of agents (whose definition include hyperparameters and all learnable parameters) instead of just policies. We demonstrate the benefits brought about by our framework through extensive numerical experiments on a number of robotics control problems, some of which with deceptive rewards, taken from the QD-RL literature. We open source an efficient JAX-based implementation of our algorithm in the QDax library. "}}

While early QD algorithms view the objective and descriptor functions as black-box functions, novel tools have been introduced to use gradient information to accelerate the search and improve overall performance of those algorithms over continuous input spaces. However a broad range of applications involve discrete spaces, such as drug discovery or image generation. Exploring those spaces is challenging as they are combinatorially large and gradients cannot be used in the same manner as in continuous spaces. We introduce MAP-Elites with a Gradient-Informed Discrete Emitter (ME-GIDE), which extends QD optimisation with differentiable functions over discrete search spaces. ME-GIDE leverages the gradient information of the objective and descriptor functions with respect to its discrete inputs to propose gradient-informed updates that guide the search towards a diverse set of high quality solutions. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks including protein design and discrete latent space illumination and find that our method outperforms state-of-the-art QD algorithms in all benchmarks.\n\n\n"}}

An existing approach consists in splitting the action space into smaller components and choosing either independently or sequentially actions in each dimension. This approach led to astonishing results for the StarCraft and Dota 2 games, however it remains underexploited and understudied. In this paper, we name this approach Factored Actions Reinforcement Learning (FARL) and study both its theoretical impact and practical use. Notably, we provide a theoretical analysis of FARL on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithms and evaluate these agents in different classes of problems. We show that FARL is a very versatile and efficient approach to combinatorial and continuous control problems."}}

The QD part contributes structural biases by decoupling the search for diversity from the search for high return, resulting in efficient management of the exploration-exploitation trade-off. The RL part contributes sample efficiency by relying on off-policy gradient-based updates of the agents. More precisely, we train a population of off-policy deep RL agents to simultaneously maximize diversity within the population and the return of each individual agent. QD-RL selects agents interchangeably from a Pareto front or from a Map-Elites grid, resulting in stable and efficient population updates. Our experiments in the Ant-Maze and Ant-Trap environments show that QD-RL can solve challenging exploration and control problems with deceptive rewards while being two orders of magnitude more sample efficient than the evolutionary counterpart."}}

NPI contributes structural biases in the form of modularity, hierarchy and recursion, which are helpful to reduce sample complexity, improve generalization and increase interpretability. AlphaNPI extends the guided tree search of AlphaZero to enable recursion. AlphaNPI only assumes a hierarchical program specification with sparse rewards: 1 when the program execution satisfies the specification, and 0 otherwise. As a result, AlphaNPI effectively eliminates the need for strong supervision when training NPI models. Indeed, the experiments show that AlphaNPI can sort as well as previous NPI variants, which required strong supervision in the form of full program execution traces. The AlphaNPI agent is also trained on the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with two disks and is shown to generalize to puzzles with an arbitrary number of disks, both empirically and theoretically."}}
