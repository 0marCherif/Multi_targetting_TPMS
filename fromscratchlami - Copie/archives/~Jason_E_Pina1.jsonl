According to this conjecture, expected, predictable features are differentiated from unexpected ones by comparing bottom-up and top-down streams of information. It is theorized that the neocortex then changes the representation of incoming stimuli, guided by differences in the responses to expected and unexpected events. In line with this conjecture, different responses to expected and unexpected sensory features have been observed in spiking and somatic calcium events. However, it remains unknown whether these unexpected event signals occur in the distal apical dendrites where many top-down signals are received, and whether these signals govern subsequent changes in the brain\u2019s stimulus representations. Here, we show that both somata and distal apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons exhibit distinct unexpected event signals that systematically change over days. These findings were obtained by tracking the responses of individual somata and dendritic branches of layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons over multiple days in primary visual cortex of awake, behaving mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Many neurons in both layers 2/3 and 5 showed large differences between their responses to expected and unexpected events. Interestingly, these responses evolved in opposite directions in the somata and distal apical dendrites. These differences between the somata and distal apical dendrites may be important for hierarchical computation, given that these two compartments tend to receive bottom-up and top-down information, respectively."}}

For example, oscillatory neural activity has been suggested to play a role in binding and in the maintenance of information in working memory. With respect to the latter, the majority of work has focused primarily on oscillations in terms of providing a \u201ccode\u201d in working memory. However, oscillations may additionally play a fundamental role by enabling or facilitating essential properties and behaviors that neuronal networks must exhibit in order to produce functional working memory and the processes it supports, such as combining items in memory into bound objects or separating bound objects into distinct items. In the present work, we present a biologically plausible working memory model and demonstrate that specific types of stable oscillatory dynamics that arise may play critical roles in providing mechanisms for working memory and the cognitive functions that it sup- ports. Specifically, these roles include (1) enabling a range of different types of binding, (2) both enabling and limiting capacities of bound and distinct items held active in working mem- ory, and (3) facilitating transitions between active working memory states as required in cog- nitive function. Several key results arise within the examinations, such as the occurrence of different network capacities for working memory and binding, differences in processing times for transitions in working memory states, and the emergence of a combinatorially rich and complex range of oscillatory states that are sufficient to map onto a wide range of cogni- tive operations supported by working memory, such as variable binding, reasoning, and lan- guage. In particular, we show that these oscillatory states and their transitions can provide a specific instantiation of current established connectionist models in representing these func- tions. Finally, we further characterize the dependence of the relevant oscillatory solutions on certain critical parameters, including mutual inhibition and synaptic timescales."}}
