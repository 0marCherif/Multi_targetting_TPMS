We analyze how the choice of task head controls feature adaptation and hence influences the downstream performance. By decomposing the learning dynamics of adaptation, we find that the key aspect is the training accuracy and loss at the beginning of finetuning, which determines the \"energy\" available for the feature's adaptation. We identify a significant trend in the effect of changes in this initial energy on the resulting features after fine-tuning. Specifically, as the energy increases, the Euclidean and cosine distances between the resulting and original features increase, while their dot products (and the resulting features' norm) first increase and then decrease.

In this work, we start from approximating the interaction between two samples, i.e. how learning one sample would modify the model's prediction on the other sample. Through analysing the terms involved in weight updates in supervised learning, we find that the signs of labels influence the interactions between samples. Therefore, we propose the labelled pseudo Neural Tangent Kernel (lpNTK) which takes label information into consideration when measuring the interactions between samples. We first prove that lpNTK would asymptotically converge to the well-known empirical Neural Tangent Kernel in terms of the Frobenius norm under certain assumptions. Secondly, we illustrate how lpNTK helps to understand learning phenomena identified in previous work, specifically the learning difficulty of samples and forgetting events during learning. Moreover, we also show that lpNTK can help to improve the generalisation performance of ANNs in image classification tasks, compared with the original whole training sets."}}

Towards this goal, the Autonomous Agents Research Group develops novel machine learning algorithms for autonomous systems control, with a specific focus on deep reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Research problems include scalable learning of coordinated agent policies and inter-agent communication; reasoning about the behaviours, goals, and composition of other agents from limited observations; and sample-efficient learning based on intrinsic motivation, curriculum learning, causal inference, and representation learning. This article provides a broad overview of the ongoing research portfolio of the group and discusses open problems for future directions."}}

We focus on the factors that determine the expressivity of emergent languages, which reflects the amount of information about input spaces those languages are capable of encoding. We measure the expressivity of emergent languages based on the generalisation performance across different games, and demonstrate that the expressivity of emergent languages is a trade-off between the complexity and unpredictability of the context those languages emerged from. Another contribution of this work is the discovery of message type collapse, i.e. the number of unique messages is lower than that of inputs. We also show that using the contrastive loss proposed by Chen et al. (2020) can alleviate this problem."}}

Over several generations, learners\u2019 biases for simple and informative systems can guide language evolution. Over repeated instances of dyadic communication, the principle of least effort dictates that speakers should bias systems towards simplicity and listeners towards informativity, similarly guiding language evolution. At the same time, it has been argued that learners only provide a bias for simplicity and, thus, language users must provide a bias for informativity. To what extent do languages evolve during acquisition versus use? We address this question by formally defining and investigating the communicative efficiency of acquisition trajectories. We illustrate our approach using colour-naming systems, replicating a communicative efficiency model based on the information bottleneck problem, and an acquisition model based on self-organising maps. We find that to the extent that language is iconic, learning alone is sufficient to shape language evolution. Regarding colour-naming systems specifically, we find that incorporating learning biases into communicative efficiency accounts might explain how speakers and listeners trade off communicative effort."}}

Unfortunately, straightforwardly applying local ViTs in domain adaptive semantic segmentation does not bring in expected improvement. We find that the pitfall of local ViTs is due to the severe high-frequency components generated during both the pseudo-label construction and features alignment for target domains. These high-frequency components make the training of local ViTs very unsmooth and hurt their transferability. In this paper, we introduce a low-pass filtering mechanism, momentum network, to smooth the learning dynamics of target domain features and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic of discrepancy measurement to align the distributions in the source and target domains via dynamic weights to evaluate the importance of the samples. After tackling the above issues, extensive experiments on sim2real benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
