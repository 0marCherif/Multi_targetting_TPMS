It is a powerful technique to automatically extract highlevel features from complex data which can be exploited for applications\nsuch as computer vision, natural language processing, cybersecurity, communications, and so on. For the particular case of computer vision, several\nalgorithms like object detection in real time videos have been proposed\nand they work well on Desktop GPUs and distributed computing platforms. However these algorithms are still heavy for mobile and embedded\nvisual applications. The rapid spreading of smart portable devices and the\nemerging 5G network are introducing new smart multimedia applications\nin mobile environments. As a consequence, the possibility of implementing deep neural networks to mobile environments has attracted a lot of\nresearchers. This paper presents emerging deep learning acceleration techniques that can enable the delivery of real time visual recognition into the\nhands of end users, anytime and anywhere"}}

These time series are a great opportunity to detect and measure\nthe space and time changes of anthropogenic and natural features. In this work, we thus exploit both temporal and spatial information\nprovided by these images to generate land cover maps. For this purpose, we combine a fully convolutional neural network with\na convolutional long short-term memory. Implementation details of the proposed spatio-temporal neural network architecture are\nprovided. Experimental results show that the temporal information provided by time series images allows increasing the accuracy of\nland cover classification, thus producing up-to-date maps that can help in identifying changes on earth in both time and space."}}

We are proposing here an MADM (Multiple Attribute Decision Making) based ranking algorithm using a multi-layered directed acyclic graph (DAG) model to rank the critical nodes in the network. Ranking of the critical nodes can contribute to the resilience improvement process. Our proposed MVNRank (Multiple Vulnerability Node Rank) algorithm takes into account the exploit and impact scores of vulnerabilities as quantified by CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) and the severity level of each vulnerability. The algorithm also takes into account the asset value, degree centrality and node's distance from the target network in the vulnerability graph. The pseudocode for the resilience improvement using the node ranking is provided and necessary simulation results are presented to justify the node ranking importance."}}

We are proposing a comprehensive cyber resilience framework for the ICS by decomposing the resilience metric into a hierarchy of several sub-metrics. These metrics form a tree structure that has the potential to capture qualitative information about system's security and resilience posture and can be used as a high-level framework to identify where modeling and analysis are needed to be carried out. We present a brief description of resilient ICS characteristics and a cyber resilience assessment model for ICS. Finally, we present the cyber resilience metrics formulation methods and an illustration of resilience metrics calculation using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Our resilience framework can serve as a platform for a multi-criteria decision aid and help technical experts in identifying the gap in the study of ICS resilience."}}
