To capture users' dynamic preferences and maximize their long-term engagement, IRS are usually formulated as reinforcement learning (RL) problems. Despite the promise to solve complex decision-making problems, RL-based methods generally require a large amount of online interaction, restricting their applications due to economic considerations. One possible direction to alleviate this issue is cross-domain recommendation that aims to leverage abundant logged interaction data from a source domain (e.g., adventure genre in movie recommendation) to improve the recommendation quality in the target domain (e.g., crime genre). Nevertheless, prior studies mostly focus on adapting the static representations of users/items. Few have explored how the temporally dynamic user-item interaction patterns transform across domains. Motivated by the above consideration, we propose DACIR, a novel Doubly-Adaptive deep RL-based framework for Cross-domain Interactive Recommendation. We first pinpoint how users behave differently in two domains and highlight the potential to leverage the shared user dynamics to boost IRS. To transfer static user preferences across domains, DACIR enforces consistency of item representation by aligning embeddings into a shared latent space. In addition, given the user dynamics in IRS, DACIR calibrates the dynamic interaction patterns in two domains via reward correlation. Once the double adaptation narrows the cross-domain gap, we are able to learn a transferable policy for the target recommender by leveraging logged data. Experiments on real-world datasets validate the superiority of our approach, which consistently achieves significant improvements over the baselines."}}

To achieve this, the system periodically queries users' preference on attributes and collects their feedback. However, most existing conversational recommender systems only enable the user to provide absolute feedback to the attributes. In practice, the absolute feedback is usually limited, as the users tend to provide biased feedback when expressing the preference. Instead, the user is often more inclined to express comparative preferences, since user preferences are inherently relative. To enable users to provide comparative preferences during conversational interactions, we propose a novel comparison-based conversational recommender system. The relative feedback, though more practical, is not easy to be incorporated since its feedback scale is always mismatched with users' absolute preferences. With effectively collecting and understanding the relative feedback from an interactive manner, we further propose a new bandit algorithm, which we call RelativeConUCB. The experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the advantage of our proposed method, compared to the existing bandit algorithms in the conversational recommender systems."}}

Various breakthroughs ranging from games to robotics have spurred the interest in designing sophisticated RL algorithms and systems. However, the prevailing workflow in RL is to learn tabula rasa, which may incur computational inefficiency. This precludes continuous deployment of RL algorithms and potentially excludes researchers without large-scale computing resources. In many other areas of machine learning, the pretraining paradigm has shown to be effective in acquiring transferable knowledge, which can be utilized for a variety of downstream tasks. Recently, we saw a surge of interest in Pretraining for Deep RL with promising results. However, much of the research has been based on different experimental settings. Due to the nature of RL, pretraining in this field is faced with unique challenges and hence requires new design principles. In this survey, we seek to systematically review existing works in pretraining for deep reinforcement learning, provide a taxonomy of these methods, discuss each sub-field, and bring attention to open problems and future directions."}}

By introducing conversational key-terms, existing conversational recommenders can effectively reduce the need for extensive exploration and elicit the user preferences faster and more accurately. However, existing conversational recommenders leveraging key-terms heavily rely on the availability and quality of the key-terms, and their performances might degrade significantly when the key-terms are incomplete or not well labeled, which usually happens when there are new items being consistently incorporated into the systems and involving lots of human efforts to acquire well-labeled key-terms is costly. Besides, existing CRS methods leverage the feedback to different conversational key-terms separately, without considering the underlying relations between the key-terms. In this case, the learning of the conversational recommenders is sample inefficient, especially when there is a large number of candidate conversational key-terms.                                                                                                                                                                               In this paper, we propose a knowledge-aware conversational preference elicitation framework and a bandit-based algorithm GraphConUCB. To achieve efficient preference elicitation given items with incompletely labeled key-terms, our algorithm leverage the underlying relations between the key-terms, guided by the knowledge graph. Being knowledge-aware, our algorithm propagates the user preferences via a pseudo graph feedback module, which also accelerates the exploration in the large action space of key-terms and improves the conversational sample efficiency. To select the most informative conversational key-terms in the graphs to conduct conversations, we further devise a graph-based optimal design module which leverages the graph structure. We provide the theoretical analysis of the regret upper bound for GraphConUCB. With extensive experiments, we show that our algorithm can effectively handle the items with incompletely labeled key-terms, and improves over the state-of-the-art baselines significantly."}}

Though the matching between two graphs and among multiple graphs have been intensively studied in literature, the online setting for incremental matching of a stream of graphs has been rarely considered. In this paper, we treat the graphs as graphs on a super-graph, and propose a novel breadth first search based method for expanding the neighborhood on the super-graph for a new coming graph, such that the matching with the new graph can be efficiently performed within the constructed neighborhood. Then depth first search is performed to update the overall pairwise matchings. Moreover, we show our approach can also be readily used in the batch mode setting, by adaptively determining the order of coming graph batch for matching, still under the neighborhood expansion based incremental matching framework. Experiments on both online and offline matching of graph collections show our approach\u2019s state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency."}}
