To generalize agents' skills outside the given dataset, we propose a goal-swapping procedure that generates additional trajectories. To alleviate the problem of noise and extrapolation errors, we present a general offline reinforcement learning method called deterministic Q-advantage policy gradient (DQAPG). In the experiments, DQAPG outperforms state-of-the-art goal-conditioned offline RL methods in a wide range of benchmark tasks, and goal-swapping further improves the test results. It is noteworthy, that the proposed method obtains good performance on the challenging dexterous in-hand manipulation tasks for which the prior methods failed."}}

Despite the progress that has been made, rich and informative spectral information of HSI has been largely underutilized by existing methods which employ convolutional kernels with limited size of receptive field in the spectral domain. To address this issue, we propose a spectral graph reasoning network (SGR) learning framework comprising two crucial modules: 1) a spectral decoupling module which unpacks and casts multiple spectral embeddings into a unified graph whose node corresponds to an individual spectral feature channel in the embedding space; the graph performs interpretable reasoning to aggregate and align spectral information to guide learning spectral-specific graph embeddings at multiple contextual levels 2) a spectral ensembling module explores the interactions and interdependencies across graph embedding hierarchy via a novel recurrent graph propagation mechanism. Experiments on two HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed architecture can significantly improve the classification accuracy compared with the existing methods with a sizable margin."}}

This paper proposes a novel approach to decomposing multiple human bodies into semantic part regions in unconstrained environments. Specifically we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture which comprises of novel semantic and contour attention mechanisms across feature hierarchy to resolve the semantic ambiguities and boundary localization issues related to semantic body parsing. We further propose to encode estimated pose as higher-level contextual information which is combined with local semantic cues in a novel graphical model in a principled manner. In this proposed model, the lower-level semantic cues can be recursively updated by propagating higher-level contextual information from estimated pose and vice versa across the graph, so as to alleviate erroneous pose information and pixel level predictions. We further propose an optimization technique to efficiently derive the solutions. Our proposed method achieves the state-of-art results on the challenging Pascal Person-Part dataset."}}

We introduce an exemplar-based nonparametric view of contextual cues, where the inherent relationships implied by object hypotheses are encoded on a similarity graph of regions. Contextual relationships learning and propagation are performed to estimate the pairwise contexts between all pairs of unlabeled local regions. Our algorithm integrates the learned contexts into a Conditional Random Field (CRF) in the form of pairwise potentials and infers the per-region semantic labels. We evaluate our approach on the challenging YouTube-Objects dataset which shows that the proposed contextual relationship model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."}}

In order to acquire high-quality tracklets, we propose a transductive inference model which is capable of calibrating short-range noisy object tracklets with respect to long-range dependencies and high-level context cues. In the center of this work lies a new paradigm of semantic video object segmentation beyond modeling appearance and motion of objects locally, where the semantic label is inferred by jointly exploiting multi-scale contextual information and spatial-temporal relations of video object. We evaluate our method on two popular semantic video object segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it advances the state-of-the-art by achieving superior accuracy performance than other leading methods."}}

However, for video semantic object segmentation, a domain where labels are scarce, effectively exploiting the representation power of CNN with limited training data remains a challenge. Simply borrowing the existing pretrained CNN image recognition model for video segmentation task can severely hurt performance. We propose a semi-supervised approach to adapting CNN image recognition model trained from labeled image data to the target domain exploiting both semantic evidence learned from CNN, and the intrinsic structures of video data. By explicitly modeling and compensating for the domain shift from the source domain to the target domain, this proposed approach underpins a robust semantic object segmentation method against the changes in appearance, shape and occlusion in natural videos. We present extensive experiments on challenging datasets that demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods."}}
