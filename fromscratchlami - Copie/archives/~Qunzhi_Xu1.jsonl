The objective is how to adaptively sample from these p local streams and how to use the observed data to raise a correct global alarm as quickly as possible. In this paper, we develop the first asymptotic optimality theory in the active quickest detection literature for the case when s = r = 2. To be more concrete, we propose to combine three ideas to develop efficient active quickest detection algorithms: (1) win-stay, lose-switch sampling strategy; (2) local CUSUM statistics for local monitoring; and (3) the SUM-Shrinkage technique to fuse local statistics into a global decision. We show that our proposed algorithms are asymptotically optimal in the sense of minimizing detection delay up to the second order subject to the false alarm constraint. Numerical studies are conducted to validate our theoretical results."}}

In this paper, we consider such problem under the sampling control constraint, in which one is able to take observations from only one of the local processes at each time step. Our objective is to design an adaptive sampling policy and a stopping time policy that is able to raise a correct alarm as quickly as possible subject to the false alarm and sampling control constraint. We develop an efficient sequential change-point detection algorithm under the sampling control that turns out to be second-order asymptotically optimal under the full data scenario. That is, with the sampling rate that is only 1/M of the full data scenario, our proposed algorithm has the same performance up to second-order as the optimal procedure under the full data scenario."}}
