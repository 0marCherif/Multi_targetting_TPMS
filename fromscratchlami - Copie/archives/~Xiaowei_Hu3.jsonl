There are two technical contributions in our network design. First, we formulate the recurrent attention residual (RAR) module to combine the contexts in two adjacent CNN layers and learn an attention map to select a residual and then refine the context features. Second, we develop a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BFPN) to aggregate shadow contexts spanned across different CNN layers by deploying two series of RAR modules in the network to iteratively combine and refine context features: one series to refine context features from deep to shallow layers, and another series from shallow to deep layers. Hence, we can better suppress false detections and enhance shadow details at the same time. We evaluate our network on two common shadow detection benchmark datasets: SBU and UCF. Experimental results show that our network outperforms the best existing method with 34.88% reduction on SBU and 34.57% reduction on UCF for the balance error rate."}}

The inference of abnormal regions on the input image requires an understanding of the surrounding semantic context. This work presents a Semantic Context based Anomaly Detection Network, SCADN, for unsupervised anomaly detection by learning the semantic context from the normal samples. To achieve this, we first generate multi-scale striped masks to remove a part of regions from the normal samples, and then train a generative adversarial network to reconstruct the unseen regions. Note that the masks are designed in multiple scales and stripe directions, and various training examples are generated to obtain the rich semantic context . In testing, we obtain an error map by computing the difference between the reconstructed image and the input image for all samples, and infer the abnormal samples based on the error maps. Finally, we perform various experiments on three public benchmark datasets and a new dataset LaceAD collected by us, and show that our method clearly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods."}}

While the low-level integrated features are capable of capturing more saliency details, the high-level integrated features can reduce non-salient regions in the intermediate prediction. Furthermore, the RRBs can obtain complementary saliency information of the intermediate prediction, and add the residual into the intermediate prediction to refine the saliency maps. We evaluate the proposed R3Net on five widely-used saliency detection benchmarks by comparing it with 16 stateof-the-art saliency detectors.

Then, from the AMLIF, we further predict a haze-free result for an atmospheric scattering model, as well as for four haze-layer separation models, and then fuse the results together to produce the final haze-free image. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we compare our network with several state-of-the-art methods on two widely-used dehazing benchmark datasets, as well as on two sets of real-world hazy images. Experimental results demonstrate clear quantitative and qualitative improvements of our method over the state-of-the-arts."}}

However, existing CNN-based algorithms suffer from the problem that the convolutional features are scale-sensitive in object detection task but it is common that traffic images and videos contain vehicles with a large variance of scales. In this paper, we delve into the source of scale sensitivity, and reveal two key issues: 1) existing RoI pooling destroys the structure of small scale objects and 2) the large intra-class distance for a large variance of scales exceeds the representation capability of a single network. Based on these findings, we present a scale-insensitive convolutional neural network (SINet) for fast detecting vehicles with a large variance of scales. First, we present a context-aware RoI pooling to maintain the contextual information and original structure of small scale objects. Second, we present a multi-branch decision network to minimize the intra-class distance of features. These lightweight techniques bring zero extra time complexity but prominent detection accuracy improvement. The proposed techniques can be equipped with any deep network architectures and keep them trained end-to-end. Our SINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and speed (up to 37 FPS) on the KITTI benchmark and a new highway dataset, which contains a large variance of scales and extremely small objects."}}

Yet, small, distant, and incomplete objects with sparse or few points are often hard to detect. We present Sparse2Dense, a new framework to efficiently boost 3D detection performance by learning to densify point clouds in latent space. Specifically, we first train a dense point 3D detector (DDet) with a dense point cloud as input and design a sparse point 3D detector (SDet) with a regular point cloud as input. Importantly, we formulate the lightweight plug-in S2D module and the point cloud reconstruction module in SDet to densify 3D features and train SDet to produce 3D features, following the dense 3D features in DDet. So, in inference, SDet can simulate dense 3D features from regular (sparse) point cloud inputs without requiring dense inputs. We evaluate our method on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset and the Waymo Domain Adaptation Dataset, showing its high performance and efficiency over the state of the arts."}}

Furthermore, we design an end-to-end deep neural network, where we train it to learn depth-attentional features via a depth-guided attention mechanism, and regress a residual map to produce the rain-free image output.

By learning these weights through training, we can recover direction-aware spatial context (DSC) for detecting shadows. This design is developed into the DSC module and embedded in a CNN to learn DSC features at different levels. Moreover, a weighted cross entropy loss is designed to make the training more effective.
