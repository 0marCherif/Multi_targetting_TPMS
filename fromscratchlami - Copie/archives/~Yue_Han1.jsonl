We observe mass redundancy in the weights of both handcrafted and randomly searched architectures. Inspired by the development of human brains, we prune low-sensitivity neurons in the model and add new neurons to the graph, and the relation between individual neurons are emphasized and the existence of layers weakened. We propose a process to discover the best base model by random architecture search, and discover the best locations and connections of the added neurons by evolutionary search. Experiment results show that the NHN achieves higher test accuracy on Cifar-10 than state-of-the-art handcrafted and randomly searched architectures, while requiring much fewer parameters and less searching time."}}
