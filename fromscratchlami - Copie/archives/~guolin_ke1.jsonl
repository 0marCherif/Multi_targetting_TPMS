Recent success of AlphaFold and its variants shows that deep learning models are capable of accurately predicting protein complex structures, yet with the painstaking effort of homology search and pairing. To bypass this need, we present Uni-Fold MuSSe (Multimer with Single Sequence inputs), which predicts protein complex structures from their primary sequences with the aid of pre-trained protein language models. Specifically, we built protein complex prediction models based on the protein sequence representations of ESM-2, a large protein language model with 3 billion parameters. In order to adapt the language model to inter-protein evolutionary patterns, we slightly modified and further pre-trained the language model on groups of protein sequences with known interactions. Our results highlight the potential of protein language models for complex prediction and suggest room for improvements."}}

Traditional solutions, like virtual screening, require exhaustively searching on a large molecular database, which are inefficient and cannot return novel molecules beyond the database. The pocket-based 3D molecular generation model, i.e., directly generating a molecule with a 3D structure and binding position in the pocket, is a new promising way to address this issue. Herein, we propose VD-Gen, a novel pocket-based 3D molecular generation pipeline. VD-Gen consists of several carefully designed stages to generate fine-grained 3D molecules with binding positions in the pocket cavity end-to-end. Rather than directly generating or sampling atoms with 3D positions in the pocket like in early attempts, in VD-Gen, we first randomly initialize many virtual particles in the pocket; then iteratively move these virtual particles, making the distribution of virtual particles approximate the distribution of molecular atoms. After virtual particles are stabilized in 3D space, we extract a 3D molecule from them. Finally, we further refine atoms in the extracted molecule by iterative movement again, to get a high-quality 3D molecule, and predict a confidence score for it. Extensive experiment results on pocket-based molecular generation demonstrate that VD-Gen can generate novel 3D molecules to fill the target pocket cavity with high binding affinities, significantly outperforming previous baselines."}}

However, previous methods learned from 1D SMILES sequences or 2D molecular graphs failed to achieve high accuracy as QC properties primarily depend on the 3D equilibrium conformations optimized by electronic structure methods, far different from the sequence-type and graph-type data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Uni-Mol+ to tackle this challenge. Uni-Mol+ first generates a raw 3D molecule conformation from inexpensive methods such as RDKit. Then, the raw conformation is iteratively updated to its target DFT equilibrium conformation using neural networks, and the learned conformation will be used to predict the QC properties. To effectively learn this update process towards the equilibrium conformation, we introduce a two-track Transformer model backbone and train it with the QC property prediction task. We also design a novel approach to guide the model's training process. Our extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that the proposed Uni-Mol+ significantly improves the accuracy of QC property prediction in various datasets. We have made the code and model publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Mol}."}}

Recent methods attempted to solve the 3D reconstruction problem with the autoencoder architecture, which suffers from the latent vector space sampling problem and frequently produces suboptimal pose inferences and inferior 3D reconstructions. Here we present an improved autoencoder architecture called ACE (Asymmetric Complementary autoEncoder), based on which we designed the ACE-EM method for cryo-EM 3D reconstructions. Compared to previous methods, ACE-EM reached higher pose space coverage within the same training time and boosted the reconstruction performance regardless of the choice of decoders. With this method, the Nyquist resolution (highest possible resolution) was reached for 3D reconstructions of both simulated and experimental cryo-EM datasets. Furthermore, ACE-EM is the only amortized inference method that reached the Nyquist resolution."}}

Uni-QSAR combines molecular representation learning (MRL) of 1D sequential tokens, 2D topology graphs, and 3D conformers with pretraining models to leverage rich representation from large-scale unlabeled data. Without any manual fine-tuning or model selection, Uni-QSAR outperforms SOTA in 21/22 tasks of the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC) benchmark under designed parallel workflow, with an average performance improvement of 6.09\\%. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical usefulness of Uni-QSAR in drug discovery domains."}}
