The majority of existing works study methodologies of set function learning under the function value oracle, which, however, requires expensive supervision signals.

In this work, we present a principled yet practical maximum likelihood learning framework, termed as EquiVSet,  that simultaneously meets the following desiderata of learning neural set functions under the OS oracle: i) permutation invariance of the set mass function being modeled; ii) permission of varying ground set; iii) minimum prior and iv) scalability. The main components of our framework involve: an energy-based treatment of the set mass function, DeepSet-style architectures to handle permutation invariance, mean-field variational inference, and its amortized variants.

Usually, training a high-quality topic model requires large amount of textual data. In many real-world scenarios, customer textual data should be private and sensitive, precluding uploading to data centers. This paper proposes a Federated NMF (FedNMF) framework, which allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a high-quality NMF based topic model with locally stored data. However, standard federated learning will significantly undermine the performance of topic models in downstream tasks (e.g., text classification) when the data distribution over clients is heterogeneous. To alleviate this issue, we further propose FedNMF+MI, which simultaneously maximizes the mutual information (MI) between the count features of local texts and their topic weight vectors to mitigate the performance degradation. Experimental results show that our FedNMF+MI methods outperform Federated Latent Dirichlet Allocation (FedLDA) and the FedNMF without MI methods for short texts by a significant margin on both coherence score and classification F1 score."}}
