This paper evaluates the contributions of target-language context models towards the translation of OOV words, specifically in those cases where OOV translations are derived from external knowledge sources, such as dictionaries. We develop both neural and non-neural context models and evaluate them within both phrase-based and self-attention based neural machine translation systems. Our results show that neural language models that integrate additional context beyond the current sentence are the most effective in disambiguating possible OOV word translations. We present an efficient second-pass lattice-rescoring method for wide-context neural language models and demonstrate performance improvements over state-of-the-art self-attention based neural MT systems in five out of six low-resource language pairs."}}

We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-lingual, multi-modal and cross-document type learning. We describe effective strategies for exploiting weakly supervised signals as a pre-training step and show that they lead to significant gains in downstream classification accuracy. We also discuss label collection schemes that help minimize the amount of noise in collected data."}}

However, existing VLC systems have primarily been focused on one-way communications from the illumination infrastructure to the mobile device. They are power demanding and not applicable for communication in the opposite direction. In this paper, we present RetroVLC, a duplex VLC system that enables a battery-free device to perform bi-directional communications over a shared light carrier across the uplink and downlink. The design features a retro-reflector fabric that backscatters light, an LCD modulator, and several low-power optimization techniques. We have prototyped a working system consisting of a credit card-sized battery-free tag and an illuminating LED reader. Experimental results show that the tag can achieve 10kbps downlink speed and 0.5kbps uplink speed over a distance of 2.4m. We outline several potential applications and limitations of the system."}}

Existing designs, however, consume significant power and computational resources, and hence cannot be run on low complexity, power constrained backscatter devices. This paper makes two main contributions: (1) we introduce the first multi-antenna cancellation design that operates on backscatter devices while retaining a small form factor and power footprint, (2) we introduce a novel coding mechanism that enables long range communication as well as concurrent transmissions and can be decoded on backscatter devices. We build hardware prototypes of the above designs that can be powered solely using harvested energy from TV and solar sources. The results show that our designs provide benefits for both RFID and ambient backscatter systems: they enable RFID tags to communicate directly with each other at distances of tens of meters and through multiple walls. They also increase the communication rate and range achieved by ambient backscatter systems by 100X and 40X respectively. We believe that this paper represents a substantial leap in the capabilities of backscatter communication."}}
