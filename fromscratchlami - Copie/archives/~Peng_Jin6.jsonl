The recent success of data-driven FWI methods results in a rapidly increasing demand for open datasets to serve the geophysics community. We present OpenFWI, a collection of large-scale multi-structural benchmark datasets, to facilitate diversified, rigorous, and reproducible research on FWI. In particular, OpenFWI consists of $12$ datasets ($2.1$TB in total) synthesized from multiple sources. It encompasses diverse domains in geophysics (interface, fault, CO$_2$ reservoir, etc.), covers different geological subsurface structures (flat, curve, etc.), and contain various amounts of data samples (2K - 67K). It also includes a dataset for 3D FWI. Moreover, we use OpenFWI to perform benchmarking over four deep learning methods, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning regimes. Along with the benchmarks, we implement additional experiments, including physics-driven methods, complexity analysis, generalization study, uncertainty quantification, and so on, to sharpen our understanding of datasets and methods. The studies either provide valuable insights into the datasets and the performance, or uncover their current limitations. We hope OpenFWI supports prospective research on FWI and inspires future open-source efforts on AI for science. All datasets and related information can be accessed through our website at https://openfwi-lanl.github.io/"}}

It has been widely used to simultaneously infer various geophysical properties~(such as velocity and conductivity). Among those inversion problems, some are explicitly governed by partial differential equations~(PDEs), while others are not. Without explicit governing equations, conventional physical-based inversion techniques are not feasible and data-driven inversion requires expensive full labels. To overcome this issue, we proposed a new data-driven multi-physics inversion technique with extremely weak supervision. Our key finding is that the pseudo labels can be constructed by learning the local relationship among geophysical properties at very sparse locations. We explore the multi-physics inversion problem from two distinct measurements~(seismic and electromagnetic data) to three geophysical properties~(velocity, conductivity, and $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ saturation) with synthetic data based on the Kimberlina storage reservoir in California.  Our results show that we are able to invert for properties without explicit governing equations. Moreover, the labeled data on three geophysical properties can be significantly reduced by 50 times~(from 100 down to only 2 locations)."}}

This problem is mathematically formulated by a second order partial differential equation (PDE), but is hard to solve. Moreover, acquiring velocity map is extremely expensive, making it impractical to scale up a supervised approach to train the mapping from seismic data to velocity maps with convolutional neural networks (CNN).We address these difficulties by $\\textit{integrating PDE and CNN in a loop}$, thus shifting the paradigm to unsupervised learning that only requires seismic data. In particular, we use finite difference to approximate the forward modeling of PDE as a differentiable operator (from velocity map to seismic data) and model its inversion by CNN (from seismic data to velocity map). Hence, we transform the supervised inversion task into an unsupervised seismic data reconstruction task. We also introduce a new large-scale dataset $\\textit{OpenFWI}$, to establish a more challenging benchmark for the community. Experiment results show that our model (using seismic data alone) yields comparable accuracy to the supervised counterpart (using both seismic data and velocity map). Furthermore, it outperforms the supervised model when involving more seismic data."}}
