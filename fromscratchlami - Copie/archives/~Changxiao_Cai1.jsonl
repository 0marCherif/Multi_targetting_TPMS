While various works have been dedicated to this tensor completion problem,   prior algorithms either are computationally too expensive, or come with sub-optimal statistical guarantees.  Focusing on ``incoherent'' tensors of a constant CP rank, we propose a two-stage nonconvex algorithm --- (vanilla) gradient descent following a rough initialization --- that  achieves the best of both worlds. Specifically, the proposed nonconvex algorithm provably completes the tensor and retrieves all low-rank factors within nearly linear time, while at the same time enjoying near-optimal statistical guarantees (i.e. minimal sample complexity and optimal estimation accuracy).  The estimation errors are evenly spread out across all entries, thus achieving  optimal entrywise statistical accuracy. "}}
