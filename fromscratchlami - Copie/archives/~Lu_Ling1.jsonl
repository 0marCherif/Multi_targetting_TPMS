Computational methods simulate bokeh effects without relying on a physical camera lens. However, in the realm of digital bokeh synthesis, the two main challenges for bokeh synthesis are color bleeding and partial occlusion at object boundaries. Our primary goal is to overcome these two major challenges using physics principles that define bokeh formation. To achieve this, we propose a novel and accurate filtering-based bokeh rendering equation and a physically-based occlusion-aware bokeh renderer, dubbed Dr.Bokeh, which addresses the aforementioned challenges during the rendering stage without the need of post-processing or data-driven approaches. Our rendering algorithm first preprocesses the input RGBD to obtain a layered scene representation. Dr.Bokeh then takes the layered representation and user-defined lens parameters to render photo-realistic lens blur. By softening non-differentiable operations, we make Dr.Bokeh differentiable such that it can be plugged into a machine-learning framework. We perform quantitative and qualitative evaluations on synthetic and real-world images to validate the effectiveness of the rendering quality and the differentiability of our method. We show Dr.Bokeh not only outperforms state-of-the-art bokeh rendering algorithms in terms of photo-realism but also improves the depth quality from depth-from-defocus."}}

To generate such effects, traditional computer graphics uses a physically-based renderer along with 3D geometry. To compensate for the lack of geometry in 2D Image compositing, recent deep learning-based approaches introduced a pixel height representation to generate soft shadows and reflections. However, the lack of geometry limits the quality of the generated soft shadows and constrain reflections to pure specular ones. We introduce PixHt-Lab, a system leveraging an explicit mapping from pixel height representation to 3D space. Using this mapping, PixHt-Lab reconstructs both the cutout and background geometry and renders realistic, diverse, lighting effects for image compositing. Given a surface with physically-based materials, we can render reflections with varying glossiness. To generate more realistic soft shadows, we further propose to use 3D-aware buffer channels to guide a neural renderer. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that PixHt-Lab significantly improves soft shadow generation."}}

Existing methods conduct macro-level or simplified micro-level vaccine distribution by assuming the homogeneous behavior within subgroup populations and lacking mobility dynamics integration. Directly applying these models for micro-level vaccine allocation leads to sub-optimal solutions due to the lack of behavioral-related details. To address the issue, we first incorporate the mobility heterogeneity in disease dynamics modeling and mimic the disease evolution process using a Trans-vaccine-SEIR model. Then we develop a novel deep reinforcement learning to seek the optimal vaccine allocation strategy for the high-degree spatial-temporal disease evolution system. The graph neural network is used to effectively capture the structural properties of the mobility contact network and extract the dynamic disease features. In our evaluation, the proposed framework reduces 7% - 10% of infections and deaths than the baseline strategies. Extensive evaluation shows that the proposed framework is robust to seek the optimal vaccine allocation with diverse mobility patterns in the micro-level disease evolution system. In particular, we find the optimal vaccine allocation strategy in the transit usage restriction scenario is significantly more effective than restricting cross-zone mobility for the top 10% age-based and income-based zones. These results provide valuable insights for areas with limited vaccines and low logistic efficacy."}}

However, vacant e-hailing vehicles occupy the road capacity, thus, aggravated traffic congestions. With the availability of real-time data, one way to deal with these concerns is to improve the forecast accuracy of demand and supply thus help improving the dispatching efficiency. This paper proposes a two-stage forecast model based on big data to real-time predict the gap between demand and supply in large scale of network. The framework includes four steps, GPS data dimensionality reduction based on Principle Component Analysis, pattern analysis, the proposed methodology of two-stage forecast model and model verification. The methodology combines both non-linear Support Vector Machine and Backpropagation neural network. In the cast study of Beijing city, the model is testified and the results show that two-stage forecast model fastens responsive performance and improves the prediction accuracy. The proposed framework not only reveals the mobility pattern, it also improves the prediction accuracy for the gap between demand and supply of taxis thus helps to improve the taxi utilizations."}}
