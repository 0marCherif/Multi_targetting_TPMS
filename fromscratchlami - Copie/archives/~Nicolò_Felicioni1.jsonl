OPE is crucial when evaluating a new policy online is too expensive or risky. Many of the state-of-the-art OPE estimators are based on the Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) technique, which provides an unbiased estimator when the full support assumption holds, i.e., when the logging policy assigns a non-zero probability to each action. \nHowever, there are several scenarios where this assumption does not hold in practice, i.e., there is deficient support, and the IPS estimator is biased in the general case.\nIn this paper, we consider two alternative estimators for the deficient support OPE problem. \nWe first show how to adapt an estimator that was originally proposed for a different domain to the deficient support setting.\nThen, we propose another estimator, which is a novel contribution of this paper.\nThese estimators exploit additional information about the actions, which we call side information, in order to make reliable estimates on the unsupported actions. \nUnder alternative assumptions that do not require full support, we show that the considered estimators are unbiased.\nWe also provide a theoretical analysis of the concentration when relaxing all the assumptions. Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation showing how the considered estimators are better suited for the deficient support setting compared to the baselines."}}

It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness, limitations and possible future directions of development."}}
