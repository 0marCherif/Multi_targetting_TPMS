In real-world and large applications graph data are usually incomplete, motivating graph reasoning models for missing-fact or missing-relationship inference. While these models can achieve state-of-the-art performance, they require a large amount of training data.\n\nRecent years have witnessed the rising interest in label creation with data programming (DP) methods, which aim to generate training labels from heuristic labeling functions. However, existing methods typically focus on unstructured data and are not optimized for graphs. In this work, we propose LogicDP, a data programming framework for graph data. Unlike existing DP methods, (1) LogicDP utilizes the inductive logic programming (ILP) technique and automatically discovers the labeling functions from the graph data; (2) LogicDP employs a budget-aware framework to iteratively refine the functions by querying an oracle, which significantly reduces the human efforts in function creations. Experiments show that LogicDP achieves better data efficiency in both scene graph and knowledge graph reasoning tasks."}}

However, due to the complexity that the notion of time introduces to the learning of the rules, an accurate graph reasoning, e.g., predicting new links between entities, is still a difficult problem. In this paper, we propose TILP, a differentiable framework for temporal logical rules learning. By designing a constrained random walk mechanism and the introduction of temporal operators, we ensure the efficiency of our model. We present temporal features modeling in tKG, e.g., recurrence, temporal order, interval between pair of relations, and duration, and incorporate it into our learning process. We compare TILP with state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets. We show that our proposed framework can improve upon the performance of baseline methods while providing interpretable results. In particular, we consider various scenarios in which training samples are limited, data is biased, and the time range between training and inference are different. In all these cases, TILP works much better than the state-of-the-art methods."}}

This task has been studied extensively for traditional graph datasets such as knowledge graphs (KGs), with representative techniques such as inductive logic programming (ILP). Existing ILP methods typically assume learning from KGs with static facts and binary relations. Beyond KGs, graph structures are widely present in other applications such as video instructions, scene graphs and program executions. While inductive logic reasoning is also beneficial for these applications, applying ILP to the corresponding graphs is nontrivial: they are more complex than KGs, which usually involve timestamps and n-ary relations, effectively a type of hypergraph with temporal events. In this work, we study two of such applications and propose to represent them as hypergraphs with time intervals. To reason on this graph, we propose the multi-start random B-walk that traverses this hypergraph. Combining it with a path-consistency algorithm, we propose an efficient backward-chaining ILP method that learns logic rules by generalizing from both the temporal and the relational data."}}

However, recent studies have demonstrated that these models are vulnerable to adversarial attack, exposing a risk-of-use in critical applications where untrusted parties have access to the data environment or even directly to the sensor inputs. Existing adversarial defense methods are either limited to specific types of attacks or are too complex to be applied to practical vision models. More importantly, these methods rely on techniques that are not interpretable to humans. In this work, we argue that an effective defense should produce an explanation as to why the system is attacked, and by using a representation that is easily readable by a human user, e.g. a logic formalism. To this end, we propose logic adversarial defense (LogicDef), a defense framework that utilizes the scene graph of the image to provide a contextual structure for detecting and explaining object classification. Our framework first mines inductive logic rules from the extracted scene graph, and then uses these rules to construct a defense model that alerts the user when the vision model violates the consistency rules. The defense model is interpretable and its robustness is further enhanced by incorporating existing relational commonsense knowledge from projects such as ConceptNet. In order to handle the hierarchical nature of such relational reasoning, we use a curriculum learning approach based on object taxonomy, yielding additional improvements to training and performance."}}

In VQA, a series of questions are posed based on a set of images and the task at hand is to arrive at the answer. To achieve this, we take a symbolic reasoning based approach using the framework of formal logic. The image and the questions are converted into symbolic representations on which explicit reasoning is performed. We propose a formal logic framework where (i) images are converted to logical background facts with the help of scene graphs, (ii) the questions are translated to first-order predicate logic clauses using a transformer based deep learning model, and (iii) perform satisfiability checks, by using the background knowledge and the grounding of predicate clauses, to obtain the answer. Our proposed method is highly interpretable and each step in the pipeline can be easily analyzed by a human. We validate our approach on the CLEVR and the GQA dataset. We achieve near perfect accuracy of 99.6% on the CLEVR dataset comparable to the state of art models, showcasing that formal logic is a viable tool to tackle visual question answering. Our model is also data efficient, achieving 99.1% accuracy on CLEVR dataset when trained on just 10% of the training data."}}
