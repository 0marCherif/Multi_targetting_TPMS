{"id": "Sbbw7CEzm5", "cdate": 1640995200000, "mdate": 1648672287213, "content": {"title": "CausalSim: Toward a Causal Data-Driven Simulator for Network Protocols", "abstract": "We present CausalSim, a causal inference framework for unbiased trace-driven simulation. Current trace-driven simulators assume that the interventions being simulated (e.g., a new algorithm) would not affect the validity of the traces. However, real-world traces are often biased by the choices of algorithms made during trace collection, and hence replaying traces under an intervention may lead to incorrect results. CausalSim addresses this challenge by learning a causal model of the system dynamics and latent factors capturing the underlying system conditions during trace collection. It learns these models using an initial randomized control trial (RCT) under a fixed set of algorithms, and then applies them to remove biases from trace data when simulating new algorithms. Key to CausalSim is mapping unbiased trace-driven simulation to a tensor completion problem with extremely sparse observations. By exploiting a basic distributional invariance property present in RCT data, CausalSim enables a novel tensor completion method despite the sparsity of observations. Our extensive evaluation of CausalSim on both real and synthetic datasets, including more than ten months of real data from the Puffer video streaming system show it improves simulation accuracy, reducing errors by 53% and 61% on average compared to expert-designed and supervised learning baselines. Moreover, CausalSim provides markedly different insights about ABR algorithms compared to the biased baseline simulator, which we validate with a real deployment."}}

We present Adaptive Model Streaming (AMS), a new approach to improving the performance of efficient lightweight models for video inference on edge devices. AMS uses a remote server to continually train and adapt a small model running on the edge device, boosting its performance on the live video using online knowledge distillation from a large, state-of-the-art model. We discuss the challenges of over-the-network model adaptation for video inference and present several techniques to reduce communication the cost of this approach: avoiding excessive overfitting, updating a small fraction of important model parameters, and adaptive sampling of training frames at edge devices. On the task of video semantic segmentation, our experimental results show 0.4\u201317.8 percent mean Intersection-over-Union improvement compared to a pretrained model across several video datasets. Our prototype can perform video segmentation at 30 frames-per-second with 40 milliseconds camera-to-label latency on a Samsung Galaxy S10+ mobile phone, using less than 300 Kbps uplink and downlink bandwidth on the device."}}
