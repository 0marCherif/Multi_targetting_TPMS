Knowledge of the Electronic Health Records, underlying Database Management System, and the relevant clinical workflows are central to an effective cohort design. However, with technical, semantic, and organizational interoperability limitations, the database queries associated with a patient cohort may need to be reconfigured in every participating site. i2b2 and SHRINE advance the notion of patient cohorts as first class objects to be shared, aggregated, and recruited for research purposes across clinical sites. This paper reports on initial efforts to assess the integration of Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) and Philips eICU, two large-scale anonymized intensive care unit (ICU) databases, using standard terminologies, i.e. LOINC, ICD9-CM and SNOMED-CT. Focus of this work is lab and microbiology observations and key demographics for patients with a primary cardiovascular ICD9-CM diagnosis. Results and discussion reflecting on reference core terminology standards, offer insights on efforts to combine detailed intensive care data from multiple ICUs worldwide.\n"}}

A question of interest is whether \u201csimilar\u201d dynamical patterns can be identified across a heterogeneous patient cohort, and be used for prognosis of patients' health and progress. In this paper, we used a switching vector autoregressive framework to systematically learn and identify a collection of vital sign time series dynamics, which are possibly recurrent within the same patient and may be shared across the entire cohort. We show that these dynamical behaviors can be used to characterize the physiological \u201cstate\u201d of a patient. We validate our technique using simulated time series of the cardiovascular system, and human recordings of HR and BP time series from an orthostatic stress study with known postural states. Using the HR and BP dynamics of an intensive care unit (ICU) cohort of over 450 patients from the MIMIC II database, we demonstrate that the discovered cardiovascular dynamics are significantly associated with hospital mortality (dynamic modes 3 and 9, p = 0.001, p = 0.006 from logistic regression after adjusting for the APACHE scores). Combining the dynamics of BP time series and SAPS-I or APACHE-III provided a more accurate assessment of patient survival/mortality in the hospital than using SAPS-I and APACHE-III alone (p = 0.005 and p = 0.045). Our results suggest that the discovered dynamics of vital sign time series may contain additional prognostic value beyond that of the baseline acuity measures, and can potentially be used as an independent predictor of outcomes in the ICU.\n"}}

The development of novel models for mortality prediction is a popular task in machine learning, with researchers typically seeking to maximize measures such as the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). The number of \u2019researcher degrees of freedom\u2019 that contribute to the performance of a model, however, presents a challenge when seeking to compare reported performance of such models. In this study, we review publications that have reported performance of mortality prediction models based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database and attempt to reproduce the cohorts used in their studies. We then compare the performance reported in the studies against gradient boosting and logistic regression models using a simple set of features extracted from MIMIC. We demonstrate the large heterogeneity in studies that purport to conduct the single task of \u2019mortality prediction\u2019, highlighting the need for improvements in the way that prediction tasks are reported to enable fairer comparison between models. We reproduced datasets for 38 experiments corresponding to 28 published studies using MIMIC. In half of the experiments, the sample size we acquired was 25% greater or smaller than the sample size reported. The highest discrepancy was 11,767 patients. While accurate reproduction of each study cannot be guaranteed, we believe that these results highlight the need for more consistent reporting of model design and methodology to allow performance improvements to be compared. We discuss the challenges in reproducing the cohorts used in the studies, highlighting the importance of clearly reported methods (e.g. data cleansing, variable selection, cohort selection) and the need for open code and publicly available benchmarks.\n"}}

In this work, we describe a tool that utilizes machine learning and crowd intelligence to automatically transcribe images of paper-based spreadsheets into electronic form while protecting sensitive personal information. Our solution consists of four high-level stages: (1) the extraction of cell-level images from the spreadsheet grid, (2) machine recognition of digits within the cells, (3) human transcription of cell contents that the machine was uncertain of and (4) feedback of human transcription results to the machine to improve future classification performance. We test the algorithm on a novel data-set of 135 heterogeneous clinical flow-sheet images collected from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), 2 hand-drawn spreadsheets, one chalk-board drawing, and one printed table. we demonstrate that our algorithm provides a generalized solution for spreadsheet transcription that maintains privacy, is up to 10 times faster and twice as cost effective than existing alternatives. Our work is valuable both as a tool and as a starting point for the development of better algorithms.\n"}}

In particular, we employ HDP to combine clinical time series and text from the nursing progress notes in a probabilistic topic modeling framework for patient risk stratification. Given a patient cohort, we use HDP to infer latent \u201ctopics\u201d shared across multimodal patient data from the entire cohort. Each topic is modeled as a multinomial distribution over a vocabulary of codewords, defined over heterogeneous data sources. We evaluate the clinical utility of the learned topic structure using the first 24-hour ICU data from over 17,000 adult patients in the MIMIC-II database to estimate patients' risks of in-hospital mortality. Our results demonstrate that our approach provides a viable framework for combining different data modalities to model patient's states of health, and can potentially be used to generate alerts to identify patients at high risk of hospital mortality.\n"}}

Staggering amounts of data are collected in the ICU daily: multi-channel waveforms sampled hundreds of times each second, vital sign time series updated each second or minute, alarms and alerts, lab results, imaging results, records of medication and fluid administration, staff notes and more. Reducing the barriers to data access has the potential to accelerate knowledge generation and ultimately improve patient care. In this interactive tutorial we introduce the eICU Collaborative Research Database: a large, publicly available database created by the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology in partnership with the Philips eICU Research Institute. The database contains routinely collected data from over 200,000 admissions to intensive care units across the United States, with representation from 10-12% of US ICU beds. The data facilitates a breadth of research studies, such as investigations into treatment efficacy, discovery of clinical markers in illnesses, and the development of decision support models. Participants in the tutorial gain an overview of the eICU Collaborative Research Database, in particular being introduced to its structure, content, and limitations. Following this overview, participants explore a demo version of the database using a laptop in a hands-on project. This exercise requires minimal technical expertise and gives an insight into the type of study that can be carried out using the database. We also highlight the growing online community centered around secondary analysis of this data. All tutorial materials are open source and publicly available. The eICU Collaborative Research Database offers an unparalleled insight into ICU care. Access to the database is granted to legitimate researchers who request it, following completion of a training course in human subjects research and acceptance of a data use agreement. We anticipate that the research community will use this unique resource to further human knowledge in the field of critical care."}}

Clinicians in ICUs are often challenged with integrating large volumes of continuously recorded physiological and clinical data in order to diagnose and treat patients.

Predicting need for intubation could have important implications for the patient and medical staff and potentially enable timely interventions for improved patient outcome. Using data from adult ICU patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database, we developed gradient boosting models for predicting intubation onset. In a cohort of 12,470 patients, of whom 1,067 were intubated (8.55%), we achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.89, with 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 - 0.91, when predicting intubation 3 hours ahead of time, a significant increase (p<;0.001) over the AUROC achieved using several baselines, including logistic regression (0.81, 95% CI 0.78 - 0.84) and neural networks (0.80, 95% CI 0.77 - 0.83]). Finally, we conducted feature importance analysis using gradient boosting and derived useful insights in understanding the relative importance of clinical vs. biological variables in predicting impending respiratory decompensation in ICUs.\n"}}
