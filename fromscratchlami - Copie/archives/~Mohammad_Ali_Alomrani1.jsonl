However, previous works often rely on complex memory modules or inefficient random walk methods to construct temporal representations. To address these limitations, we present an efficient yet effective attention-based encoder that leverages temporal edge encodings and window-based subgraph sampling to generate task-agnostic embeddings. Moreover, we propose a joint-embedding architecture using non-contrastive SSL to learn rich temporal embeddings without labels. Experimental results on 7 benchmark datasets indicate that on average, our model outperforms SoTA baselines on the future link prediction task by 4.23% for the transductive setting and 3.30% for the inductive setting while only requiring 5-10x less training/inference time. Lastly, different aspects of the proposed framework are investigated through experimental analysis and ablation studies. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/graph_atlas."}}

Moreover, task labels are often scarce, costly to obtain, and highly imbalanced for large dynamic graphs. Recent advances in self-supervised learning on graphs demonstrate great potential, but focus on static graphs. State-of-the-art (SoTA) models for dynamic graphs are not only incompatible with the self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm but also fail to forecast interactions beyond the very near future. To address these limitations, we present DyG2Vec, an SSL-compatible, efficient model for representation learning on dynamic graphs. DyG2Vec uses a window-based mechanism to generate task-agnostic node embeddings that can be used to forecast future interactions. DyG2Vec significantly outperforms SoTA baselines on benchmark datasets for downstream tasks while only requiring a fraction of the training/inference time. We adapt two SSL evaluation mechanisms to make them applicable to dynamic graphs and thus show that SSL pre-training helps learn more robust temporal node representations, especially for scenarios with few labels.
