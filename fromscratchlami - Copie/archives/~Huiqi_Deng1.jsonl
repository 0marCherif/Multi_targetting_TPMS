Many recent studies have quantified a clear emergence of interactive concepts encoded by the DNN, which have been observed on different DNNs during the learning process. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the generalization power of each interactive concept, and we use the generalization power of different interactive concepts to explain the generalization power of the entire DNN. Specifically, we define the complexity of each interactive concept. We find that simple concepts can be better generalized to testing data than complex concepts. The DNN with strong generalization power usually learns simple concepts more quickly and encodes fewer complex concepts. More crucially, we discover the detouring dynamics of learning complex concepts, which explain both the high learning difficulty and the low generalization power of complex concepts."}}

However, existing attribution methods are often built upon different heuristics. There remains a lack of a unified theoretical understanding of why these methods are effective and how they are related. To this end, for the first time, we formulate core mechanisms of fourteen attribution methods, which were designed on different heuristics, into the same mathematical system, i.e., the system of Taylor interactions. Specifically, we prove that attribution scores estimated by fourteen attribution methods can all be reformulated as the weighted sum of two types of effects, i.e., independent effects of each individual input variable and interaction effects between input variables. The essential difference among the fourteen attribution methods mainly lies in the weights of allocating different effects. Based on the above findings, we propose three principles for a fair allocation of effects to evaluate the faithfulness of the fourteen attribution methods."}}

It has been observed and studied that a relatively small set of interactive concepts usually emerge in the knowledge representation of a sufficiently-trained neural network, and such concepts can faithfully explain the network output. Based on this, our study proves that compared to standard deep neural networks (DNNs), it is less likely for BNNs to encode complex concepts. Experiments verify our theoretical proofs. Note that the tendency to encode less complex concepts does not necessarily imply weak representation power, considering that complex concepts exhibit low generalization power and high adversarial vulnerability."}}

In this paper, we explore the representation bottleneck of BNNs from the perspective of conceptual representations. It is proven that the logic of a neural network can be faithfully mimicked by a specific sparse causal graph, where each causal pattern can be considered as a concept encoded by the neural network. Then, we formally define the complexity of concepts, and prove that compared to standard DNNs, it is more difficult for BNNs to encode complex concepts. Extensive experiments verify our theoretical proofs. The code will be released when the paper is accepted."}}

We discover and explain the reason for the feature collapse phenomenon in the first phase, i.e., the diversity of features over different samples keeps decreasing in the first phase, until samples of different categories share almost the same feature, which hurts the optimization of MLPs. We explain such a phenomenon in terms of the learning dynamics of MLPs. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the reason why four typical operations can alleviate the feature collapse.

Beyond empirical studies, our research first specifies an exact definition of the complexity of the concept that boosts the learning difficulty. Specifically, it is proven that the inference logic of a neural network can be represented as a causal graph. In this way, causal patterns in the causal graph can be used to formulate interactive concepts learned by the neural network. Based on such formulation, we explain the reason why simple interactive concepts in the data are more likely to be learned than complex interactive concepts. More crucially, we discover that our research provides a new perspective to explain previous understandings of the conceptual complexity. The code will be released when the paper is accepted."}}

To this end, we focus on the multi-order interaction between input variables, where the order represents the complexity of interactions. We discover that a DNN is more likely to encode both too simple and too complex interactions, but usually fails to learn interactions of intermediate complexity. Such a phenomenon is widely shared by different DNNs for different tasks. This phenomenon indicates a cognition gap between DNNs and humans, and we call it a representation bottleneck. We theoretically prove the underlying reason for the representation bottleneck. Furthermore, we propose losses to encourage/penalize the learning of interactions of specific complexities, and analyze the representation capacities of interactions of different complexities.
