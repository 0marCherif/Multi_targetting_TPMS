Large-scale profiled cancer genomics data enables us to develop computational methods for tumor stratification. However, most of the existing approaches only considered tumors from an individual cancer type during clustering, leading to the overlook of common patterns across cancer types and the vulnerability to the noise within that cancer type. To address these challenges, we proposed cancerAlign to map tumors of the target cancer type into latent spaces of other source cancer types. These tumors were then clustered in each latent space rather than the original space in order to exploit shared patterns across cancer types. Due to the lack of aligned tumor samples across cancer types, cancerAlign used adversarial learning to learn the mapping at the population level. It then used consensus clustering to integrate cluster labels from different source cancer types. We evaluated cancerAlign on 7,134 tumors spanning 24 cancer types from TCGA and observed substantial improvement on tumor stratification and cancer gene prioritization. We further revealed the transferability across cancer types, which reflected the similarity among them based on the somatic mutation profile. cancerAlign is an unsupervised approach that provides deeper insights into the heterogeneous and rapidly accumulating somatic mutation profile and can be also applied to other genome-scale molecular information."}}

Existing prediction models that forecast the first outbreak wave using mobility data may not be applicable to the multiwave prediction, because the evidence in the USA and Japan has shown that mobility patterns across different waves exhibit varying relationships with fluctuations in infection cases. Therefore, to predict the multiwave pandemic, we propose a Social Awareness-Based Graph Neural Network (SAB-GNN) that considers the decay of symptom-related web search frequency to capture the changes in public awareness across multiple waves. Our model combines GNN and LSTM to model the complex relationships among urban districts, inter-district mobility patterns, web search history, and future COVID-19 infections. We train our model to predict future pandemic outbreaks in the Tokyo area using its mobility and web search data from April 2020 to May 2021 across four pandemic waves collected by Yahoo Japan Corporation under strict privacy protection rules. Results demonstrate our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as ST-GNN, MPNN, and GraphLSTM. Though our model is not computationally expensive (only 3 layers and 10 hidden neurons), the proposed model enables public agencies to anticipate and prepare for future pandemic outbreaks."}}

Although conventional statistics provide useful information about the characteristics of either a single node\u2019s direct neighbours or the entire network, such metrics fail to measure the similarities of subnetworks or capture local, indirect neighbourhood relationships. Here we propose a graph-based machine learning method to quantify the spatial homogeneity of subnetworks. We apply the method to 11,790 urban road networks across 30 cities worldwide to measure the spatial homogeneity of road networks within each city and across different cities. We find that intracity spatial homogeneity is highly associated with socioeconomic status indicators such as gross domestic product and population growth. Moreover, intercity spatial homogeneity values obtained by transferring the model across different cities reveal the intercity similarity of urban network structures originating in Europe, passed on to cities in the United States and Asia. The socioeconomic development and intercity similarity revealed using our method can be leveraged to understand and transfer insights between cities. It also enables us to address urban policy challenges including network planning in rapidly urbanizing areas and regional inequality."}}

Current autoregressive model suffers from two major drawbacks. First, it is hard to  capture local geometric patterns as only one atom is generated at each step. Second, most of the autoregressive models generate atoms and chemical bonds in two separate processes, which causes a number of problems such as incorrect counts of rings, a bias distribution of bond lengths, and inaccurate 3D molecular structures. To tackle this problem, we designed a model, named FragDiff, to generate 3D molecules fragment-by-fragment for pockets. In each generation step, FragDiff places a molecular fragment around the pocket by using E(3)-equivariant diffusion generative models to simultaneously predict the atom types, atom coordinates and the chemical bonds of the fragment. Extensive experimental results confirm our assumption that unifying the atoms and bonds generations could significantly improve the quality of the sampled 3D molecules in terms of more accurate distributions of 2D subgraphs and 3D substructures."}}

Recently, the inclusion of 3D structures during targeted drug design shows superior performance to other target-free models as the atomic interaction in the 3D space is explicitly modeled. However, current 3D target-aware models either rely on the voxelized atom densities or the autoregressive sampling process, which are not equivariant to rotation or easily violate geometric constraints resulting in unrealistic structures. In this work, we develop a 3D equivariant diffusion model to solve the above challenges. To achieve target-aware molecule design, our method learns a joint generative process of both continuous atom coordinates and categorical atom types with a SE(3)-equivariant network. Moreover, we show that our model can serve as an unsupervised feature extractor to estimate the binding affinity under proper parameterization, which provides an effective way for drug screening. To evaluate our model, we propose a comprehensive framework to evaluate the quality of sampled molecules from different dimensions. Empirical studies show our model could generate molecules with more realistic 3D structures and better affinities towards the protein targets, and improve binding affinity ranking and prediction without retraining."}}

The limited representational power of MPNNs inspires the study of provably powerful GNN architectures. However, knowing one model is more powerful than another gives little insight about what functions they can or cannot express. It is still unclear whether these models are able to approximate specific functions such as counting certain graph substructures, which is essential for applications in biology, chemistry and social network analysis. Motivated by this, we propose to study the counting power of Subgraph MPNNs, a recent and popular class of powerful GNN models that extract rooted subgraphs for each node, assign the root node a unique identifier and encode the root node's representation within its rooted subgraph. Specifically, we prove that Subgraph MPNNs fail to count more-than-4-cycles at node level, implying that node representations cannot correctly encode the surrounding substructures like ring systems with more than four atoms. To overcome this limitation, we propose I$^2$-GNNs to extend Subgraph MPNNs by assigning different identifiers for the root node and its neighbors in each subgraph. I$^2$-GNNs' discriminative power is shown to be strictly stronger than Subgraph MPNNs and partially stronger than the 3-WL test. More importantly, I$^2$-GNNs are proven capable of counting all 3, 4, 5 and 6-cycles, covering common substructures like benzene rings in organic chemistry, while still keeping linear complexity. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first linear-time GNN model that can count 6-cycles with theoretical guarantees. We validate its counting power in cycle counting tasks and demonstrate its competitive performance in molecular prediction benchmarks."}}

We demonstrate the power of our equivalent condition by applying it to two ensembles of random problem instances that are challenging and popularly used in literature and prove that our method achieves exactness with overwhelming probability and nearly optimal sample complexity. Empirically, we use synthetic datasets to demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art group sparse learning models in terms of individual and group support recovery when the number of samples is small.

To learn meaningful representation from a protein structure for downstream tasks, not only the global backbone topology but the local fine-grained orientational relations between amino acids should also be considered. In this work, we propose the Orientation-Aware Graph Neural Networks (OAGNNs) to better sense the geometric characteristics in protein structure (e.g. inner-residue torsion angles, inter-residue orientations). Extending a single weight from a scalar to a 3D vector, we construct a rich set of geometric-meaningful operations to process both the classical and SO(3) representations of a given structure. To plug our designed perceptron unit into existing Graph Neural Networks, we further introduce an equivariant message passing paradigm, showing superior versatility in maintaining SO(3)-equivariance at the global scale. Experiments have shown that our OAGNNs have a remarkable ability to sense geometric orientational features compared to classical networks. OAGNNs have also achieved state-of-the-art performance on various computational biology applications related to protein 3D structures.\n\n"}}

In this work, we propose a new approach that predicts mutational effects on binding using the change in conformational flexibility of the protein-protein interface. Our approach, named Rotamer Density Estimator (RDE), employs a flow-based generative model to estimate the probability distribution of protein side-chain conformations and uses entropy to measure flexibility. RDE is trained solely on protein structures and does not require the supervision of experimental values of changes in binding affinities. Furthermore, the unsupervised representations extracted by RDE can be used for downstream neural network predictions with even greater accuracy. Our method outperforms empirical energy functions and other machine learning-based approaches."}}

Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) tackles this problem by learning transferable policies that support few-shot adaptation to unseen tasks. Despite recent advances in meta-RL, most existing methods require the access to the environmental reward function of new tasks to infer the task objective, which is not realistic in many practical applications. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of few-shot adaptation in the context of human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning. We develop a meta-RL algorithm that enables fast policy adaptation with preference-based feedback. The agent can adapt to new tasks by querying human's preference between behavior trajectories instead of using per-step numeric rewards. By extending techniques from information theory, our approach can design query sequences to maximize the information gain from human interactions while tolerating the inherent error of non-expert human oracle. In experiments, we extensively evaluate our method, Adaptation with Noisy OracLE (ANOLE), on a variety of meta-RL benchmark tasks and demonstrate substantial improvement over baseline algorithms in terms of both feedback efficiency and error tolerance."}}
