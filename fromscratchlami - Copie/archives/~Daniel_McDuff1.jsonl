Our approach aims to explicitly regularize the distance between the positive and negative samples in a triplet with respect to the anchor-negative distance. As an initial validation, we show that our method (called No Pairs Left Behind [NPLB]) improves upon the traditional and current state-of-the-art triplet objective formulations on standard benchmark datasets. To show the effectiveness and potentials of NPLB on real-world complex data, we evaluate our approach on a large-scale healthcare dataset (UK Biobank), demonstrating that the embeddings learned by our model significantly outperform all other current representations on tested downstream tasks. Additionally, we provide a new model-agnostic single-time health risk definition that, when used in tandem with the learned representations, achieves the most accurate prediction of a patient's future health complications. Our results indicate that NPLB is a simple, yet effective framework for improving existing deep metric learning models, showcasing the potential implications of deep metric learning in more complex applications, especially in the biological and healthcare domains."}}

Due to their inherent label scarcity, learning useful representations for periodic tasks with limited or no supervision is of great benefit. Yet, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods overlook the intrinsic periodicity in data, and fail to learn representations that capture periodic or frequency attributes. In this paper, we present SimPer, a simple contrastive SSL regime for learning periodic information in data. To exploit the periodic inductive bias, SimPer introduces customized augmentations, feature similarity measures, and a generalized contrastive loss for learning efficient and robust periodic representations. Extensive experiments on common real-world tasks in human behavior analysis, environmental sensing, and healthcare domains verify the superior performance of SimPer compared to state-of-the-art SSL methods, highlighting its intriguing properties including better data efficiency, robustness to spurious correlations, and generalization to distribution shifts."}}

However, diverse data representing a range of environments, body motions, illumination conditions and physiological states is laborious, time consuming and expensive to obtain. Synthetic data have proven a valuable tool in several areas of machine learning, yet are not widely available for camera measurement of physiological states. Synthetic data offer \"perfect\" labels (e.g., without noise and with precise synchronization), labels that may not be possible to obtain otherwise (e.g., precise pixel level segmentation maps) and provide a high degree of control over variation and diversity in the dataset.  We present SCAMPS, a dataset of synthetics containing 2,800 videos (1.68M frames) with aligned cardiac and respiratory signals and facial action intensities. The RGB frames are provided alongside segmentation maps and precise descriptive statistics about the underlying waveforms, including inter-beat interval, heart rate variability, and pulse arrival time. Finally, we present baseline results training on these synthetic data and testing on real-world datasets to illustrate generalizability."}}

Decision-making systems that can perform these types of reasoning have the potential to be more generalizable and interpretable. Simulations have helped advance the state-of-the-art in this domain, by providing the ability to systematically vary parameters (e.g., confounders) and generate examples of the outcomes in the case of counterfactual scenarios. However, simulating complex temporal causal events in multi-agent scenarios, such as those that exist in driving and vehicle navigation, is challenging. To help address this, we present a high-fidelity simulation environment that is designed for developing algorithms for causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning in the safety-critical context. A core component of our work is to introduce agency, such that it is simple to define and create complex scenarios using high-level definitions. The vehicles then operate with agency to complete these objectives, meaning low-level behaviors need only be controlled if necessary. We perform experiments with three state-of-the-art methods to create baselines and highlight the affordances of this environment. Finally, we highlight challenges and opportunities for future work."}}

However, in many cases the properties of interest are subtle variations in higher-order changes, such as acceleration. This is true in the cardiac pulse, where the second derivative can be used as an indicator of blood pressure and arterial disease. Recent developments in camera-based vital sign measurement have shown that cardiac measurements can be recovered with impressive accuracy from videos; however, the majority of research has focused on extracting summary statistics such as heart rate. Less emphasis has been put on the accuracy of waveform morphology that is necessary for many clinically impactful scenarios. In this work, we provide evidence that higher-order dynamics are better estimated by neural models when explicitly optimized for in the loss function. Furthermore, adding second-derivative inputs also improves performance when estimating second-order dynamics. By incorporating the second derivative of both the input frames and the target vital sign signals into the training procedure, our model is better able to estimate left ventricle ejection time intervals."}}

Prior research have explored various \"end-to-end'' models; however these methods still require several preprocessing steps. These additional operations are often non-trivial to implement making replication and deployment difficult and can even have a higher computational budget than the \"core'' network itself. In this paper, we propose two novel and efficient neural models for camera-based physiological measurement called EfficientPhys that remove the need for face detection, segmentation, normalization, color space transformation or any other preprocessing steps. Using an input of raw video frames, our models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on three public datasets. We show that this is the case whether using a transformer or convolutional backbone. We further evaluate the latency of the proposed networks and show that our most light weight network also achieves a 33\\% improvement in efficiency.\n"}}

In this work, we propose to learn video representations that generalize to both the tasks which require global semantic information (e.g., classification) and the tasks that require local fine-grained spatio-temporal information (e.g., localization). We achieve this by optimizing two contrastive objectives that together encourage our model to learn global-local visual information given audio signals. We show that the two objectives mutually improve the generalizability of the learned global-local representations, significantly outperforming their disjointly learned counterparts. We demonstrate our approach on various tasks including action/sound classification, lipreading, deepfake detection, event and sound localization."}}

These satellites have different vantage points above the earth and different spectral imaging bands resulting in inconsistent imagery from one to another. This presents challenges in building downstream applications. What if we could generate synthetic bands for existing satellites from the union of all domains? We tackle the problem of generating synthetic spectral imagery for multispectral sensors as an unsupervised image-to-image translation problem with partial labels and introduce a novel shared spectral reconstruction loss. Simulated experiments performed by dropping one or more spectral bands show that cross-domain reconstruction outperforms measurements obtained from a second vantage point. On a downstream cloud detection task, we show that generating synthetic bands with our model improves segmentation performance beyond our baseline. Our proposed approach enables synchronization of multispectral data and provides a basis for more homogeneous remote sensing datasets."}}

Existing machine learning systems struggle to generalize well to unseen subjects or contexts, especially in video-based physiological measurement. Although fine-tuning for a user might address this issue, it is difficult to collect large sets of training data for specific individuals because supervised algorithms require medical-grade sensors for generating the training target. Therefore, learning personalized or customized models from a small number of unlabeled samples is very attractive as it would allow fast calibrations. In this paper, we present a novel meta-learning approach called MetaPhys for learning personalized cardiac signals from 18-seconds of video data. MetaPhys works in both supervised and unsupervised manners. We evaluate our proposed approach on two benchmark datasets and demonstrate superior performance in cross-dataset evaluation with substantial reductions (42% to 44%) in errors compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Visualization of attention maps and ablation experiments reveal how the model adapts to each subject and why our proposed approach leads to these improvements. We have also demonstrated our proposed method significantly helps reduce the bias in skin type.  \n"}}
