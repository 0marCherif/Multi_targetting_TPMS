However, previous works directly utilized the features extracted from multimodal data, in which the noise reduction within and among multiple modalities has been largely ignored before multimodal fusion. This paper proposes a multi-level attention map network (MAMN) to filter noise before multimodal fusion and capture the consistent and heterogeneous correlations among multi-granularity features for multimodal sentiment analysis. Architecturally, MAMN is comprised of three modules: multi-granularity feature extraction module, multi-level attention map generation module, and attention map fusion module. The first module is designed to sufficiently extract multi-granularity features from multimodal data. The second module is constructed to filter noise and enhance the representation ability for multi-granularity features before multimodal fusion. And the third module is built to extensibly mine the interactions among multi-level attention maps by the proposed extensible co-attention fusion method. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets show the proposed model is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrate its effectiveness on two tasks of document-based and aspect-based MSA tasks."}}
