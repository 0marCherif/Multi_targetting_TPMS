The\ngoal of optimal randomized smoothing is to maximize the average certified radius over the space\nof smoothing distributions. We theoretically\nstudy this problem through the lens of infinitedimensional optimization over measure spaces,\nand prove that the nonconvex infinite program is\nlower-bounded by a conic linear program wherein\nthe classifier\u2019s confidence acts as a surrogate objective to optimize. A semi-infinite linear programming approximation to the problem is presented, whose sub-problems are proven to attain\nnontrivial strong duality. A proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel feature-convex neural network architecture as the composition of an ICNN with a Lipschitz feature map in order to achieve adversarial robustness. We consider the asymmetric binary classification setting with one \"sensitive\" class, and for this class we prove deterministic, closed-form, and easily-computable certified robust radii for arbitrary $\\ell_p$-norms. We theoretically justify the use of these models by characterizing their decision region geometry, extending the universal approximation theorem for ICNN regression to the classification setting, and proving a lower bound on the probability that such models perfectly fit even unstructured uniformly distributed data in sufficiently high dimensions. Experiments on Malimg malware classification and subsets of MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets show that feature-convex classifiers attain state-of-the-art certified $\\ell_1$-radii as well as substantial $\\ell_2$- and $\\ell_{\\infty}$-radii while being far more computationally efficient than any competitive baseline."}}

Selecting the right method and hyperparameters for a particular task often involves trial-and-error or practitioner intuition, motivating the field of meta-learning. We generalize a broad family of preexisting update rules by proposing a meta-learning framework in which the inner loop optimization step involves solving a differentiable convex optimization (DCO). We illustrate the theoretical appeal of this approach by showing that it enables one-step optimization of a family of linear least squares problems, given that the meta-learner has sufficient exposure to similar tasks. Various instantiations of the DCO update rule are compared to conventional optimizers on a range of illustrative experimental settings."}}

We study Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control under sparse disturbances by analyzing three distinct policies: the blind online policy, the disturbance-aware policy, and the optimal offline policy. We derive the two-dimensional recurrence structure of the optimal disturbance-aware policy, under the assumption that the controller has information about future disturbance values with only a probabilistic model of their locations in time. Under mild conditions, we show that the disturbance-aware policy converges to the blind online policy if the number of disturbances grows sublinearly in the time horizon. Finally, we provide a finite-horizon regret bound between the blind online policy and optimal offline policy, which is proven to be quadratic in the number of disturbances and in their magnitude. This provides a useful characterization of the suboptimality of a standard LQR controller when confronted with unexpected sparse perturbations."}}
