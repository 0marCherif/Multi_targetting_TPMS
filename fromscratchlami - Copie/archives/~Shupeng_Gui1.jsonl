The core part of the system is the Ranking neural network, which is usually a bottleneck of whole system performance during online inference.  In this work, we propose a unified model and embedding compression (UMEC) framework to hammer an efficient neural network-based recommendation system.  Our framework jointly learns input feature selection and neural network compression together, and solve them as an end-to-end resource-constrained optimization problem using ADMM.  Our method outperforms other baselines in terms of neural network Flops, sparse embedding feature size and the number of sparse embedding features.  We evaluate our method on the public benchmark of DLRM, trained over the Kaggle Criteo dataset. The codes can be found at https://github.com/VITA-Group/UMEC."}}

There is an increased demand for deploying DNNs on devices that do not have abundant resources such as memory and computation units. Recently, network compression through a variety of techniques such as pruning and quantization have been proposed to reduce the resource requirement. A key parameter that all existing compression techniques are sensitive to is the compression ratio (e.g., pruning sparsity, quantization bitwidth) of each layer. Traditional solutions treat the compression ratios of each layer as hyper-parameters, and tune them using human heuristic. Recent researchers start using black-box hyper-parameter optimizations, but they will introduce new hyper-parameters and have efficiency issue. In this paper, we propose a framework to jointly prune and quantize the DNNs automatically according to a target model size without using any hyper-parameters to manually set the compression ratio for each layer. In the experiments, we show that our framework can compress the weights data of ResNet-50 to be 836x smaller without accuracy loss on CIFAR-10, and compress AlexNet to be 205x smaller without accuracy loss on ImageNet classification."}}

The key problem is how to model the dependence  of each node to its neighbor nodes since the neighborhood can uniquely characterize a graph. Most existing approaches rely on defining the specific neighborhood dependence as the computation mechanism of representations, which may exclude important subtle structures within the graph and dependence among neighbors. Instead, we propose a novel graph node embedding method (namely P^2IR) via developing a novel notion, namely partial permutation invariant set function} to learn those subtle structures. Our method can 1) learn an arbitrary form of the representation function from the neighborhood, without losing any potential dependence structures, 2) automatically decide the significance of neighbors at different distances, and 3) be applicable to both homogeneous and heterogeneous graph embedding, which may contain multiple types of nodes. Theoretical guarantee for the representation capability of our method has been proved for general homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. Evaluation results on benchmark data sets show that the proposed P^IR outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on producing node vectors for classification tasks."}}
