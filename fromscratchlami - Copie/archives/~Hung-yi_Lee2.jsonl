Empirical Study of Order Effect in Knowledge-grounded Dialogue", "abstract": "With the power of large pretrained language models, various research works have integrated knowledge into dialogue systems. The traditional techniques treat knowledge as part of the input sequence for the dialogue system, prepending a set of knowledge statements in front of dialogue history. However, such a mechanism forces knowledge sets to be concatenated in an ordered manner, making models implicitly pay imbalanced attention to the sets during training. In this paper, we first investigate how the order of the knowledge set can influence autoregressive dialogue systems' responses. We conduct experiments on two commonly used dialogue datasets with two types of transformer-based models and find that models view the input knowledge unequally. To this end, we propose a simple and novel technique to alleviate the order effect by modifying the position embeddings of knowledge input in these models. With the proposed position embedding method, the experimental results show that each knowledge statement is uniformly considered to generate responses."}}

Recently, prompt tuning has demonstrated its storage and computation efficiency in both natural language processing (NLP) and speech processing fields. These advantages have also revealed prompt tuning as a candidate approach to serving pre-trained LM for multiple tasks in a unified manner. For speech processing, SpeechPrompt shows its high parameter efficiency and competitive performance on a few speech classification tasks. However, whether SpeechPrompt is capable of serving a large number of tasks is unanswered. In this work, we propose SpeechPrompt v2, a prompt tuning framework capable of performing a wide variety of speech classification tasks, covering multiple languages and prosody-related tasks. The experiment result shows that SpeechPrompt v2 achieves performance on par with prior works with less than 0.15M trainable parameters in a unified framework."}}

However, there is a lack of experience in jointly distilling multiple self-supervised speech models. In our work, we performed Ensemble Knowledge Distillation (EKD) on various self-supervised speech models such as HuBERT, RobustHuBERT, and WavLM. We tried two different aggregation techniques, layerwise-average and layerwise-concatenation, to the representations of different teacher models and found that the former was more effective. On top of that, we proposed a multiple prediction head method for student models to predict different layer outputs of multiple teacher models simultaneously. The experimental results show that our method improves the performance of the distilled models on four downstream speech processing tasks, Phoneme Recognition, Speaker Identification, Emotion Recognition, and Automatic Speech Recognition in the hidden-set track of the SUPERB benchmark."}}

However, TTS training typically requires many hours of recording and a large model, making it unsuitable for deployment on mobile devices. To overcome this limitation, related works typically require fine-tuning a pre-trained TTS model to preserve its ability to generate high-quality audio samples while adapting to the target speaker's voice. This process is commonly referred to as ``voice cloning.'' Although related works have achieved significant success in changing the TTS model's voice, they are still required to fine-tune from a large pre-trained model, resulting in a significant size for the voice-cloned model. In this paper, we propose applying trainable structured pruning to voice cloning. By training the structured pruning masks with voice-cloning data, we can produce a unique pruned model for each target speaker. Our experiments demonstrate that using learnable structured pruning, we can compress the model size to 7 times smaller while achieving comparable voice-cloning performance."}}

In this paper, we present the first study on unsupervised spoken constituency parsing given unlabeled spoken sentences and unpaired textual data. The goal is to determine the spoken sentences' hierarchical syntactic structure in the form of constituency parse trees, such that each node is a span of audio that corresponds to a constituent. We compare two approaches: (1) cascading an unsupervised automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and an unsupervised parser to obtain parse trees on ASR transcripts, and (2) direct training an unsupervised parser on continuous word-level speech representations. This is done by first splitting utterances into sequences of word-level segments, and aggregating self-supervised speech representations within segments to obtain segment embeddings. We find that separately training a parser on the unpaired text and directly applying it on ASR transcripts for inference produces better results for unsupervised parsing. Additionally, our results suggest that accurate segmentation alone may be sufficient to parse spoken sentences accurately. Finally, we show the direct approach may learn head-directionality correctly for both head-initial and head-final languages without any explicit inductive bias."}}

(2021) present a method (LEAPS) that first learns a program embedding space to continuously parameterize diverse programs from a pre-generated program dataset, and then searches for a task-solving program in the learned program embedding space when given a task. Despite the encouraging results, the program policies that LEAPS can produce are limited by the distribution of the program dataset. Furthermore, during searching, LEAPS evaluates each candidate program solely based on its return, failing to precisely reward correct parts of programs and penalize incorrect parts. To address these issues, we propose to learn a meta-policy that composes a series of programs sampled from the learned program embedding space. By learning to compose programs, our proposed hierarchical programmatic reinforcement learning (HPRL) framework can produce program policies that describe out-of-distributionally complex behaviors and directly assign credits to programs that induce desired behaviors. The experimental results in the Karel domain show that our proposed framework outperforms baselines. The ablation studies confirm the limitations of LEAPS and justify our design choices."}}

Great efforts have been dedicated to defending ASV against replay and synthetic speech; however, only a few approaches have been explored to deal with adversarial attacks. All the existing approaches to tackle adversarial attacks for ASV require the knowledge for adversarial samples generation, but it is impractical for defenders to know the exact attack algorithms that are applied by the in-the-wild attackers. This work is among the first to perform adversarial defense for ASV without knowing the specific attack algorithms. Inspired by self-supervised learning models (SSLMs) that possess the merits of alleviating the superficial noise in the inputs and reconstructing clean samples from the interrupted ones, this work regards adversarial perturbations as one kind of noise and conducts adversarial defense for ASV by SSLMs. Specifically, we propose to perform adversarial defense from two perspectives: 1) adversarial perturbation purification and 2) adversarial perturbation detection. The purification module aims at alleviating the adversarial perturbations in the samples and pulling the contaminated adversarial inputs back towards the decision boundary. Experimental results show that our proposed purification module effectively counters adversarial attacks and outperforms traditional filters from both alleviating the adversarial noise and maintaining the performance of genuine samples. The detection module aims at detecting adversarial samples from genuine ones based on the statistical properties of ASV scores derived by a unique ASV integrating with different number of SSLMs. Experimental results show that our detection module helps shield the ASV by detecting adversarial samples. Both purification and detection methods are helpful for defending against different kinds of attack algorithms. Moreover, since there is no common metric for evaluating the ASV performance under adversarial attacks, this work also formalizes evaluation metrics for adversarial defense considering both purification and detection based approaches into account. We sincerely encourage future works to benchmark their approaches based on the proposed evaluation framework."}}

The architecture of the MFA-Conformer is inspired by recent stateof-the-art models in speech recognition and speaker verification. Firstly, we introduce a convolution subsampling layer to decrease the computational cost of the model. Secondly, we adopt Conformer blocks which combine Transformers and convolution neural networks (CNNs) to capture global and local features effectively. Finally, the output feature maps from all Conformer blocks are concatenated to aggregate multi-scale representations before final pooling. We evaluate the MFA-Conformer on the widely used benchmarks. The best system obtains 0.64%, 1.29% and 1.63% EER on VoxCeleb1-O, SITW.Dev, and SITW.Eval set, respectively. MFA-Conformer significantly outperforms the popular ECAPA-TDNN systems in both recognition performance and inference speed. Last but not the least, the ablation studies clearly demonstrate that the combination of global and local feature learning can lead to robust and accurate speaker embedding extraction. We have also released the code for future comparison."}}

We conduct analyses to compare the two types of anomalies (OOD and Adv samples) with the in-distribution (ID) ones from three aspects: the input features, the hidden representations in each layer of the model, and the output probability distributions of the classifier. We find that OOD samples expose their aberration starting from the first layer, while the abnormalities of Adv samples do not emerge until the deeper layers of the model. We also illustrate that the models' output probabilities for Adv samples tend to be more unconfident. Based on our observations, we propose a simple method to separate ID, OOD, and Adv samples using the hidden representations and output probabilities of the model. On multiple combinations of ID, OOD datasets, and Adv attacks, our proposed method shows exceptional results on distinguishing ID, OOD, and Adv samples."}}
