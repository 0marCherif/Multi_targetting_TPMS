Through the sifting convolution, one may define translations and, thus, convolutions on manifolds - which are otherwise not well-defined in general. Slepian wavelets are constructed on a region of a manifold and are therefore suited to problems where data only exists in a particular region. The Slepian functions, on which Slepian wavelets are built, are the basis functions of the Slepian spatial-spectral concentration problem on the manifold. A tiling of the Slepian harmonic line with smoothly decreasing generating functions defines the scale-discretised wavelets; allowing one to probe spatially localised, scale-dependent features of a signal. By discretising manifolds as graphs, the Slepian functions and wavelets of a triangular mesh are presented. Through a wavelet transform, the wavelet coefficients of a field defined on the mesh are found and used in a straightforward thresholding denoising scheme."}}

Large astronomical surveys are broadcasting unprecedented rates of information, demanding machine learning as a critical component in modern scientific pipelines to handle the deluge of data. The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will raise the big-data bar for time-domain astronomy, with an expected 10 million alerts per-night, and generating many petabytes of data over the lifetime of the survey. Fast and efficient classification algorithms that can operate in real-time, yet robustly and accurately, are needed for time-critical events where additional resources can be sought for follow-up analyses. In order to handle such data, state-of-the-art deep learning architectures coupled with tools that leverage modern hardware accelerators are essential. We showcase how the use of modern deep compression methods can achieve a $18\\times$ reduction in model size, whilst preserving classification performance. We also show that in addition to the deep compression techniques, careful choice of file formats can improve inference latency, and thereby throughput of alerts, on the order of $8\\times$ for local processing, and $5\\times$ in a live production setting. To test this in a live setting, we deploy this optimised version of the original time-series transformer, t2, into the community alert broking system of FINK on real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert data, and compare throughput performance with other science modules that exist in FINK. The results shown herein emphasise the time-series transformer's suitability for real-time classification at LSST scale, and beyond, and introduce deep model compression as a fundamental tool for improving deploy-ability and scalable inference of deep learning models for transient classification."}}

This is achieved through interferometric imaging. State-of-the-art methods for reconstructing images from interferometric measurements adopt proximal optimization techniques, which are computationally expensive and require handcrafted priors. In this work we present two data-driven approaches for reconstructing images from measurements made by the SPIDER instrument. These approaches use deep learning to learn prior information from training data, increasing the reconstruction quality, and significantly reducing the computation time required to recover images by orders of magnitude. Reconstruction time is reduced to ${\\sim} 10$ milliseconds, opening up the possibility of real-time imaging with SPIDER for the first time. Furthermore, we show that these methods can also be applied in domains where training data is scarce, such as astronomical imaging, by leveraging transfer learning from domains where plenty of training data are available."}}

However, Bayesian model selection requires the computation of the marginal likelihood (model evidence), which is computationally challenging, prohibiting its use in many high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems. With Bayesian imaging applications in mind, in this work we present the proximal nested sampling methodology to objectively compare alternative Bayesian imaging models for applications that use images to inform decisions under uncertainty. The methodology is based on nested sampling, a Monte Carlo approach specialised for model comparison, and exploits proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to scale efficiently to large problems and to tackle models that are log-concave and not necessarily smooth (e.g., involving $$\\ell _1$$ \u2113 1 or total-variation priors). The proposed approach can be applied computationally to problems of dimension $${\\mathcal {O}}(10^6)$$ O ( 10 6 ) and beyond, making it suitable for high-dimensional inverse imaging problems. It is validated on large Gaussian models, for which the likelihood is available analytically, and subsequently illustrated on a range of imaging problems where it is used to analyse different choices of dictionary and measurement model."}}

While an efficient framework has been formulated, spherical CNNs are nevertheless highly computationally demanding; typically they cannot scale beyond spherical signals of thousands of pixels. We develop scattering networks constructed natively on the sphere that provide a powerful representational space for spherical data. Spherical scattering networks are computationally scalable and exhibit rotational equivariance, while their representational space is invariant to isometries and provides efficient and stable signal representations. By integrating scattering networks as an additional type of layer in the generalized spherical CNN framework, we show how they can be leveraged to scale spherical CNNs to the high-resolution data typical of many practical applications, with spherical signals of many tens of megapixels and beyond."}}
