Transmission and storage of these descriptors are of critical importance in the context of mobile visual search applications. We propose a framework for computing low bit-rate feature descriptors with a 20\u00d7 reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art descriptors. The framework offers low complexity and has significant speed-up in the matching stage. We show how to efficiently compute distances between descriptors in the compressed domain eliminating the need for decoding. We perform a comprehensive performance comparison with SIFT, SURF, BRIEF, MPEG-7 image signatures and other low bit-rate descriptors and show that our proposed CHoG descriptor outperforms existing schemes significantly over a wide range of bitrates. We implement the descriptor in a mobile image retrieval system and for a database of 1 million CD, DVD and book covers, we achieve 96% retrieval accuracy using only 4 KB of data per query image."}}

We advance the state of the art in this area by fusing two popular representations of street-level image data - facade-aligned and viewpoint-aligned - and show that they contain complementary information that can be exploited to significantly improve the recall rates on the city scale. We also improve feature detection in low contrast parts of the street-level data, and discuss how to incorporate priors on a user's position (e.g. given by noisy GPS readings or network cells), which previous approaches often ignore. Finally, and maybe most importantly, we present our results according to a carefully designed, repeatable evaluation scheme and make publicly available a set of 1.7 million images with ground truth labels, geotags, and calibration data, as well as a difficult set of cell phone query images. We provide these resources as a benchmark to facilitate further research in the area."}}

We introduce the Radial Gradient Transform (RGT) and an approximate RGT, yielding the Rotation-Invariant, Fast Feature (RIFF) descriptor. We demonstrate that RIFF is fast enough for real-time tracking, while robust enough for large scale retrieval tasks. At 26\u00d7 the speed, our tracking-scheme obtains a more accurate global affine motion-model than the Kanade Lucas Tomasi (KLT) tracker. The same descriptors can achieve 94% retrieval accuracy from a database of 10 <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup> images."}}

We propose a scheme for compressing distributions called Type Coding, which offers lower complexity and higher compression efficiency compared to tree-based quantization schemes proposed in prior work. We construct optimal Entropy Constrained Vector Quantization (ECVQ) code-books and show that Type Coding comes close to achieving optimal performance. The proposed descriptors are 16\u00d7 smaller than SIFT and perform on par. We implement the descriptor in a mobile image retrieval system and for a database of 1 million CD, DVD and book covers, we achieve 96% retrieval accuracy using only 4 kilobytes of data per query image."}}
