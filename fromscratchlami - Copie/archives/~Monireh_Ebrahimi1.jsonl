Modern approaches to biometric authentication, based on sophisticated machine learning techniques, cannot avoid storing either trained-classifier details or explicit user biometric data, thus exposing users' credentials to falsification. In this paper, we introduce a secure way to handle user-specific information involved with the use of vector-space classifiers or artificial neural networks for biometric authentication. Our proposed architecture, called a Neural Fuzzy Extractor (NFE), allows the coupling of pre-existing classifiers with fuzzy extractors, through a artificial-neural-network-based buffer called an expander, with minimal or no performance degradation. The NFE thus offers all the performance advantages of modern deep-learning-based classifiers, and all the security of standard fuzzy extractors. We demonstrate the NFE retrofit to a classic artificial neural network for a simple scenario of fingerprint-based user authentication."}}

The difference is not only in their inner workings and general approach, but also with respect to capabilities. Neural-symbolic Integration, as a field of study, aims to bridge between the two paradigms. In this paper, we will discuss neural-symbolic integration in its relation to the Semantic Web field, with a focus on promises and possible benefits for both, and report on some current research on the topic."}}

Our approach seeks to emulate reasoning structure, which can be inspected part-way through, rather than simply learning reasoner answers, which is typical in many of the black-box systems currently in use. We demonstrate that this idea is feasible by training a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network to learn EL+ reasoning patterns with two different data sets. We also show that this trained system is resistant to noise by corrupting a percentage of the test data and comparing the reasoner's and LSTM's predictions on corrupt data with correct answers."}}

Reasoning, i.e., the drawing of logical inferences from knowledge expressed in such standards, is traditionally based on logical deductive methods and algorithms which can be proven to be sound and complete and terminating, i.e. correct in a very strong sense. For various reasons, though, in particular, the scalability issues arising from the ever-increasing amounts of Semantic Web data available and the inability of deductive algorithms to deal with noise in the data, it has been argued that alternative means of reasoning should be investigated which bear high promise for high scalability and better robustness. From this perspective, deductive algorithms can be considered the gold standard regarding correctness against which alternative methods need to be tested. In this paper, we show that it is possible to train a Deep Learning system on RDF knowledge graphs, such that it is able to perform reasoning over new RDF knowledge graphs, with high precision and recall compared to the deductive gold standard."}}

Many opinion mining systems and tools provide users with people's attitudes toward products, people, or topics and their attributes/aspects. However, although it may appear simple, using sentiment analysis to predict election results is difficult, since it is empirically challenging to train a successful model to conduct sentiment analysis on tweet streams for a dynamic event such as an election. This article highlights some of the challenges related to sentiment analysis encountered during monitoring of the presidential election using Kno.e.sis's Twitris system."}}
