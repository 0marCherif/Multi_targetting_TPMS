Despite its numerical success in various applications, the memory requirement in AM remains a bottleneck when solving large-scale optimization problems in a resource-limited machine. To address this problem, we propose a novel variant of AM method, called Min-AM, by storing only one vector pair, that is the minimal memory size requirement in AM. Our method forms a symmetric approximation to the inverse Hessian matrix and is proved to be equivalent to the full-memory Type-I AM for solving strongly convex quadratic optimization. Moreover, for general nonlinear optimization problems, we establish the convergence properties of Min-AM under reasonable assumptions and show that the mixing parameters can be adaptively chosen by estimating the eigenvalues of the Hessian. Finally, we extend Min-AM to solve stochastic programming problems. Experimental results on logistic regression and network training problems validate the effectiveness of the proposed Min-AM."}}

We prove that the basic version of ST-AM is equivalent to the full-memory AM in strongly convex quadratic optimization, and with minor changes it has local linear convergence for solving general nonlinear fixed-point problems. We further analyze the convergence properties of the regularized ST-AM for nonconvex (stochastic) optimization. Finally, we apply ST-AM to several applications including solving root-finding problems and training neural networks.

In fact, fine-tuning all the parameters of a colossal model and retaining separate instances for different tasks are practically infeasible. This necessitates a new branch of research focusing on the parameter-efficient adaptation of PLMs, dubbed as delta tuning in this paper. In contrast with the standard fine-tuning, delta tuning only fine-tunes a small portion of the model parameters while keeping the rest untouched, largely reducing both the computation and storage costs. Recent studies have demonstrated that a series of delta tuning methods with distinct tuned parameter selection could achieve performance on a par with full-parameter fine-tuning, suggesting a new promising way of stimulating large-scale PLMs. In this paper, we first formally describe the problem of delta tuning and then comprehensively review recent delta tuning approaches. We also propose a unified categorization criterion that divide existing delta tuning methods into three groups: addition-based, specification-based, and reparameterization-based methods. Though initially proposed as an efficient method to steer large models, we believe that some of the fascinating evidence discovered along with delta tuning could help further reveal the mechanisms of PLMs and even deep neural networks. To this end, we discuss the theoretical principles underlying the effectiveness of delta tuning and propose frameworks to interpret delta tuning from the perspective of optimization and optimal control, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a holistic empirical study of representative methods, where results on over 100 NLP tasks demonstrate a comprehensive performance comparison of different approaches. The experimental results also cover the analysis of combinatorial, scaling and transferable properties of delta tuning."}}
