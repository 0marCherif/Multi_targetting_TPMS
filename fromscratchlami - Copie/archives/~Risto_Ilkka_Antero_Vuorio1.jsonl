A promising approach for alleviating these limitations is to cast the development of better RL algorithms as a machine learning problem itself in a process called meta-RL. Meta-RL is most commonly studied in a problem setting where, given a distribution of tasks, the goal is to learn a policy that is capable of adapting to any new task from the task distribution with as little data as possible. In this survey, we describe the meta-RL problem setting in detail as well as its major variations. We discuss how, at a high level, meta-RL research can be clustered based on the presence of a task distribution and the learning budget available for each individual task. Using these clusters, we then survey meta-RL algorithms and applications. We conclude by presenting the open problems on the path to making meta-RL part of the standard toolbox for a deep RL practitioner."}}

We break down the space of confounded imitation learning problems and identify three settings with different data requirements in which the correct imitation policy can be identified. We then introduce an algorithm for deconfounded imitation learning, which trains an inference model jointly with a latent-conditional policy. At test time, the agent alternates between updating its belief over the latent and acting under the belief. We show in theory and practice that this algorithm converges to the correct interventional policy, solves the confounding issue, and can under certain assumptions achieve an asymptotically optimal imitation performance.\n"}}

This is the fundamental temporal credit assignment problem in Reinforcement Learning (RL). One of the earliest and still most widely used heuristics is to assign this credit based on a scalar coefficient, lambda (treated as a hyperparameter), raised to the power of the time interval between the state-action and the reward. In this empirical paper, we explore heuristics based on more general pairwise weightings that are functions of the state in which the action was taken, the state at the time of the reward, as well as the time interval between the two. Of course it isn't clear what these pairwise weight functions should be, and because they are too complex to be treated as hyperparameters we develop a metagradient procedure for learning these weight functions during the usual RL training of a policy. Our empirical work shows that it is often possible to learn these pairwise weight functions during learning of the policy to achieve better performance than competing approaches."}}

Estimation of meta-gradients is central to the performance of these meta-algorithms, and has been studied in the setting of MAML-style short-horizon meta-RL problems. In this context, prior work has investigated the estimation of the Hessian of the RL objective, as well as tackling the problem of credit assignment to pre-adaptation behavior by making a sampling correction. However, we show that Hessian estimation, implemented for example by DiCE and its variants, always adds bias and can also add variance to meta-gradient estimation. Meanwhile, meta-gradient estimation has been studied less in the important long-horizon setting, where backpropagation through the full inner optimization trajectories is not feasible. We study the bias and variance tradeoff arising from truncated backpropagation and sampling correction, and additionally compare to evolution strategies, which is a recently popular alternative strategy to long-horizon meta-learning. While prior work implicitly chooses points in this bias-variance space, we disentangle the sources of bias and variance and present an empirical study that relates existing estimators to each other."}}

An open question is whether and how theoretical consistency translates into practice, in comparison to inconsistent algorithms. In this paper, we empirically investigate this question on a set of representative meta-RL algorithms. We find that theoretically consistent algorithms can indeed usually adapt to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while inconsistent ones cannot, although they can still fail in practice for reasons like poor exploration. We further find that theoretically inconsistent algorithms can be made consistent by continuing to update all agent components on the OOD tasks, and adapt as well or better than originally consistent ones. We conclude that theoretical consistency is indeed a desirable property, and inconsistent meta-RL algorithms can easily be made consistent to enjoy the same benefits."}}
