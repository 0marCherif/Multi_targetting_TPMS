This system receives EEG data from a headset on a participant, filters this data, extracts appropriate features, and virtualizes it through a physical head model and VR system. We will demonstrate this system performing three distinct tasks."}}

Online category learning is necessary in this system because we envision that humans will need to provide input to assist CV modules in determining category labels without reducing throughput and without necessarily having expert knowledge of each category. In our study, subjects participated in a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation paradigm in which they were asked to determine the target category from highlighted exemplar images interspersed among distractor images. In Experiment 1, the highlighting method was varied among four options and a negative (no-label) and positive (explicit, text-based) control. In Experiment 2, label accuracy was altered by incorrectly labeling some distractor and exemplar images. In both experiments, there were three levels of difficulty that varied the similarity between distractor and exemplar images. The results show that most highlighting methods resulted in equivalent accuracy to the positive control, but certain modalities were more effective at varying difficulty levels. In addition, the subject accuracy was sensitive to distractors highlighted as targets, but not to nonhighlighted exemplars. Our results indicate that human online category learning can be optimized for human-system interaction."}}

To support the use of various forms of EEG signal, we have developed a signal processing pipeline to filter noise and extract relevant, user-selected features. We provide two forms of presentation: a virtual reality (VR) system with a spatial audio and visualization, and a physical head model capable of displaying location and frequency-specific data. Examples are given for applications of the full system."}}

To further explore the usefulness of eye tracking for the estimation of cognitive state, the current experiment evaluated saccade, fixation, and pupil-based measures to identify which metrics reliably indexed cognitive workload in a dynamic, unconstrained task (Tetris <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00ae</sup> ). In line with previous studies, our results show that some eye movement features are correlated with changes in workload, manipulated here via task difficulty. Among these were blink duration, saccade velocity, and tonic pupil dilation."}}

However, there is currently very little research on providing feedback to the human interacting with one of these systems. To explore this question, an RSVP task was developed to examine the effectiveness of feedback to induce changes in target category in near-real time. Three different factors involved in image presentation were explored: image presentation duration, target/distract or similarity, and feedback modality. Significant, nonlinear changes in performance were related to these independent variables. These results demonstrate the complexity inherent to human category learning and will guide future use of image presentation parameters to optimize human performance within a human-assisted computing system that is focused on image analysis."}}

Recent technological advances have now enabled researchers to quickly record and collect EEG on a wide scale. Although EEG is fairly easy to record, it is highly susceptible to noise sources called artifacts which can occur at amplitudes several times greater than the EEG signal of interest. Because of this, users must manually annotate the EEG signal to identify artifact regions in the data prior to any downstream processing. This can be time-consuming and impractical for large data collections. In this paper we present a method which uses Active Learning (AL) to improve the reliability of existing EEG artifact classifiers with minimal amounts of user interaction. Our results show that classification accuracy equivalent to classifiers trained on full data annotation can be obtained while labeling less than 25% of the data. This suggests significant time savings can be obtained when manually annotating artifacts in large EEG data collections."}}
