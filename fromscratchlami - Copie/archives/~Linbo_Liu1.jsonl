Our studies discover a new attack pattern that negatively impact the forecasting of a target time series via making strategic, sparse (imperceptible) modifications to the past observations of a small number of other time series. To mitigate the impact of such attack, we have developed two defense strategies. First, we extend a previously developed randomized smoothing technique in classification to multivariate forecasting scenarios. Second, we develop an adversarial training algorithm that learns to create adversarial examples and at the same time optimizes the forecasting model to improve its robustness against such adversarial simulation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our attack schemes are powerful and our defense algorithms are more effective compared with baseline defense mechanisms.\n"}}

However, existing works show that vanilla randomized smoothing usually does not provide good robustness performance and often requires (re)training techniques on the base classifier in order to boost the robustness of the resulting smoothed classifier. In this work, we propose two cost-effective approaches to boost the robustness of randomized smoothing while preserving its standard performance. In the first approach, we propose a new robust training method AdvMacer that combines adversarial training and maximizing robustness certificate for randomized smoothing. We show that AdvMacer can improve the robustness performance of randomized smoothing classifiers compared to SOTA baselines. The second approach introduces a post-processing method named EsbRS which greatly improves the robustness certificate based on model ensembles. We explore different aspects of model ensembles that has not been studied by prior works and propose a mixed design strategy to further improve robustness of the ensemble. "}}
