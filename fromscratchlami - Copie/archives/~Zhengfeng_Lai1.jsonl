However, the cost associated with annotating these biomedical signals is high and prevents the widespread use of such techniques. To address the challenges of generating a large labeled dataset, we adapt and apply semi-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks to a new problem setting, i.e., artifact detection in PPG signal and verified its generalizability in ECG and EEG as well. Our proposed framework is able to leverage unlabeled data to achieve similar PPG artifact detection performance obtained by fully supervised learning approach using only 75 labeled samples, or 0.5\\% of the available labeled data."}}

This is due to the confirmation bias especially when the pseudo labels are highly biased towards the majority classes. Traditional resampling or reweighting techniques may not be directly applicable when the unlabeled data distribution is unknown. Inspired by the threshold-moving method that performs well in supervised learning-based binary classification tasks, we provide a simple yet effective scheme to address the multiclass imbalance issue of SSL. This scheme, named SaR, is a Self-adaptive Refinement of soft labels before generating pseudo labels. The pseudo labels generated post-SaR will be less biased, resulting in higher quality data for training the classifier. We show that SaR can consistently improve recent consistency-based SSL algorithms on various image classification problems across different imbalanced ratios. We also show that SaR is robust to the situations where unlabeled data have different distributions as labeled data. Hence, SaR does not rely on the assumptions that unlabeled data share the same distribution as the labeled data."}}

Standard segmentation methods typically involve manual annotations, where a trained researcher traces the delineation of GM/WM in ultra-high-resolution Whole Slide Images (WSIs). This method can be time-consuming and subjective, preventing a scalable analysis on pathology images. This paper proposes an automated segmentation pipeline (BrainSec) combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module for segmenting GM/WM regions and a post-processing module to remove artifacts/residues of tissues. The final output generates XML annotations that can be visualized via Aperio ImageScope. First, we investigate two baseline models for medical image segmentation: FCN, and U-Net. Then we propose a patch-based approach, BrainSec, to classify the GM/WM/background regions. We demonstrate BrainSec is robust and has reliable performance by testing it on over 180 WSIs that incorporate numerous unique cases as well as distinct neuroanatomic brain regions. We also apply gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to interpret the segmentation masks and provide relevant explanations and insights. In addition, we have integrated BrainSec with an existing Amyloid- <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\beta $ </tex-math></inline-formula> pathology classification model into a unified framework (without incurring significant computation complexity) to identify pathologies, visualize their distributions, and quantify each type of pathologies in segmented GM/WM regions, respectively."}}

To comprehensively study the most effective way to remove the artifact segments from PPG waveforms, we performed feature engineering and investigated both Machine Learning (ML) and rule based algorithms to identify the optimal method of artifact detection. Our proposed artifact detection system utilizes a 3-stage ML model that incorporates both Gradient Boosting (GB) and Random Forest (RF).

Although supervised deep learning methods have shown good performance, its requirement of a large amount of labeled data may not be cost-effective for large scale projects. In the case of GM/WM segmentation, trained experts need to carefully trace the delineation in gigapixel images. To minimize manual labeling, we consider semi-surprised learning (SSL) and deploy one state-of-the-art SSL method (FixMatch) on WSIs. Then we propose a two-stage scheme to further improve the performance of SSL: the first stage is a self-supervised module to train an encoder to learn the visual representations of unlabeled data, subsequently, this well-trained encoder will be an initialization of consistency loss-based SSL in the second stage. We test our method on Amyloid-\u03b2 stained histopathology images and the results outperform FixMatch with the mean IoU score at around 2% by using 6,000 labeled tiles while over 10% by using only 600 labeled tiles from 2 WSIs.Clinical relevance\u2014 this work minimizes the required labeling efforts by trained personnel.

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides an effective way for leveraging unlabeled data to relieve the heavy reliance on the amount of labeled samples when training a model. Although SSL has shown good performance, the performance of recent state-of-the-art SSL methods on pathology images is still under study. The problem for selecting the most optimal data to label for SSL is not fully explored. To tackle this challenge, we propose a semi-supervised active learning framework with a region-based selection criterion. This framework iteratively selects regions for an-notation query to quickly expand the diversity and volume of the labeled set. We evaluate our framework on a grey-matter/white-matter segmentation problem using gigapixel pathology images from autopsied human brain tissues. With only 0.1% regions labeled, our proposed algorithm can reach a competitive IoU score compared to fully-supervised learning and outperform the current state-of-the-art SSL by more than 10% of IoU score and DICE coefficient."}}
