Such a problem admits a bi-level optimization formulation. The lower level requires solving the Nash equilibrium under a given reward function, which makes the overall problem challenging to optimize in an end-to-end way. We propose a backpropagation scheme that differentiates through the Nash equilibrium, which provides the gradient feedback for the upper level. In particular, our method only requires a black-box solver for the (regularized) Nash equilibrium (NE). We develop the convergence analysis for the proposed framework with proper black-box NE solvers and demonstrate the empirical successes in two multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environments."}}
