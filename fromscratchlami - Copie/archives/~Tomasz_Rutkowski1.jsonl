Using digital health technologies, home-based self-diagnostics, or cognitive decline managing approaches with neuro-biomarker feedback may be helpful for older adults to remain independent and improve their wellbeing. We report research results on early-onset dementia neuro-biomarkers to scrutinize cognitive-behavioral intervention management and digital non-pharmacological therapies.\n\nMethods: We present an empirical task in the EEG-based passive brain-computer interface application framework to assess working memory decline for forecasting a mild cognitive impairment. The EEG responses are analyzed in a framework of a network neuroscience technique applied to EEG time series for evaluation and to confirm the initial hypothesis of possible ML application modeling mild cognitive impairment prediction.\n\nResults: We report findings from a pilot study group in Poland for a cognitive decline prediction. We utilize two emotional working memory tasks by analyzing EEG responses to facial emotions reproduced in short videos. A reminiscent interior image oddball task is also employed to validate the proposed methodology further.\n\nDiscussion: The proposed three experimental tasks in the current pilot study showcase the critical utilization of artificial intelligence for early-onset dementia prognosis in older adults."}}

Brain reactions to sensory stimuli may serve as digital biomarkers for detecting and monitoring the progression of dementia. Traditional approaches to the analysis of event related potentials (ERP) based on amplitude and latency variations do not have sufficient sensitivity to provide reliable biomarkers. Searching for a better approach we have combined time-frequency (TF) spectral representation of the EEG signal with recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). The non-linear features derived from the recurrence plots constructed in this way help to discriminate subtle differences of EEG signals. Auditory and visual stimuli were used in a single-trial oddball-type BCI experiments. Simple EEG using 16 electrodes was sufficient to achieve state-of-art classification accuracy of auditory and visual stimuli, using linear SVM method with selected RQA features. The differences between the standard linear amplitude ERP analysis and TF-RQA approach is also shown in the histograms of the SVM linear projection and in the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plots. The small scale of these experiments and lack of longitudinal observations does not allow justifying the hypothesis linking mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with auditory response degradation, but the TF-RQA should be a good tool in creation of such biomarkers."}}

We present a practical application of a machine learning (ML) model in the domain known as \u2018AI for social good\u2019. In particular, we focus on early dementia onset prediction from speech patterns in natural conversation situations. This paper explains our model and study results of conversational speech pattern-based prognostication of mild dementia onset indicated by predictive Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores. Experiments with elderly subjects are conducted in natural conversation situations, with four members in each study group. We analyze the resulting four-party conversation speech transcripts within a natural language processing (NLP) deep learning framework to obtain conversation embedding. With a fully connected deep learning model, we use the conversation topic changing distances for subsequent MMSE score prediction. This pilot study is conducted with Japanese elderly subjects within a healthy group. The best median MMSE prediction errors are at the level of 0.167, with a median coefficient of determination equal to 0.330 and a mean absolute error of 0.909. The results presented are easily reproducible for other languages by swapping the language model in the proposed deep-learning conversation embedding approach."}}
