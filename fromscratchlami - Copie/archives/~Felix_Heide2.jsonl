In particular, correlation Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors have found widespread adoption for meter-scale indoor applications such as object tracking and pose estimation. While they offer high depth resolution at competitive costs, the precision of these indirect ToF sensors is fundamentally limited by their modulation contrast, which is in turn limited by the effects of photo-conversion noise. In contrast, optical interferometric methods can leverage short illumination modulation wavelengths to achieve depth precision three orders of magnitude greater than ToF, but typically find their range is restricted to the sub-centimeter. In this work, we merge concepts from both correlation ToF design and interferometric imaging; a step towards bridging the gap between these methods. We propose a computational ToF imaging method that optically computes the GHz ToF correlation signal in free space before photo-conversion. To acquire a depth map, we scan a scene point-wise and computationally unwrap the collected correlation measurements. Specifically, we repurpose electro-optical modulators used in optical communication for ToF imaging with centimeter-wave signals, and achieve all-optical correlation at 7.15 GHz and 14.32\u00a0GHz modulation frequencies. While GHz modulation frequencies increase depth precision, these high modulation rates also pose a technical challenge. They result in dozens of wraps per meter which cannot be estimated robustly by existing phase unwrapping methods. We tackle this problem with a proposed segmentation-inspired phase unwrapping network, which exploits the correlation of adjacent GHz phase measurements to classify regions into their respective wrap counts. We validate this method in simulation and experimentally, and demonstrate precise depth sensing using centimeter wave modulation that is robust to surface texture and ambient light. Compared to existing analog demodulation methods, the proposed system outperforms all of them across all tested scenarios. CCS Concepts: \u2022\u00a0 Computing methodologies;"}}

In this work, we exploit that the light-matter interactions on glass materials provide unique intensity-polarization cues for each observed wavelength of light. We present a novel learning-based glass segmentation network that leverages both trichromatic (RGB) intensities as well as trichromatic linear polarization cues from a single photograph captured without making any assumption on the polarization state of the illumination. Our novel network architecture dynamically fuses and weights both the trichromatic color and polarization cues using a novel global-guidance and multi-scale self-attention module, and leverages global cross-domain contextual information to achieve robust segmentation. We train and extensively validate our segmentation method on a new large-scale RGB-Polarization dataset (RGBP-Glass), and demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation approaches by a significant margin."}}

These imagers capture events asynchronously that encode rich temporal and spatial information. However, effectively extracting this information from events remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose a spiking transformer network, STNet, for single object tracking. STNet dynamically extracts and fuses information from both temporal and spatial domains. In particular, the proposed architecture features a transformer module to provide global spatial information and a spiking neural network (SNN) module for extracting temporal cues. The spiking threshold of the SNN module is dynamically adjusted based on the statistical cues of the spatial information, which we find essential in providing robust SNN features. We fuse both feature branches dynamically with a novel cross-domain attention fusion algorithm. Extensive experiments on two event-based datasets, FE240hz and EED, validate that the proposed STNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both tracking accuracy and speed with a significant margin."}}

Used by artists, photographers, system engineers, and for downstream vision tasks, traditional image processing pipelines feature complex algorithmic branches developed over decades. Recently, image-to-image networks have made great strides in image processing, style transfer, and semantic understanding. The differentiable nature of these networks allows them to fit a large corpus of data; however, they do not allow for intuitive, fine-grained controls that photographers find in modern photo-finishing tools.\nThis work closes that gap and presents an approach to making complex photo-finishing pipelines differentiable, allowing legacy algorithms to be trained akin to neural networks using first-order optimization methods. By concatenating tailored network proxy models of individual processing steps (e.g. white-balance, tone-mapping, color tuning), we can model a non-differentiable reference image finishing pipeline more faithfully than existing proxy image-to-image network models. We validate the method for several diverse applications, including photo and video style transfer, slider regression for commercial camera ISPs, photography-driven neural demosaicking, and adversarial photo-editing."}}

As such, the neuron firing rate is regulated by a dynamic spiking threshold, which has been extensively studied in biology. Existing work in the machine learning community does not employ bioinspired spiking threshold schemes. This work aims at bridging this gap by introducing a novel bioinspired dynamic energy-temporal threshold (BDETT) scheme for spiking neural networks (SNNs). The proposed BDETT scheme mirrors two bioplausible observations: a dynamic threshold has 1) a positive correlation with the average membrane potential and 2) a negative correlation with the preceding rate of depolarization. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed BDETT on robot obstacle avoidance and continuous control tasks under both normal conditions and various degraded conditions, including noisy observations, weights, and dynamic environments. We find that the BDETT outperforms existing static and heuristic threshold approaches by significant margins in all tested conditions, and we confirm that the proposed bioinspired dynamic threshold scheme offers homeostasis to SNNs in complex real-world tasks."}}

Existing methods can fit SDFs to a handful of object classes and boast fine detail or fast inference speeds, but do not generalize well to unseen shapes. We introduce a two-stage semi-supervised meta-learning approach that transfers shape priors from labeled to unlabeled data to reconstruct unseen object categories. The first stage uses an episodic training scheme to simulate training on unlabeled data and meta-learns initial shape priors. The second stage then introduces unlabeled data with disjoint classes in a semi-supervised scheme to diversify these priors and achieve generalization. We assess our method on both synthetic data and real collected point clouds. Experimental results and analysis validate that our approach outperforms existing neural SDF methods and is capable of robust zero-shot inference on 100+ unseen classes.

Instead of sequentially scanning a scene and directly recording depth via the photon time-of-flight, as in pulsed LiDAR sensors, gated imagers encode depth in the relative intensity of a handful of gated slices, captured at megapixel resolution. Although existing methods have shown that it is possible to decode high-resolution depth from such measurements, these methods require synchronized and calibrated LiDAR to supervise the gated depth decoder - prohibiting fast adoption across geographies, training on large unpaired datasets, and exploring alternative applications outside of automotive use cases. In this work, propose an entirely self-supervised depth estimation method that uses gated in-tensity profiles and temporal consistency as a training signal. The proposed model is trained end-to-end from gated video sequences, does not require LiDAR or RGB data, and learns to estimate absolute depth values. We take gated slices as input and disentangle the estimation of the scene albedo, depth, and ambient light, which are then used to learn to reconstruct the input slices through a cyclic loss. We rely on temporal consistency between a given frame and neighboring gated slices to estimate depth in regions with shadows and reflections. We experimentally validate that the proposed approach outperforms existing super-vised and self-supervised depth estimation methods based on monocular RGB and stereo images, as well as super-vised methods based on gated images.

Various defense methods have proposed image-to-image mapping methods, either including these perturbations in the training process or removing them in a preprocessing step. In doing so, existing methods often ignore that the natural RGB images in today\u2019s datasets are not captured but, in fact, recovered from RAW color filter array captures that are subject to various degradations in the capture. In this work, we exploit this RAW data distribution as an empirical prior for adversarial defense. Specifically, we propose a model-agnostic adversarial defensive method, which maps the input RGB images to Bayer RAW space and back to output RGB using a learned camera image signal processing (ISP) pipeline to eliminate potential adversarial patterns. The proposed method acts as an off-the-shelf preprocessing module and, unlike model-specific adversarial training methods, does not require adversarial images to train. As a result, the method generalizes to unseen tasks without additional retraining. Experiments on large-scale datasets, e.g., ImageNet, COCO, for different vision tasks, e.g., classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, validate that the method significantly outperforms existing methods across task domains."}}
