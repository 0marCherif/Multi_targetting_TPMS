The basic architecture of\nan LSTM layer is a unit called a memory cell. It has a recurrent connection to itself and several\nactivation gates that regulate the flow of information in and out of the cell. It retains a memory\nstate within the network representing relevant information learned from the input time series.\n(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). LSTM networks are state of the art in many fields,\nincluding natural language processing (K. Greff, 2017). The ability to approximate dynamical\ntime-variant systems (Li, X. D., 2005) and learn temporal patterns that span large intervals\nmakes LSTM based architectures a logical choice for classifying EEG signals (Tsiouris, \u039a. \u039c.,\n2018). There are many variants of this architecture, of which bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)\ncells are of particular interest to classifying EEG data. One can visualize this layer as two\nstandard memory cells parsing the data in opposite directions, enabling the individual cells to\nupdate learned representations using either past or future time points. The utilization of future\ntime points to predict the current cell state necessitates that the signal is a complete-time series\nand not an evolving sequence. (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997).\nThe average cross-validation accuracy of the proposed classifier is\n89.51%, with a standard deviation of 4.7. This work suggests that the BiLSTM classifier can\nprovide a robust framework for EEG mental workload classification when coupled with\nspectral and non-linear features."}}

Publicly available datasets are usually limited by small number of participants with few BCI sessions. In this sense, the lack of large, comprehensive datasets with various individuals and multiple sessions has limited advances in the development of more effective data processing and analysis methods for BCI systems. This is particularly evident to explore the feasibility of deep learning methods that require large datasets. Here we present the BCIAUT-P300 dataset, containing 15 autism spectrum disorder individuals undergoing 7 sessions of P300-based BCI joint-attention training, for a total of 105 sessions. The dataset was used for the 2019 IFMBE Scientific Challenge organized during MEDICON 2019 where, in two phases, teams from all over the world tried to achieve the best possible object-detection accuracy based on the P300 signals. This paper presents the characteristics of the dataset and the approaches followed by the 9 finalist teams during the competition. The winner obtained an average accuracy of 92.3% with a convolutional neural network based on EEGNet. The dataset is now publicly released and stands as a benchmark for future P300-based BCI algorithms based on multiple session data"}}

With this as background, we applied variants of data driven Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) on McGurk EEG, which is an illusory perception of speech when the movement of lips does not match with the audio signal, for classifying whether the perception is affected by the visual cue or not. After applying a common pre-processing pipeline, we explored four EMD based frameworks to extract EEG features, which were classified using Random Forest. Among the four alternatives, the most effective framework decomposes the ensemble average of two classes of EEG into their respective intrinsic mode functions forming the basis on which the trials were projected to obtain features, which on classification resulted in accuracies of 63.66% using single electrode and 75.85% using three electrodes. The frequency band which plays vital role during audio-visual integration was also studied using traditional band pass filters. Of all, Gamma band was found to be the most prominent followed by alpha and beta bands which contemplates findings from previous studies."}}

It has a significant part to play in priming motoric actions which depends on the actor's spontaneous neurological behaviour. Action Observation (AO) and Motor Imagery (MI) also lead to the stimulation of motor system. In fact, AO and MI result in activation of overlapping brain areas as the actual motor task. AO combined with MI (referred to as AO+MI) initiates higher cortical activity in comparison with either MI or AO alone. In this paper, we investigate the influence of affordance driven motor priming during AO, MI and AO + MI. Source current density as an EEG parameter is estimated by Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). Our results demonstrate that affordance driven motor priming during AO+MI indicates stronger electrophysiological and behavioural changes. This is evident from the N2 ERP component. Further, the current source density (in brain regions associated with motor planning) during affordance driven AO+MI is found to be maximum."}}

In addition, graph theory-based studies are proving altered structural connectivity in PD. This motivated us to employ regional grey matter volume of PD patients (N=70) for comparative network analysis with an equal number of age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). In the current study, normalized grey matter maps obtained from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) were parcellated into 56 ROI (regions of interest) for construction of symmetric matrix using partial correlation between every pair of regional grey matter volumes. Sparsity thresholding was used to binarize the matrices and MATLAB functions from brain connectivity toolbox were employed to obtain the connectivity metrics. We observed PD with a significantly lower clustering coefficient as well as local efficiency at higher sparsities (above 0.9 and 0.84, respectively) with p<0.05. The right fusiform gyrus was found to be the conserved hub, besides disruption of four hubs and regeneration of five other hubs. Lower clustering coefficient and local efficiency were indicative of reduced local integration and information processing, respectively. Hence, we suggest that global clustering coefficient and local efficiency could have a pivotal role in evaluating network topology. Thereby, our findings confirmed impairment of normal structural brain network topology reflecting disconnectivity mechanisms in PD. Clinical Relevance - Analyzing structural brain connectivity in Parkinson's disease might provide the researchers and clinicians with a signature pattern of the disease to discriminate patients from normal controls."}}

We used average spectral power from all EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) and the approximate entropy of each trial as input features to the LSTM classification network. The proposed framework achieved a mean validation accuracy of 87.38% and a test accuracy of 43.79% on an unseen session of the same subject. Given the performance of our method, we speculate that our network may have tuned to the subject-specific features despite exhibiting generalized predictive capabilities. We also observed a decrease in classification accuracies (validation=86.63%) when the nonlinear feature was not considered. Our results suggest that LSTMs can model discriminative features of the different MW levels experienced by a passive brain-computer interface (PBCI) user."}}

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has been vastly explored to find consistent abnormality patterns of gray matter concentration (GMC) in schizophrenia, yet we are far from having reached conclusive evidence. This paper presents a machine learning approach based on resampling techniques to find brain regions with consistent patterns of GMC differences between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients, these regions being detected by means of source-based morphometry. This work uses multi-site data from the Mind Clinical Imaging Consortium, which is composed of sMRI data from 124 controls and 110 patients. Our method achieves a better classification rate than other algorithms and detects regions with GMC differences between both groups that are consistent with several findings on the literature. In addition, the results obtained on data from multiple sites suggest that it may be possible to replicate these results on other datasets."}}
