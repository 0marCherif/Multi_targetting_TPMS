The giant formula for simultaneously enlarging the resolution, depth and width provides us a Rubik\u2019s cube for neural networks. So that we can find networks with high efficiency and excellent performance by twisting the three dimensions. This paper aims to explore the twisting rules for obtaining deep neural networks with minimum model sizes and computational costs. Different from the network enlarging, we observe that resolution and depth are more important than width for tiny networks. Therefore, the original method, \\ie the compound scaling in EfficientNet is no longer suitable. To this end, we summarize a tiny formula for downsizing neural architectures through a series of smaller models derived from the EfficientNet-B0 with the FLOPs constraint. Experimental results on the ImageNet benchmark illustrate that our TinyNet performs much better than the smaller version of EfficientNets using the inversed giant formula. For instance, our TinyNet-E achieves a 59.9\\% Top-1 accuracy with only 24M FLOPs, which is about 1.9\\% higher than that of the previous best MobileNetV3 with similar computational cost.

Nevertheless, common approaches mostly focus on eliminating less important filters or constructing efficient operations, while ignoring the pattern redundancy in feature maps. We reveal that many feature maps within a layer share similar but not identical patterns. However, it is difficult to identify if features with similar patterns are redundant or contain essential details. Therefore, instead of directly removing uncertain redundant features, we propose a split based convolutional operation, namely SPConv, to tolerate features with similar patterns but require less computation. Specifically, we split input feature maps into the representative part and the uncertain redundant part, where intrinsic information is extracted from the representative part through relatively heavy computation while tiny hidden details in the uncertain redundant part are processed with some light-weight operation. To recalibrate and fuse these two groups of processed features, we propose a parameters-free feature fusion module. Moreover, our SPConv is formulated to replace the vanilla convolution in a plug-and-play way. Without any bells and whistles, experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate SPConv-equipped networks consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and inference time on GPU, with FLOPs and parameters dropped sharply."}}
