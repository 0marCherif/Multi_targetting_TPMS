Therefore, it is important for transit providers to understand\ntheir impact on disruptions, delays, and fare revenues.\nThis paper proposes a suite of data-driven techniques that exploit\nAutomated Fare Collection (AFC) data for evaluating, anticipating,\nand managing the performance of transit systems during\nrecurring congestion peaks due to special events. This includes\nan extensive analysis of ridership of the two major stadiums in\ndowntown Atlanta using rail data from the Metropolitan Atlanta\nRapid Transit Authority (MARTA). The paper first highlights the\nridership predictability at the aggregate level for each station on\nboth event and non-event days. It then presents an unsupervised\nmachine-learning model to cluster passengers and identify which\ntrain they are boarding. The model makes it possible to evaluate\nsystem performance in terms of fundamental metrics such as the\npassenger load per train and the wait times of riders. The paper\nalso presents linear regression and random forest models for\npredicting ridership that are used in combination with historical\nthroughput analysis to forecast demand. Finally, simulations are\nperformed that showcase the potential improvements to wait\ntimes and demand matching by leveraging proposed techniques\nto optimize train frequencies based on forecasted demand."}}
