On the one hand, current OOD detection approaches usually do not directly fix the SoftMax loss drawbacks, but rather build techniques to circumvent it. Unfortunately, those methods usually produce undesired side effects (e.g., classification accuracy drop, additional hyperparameters, slower inferences, and collecting extra data). On the other hand, we propose replacing SoftMax loss with a novel loss function that does not suffer from the mentioned weaknesses. The proposed IsoMax loss is isotropic (exclusively distance-based) and provides high entropy posterior probability distributions. Replacing the SoftMax loss by IsoMax loss requires no model or training changes. Additionally, the models trained with IsoMax loss produce as fast and energy-efficient inferences as those trained using SoftMax loss. Moreover, no classification accuracy drop is observed. The proposed method does not rely on outlier/background data, hyperparameter tuning, temperature calibration, feature extraction, metric learning, adversarial training, ensemble procedures, or generative models. Our experiments showed that IsoMax loss works as a seamless SoftMax loss drop-in replacement that significantly improves neural networks' OOD detection performance. Hence, it may be used as a baseline OOD detection approach to be combined with current or future OOD detection techniques to achieve even higher results."}}

Machine learning algorithms have been proposed for hindering cyber-attacks on CPSs, but the absence of labeled data from novel attacks makes their detection quite challenging. In this context, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a promising unsupervised approach to detect cyber-attacks by implicitly modeling the system. However, the detection of cyber-attacks on CPSs has strict latency requirements, since the attacks need to be stopped before the system is compromised. In this article, we propose FID-GAN, a novel fog-based, unsupervised intrusion detection system (IDS) for CPSs using GANs. The IDS is proposed for a fog architecture, which brings computation resources closer to the end nodes and thus contributes to meeting low-latency requirements. In order to achieve higher detection rates, the proposed architecture computes a reconstruction loss based on the reconstruction of data samples mapped to the latent space. Other works that follow a similar approach struggle with the time required to compute the reconstruction loss, which renders them impractical for latency constrained applications. We address this problem by training an encoder that accelerates the reconstruction loss computation. Experiments show that the proposed solution achieves higher detection rates and is at least 5.5 times faster than a baseline approach in the three studied data sets."}}

Therefore, transaction monitoring and analysis prevent monetary losses caused by fraudsters. Since the fraud detection process is a labor-intensive task for human auditors given the huge amount of daily transactions processed by financial services information systems. Credit card is the financial product most explored in the financial fraud detection literature, while mobile money service is becoming a popular option for payments, fraud detection for such financial product has not yet been deeply explored. Therefore, it is interesting to optimize the auditing process and test new quantitative techniques, such as deep learning, to support human auditors before double-checking a suspicious transaction. Thus, we propose an integration of adversarial autoencoders and machine learning methods to perform an objective classification among three transaction types: regular, local, and global anomaly. The integration consists of using the autoencoder's generated latent vectors as features for the supervised learning algorithms. The experiments considered different latent vector space forms concerning their dimensionality and the clusters generated by a prior Gaussian mixture. The results show that some classifiers may accept latent characteristics well, getting better or similar performance when using all the original characteristics."}}

Manually defining a learning rate schedule involves troublesome time-consuming try and error procedures to determine hyperparameters such as learning rate decay epochs and learning rate decay rates. Although adaptive learning rate optimizers automatize this process, recent studies suggest they may produce overffiting and reduce performance when compared to fine-tuned learning rate schedules. Considering that deep neural networks loss functions present landscapes with much more saddle points than local minima, we proposed the Training Aware Sigmoidal Optimizer (TASO), which consists of a two-phases automated learning rate schedule. The first phase uses a high learning rate to fast traverse the numerous saddle point, while the second phase uses low learning rate to slowly approach the center of the local minimum previously found. We compared the proposed approach with commonly used adaptive learning rate schedules such as Adam, RMSProp, and Adagrad. Our experiments showed that TASO outperformed all competing methods in both optimal (i.e., performing hyperparameter validation) and suboptimal (i.e., using default hyperparameters) scenarios."}}

The common approaches for emotion recognition focus on analyzing facial expressions and requires the automatic localization of the face in the image. Although these methods can correctly classify emotion in controlled scenarios, such techniques are limited when dealing with unconstrained daily interactions. We propose a new deep learning approach for emotion recognition based on adaptive multi-cues that extract information from context and body poses, which humans commonly use in social interaction and communication.
