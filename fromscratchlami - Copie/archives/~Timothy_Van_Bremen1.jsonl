We consider two variants of this problem: the uniform sampling regime, in which the goal is to sample a model uniformly at random, and the symmetric weighted sampling regime, in which models are weighted according to the number of groundings of each predicate appearing in them. Solutions to this problem have applications to the scalable generation of combinatorial structures, as well as sampling in several statistical-relational models such as Markov logic networks and probabilistic logic programs. In this paper, we identify certain classes of sentences that are domain-liftable under sampling, in the sense that they admit a sampling algorithm that runs in time polynomial in n. In particular, we prove that every sentence of the form \u2200x\u2200y: ?(x, y) for some quantifier-free formula ?(x,y) is domain-liftable under sampling. We then further show that this result continues to hold in the presence of one or more cardinality constraints as well as a single tree axiom constraint."}}

Algorithms for this problem typically output a single number, which is the number of models of the first-order logic sentence in question on a given domain. However, in the combinatorics setting, we are more interested in obtaining a mathematical formula that holds for any given structure size. In this paper, we show that one can use lifted inference algorithms to conjecture linear recurrences with polynomial coefficients, one such class of formulas of interest."}}

Past work has shown that the RMP construction problem can be reduced to weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC). However, existing reductions in the literature are intractable in practice, since they typically require an infeasibly large number of calls to a WFOMC oracle. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to construct RMPs using fewer oracle calls. As an application, we also show how to apply this new algorithm to improve an existing approximation scheme for WFOMC. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches experimentally, and find that our method provides speed-ups over the baseline for RMP construction of a full order of magnitude."}}

Modern search-based model counting algorithms are built on conflict-driven clause learning, combined with the caching of certain subformulas (called components) encountered during the search process. Despite significant progress in these algorithms over the years, state-of-the-art model counters often struggle to handle large but structured instances that typically arise in combinatorial settings. Motivated by the observation that these counters do not exploit the inherent symmetries exhibited in such instances, we revisit the component caching architecture employed in current counters and introduce a novel caching scheme that focuses on identifying symmetric components. We first prove the soundness of our approach, and then integrate it into the state-of-the-art model counter GANAK. Our extensive experiments on hard combinatorial instances demonstrate that the resulting counter, SymGANAK, leads to improvements over GANAK both in terms of PAR-2 score and the number of instances solved."}}

The algorithm has applications to inference in a variety of first-order probabilistic representations, such as Markov logic networks and probabilistic logic programs. Crucially for many applications, no assumptions are made on the form of the input sentence. Instead, the algorithm makes use of the symmetry inherent in the problem by imposing cardinality constraints on the number of possible true groundings of a sentence's literals. Realising the first-order model counting oracle in practice using the approximate hashing-based model counter ApproxMC3, we show how our algorithm is competitive with existing approximate and exact techniques for inference in first-order probabilistic models. We additionally provide PAC guarantees on the accuracy of the bounds generated."}}
