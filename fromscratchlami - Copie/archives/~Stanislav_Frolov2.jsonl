Recently, layout-to-image synthesis approaches have attracted much interest by conditioning the generator on a list of bounding boxes and corresponding class labels. However, previous approaches are very restrictive because the set of labels is fixed a priori. Meanwhile, text-to-image synthesis methods have substantially improved and provide a flexible way for conditional image generation. In this work, we introduce dense text-to-image (DT2I) synthesis as a new task to pave the way toward more intuitive image generation. Furthermore, we propose DTC-GAN, a novel method to generate images from semantically rich region descriptions, and a multi-modal region feature matching loss to encourage semantic image-text matching. Our results demonstrate the capability of our approach to generate plausible images of complex scenes using region captions."}}

At the same time, image synthesis using generative adversarial networks (GANs) has drastically improved over the last few years. The recently proposed TransGAN is the first GAN using only transformer-based architectures and achieves competitive results when compared to convolutional GANs. However, since transformers are data-hungry architectures, TransGAN requires data augmentation, an auxiliary super-resolution task during training, and a masking prior to guide the self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we study the combination of a transformer-based generator and convolutional discriminator and successfully remove the need of the aforementioned required design choices. We evaluate our approach by conducting a benchmark of well-known CNN discriminators, ablate the size of the transformer-based generator, and show that combining both architectural elements into a hybrid model leads to better results. Furthermore, we investigate the frequency spectrum properties of generated images and observe that our model retains the benefits of an attention based generator."}}

It is a flexible and intuitive way for conditional image generation with significant progress in the last years regarding visual realism, diversity, and semantic alignment. However, the field still faces several challenges that require further research efforts such as enabling the generation of high-resolution images with multiple objects, and developing suitable and reliable evaluation metrics that correlate with human judgement. In this review, we contextualize the state of the art of adversarial text-to-image synthesis models, their development since their inception five years ago, and propose a taxonomy based on the level of supervision. We critically examine current strategies to evaluate text-to-image synthesis models, highlight shortcomings, and identify new areas of research, ranging from the development of better datasets and evaluation metrics to possible improvements in architectural design and model training. This review complements previous surveys on generative adversarial networks with a focus on text-to-image synthesis which we believe will help researchers to further advance the field."}}

Previous approaches condition the generator on object locations as well as class labels but lack fine-grained control over the diverse appearance aspects of individual objects. Gaining control over the image generation process is fundamental to build practical applications with a user-friendly interface. In this paper, we propose a method for attribute controlled image synthesis from layout which allows to specify the appearance of individual objects without affecting the rest of the image. We extend a state-of-the-art approach for layout-to-image generation to additionally condition individual objects on attributes. We create and experiment on a synthetic, as well as the challenging Visual Genome dataset. Our qualitative and quantitative results show that our method can successfully control the fine-grained details of individual objects when modelling complex scenes with multiple objects. Source code, dataset and pre-trained models are publicly available ( https://github.com/stanifrolov/AttrLostGAN )."}}

While current models can generate photo-realistic images of individual objects such as birds and human faces, synthesising images with multiple objects is still very difficult. In this paper, we propose an effective way to combine Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis with Visual Question Answering (VQA) to improve the image quality and image-text alignment of generated images by leveraging the VQA 2.0 dataset. We create additional training samples by concatenating question and answer (QA) pairs and employ a standard VQA model to provide the T2I model with an auxiliary learning signal. We encourage images generated from QA pairs to look realistic and additionally minimize an external VQA loss. Our method lowers the FID from 27.84 to 25.38 and increases the R-prec. from 83.82% to 84.79% when compared to the baseline, which indicates that T2I synthesis can successfully be improved using a standard VQA model."}}
