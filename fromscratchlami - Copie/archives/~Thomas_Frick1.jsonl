As the manual inspection of such large structures is costly and time-consuming, we are working towards fully automating the visual inspections to support the prioritization of maintenance activities. To that end we combine recent advances in drone technology and deep learning. Unfortunately, annotation costs are incredibly high as our proprietary civil engineering dataset must be annotated by highly trained engineers. Active learning is, therefore, a valuable tool to optimize the trade-off between model performance and annotation costs. Our use-case differs from the classical active learning setting as our dataset suffers from heavy class imbalance and consists of a much larger already labeled data pool than other active learning research. We present a novel method capable of operating in this challenging setting by replacing the traditional active learning acquisition function with an auxiliary binary discriminator. We experimentally show that our novel method outperforms the best-performing traditional active learning method (BALD) by 5% and 38% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and our proprietary dataset respectively."}}

However, there is still a lot of uncertainties regarding the precise link between peripheral and central autonomic biosignals. Clarifying these links could have a profound impact on the interpretability, and thus usefulness, of peripheral autonomic biosignals captured with wearable devices. In this study, we take advantage of a unique dataset consisting of intracranial stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) and peripheral biosignals acquired simultaneously for several days from four subjects undergoing epilepsy monitoring. Compared to previous work, we apply a deep neural network to explore high-dimensional nonlinear correlations between the cerebral brainwaves and variations in heart rate and electrodermal activity (EDA). Further, neural network explainability methods were applied to identify most relevant brainwave frequencies, brain regions and temporal information to predict a specific biosignal. Strongest brain-peripheral correlations were observed from contacts located in the central autonomic network, in particular in the alpha, theta and 52 to 58 Hz frequency band. Furthermore, a temporal delay of 12 to 14 s between SEEG and EDA signal was observed. Finally, we believe that this pilot study demonstrates a promising approach to mapping brain-peripheral relationships in a data-driven manner by leveraging the expressiveness of deep neural networks."}}

These seizures have different intensities and might lead to accidents or, in the worst case, to sudden death. Therefore, being able to predict epileptic seizures would allow patients to be prepared, reducing the risk of injury. This paper focuses on epileptic seizure prediction using EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals. In contrast to the standard approach where the preictal state is assumed to have a constant duration in all the seizures of a patient, we propose a new method that labels each seizure individually exploiting clustering. Our labeling approach, which was applicable for 38% of the selected seizures, results in substantial improvements compared to the standard one. In fact, it reduces noise in the labels and improves the performance of the binary classifier used to distinguish the interictal and preictal states. Hence, our results suggest that the preictal duration is seizure-specific, not only patient-specific. Finally, we show that our method is able to predict 17 out of 18 (94%) seizures between 15 and 85 minutes, before seizure onset."}}

However, they are black boxes and do not provide explicit explanations for their decisions. For many applications, particularly in health care, explanations are essential for building trust in the model. In the field of computer vision, a multitude of explainability methods have been developed to analyze Neural Networks by explaining what they have learned during training and what factors influence their decisions. This work provides an overview of these explanation methods in form of a taxonomy. We adapt and benchmark the different methods to time series data. Further, we introduce quantitative explanation metrics that enable us to build an objective benchmarking framework with which we extensively rate and compare explainability methods. As a result, we show that the Grad-CAM++ algorithm outperforms all other methods. Finally, we identify the limits of existing explanation methods for specific datasets, with feature values close to zero."}}
