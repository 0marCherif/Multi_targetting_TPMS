Thanks to the semantic diversity of natural language descriptions, temporal grounding allows activity grounding beyond pre-defined classes and has received increasing attention in recent years. The semantic diversity is rooted in the principle of compositionality in linguistics, where novel semantics can be systematically de- scribed by combining known words in novel ways (compositional generalization). However, current temporal ground- ing datasets do not specifically test for the compositional generalizability. To systematically measure the compositional generalizability of temporal grounding models, we introduce a new Compositional Temporal Grounding task and construct two new dataset splits, i.e., Charades-CG and ActivityNet-CG. Evaluating the state-of-the-art methods on our new dataset splits, we empirically find that they fail to generalize to queries with novel combinations of seen words. To tackle this challenge, we propose a variational cross-graph reasoning framework that explicitly de- composes video and language into multiple structured hierarchies and learns fine-grained semantic correspondence among them. Experiments illustrate the superior compositional generalizability of our approach. "}}

This new task requires a model to draw inference on whether a natural language statement entails or contradicts a given video clip. In this paper, we study how to address three critical challenges for this task: judging the global correctness of the statement involved multiple semantic meanings, joint reasoning over video and subtitles, and modeling long-range relationships and complex social interactions. First, we propose an adaptive hierarchical graph network that achieves in-depth understanding of the video over complex interactions. Specifically, it performs joint reasoning over video and subtitles in three hierarchies, where the graph structure is adaptively adjusted according to the semantic structures of the statement. Secondly, we introduce semantic coherence learning to explicitly encourage the semantic coherence of the adaptive hierarchical graph network from three hierarchies. The semantic coherence learning can further improve the alignment between vision and linguistics, and the coherence across a sequence of video segments. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline by a large margin."}}

Gestures with meaningful signs can better convey useful information and arouse sympathy in the audience. Current works focus on aligning gestures with the speech rhythms, which are hard to mine the semantics and model semantic gestures explicitly. In this paper, we propose a novel method SEmantic Energized Generation (SEEG), for semantic-aware gesture generation. Our method contains two parts: DEcoupled Mining module (DEM) and Semantic Energizing Module (SEM). DEM decouples the semantic-irrelevant information from inputs and separately mines information for the beat and semantic gestures. SEM conducts semantic learning and produces semantic gestures. Apart from representational similarity, SEM requires the predictions to express the same semantics as the ground truth. Besides, a semantic prompter is designed in SEM to leverage the semantic-aware supervision to predictions. This promotes the networks to learn and generate semantic gestures. Experimental results reported in three metrics on different benchmarks prove that SEEG efficiently mines semantic cues and generates semantic gestures. In comparison, SEEG outperforms other methods in all semantic-aware evaluations on different datasets. Qualitative evaluations also indicate the superiority of SEEG in semantic expressiveness."}}

Many studies have been conducted to assess the quality of feature representations. One of the simple strategies is to utilize a linear probing classifier to quantitatively evaluate the class accuracy under the obtained features. The typical linear probe is only applied as a proxy at the inference time, but its efficacy in measuring features' suitability for linear classification is largely neglected in training. In this paper, we propose an episodic linear probing (ELP) classifier to reflect the generalization of visual representations in an online manner. ELP is trained with detached features from the network and re-initialized episodically. It demonstrates the discriminability of the visual representations in training. Then, an ELP-suitable Regularization term (ELP-SR) is introduced to reflect the distances of probability distributions between ELP classifier and the main classifier. ELP-SR leverages a re-scaling factor to regularize each sample in training, which modulates the loss function adaptively and encourages the features to be discriminative and generalized. We observe significant improvements in three real-world visual recognition tasks, including fine-grained visual classification, long-tailed visual recognition, and generic object recognition. The performance gains show the effectiveness of our method in improving network generalization and feature discrimination."}}

Their adaptation to zero-shot image-conditioned text generation tasks has drawn increasing interest. Prior arts approach to zero-shot captioning by either utilizing the existing large language models (e.g., GPT-2) or pre-training the encoder-decoder network in an end-to-end manner. However, the large language models may not generate sensible descriptions due to the task discrepancy between captioning and language modeling, while the end-to-end pre-training requires paired data and extensive computational resources. In this work, we propose a simple framework, named DeCap, for zero-shot captioning. We introduce a lightweight visual-aware language decoder. This decoder is both data-efficient and computation-efficient: 1) it only requires the \\textit{text} data for training, easing the burden on the collection of paired data. 2) it does not require end-to-end training. When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the text embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix embedding. The challenge is that the decoder is trained on the text corpus but at the inference stage, it needs to generate captions based on visual inputs. Though the CLIP text embedding and the visual embedding are correlated, the \\textit{modality gap} issue is widely observed in multi-modal contrastive models that prevents us from directly taking the visual embedding as the prefix embedding. We propose a training-free mechanism to reduce the modality gap. We project the visual embedding into the CLIP text embedding space, while the projected embedding retains the information of the visual input. Taking the projected embedding as the prefix embedding, the decoder generates high-quality descriptions that match the visual input. The experiments show that DeCap outperforms other zero-shot captioning methods and unpaired captioning methods by a large margin on the typical image captioning benchmarks, i.e., MSCOCO and NoCaps. We apply DeCap to video captioning and achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on MSR-VTT and ActivityNet-Captions. The code is available at https://github.com/dhg-wei/DeCap."}}

Previous solutions to this problem mainly rely on knowledge distillation and indeed have a two-stage learning procedure: first train a large teacher model, then distill it to improve the generalization ability of small ones. In this work, we present a new one-stage solution to obtain pre-trained small models without extra teachers: slimmable networks for contrastive self-supervised learning (SlimCLR). A slimmable network contains a full network and several weight-sharing sub-networks. We can pre-train for only one time and obtain various networks including small ones with low computation costs. However, in self-supervised cases, the interference between weight-sharing networks leads to severe performance degradation. One evidence of the interference is gradient imbalance: a small proportion of parameters produces dominant gradients during backpropagation, and the main parameters may not be fully optimized. The divergence in gradient directions of various networks may also cause interference between networks. To overcome these problems, we make the main parameters produce dominant gradients and provide consistent guidance for sub-networks via three techniques: slow start training of sub-networks, online distillation, and loss re-weighting according to model sizes. Besides, a switchable linear probe layer is applied during linear evaluation to avoid the interference of weight-sharing linear layers. We instantiate SlimCLR with typical contrastive learning frameworks and achieve better performance than previous arts with fewer parameters and FLOPs."}}

Existing methods mainly model the cross-modal alignment by the similarity of the global representations of images and text, or advanced cross-modal attention upon image and text features. However, they fail to explicitly learn the fine-grained semantic alignment between visual regions and textual phrases, as only global image-text alignment information is available. In this paper, we introduce LOUPE, a fine-grained semantically aLigned visiOn-langUage PrE-training framework, which learns fine-grained semantic alignment from the novel perspective of game-theoretic interactions. To efficiently estimate the game-theoretic interactions, we further propose an uncertainty-aware neural Shapley interaction learning module. Experiments show that LOUPE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of  vision-language tasks. Without any object-level human annotations and fine-tuning, LOUPE achieves competitive performance on object detection and visual grounding. More importantly, LOUPE opens a new promising direction of learning fine-grained semantics from large-scale raw image-text pairs."}}

Most of previous works deal with the long-tailed classification problem by re-balancing the overall distribution within the whole dataset or directly transferring knowledge from data-rich classes to data-poor ones. In this work, we consider the gradient distortion in long-tailed classification when the gradient on data-rich classes and data-poor ones are incorporated simultaneously, i.e., shifted gradient direction towards data-rich classes as well as the enlarged variance by the gradient fluctuation on data-poor classes. Motivated by such phenomenon, we propose to disentangle the distinctive effects of data-rich and data-poor gradient and asynchronously train a model via a dual-phase learning process. The first phase only concerns the data-rich classes. In the second phase, besides the standard classification upon data-poor classes, we propose an exemplar memory bank to reserve representative examples and a memory-retentive loss via graph matching to retain the relation between two phases. The extensive experimental results on four commonly used long-tailed benchmarks including CIFAR100-LT, Places-LT, ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist 2018 highlight the excellent performance of our proposed method."}}

Specifically, we find a transport plan with discriminative features. To this end, we formulate the FROT problem as a min--max optimization problem. We then propose a convex formulation of the FROT problem and solve it using a Frank--Wolfe-based optimization algorithm, whereby the subproblem can be efficiently solved using the Sinkhorn algorithm. Since FROT finds the transport plan from selected features, it is robust to noise features. To show the effectiveness of FROT, we propose using the FROT algorithm for the layer selection problem in deep neural networks for semantic correspondence. By conducting synthetic and benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can find a strong correspondence by determining important layers. We show that the FROT algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world semantic correspondence datasets."}}

Because reID is different from classification, the architecture should be modified accordingly. We propose to automatically search for a CNN architecture that is specifically suitable for the reID task. There are three aspects to be tackled. First, body structural information plays an important role in reID but it is not encoded in backbones. Second, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates the process of architecture design without human effort, but no existing NAS methods incorporate the structure information of input images. Third, reID is essentially a retrieval task but current NAS algorithms are merely designed for classification. To solve these problems, we propose a retrieval-based search algorithm over a specifically designed reID search space, named Auto-ReID. Our Auto-ReID enables the automated approach to find an efficient and effective CNN architecture for reID. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the searched architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing 50% parameters and 53% FLOPs compared to others."}}
