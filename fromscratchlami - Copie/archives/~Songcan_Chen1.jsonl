Such two stages are usually implemented separately, making the learned representation learned agnostic to the downstream tasks. Currently, most works are devoted to exploring the first stage. Whereas, it is less studied on how to learn downstream tasks with limited labeled data using the already learned representations. Especially, it is crucial and challenging to selectively utilize the complementary representations from diverse pretexts for a downstream task. In this paper, we technically propose a novel solution by leveraging the attention mechanism to adaptively squeeze suitable representations for the tasks. Meanwhile, resorting to information theory, we theoretically prove that gathering representation from diverse pretexts is more effective than a single one. Extensive experiments validate that our scheme significantly exceeds current popular pretext-matching based methods in gathering knowledge and relieving negative transfer in downstream tasks."}}

In this paper, we propose to employ implicit stochastic gradient descent (ISGD) method to train PINNs for improving the stability of training process. We heuristically analyze how ISGD overcome stiffness in the gradient flow dynamics of PINNs, especially for problems with multi-scale solutions. We theoretically prove that for two-layer fully connected neural networks with large hidden nodes, randomly initialized ISGD converges to a globally optimal solution for the quadratic loss function. Empirical results demonstrate that ISGD works well in practice and compares favorably to other gradient-based optimization methods such as SGD and Adam, while can also effectively address the numerical stiffness in training dynamics via gradient descent."}}

This defense ability, however, is challenged in this paper. We identify a novel threat model named stability attack, which aims to hinder robust availability by slightly manipulating the training data. Under this threat, we show that adversarial training using a conventional defense budget $\\epsilon$ provably fails to provide test robustness in a simple statistical setting, where the non-robust features of the training data can be reinforced by $\\epsilon$-bounded perturbation. Further, we analyze the necessity of enlarging the defense budget to counter stability attacks. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that stability attacks are harmful on benchmark datasets, and thus the adaptive defense is necessary to maintain robustness."}}

A deep learning system involves a couple of elements: the learning task, data set, deep model, loss, and optimizer. Each element may cause the vulnerability of the deep learning system, and simply attributing the vulnerability of the deep learning system to the deep model may impede addressing the adversarial attack. So we redefine the robustness of DNNs as the robustness of the deep neural learning system, and we experimentally find that the vulnerability of the deep learning system also roots in the learning task itself. In detail, this paper defines the interval-label classification task for the deep classification system, whose labels are predefined non-overlapping intervals instead of a fixed value (hard label) or probability vector (soft label). The experimental results demonstrate that the interval-label classification task is more robust than the traditional classification task while retaining accuracy."}}

By formalizing this malicious attack as finding the worst-case training data within a specific $\\infty$-Wasserstein ball, we show that minimizing adversarial risk on the perturbed data is equivalent to optimizing an upper bound of natural risk on the original data. This implies that adversarial training can serve as a principled defense against delusive attacks. Thus, the test accuracy decreased by delusive attacks can be largely recovered by adversarial training. To further understand the internal mechanism of the defense, we disclose that adversarial training can resist the delusive perturbations by preventing the learner from overly relying on non-robust features in a natural setting. Finally, we complement our theoretical findings with a set of experiments on popular benchmark datasets, which show that the defense withstands six different practical attacks. Both theoretical and empirical results vote for adversarial training when confronted with delusive adversaries."}}

Commonly studied adversarial examples are malicious inputs, crafted by an adversary from correctly classified examples, to induce misclassification. This paper studies an intriguing, yet far overlooked consequence of the excessive sensitivity, that is, a misclassified example can be easily perturbed to help the model to produce correct output. Such perturbed examples look harmless, but actually can be maliciously utilized by a false friend to make the model self-satisfied. Thus we name them hypocritical examples. With false friends like these, a poorly performed model could behave like a state-of-the-art one. Once a deployer trusts the hypocritical performance and uses the \"well-performed\" model in real-world applications, potential security concerns appear even in benign environments. In this paper, we formalize the hypocritical risk for the first time and propose a defense method specialized for hypocritical examples by minimizing the tradeoff between natural risk and an upper bound of hypocritical risk. Moreover, our theoretical analysis reveals connections between adversarial risk and hypocritical risk. Extensive experiments verify the theoretical results and the effectiveness of our proposed methods."}}

However, in some machine learning problems such as the bandit model and the black-box learning problem, proximal gradient method could fail because the explicit gradients of these problems are difficult or infeasible to obtain. The gradient-free (zeroth-order) method can address these problems because only the objective function values are required in the optimization. Recently, the first zeroth-order proximal stochastic algorithm was proposed to solve the nonconvex nonsmooth problems. However, its convergence rate is O(1/\u221aT) for the nonconvex problems, which is significantly slower than the best convergence rate O(T1) of the zerothorder stochastic algorithm, where T is the iteration number. To fill this gap, in the paper, we propose a class of faster zeroth-order proximal stochastic methods with the variance reduction techniques of SVRG and SAGA, which are denoted as ZO-ProxSVRG and ZO-ProxSAGA, respectively. In theoretical analysis, we address the main challenge that an unbiased estimate of the true gradient does not hold in the zerothorder case, which was required in previous theoretical analysis of both SVRG and SAGA. Moreover, we prove that both ZO-ProxSVRG and ZO-ProxSAGA algorithms have O(T1) convergence rates. Finally, the experimental results verify that our algorithms have a faster convergence rate than the existing zeroth-order proximal stochastic algorithm."}}

Multi-view clustering (MVC) becomes its important paradigm. In real-world applications, some views often suffer from instances missing. Clustering on such multi-view datasets is called incomplete multi-view clustering (IMC) and quite challenging. To date, though many approaches have been developed, most of them are offline and have high computational and memory costs especially for large scale datasets. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an One-Pass Incomplete Multi-view Clustering framework (OPIMC). With the help of regularized matrix factorization and weighted matrix factorization, OPIMC can relatively easily deal with such problem. Different from the existing and sole online IMC method, OPIMC can directly get clustering results and effectively determine the termination of iteration process by introducing two global statistics. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on four real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed OPIMC method."}}
{"id": "r1-bGXGd-S", "cdate": 1514764800000, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Doubly Aligned Incomplete Multi-view Clustering", "abstract": "Nowadays, multi-view clustering has attracted more and more attention. To date, almost all the previous studies assume that views are complete. However, in reality, it is often the case that each view may contain some missing instances. Such incompleteness makes it impossible to directly use traditional multi-view clustering methods. In this paper, we propose a Doubly Aligned Incomplete Multi-view Clustering algorithm (DAIMC) based on weighted semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (semi-NMF). Specifically, on the one hand, DAIMC utilizes the given instance alignment information to learn a common latent feature matrix for all the views. On the other hand, DAIMC establishes a consensus basis matrix with the help of \u00a0L2,1-Norm regularized regression for reducing the influence of missing instances. Consequently, compared with existing methods, besides inheriting the strength of semi-NMF with ability to handle negative entries, DAIMC has two unique advantages: 1) solving the incomplete view problem by introducing a respective weight matrix for each view, making it able to easily adapt to the case with more than two views; 2) reducing the influence of view incompleteness on clustering by enforcing the basis matrices of individual views being aligned with the help of regression. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate its advantages."}}
