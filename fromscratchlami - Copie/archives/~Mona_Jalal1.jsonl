We here focus on a challenging dataset, 1,000 political tweets that were collected during the U.S. presidential primary election in February 2016. Each tweet refers to at least one of four presidential candidates, i.e., four named entities. The groundtruth, established by experts in political communication, has entity-level sentiment information for each candidate mentioned in the tweet. We tested several commercial and open-source tools. Our experiments show that, for our dataset of political tweets, the most accurate NER system, Google Cloud NL, performed almost on par with crowdworkers, but the most accurate ELS analysis system, TensiStrength, did not match the accuracy of crowdworkers by a large margin of more than 30 percent points.

By analyzing a student's face and gestures, our method predicts the outcome of a student answering a problem in an ITS from a video feed. Our work is motivated by the reasoning that the ability to predict such outcomes enables tutoring systems to adjust interventions, such as hints and encouragement, and to ultimately yield improved student learning. We collected a large labeled dataset of student interactions with an intelligent online math tutor consisting of 68 sessions, where 54 individual students solved 2,749 problems. We will release this dataset publicly upon publication of this paper. It will be available at https://www.cs.bu.edu/faculty/betke/research/learning/. Working with this dataset, our transfer-learning challenge was to design a representation in the source domain of pictures obtained \u201cin the wild\u201d for the task of facial expression analysis, and transferring this learned representation to the task of human behavior prediction in the domain of webcam videos of students in a classroom environment. We developed a novel facial affect representation and a user-personalized training scheme that unlocks the potential of this representation. We designed several variants of a recurrent neural network that models the temporal structure of video sequences of students solving math problems. Our final model, named ATL-BP for Affect Transfer Learning for Behavior Prediction, achieves a relative increase in mean F -score of 50 % over the state-of-the-art method on this new dataset."}}

When describing an incident involving gun violence, for example, some journalists may focus on mental health or gun regulation, while others may emphasize the discussion of gun rights. Such perspectives are called \u201cframes\u201d in communication research. We study, for the first time, the value of combining lead images and their contextual information with text to identify the frame of a given news article. We observe that using multiple modes of information(article- and image-derived features) improves prediction of news frames over any single mode of information when the images are relevant to the frames of the headlines. We also observe that frame image relevance is related to the ease of conveying frames via images, which we call frame concreteness. Additionally, we release the first multimodal news framing dataset related to gun violence in the U.S., curated and annotated by communication researchers. The dataset will allow researchers to further examine the use of multiple information modalities for studying media framing."}}

A news article written about COVID-19 for example, might focus on personal preventative actions such as mask-wearing, while another might focus on COVID-19's impact on the economy. These perspectives are called \"frames,\" which when used may influence public perception and opinion of the issue. We introduce a Web-based system for analyzing and classifying frames in text documents. Our goal is to make effective tools for automatic frame discovery and labeling based on topic modeling and deep learning widely accessible to researchers from a diverse array of disciplines. To this end, we provide both state-of-the-art pre-trained frame classification models on various issues as well as a user-friendly pipeline for training novel classification models on user-provided corpora. Researchers can submit their documents and obtain frames of the documents. The degree of user involvement is flexible: they can run models that have been pre-trained on select issues; submit labeled documents and train a new model for frame classification; or submit unlabeled documents and obtain potential frames of the documents. The code making up our system is also open-sourced and well-documented, making the system transparent and expandable. The system is available on-line at http://www.openframing.org and via our GitHub page https://github.com/davidatbu/openFraming ."}}

Research has shown that data from social media sources can be used for monitoring dietary behavior.We propose a scrape-by-location methodology to create food image datasets from Instagram posts. We used it to collect 3.56 million images over a period of 20 days in March 2019. We also propose a scrape-by-keywords methodology and used it to scrape -30,000 images and their captions of 38 Kenyan food types.We publish two datasets of 104,000 and 8,174 image/caption pairs, respectively. With the first dataset, Kenya104K, we train a Kenyan Food Classifier, called KenyanFC, to distinguish Kenyan food from non-food images posted in Kenya.We used the second dataset, KenyanFood13, to train a classifier Kenyan-FTR, short for Kenyan Food Type Recognizer, to recognize 13 popular food types in Kenya. The KenyanFTR is a multimodal deep neural network that can identify 13 types of Kenyan foods using both images and their corresponding captions. Experiments show that the average top-1 accuracy of KenyanFC is 99% over 10,400 tested Instagram images and of KenyanFTR is 81% over 8,174 tested data points. Ablation studies show that three of the 13 food types are particularly difficult to categorize based on image content only and that adding analysis of captions to the image analysis yields a classifier that is 9 percent points more accurate than a classifier that relies only on images. Our food trend analysis revealed that cakes and roasted meats were the most popular foods in photographs on Instagram in Kenya in March 2019."}}

We explore unsupervised information extraction from intermediate convolutional layers of deep neural networks to measure visual complexity. We derive an activation energy metric that combines convolutional layer activations to quantify visual complexity. To show the effectiveness of our proposed metric for various applications, we introduce Savoias, a visual complexity dataset that compromises of more than 1,400 images from seven diverse image categories (e.g., advertisement and interior design). We demonstrate high correlations of our deep neural network-based measure of visual complexity with human-curated ground-truth (GT) scores on various widely used network architectures, e.g., VGG16, ResNet-v2-152, and EfficientNet, and in networks trained on two classification tasks (object and scene classification). This result reveals that intermediate convolutional layers of deep neural networks carry information about the complexity of images that is meaningful to people. Furthermore, we show that our method of measuring visual complexity outperforms traditional methods on Savoias and two other state-of-the-art benchmark datasets. Moreover, we perform extensive analysis on the performance difference between our unsupervised method and a supervised method trained on the feature map, and show that by supervision, we can improve the prediction. Finally, we demonstrate that, within the context of a category, visually more complex images are also more memorable to human observers."}}
