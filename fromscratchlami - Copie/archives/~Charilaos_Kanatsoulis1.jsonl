Despite their success, the common belief is that the expressive power of standard GNNs is limited and that they are at most as discriminative as the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm. In this paper we argue the opposite and show that the WL algorithm is the upper bound only when the input to the GNN is the vector of all ones. In this direction, we derive an alternative analysis that employs linear algebraic tools and characterize the representational power of GNNs with respect to the eigenvalue decomposition of the graph operators. We show that GNNs can distinguish between any graphs that differ in at least one eigenvalue and design simple GNN architectures that are provably more expressive than the WL algorithm. Thorough experimental analysis on graph isomorphism and graph classification datasets corroborates our theoretical results and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed architectures."}}

The cornerstone of our proposed architecture is the composition of time and graph convolutional filters followed by pointwise nonlinear activation functions. We introduce a generic definition of convolution operators that mimic the diffusion process of signals over its underlying support. On top of this definition, we propose space-time graph convolutions that are built upon a composition of time and graph shift operators.  We prove that ST-GNNs with multivariate integral Lipschitz filters are stable to small perturbations in the underlying graphs as well as small perturbations in the time domain caused by time warping. Our analysis shows that small variations in the network topology and time evolution of a system does not significantly affect the performance of ST-GNNs. Numerical experiments with decentralized control systems showcase the effectiveness and stability of the proposed ST-GNNs."}}
