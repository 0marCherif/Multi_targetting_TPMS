However, in addition to OOD generalization, practical applications require that adapted models are also safe. To this end, we study the susceptibility of common adaptation protocols to simplicity bias (SB), i.e., the well-known propensity of neural networks to rely upon simple features, as this phenomenon has recently been shown to underlie several problems in safe generalization. Using a controllable, synthetic setting, we demonstrate that solely controlling FD is not sufficient to avoid SB, harming safe generalization. Given the need to control both SB and FD for improved safety and ID/OOD generalization, we propose modifying a recently proposed protocol with goal of reducing SB. We verify the effectiveness of these modified protocols in decreasing SB on synthetic settings, and in jointly improving OOD generalization and safety on standard adaptation benchmarks."}}

Going beyond conventional linear probing (LP) and fine tuning (FT) strategies, protocols that can effectively control feature distortion, i.e., the failure to update features orthogonal to the in-distribution, have been found to achieve improved out-of-distribution generalization (OOD). In order to limit this distortion, the LP+FT protocol, which first learns a linear probe and then uses this initialization for subsequent FT, was proposed. However, in this paper, we find when adaptation protocols (LP, FT, LP+FT) are also evaluated on a variety of safety objectives (e.g., calibration, robustness, etc.), a complementary perspective to feature distortion is helpful to explain protocol behavior. To this end, we study the susceptibility of protocols to simplicity bias (SB), i.e. the well-known propensity of deep neural networks to rely upon simple features, as SB has recently been shown to underlie several problems in robust generalization. Using a synthetic dataset, we demonstrate the susceptibility of existing protocols to SB. Given the strong effectiveness of LP+FT, we then propose modified linear probes that help mitigate SB, and lead to better initializations for subsequent FT. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed LP+FT variants for decreasing SB in a controlled setting, and their ability to improve OOD generalization and safety on three adaptation datasets."}}

However, given their discrete, non-Euclidean nature, graph datasets and graph SSL methods are unlikely to satisfy these properties. This raises the question: how do graph SSL methods, such as contrastive learning (CL), work well? To systematically probe this question, we perform a generalization analysis for CL when using generic graph augmentations (GGAs), with a focus on data-centric properties. Our analysis yields formal insights into the limitations of GGAs and the necessity of task-relevant augmentations. As we empirically show, GGAs do not induce task-relevant invariances on common benchmark datasets, leading to only marginal gains over naive, untrained baselines. Our theory motivates a synthetic data generation process that enables control over task-relevant information and boasts pre-defined optimal augmentations. This flexible benchmark helps us identify yet unrecognized limitations in advanced augmentation techniques (e.g., automated methods). Overall, our work rigorously contextualizes, both empirically and theoretically, the effects of data-centric properties on augmentation strategies and learning paradigms for graph SSL. "}}

In this paper, we investigate the role of dataset properties and augmentation strategies on the success of GCL and reconstruction-based approaches. Using the recent population augmentation graph-based analysis of self-supervised learning, we show theoretically that the success of GCL with popular augmentations is bounded by the graph edit distance between different classes. Next, we introduce a synthetic data generation process that systematically controls the amount of style vs. content in each sample- i.e. information that is irrelevant vs. relevant to the downstream task- to elucidate how graph representation learning methods perform under different dataset conditions. We empirically show that reconstruction approaches perform better when the style vs. content ratio is low and GCL with popular augmentations benefits from moderate style. Our results provide a general, systematic framework for analyzing different graph representation learning methods and demonstrate when a given approach is expected to perform well."}}

In this paper, we go beyond mere descriptions of the learning dynamics by taking a graph perspective and investigating the relationship between the graph structure of NNs and their performance. \nSpecifically, we propose (1) representing the neural network learning process as a time-evolving graph (i.e., a series of static graph snapshots over epochs), (2) capturing the structural changes of the NN during the training phase in a simple temporal summary, and (3) leveraging the structural summary to predict the accuracy of the underlying NN in a classification or regression task. For the dynamic graph representation of NNs, we explore structural representations for fully-connected and convolutional layers, which are key components of powerful NN models. Our analysis shows that a simple summary of graph statistics, such as weighted degree and eigenvector centrality, over just a few epochs, can be used to accurately predict the performance of NNs. For example, a weighted degree-based summary of the time-evolving graph that is constructed based on 5 training epochs of the LeNet architecture achieves classification accuracy of over 93\\%. Our findings are consistent for different NN architectures, including LeNet, VGG, AlexNet, and ResNet."}}
