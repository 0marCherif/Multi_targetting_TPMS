However, existing SSL methods rely on a large unlabeled dataset, which may not always be available in many real-world applications due to legal constraints (e.g., GDPR). In this paper, we investigate the research question: Can we train SSL models without real unlabeled datasets? Instead of using real unlabeled datasets, we propose an SSL method using synthetic datasets generated from generative foundation models trained on datasets containing millions of samples in diverse domains (e.g., ImageNet). Our main concepts are identifying synthetic samples that emulate unlabeled samples from generative foundation models and training classifiers using these synthetic samples. To achieve this, our method is formulated as an alternating optimization problem: (i) meta-learning of generative foundation models and (ii) SSL of classifiers using real labeled and synthetic unlabeled samples. For (i), we propose a meta-learning objective that optimizes latent variables to generate samples that resemble real labeled samples and minimize the validation loss. For (ii), we propose a simple unsupervised loss function that regularizes the feature extractors of classifiers to maximize the performance improvement obtained from synthetic samples. We confirm that our method outperforms baselines using generative foundation models on SSL. We also demonstrate that our methods outperform SSL using real unlabeled datasets in scenarios with extremely small amounts of labeled datasets. This suggests that synthetic samples have the potential to provide improvement gains more efficiently than real unlabeled data."}}

To enhance its performance, recent methods impose high weights on the cross-entropy loss for important data points near the decision boundary. However, these importance-aware methods are vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, e.g., Auto-Attack. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the cause of their vulnerability via margins between logits for the true label and the other labels because they should be large enough to prevent the largest logit from being flipped by the attacks. Our experiments reveal that the histogram of the logit margins of naive adversarial training has two peaks. Thus, the levels of difficulty in increasing logit margins are roughly divided into two: difficult samples (small logit margins) and easy samples (large logit margins). On the other hand, only one peak near zero appears in the histogram of importance-aware methods, i.e., they reduce the logit margins of easy samples. To increase logit margins of difficult samples without reducing those of easy samples, we propose switching one-versus-the-rest loss (SOVR), which switches from cross-entropy to one-versus-the-rest loss (OVR) for difficult samples. We derive trajectories of logit margins for a simple problem and prove that OVR increases logit margins two times larger than the weighted cross-entropy loss. Thus, SOVR increases logit margins of difficult samples, unlike existing methods. We experimentally show that SOVR achieves better robustness against Auto-Attack than importance-aware methods."}}

To transfer source knowledge without these assumptions, we propose a transfer learning method that uses deep generative models and is composed of the following two stages: pseudo pre-training (PP) and pseudo semi-supervised learning (P-SSL). PP trains a target architecture with an artificial dataset synthesized by using conditional source generative models. P-SSL applies SSL algorithms to labeled target data and unlabeled pseudo samples, which are generated by cascading the source classifier and generative models to condition them with target samples.

The main challenge is how to avoid overfitting since over-parameterized NNs can easily overfit to such small dataset. Previous work (e.g. MAML by Finn et al. 2017) tackles this challenge by meta-learning, which learns how to learn from a few data by using various tasks. On the other hand, one conventional approach to avoid overfitting is restricting hypothesis spaces by endowing sparse NN structures like convolution layers in computer vision. However, although such manually-designed sparse structures are sample-efficient for sufficiently large datasets, they are still insufficient for few-shot learning. Then the following questions naturally arise: (1) Can we find sparse structures effective for few-shot learning by meta-learning? (2) What benefits will it bring in terms of meta-generalization? In this work, we propose a novel meta-learning approach, called Meta-ticket, to find optimal sparse subnetworks for few-shot learning within randomly initialized NNs. We empirically validated that Meta-ticket successfully discover sparse subnetworks that can learn specialized features for each given task. Due to this task-wise adaptation ability, Meta-ticket achieves superior meta-generalization compared to MAML-based methods especially with large NNs."}}

These systems often use a single prediction model in a central server and process images sent from various environments, such as cameras distributed in cities or cars. Such single models face images corrupted in heterogeneous ways in test time. Thus, they require to instantly adapt to the multiple corruptions during testing rather than being re-trained at a high cost. Test-time adaptation (TTA), which aims to adapt models without accessing the training dataset, is one of the settings that can address this problem. Existing TTA methods indeed work well on a single corruption. However, the adaptation ability is limited when multiple types of corruption occur, which is more realistic. We hypothesize this is because the distribution shift is more complicated, and the adaptation becomes more difficult in case of multiple corruptions. In fact, we experimentally found that a larger distribution gap remains after TTA. To address the distribution gap during testing, we propose a novel TTA method named Covariance-Aware Feature alignment (CAFe). We empirically show that CAFe outperforms prior TTA methods on image corruptions, including multiple types of corruptions."}}

However, this assumption is easily broken in the real world because of the distribution shift that occurs when the co-occurrence relations between objects and backgrounds in input images change. Under this type of distribution shift, CNNs learn to focus on features that are not task-relevant, such as backgrounds from the training data, and degrade their accuracy on the test data. To tackle this problem, we propose relevant feature focusing (ReFF). ReFF detects task-relevant features and regularizes CNNs via explanation outputs (e.g., Grad-CAM). Since ReFF is composed of post-hoc explanation modules, it can be easily applied to off-the-shelf CNNs. Furthermore, ReFF requires no additional inference cost at test time because it is only used for regularization while training. We demonstrate that CNNs trained with ReFF focus on features relevant to the target task and that ReFF improves the test-time accuracy."}}

To alleviate this issue, we introduce two novel training techniques called frequency dropping (F-Drop) and frequency matching (F-Match). The key idea of F-Drop is to filter out unnecessary high-frequency components from the input images of the discriminators. This simple modification prevents the discriminators from being confused by perturbations of the high-frequency components. In addition, F- Drop makes the GANs focus on fitting in the low-frequency domain, in which there are the dominant components of natural images. F-Match minimizes the difference between real and fake images in the frequency domain for generating more realistic images. F-Match is implemented as a regularization term in the objective functions of the generators; it penalizes the batch mean error in the frequency domain. F-Match helps the generators to fit in the high-frequency domain filtered out by F-Drop to the real image. We experimentally demonstrate that the combination of F-Drop and F-Match improves the generative performance of GANs in both the frequency and spatial domain on multiple image benchmarks."}}
