Although considerable improvement has been achieved, the quality of synthesized images is far from satisfactory due to three largely unresolved challenges. 1) The semantic labels do not provide detailed structural information, making it difficult to synthesize local details and structures. 2) The widely adopted CNN operations such as convolution, down-sampling, and normalization usually cause spatial resolution loss and thus cannot fully preserve the original semantic information, leading to semantically inconsistent results (e.g., missing small objects). 3) Existing semantic image synthesis methods focus on modeling ``local'' semantic information from a single input semantic layout. However, they ignore ``global'' semantic information of multiple input semantic layouts, i.e., semantic cross-relations between pixels across different input layouts. To tackle 1), we propose to use edge as an intermediate representation which is further adopted to guide image generation via a proposed attention guided edge transfer module. Edge information is produced by a convolutional generator and introduces detailed structure information. To tackle 2), we design an effective module to selectively highlight class-dependent feature maps according to the original semantic layout to preserve the semantic information. To tackle 3), inspired by current methods in contrastive learning, we propose a novel contrastive learning method, which aims to enforce pixel embeddings belonging to the same semantic class to generate more similar image content than those from different classes. Doing so can capture more semantic relations by explicitly exploring the structures of labeled pixels from multiple input semantic layouts. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our ECGAN achieves significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods."}}

Existing approaches either rely on instance-level supervision or absolute count information to train a generic object counter. We introduce a partially supervised setting that significantly reduces the supervision level required for generic object counting. We propose two novel frameworks, named lower-count (LC) and reduced lower-count (RLC), to enable object counting under this setting. Our frameworks are built on a novel dual-branch architecture that has an image classification and a density branch. Our LC framework reduces the annotation cost due to multiple instances in an image by using only lower-count supervision for all object categories. Our RLC framework further reduces the annotation cost arising from large numbers of object categories in a dataset by only using lower-count supervision for a subset of categories and class-labels for the remaining ones. The RLC framework extends our dual-branch LC framework with a novel weight modulation layer and a category-independent density map prediction. Experiments are performed on COCO, Visual Genome and PASCAL 2007 datasets. Our frameworks perform on par with state-of-the-art approaches using higher levels of supervision. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of our LC supervised density map for image-level supervised instance segmentation."}}

The high intrinsic similarities between the target object and the background make COD far more challenging than the traditional object detection task. To address this issue, we elaborately collect a novel dataset, called COD10K, which comprises 10,000 images covering camouflaged objects in various natural scenes, over 78 object categories. All the images are densely annotated with category, bounding-box, object-/instance-level, and matting-level labels. This dataset could serve as a catalyst for progressing many vision tasks, e.g., localization, segmentation, and alpha-matting, etc. In addition, we develop a simple but effective framework for COD, termed Search Identification Network (SINet). Without any bells and whistles, SINet outperforms various state-of-the-art object detection baselines on all datasets tested, making it a robust, general framework that can help facilitate future research in COD. Finally, we conduct a large-scale COD study, evaluating 13 cutting-edge models, providing some interesting findings, and showing several potential applications. Our research offers the community an opportunity to explore more in this new field. The code will be available at https://github.com/DengPingFan/SINet/."}}

This indicates that global scene context is essential, despite the seemingly bottom-up nature of the problem. This may be explained by the fact that context knowledge can adapt and improve local feature extraction to a given scene. In this paper, we therefore investigate the role of global context for crowd counting. Specifically, a pure transformer is used to extract features with global information from overlapping image patches. Inspired by classification, we add a context token to the input sequence, to facilitate information exchange with tokens corresponding to image patches throughout transformer layers. Due to the fact that transformers do not explicitly model the tried-and-true channel-wise interactions, we propose a token-attention module (TAM) to recalibrate encoded features through channel-wise attention informed by the context token. Beyond that, it is adopted to predict the total person count of the image through regression-token module (RTM). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, including ShanghaiTech, UCF-QNRF, JHU-CROWD++ and NWPU. On the large-scale JHU-CROWD++ dataset, our method improves over the previous best results by 26.9% and 29.9% in terms of MAE and MSE, respectively."}}

However, such an assumption is rarely applicable for real images whose blur kernels are usually spatially variant due to factors such as object motion and out-of-focus. Hence, existing blind SR methods would inevitably give rise to poor performance in real applications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a mutual affine network (MANet) for spatially variant kernel estimation. Specifically, MANet has two distinctive features. First, it has a moderate receptive field so as to keep the locality of degradation. Second, it involves a new mutual affine convolution (MAConv) layer that enhances feature expressiveness without increasing receptive field, model size and computation burden. This is made possible through exploiting channel interdependence, which applies each channel split with an affine transformation module whose input are the rest channel splits. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real images show that the proposed MANet not only performs favorably for both spatially variant and invariant kernel estimation, but also leads to state-of-the-art blind SR performance when combined with non-blind SR methods."}}

While state-of-the-art image restoration methods are based on convolutional neural networks, few attempts have been made with Transformers which show impressive performance on high-level vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline model SwinIR for image restoration based on the Swin Transformer. SwinIR consists of three parts: shallow feature extraction, deep feature extraction and high-quality image reconstruction. In particular, the deep feature extraction module is composed of several residual Swin Transformer blocks (RSTB), each of which has several Swin Transformer layers together with a residual connection. We conduct experiments on three representative tasks: image super-resolution (including classical, lightweight and real-world image super-resolution), image denoising (including grayscale and color image denoising) and JPEG compression artifact reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on different tasks by $\\textbf{up to 0.14$\\sim$0.45dB}$, while the total number of parameters can be reduced by $\\textbf{up to 67%}$."}}
