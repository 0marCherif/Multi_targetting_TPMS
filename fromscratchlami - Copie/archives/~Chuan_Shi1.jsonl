In this paper, we study the problem of self-supervised HGNNs and propose a novel co-contrastive learning mechanism for HGNNs, named HeCo. Different from traditional contrastive learning which only focuses on contrasting positive and negative samples, HeCo employs cross-view contrastive mechanism. Specifically, two views of a HIN (network schema and meta-path views) are proposed to learn node embeddings, so as to capture both of local and high-order structures simultaneously. Then the cross-view contrastive learning, as well as a view mask mechanism, is proposed, which is able to extract the positive and negative embeddings from two views. This enables the two views to collaboratively supervise each other and finally learn high-level node embeddings. Moreover, to further boost the performance of HeCo, two additional methods are designed to generate harder negative samples with high quality. Besides the invariant factors, view-specific factors complementally provide the diverse structure information between different nodes, which also should be contained into the final embeddings. Therefore, we need to further explore each view independently and propose a modified model, called HeCo++. Specifically, HeCo++ conducts hierarchical contrastive learning, including cross-view and intra-view contrasts, which aims to enhance the mining of respective structures."}}

Current GSL methods mainly learn an optimal graph structure (final view) from single or multiple information sources (basic views), however the theoretical guidance on what is the optimal graph structure is still unexplored. In essence, an optimal graph structure should only contain the information about tasks while compress redundant noise as much as possible, which is defined as \"minimal sufficient structure\", so as to maintain the accurancy and robustness. How to obtain such structure in a principled way? In this paper, we theoretically prove that if we optimize basic views and final view based on mutual information, and keep their performance on labels simultaneously, the final view will be a minimal sufficient structure. With this guidance, we propose a Compact GSL architecture by MI compression, named CoGSL. Specifically, two basic views are extracted from original graph as two inputs of the model, which are refinedly reestimated by a view estimator. Then, we propose an adaptive technique to fuse estimated views into the final view. Furthermore, we maintain the performance of estimated views and the final view and reduce the mutual information of every two views. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of CoGSL, we conduct extensive experiments on several datasets under clean and attacked conditions, which demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of CoGSL."}}

In the field of drug engineering, the essential task is designing a novel antibody to make sure its paratope (substructures in the antibody) binds to the epitope of the specific antigen with high precision. Also, understanding the structure of antibody and its paratope can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of the function. Therefore, antibody structure prediction has always been a highly valuable problem for drug discovery. AlphaFold2, a breakthrough in the field of structural biology, provides a feasible solution to predict protein structure based on protein sequences and computationally expensive coevolutionary multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). However, the computational efficiency and undesirable prediction accuracy on antibody, especially on the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibody limit its applications on the industrially high-throughput drug design. In this paper, we present a novel method named xTrimoABFold to predict antibody structure from antibody sequence based on a pretrained antibody language model (ALM) as well as homologous templates, which are searched from protein database (PDB) via fast and cheap algorithms. xTrimoABFold outperforms the MSA-based AlphaFold2 and the protein language model based SOTAs, e.g., OmegaFold, HelixFold-Single and IgFold with a large significant margin (30+% improvement on RMSD) while performs 151x faster than AlphaFold2. To the best of our knowledge, xTrimoABFold is the best antibody structure predictor to date in the world."}}

Rigid protein-protein docking, assuming no conformational change within proteins, predicts the 3D structure of protein complexes from unbound chains. According to the number of chains, rigid docking is divided into binary complex setting that contains only two chains, and more ubiquitous multi-chain complex setting. Most existing docking methods are tailored for binary complexes, and are computationally expensive or not guaranteed to find accurate complex structures. In this paper, we propose a novel model xTrimoDock for the docking of multi-chain complexes, which can simultaneously employ information from both sequence modality and structure modality of involved protein chains. Specifically, xTrimoDock leverages a cross-modal transformer to integrate representations from protein sequences and structures, and conducts a multi-step prediction of rotations and translations to accomplish the multi-chain docking. Extensive experiments reflect the promising results of the proposed model in the harder multi-chain complex setting."}}

However, most existing spectral graph filters are scalar-to-scalar functions, i.e., mapping a single eigenvalue to a single filtered value, thus ignoring the global pattern of the spectrum. Furthermore, these filters are often constructed based on some fixed-order polynomials, which have limited expressiveness and flexibility. To tackle these issues, we introduce Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter. We also design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution. Importantly, Specformer is equivariant to permutation. By stacking multiple Specformer layers, one can build a powerful spectral GNN. On synthetic datasets, we show that our Specformer can better recover ground-truth spectral filters than other spectral GNNs. Extensive experiments of both node-level and graph-level tasks on real-world graph datasets show that our Specformer outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and learns meaningful spectrum patterns.

Graph contrastive learning (GCL), which marries the power of GCN and contrastive learning, has emerged as a promising self-supervised approach for learning node representations. How does GCL behave in terms of structural fairness? Surprisingly, we find that representations obtained by GCL methods are already fairer to degree bias than those learned by GCN. We theoretically show that this fairness stems from intra-community concentration and inter-community scatter properties of GCL, resulting in a much clear community structure to drive low-degree nodes away from the community boundary. Based on our theoretical analysis, we further devise a novel graph augmentation method, called GRAph contrastive learning for DEgree bias (GRADE), which applies different strategies to low- and high-degree nodes. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and evaluation protocols validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

However, by presenting a graph classification investigation on the training graphs with severe bias, surprisingly, we discover that GNNs always tend to explore the spurious correlations to make decision, even if the causal correlation always exists. This implies that existing GNNs trained on such biased datasets will suffer from poor generalization capability.  By analyzing this problem in a causal view, we find that disentangling and decorrelating the causal and bias latent variables from the biased graphs are both crucial for debiasing. Inspired by this, we propose a general disentangled GNN framework to learn the causal substructure and bias substructure, respectively. Particularly,  we design a parameterized edge mask generator to explicitly split the input graph into causal and bias subgraphs. Then two GNN modules supervised by causal/bias-aware loss functions respectively are trained to encode causal and bias subgraphs into their corresponding representations. With the disentangled representations, we synthesize the counterfactual unbiased training samples to further decorrelate causal and bias variables. Moreover, to better benchmark the severe bias problem, we construct three new graph datasets, which have controllable bias degrees and are easier to visualize and explain. Experimental results well demonstrate that our approach achieves superior generalization performance over existing baselines. Furthermore, owing to the learned edge mask, the proposed model has appealing interpretability and transferability."}}

Despite the proliferation of various graph augmentation strategies, there are still some fundamental questions unclear: what information is essentially learned by GCL? Are there some general augmentation rules behind different augmentations? If so, what are they and what insights can they bring? In this paper, we answer these questions by establishing the connection between GCL and graph spectrum. By an experimental investigation in spectral domain, we firstly find the General grAph augMEntation (GAME) rule for GCL, i.e., the difference of the high-frequency parts between two augmented graphs should be larger than that of low-frequency parts. This rule reveals the fundamental principle to revisit the current graph augmentations and design new effective graph augmentations. Then we theoretically prove that GCL is able to learn the invariance information by contrastive invariance theorem, together with our GAME rule, for the first time, we uncover that the learned representations by GCL essentially encode the low-frequency information, which explains why GCL works. Guided by this rule, we propose a spectral graph contrastive learning module (SpCo), which is a general and GCL-friendly plug-in. We combine it with different existing GCL models, and extensive experiments well demonstrate that it can further improve the performances of a wide variety of different GCL methods."}}
