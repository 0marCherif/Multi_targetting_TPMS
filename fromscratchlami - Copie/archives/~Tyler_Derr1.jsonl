Nevertheless, most of the existing message-passing mechanisms for recommendation are directly inherited from GNNs without scrutinizing whether the captured collaborative effect would benefit the prediction of user preferences. In this paper, we first analyze how message-passing captures the collaborative effect in predicting user preferences and propose a recommendation-oriented topological metric, Common Interacted Ratio (CIR), which measures the level of interaction between a specific neighbor of a node with the rest of its neighbors. By empirically demonstrating the benefits of leveraging collaborations from neighbors with higher CIR, we propose a recommendation-tailored GNN, Collaboration-Aware Graph Convolution Network (CAGCN), that goes beyond 1-WL test in distinguishing non-bipartite-subgraph-isomorphic graphs. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that the best CAGCN variant outperforms the most representative GNN-based recommendation model, LightGCN, by nearly 10% in Recall@20 and also achieves more than 80% speedup."}}

Despite the recent success of applying graph neural network to this task, important chemical information such as molecular chirality is ignored. To fill this crucial gap, we propose Molecular Kernel Graph Neural Network (MolKGNN) for molecular representation learning, which features conformation invariance, chirality-awareness, and interpretability. For our MolKGNN, we first design a molecular graph convolution to capture the chemical pattern by comparing the atom's similarity with the learnable molecular kernels. Furthermore, we propagate the similarity score to capture the higher-order chemical pattern. To assess the method, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation with nine well-curated datasets spanning numerous important drug targets that feature realistic high class imbalance and it demonstrates the superiority of MolKGNN. Meanwhile, the learned kernels identify patterns that agree with domain knowledge, confirming MolKGNN's pragmatic interpretability."}}

GNNs explore the graph structure and node features by aggregating and transforming information within node neighborhoods. However, through theoretical and empirical analysis, we reveal that the aggregation process of GNNs tends to destroy node similarity in the original feature space. There are many scenarios where node similarity plays a crucial role. Thus, it has motivated the proposed framework SimP-GCN that can effectively and efficiently preserve node similarity while exploiting graph structure. Specifically, to balance information from graph structure and node features, we propose a feature similarity preserving aggregation which adaptively integrates graph structure and node features. Furthermore, we employ self-supervised learning to explicitly capture the complex feature similarity and dissimilarity relations between nodes. We validate the effectiveness of SimP-GCN on seven benchmark datasets including three assortative and four disassorative graphs. The results demonstrate that SimP-GCN outperforms representative baselines. Further probe shows various advantages of the proposed framework. The implementation of SimP-GCN is available at https://github.com/ChandlerBang/SimP-GCN."}}

Most GNNs follow a message-passing scheme where the node representations are updated by aggregating and transforming the information from the neighborhood. Meanwhile, they adopt the same strategy in aggregating the information from different feature dimensions. However, suggested by social dimension theory and spectral embedding, there are potential benefits to treat the dimensions differently during the aggregation process. In this work, we investigate to enable heterogeneous contributions of feature dimensions in GNNs. In particular, we propose a general graph feature gating network (GFGN) based on the graph signal denoising problem and then correspondingly introduce three graph filters under GFGN to allow different levels of contributions from feature dimensions. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frameworks."}}

While in the past political entities were primarily utilizing newspaper and later television to inform the public, with the rise of the Internet and online social media, the political arena has transformed into a more complex structure. Now, more than ever, people express themselves online while mainstream news agencies attempt to seize the power of the Internet to spread their agenda. To grasp the political coexistence of mainstream media and online social media, in this paper, we perform an analysis between these two sources of information in the context of the U.S. 2020 presidential election. In particular, we collect data during the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries pertaining to the candidates and by analyzing this data, we highlight similarities and differences between these two main types of sources, detect the potential impact they have on each other, and understand how this impact relationship can change over time. To supplement these two main sources and to establish a baseline, we also include Google Trends search results and Polling results for each of the candidates that are being analyzed."}}

Then, once paired with domain knowledge, we can seek to understand the past, make predictions about the future, and ultimately take actionable steps towards improving our society. Thus, due to the fact that much of today's big data can be represented as graphs, emphasis is being taken to harness the natural structure of data through network analysis. Furthermore, many real-world networks can be better represented as signed networks, e.g., in an online social network such as Facebook, friendships can be represented as positive links while negative links can represent blocked users. Hence, due to signed networks being ubiquitous, in this work we seek to provide a fundamental background into the domain, a hierarchical categorization of existing work highlighting both seminal and state of the art, provide a curated collection of signed network datasets, and discuss important future directions."}}

The diffusion of information from online social media to the classroom is significantly faster than traditional curriculum-based approaches. However, this is contingent upon how well teachers across an online social media network are connected. To understand this, we perform a thorough and large-scale investigation of teacher connections in online social media, which is lacking in the literature. To make this feasible, we construct a large dataset of teachers on Pinterest, an image-based popular online social media. Our dataset includes 540 teachers across 5 states and 48 districts, thousands of connections they have established (either with their peers or some other Pinterest users), and all the resources they have shared in their accounts. Then, taking into account some crucial teacher-related attributes (e.g., their districts, grade levels, etc), we characterize direct and indirect teacher connections. Moreover, we compare the physical (face to face) and virtual (Pinterest) network of our surveyed teachers using several graph-related metrics. The finding in this study can serve as a basis to investigate teachers on social media in a deeper manner."}}

In fact, many of these state-of-the-art techniques have been deep learning based. Recent studies have shown that these deep learning models (in particular for recommendation systems) are vulnerable to attacks, such as data poisoning, which generates users to promote a selected set of items. However, more recently, defense strategies have been developed to detect these generated users with fake profiles. Thus, advanced injection attacks of creating more `realistic' user profiles to promote a set of items is still a key challenge in the domain of deep learning based recommender systems. In this work, we present our framework CopyAttack, which is a reinforcement learning based black-box attack method that harnesses real users from a source domain by copying their profiles into the target domain with the goal of promoting a subset of items. CopyAttack is constructed to both efficiently and effectively learn policy gradient networks that first select, and then further refine/craft, user profiles from the source domain to ultimately copy into the target domain. CopyAttack's goal is to maximize the hit ratio of the targeted items in the Top-$k$ recommendation list of the users in the target domain. We have conducted experiments on two real-world datasets and have empirically verified the effectiveness of our proposed framework and furthermore performed a thorough model analysis."}}

However, in many real-world applications such as image recognition, the collected data samples often involve more than two categories. Moreover, only a small portion of the collected samples might have associated labels due to some practical reasons, and these labeled samples cannot always cover all the categories. We refer to this type of data as incomplete labeled data. In this paper, we first formally define the incomplete labeled data learning problem and then aim to tackle it via adversarial data generation. Specifically, we propose a novel generative framework LILA, which can produce synthetic labeled samples for both partially labeled categories and unlabeled categories. To enforce that the generated samples for unlabeled categories can associate with correct labels, we integrate two active learning processes into the LILA framework for selecting unlabeled samples in the collected sample set to query their labels effectively. After LILA has been well trained, a classifier can be trained on the balanced augmented data set consisting of both generated and original labeled samples. Extensive experiments on real image data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We release the implementation of the proposed framework via https://github.com/wentao-repo/LILA."}}

In fact, online social networks can be best modeled as signed networks, where opinions in the form of positive and negative links can exist between users, such as our friends and foes (e.g., \u201cunfriended\u201d users), respectively. Furthermore, users can also express their opinions to content generated by others through online social interactions, such as commenting or rating. Intuitively, these two types of opinions in the form of links and interactions should be related. For example, users\u2019 interactions are likely to be positive (or negative) to those they have positively (or negatively) established links with. Similarly, we tend to establish positive (or negative) links with those whose generated content we frequently positively (or negatively) interact with online. Hence, in this paper, we first verify these assumptions by understanding the correlation between these two types of opinions from both a local and global perspective. Then, we propose a framework that jointly solves the link and interaction polarity prediction problem based on our newly found understanding of how these two problems are correlated. We ultimately perform experiments on a real-world signed network to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach to help mitigate both the data sparsity and cold-start problems found in the two tasks of link and interaction polarity prediction."}}
