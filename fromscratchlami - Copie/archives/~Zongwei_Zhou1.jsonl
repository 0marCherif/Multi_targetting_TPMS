However, we uncover a striking contradiction to this promise: at the first few choices, active learning fails to select data as efficiently as random selection. We identify this as the cold start problem in active learning, caused by a biased and outlier initial query. This paper seeks to address the cold start problem and develops a novel active querying strategy, named HaCon, that can exploit the three advantages of contrastive learning: (1) no annotation is required; (2) label diversity is ensured by pseudo-labels to mitigate bias; (3) typical data is determined by contrastive features to reduce outliers. Experiments on three public medical datasets show that HaCon not only significantly outperforms existing active querying strategies but also surpasses random selection by a large margin.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can potentially assist radiologists in detecting pancreatic tumors at an early stage. Training AI models require a vast number of annotated examples, but the availability of CT scans obtaining early-stage tumors is constrained. This is because early-stage tumors may not cause any symptoms, which can delay detection, and the tumors are relatively small and may be almost invisible to human eyes on CT scans. To address this issue, we develop a tumor synthesis method that can synthesize enormous examples of small pancreatic tumors in the healthy pancreas without the need for manual annotation. Our experiments demonstrate that the overall detection rate of pancreatic tumors, measured by Sensitivity and Specificity, achieved by AI trained on synthetic tumors is comparable to that of real tumors. More importantly, our method shows a much higher detection rate for small tumors. We further investigate the per-voxel segmentation performance of pancreatic tumors if AI is trained on a combination of CT scans with synthetic tumors and CT scans with annotated large tumors at an advanced stage. Finally, we show that synthetic tumors improve AI generalizability in tumor detection and localization when processing CT scans from different hospitals. Overall, our proposed tumor synthesis method has immense potential to improve the early detection of pancreatic cancer, leading to better patient outcomes."}}

For example, annotating an abdominal organ requires an estimated rate of 30-60 minutes per CT volume based on the expertise of an annotator and the size, visibility, and complexity of the organ. Therefore, publicly available datasets for multi-organ segmentation are often limited in data size and organ diversity. This paper proposes a systematic and efficient method to expedite the annotation process for organ segmentation. We have created the largest multi-organ dataset (by far) with the spleen, liver, kidneys, stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, aorta, and IVC annotated in 8,448 CT volumes, equating to 3.2 million slices. The conventional annotation methods would take an experienced annotator up to 1,600 weeks (or roughly 30.8 years) to complete this task. In contrast, our annotation method has accomplished this task in three weeks (based on an 8-hour workday, five days a week) while maintaining a similar or even better annotation quality. This achievement is attributed to three unique properties of our method: (1) label bias reduction using multiple pre-trained segmentation models, (2) effective error detection in the model predictions, and (3) attention guidance for annotators to make corrections on the most salient errors. Furthermore, we summarize the taxonomy of common errors made by AI algorithms and annotators. This allows for continuous refinement of both AI and annotations and significantly reduces the annotation costs required to create large-scale datasets for a wider variety of medical imaging tasks."}}

However, ViT has shown inferior performance to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on medical tasks due to its data-hungry nature and the lack of an-notated medical data. In this paper, we pre-train ViTs on 266,340 chest X-rays using Masked Autoencoders (MAE) which reconstruct missing pixels from a small part of each image. For comparison, CNNs are also pre-trained on the same 266,340 X-rays using advanced self-supervised methods (e.g. MoCo v2). The results show that our pre-trained ViT performs comparably (sometimes better) to the state-of-the-art CNN (DenseNet-121) for multi-label thorax dis-ease classification. This performance is attributed to the strong recipes extracted from our empirical studies for pre-training and fine-tuning ViT. The pre-training recipe signifies that medical reconstruction requires a much smaller proportion of an image (10% vs. 25%) and a more moderate random resized crop range (0.5\u223c1.0 vs. 0.2\u223c1.0) compared with natural imaging. Furthermore, we remark that in-domain transfer learning is preferred whenever possible. The fine-tuning recipe discloses that layer-wise LR decay, RandAug magnitude, and DropPath rate are significant factors to consider. We hope that this study can direct future research on the application of Transformers to a larger variety of medical imaging tasks."}}

To address this problem, we propose a new initiative, \"Label-Assemble\", that aims to un-leash the full potential of partial labels from an assembly of public datasets. We discovered that learning from negative examples facilitates both computer-aided disease diagnosis and detection. This discovery will be particularly crucial in novel disease diagnosis, where positive examples are hard to collect, yet negative examples are relatively easier to assemble. For example, assembling existing labels from NIH ChestX-ray14 (available since 2017) significantly improves the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis from 96.3% to 99.3%. In addition to diagnosis, assembling labels can also improve disease detection, e.g., the detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) can greatly benefit from leveraging the labels of Cysts and PanNets (two other types of pancreatic abnormalities), increasing sensitivity from 52.1% to 84.0% while maintaining a high specificity of 98.0%.

However, due to the small size and partially labeled problem of each dataset, as well as a limited investigation of diverse types of tumors, the resulting models are often limited to segmenting specific organs/tumors and ignore the semantics of anatomical structures, nor can they be extended to novel domains. To address these issues, we propose the CLIP-Driven Universal Model, which incorporates text embedding learned from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to segmentation models. This CLIP-based label encoding captures anatomical relationships, enabling the model to learn a structured feature embedding and segment 25 organs and 6 types of tumors. The proposed model is developed from an assembly of 14 datasets, using a total of 3,410 CT scans for training and then evaluated on 6,162 external CT scans from 3 additional datasets. We rank first on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) public leaderboard and achieve state-of-the-art results on Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV). Additionally, the Universal Model is computationally more efficient (6x faster) compared with dataset-specific models, generalized better to CT scans from varying sites, and shows stronger transfer learning performance on novel tasks."}}

Our synthetic tumors have two intriguing advantages: (I) realistic in shape and texture, which even medical professionals can confuse with real tumors; (II) effective for training AI models, which can perform liver tumor segmentation similarly to the model trained on real tumors -- this result is exciting because no existing work, using synthetic tumors only, has thus far reached a similar or even close performance to real tumors. This result also implies that manual efforts for annotating tumors voxel by voxel (which took years to create) can be significantly reduced in the future. Moreover, our synthetic tumors can automatically generate many examples of small (or even tiny) synthetic tumors and have the potential to improve the success rate of detecting small liver tumors, which is critical for detecting the early stages of cancer. In addition to enriching the training data, our synthesizing strategy also enables us to rigorously assess the AI robustness."}}

However, due to privacy regulations, accessing previous data and annotations can be problematic in the medical domain. This poses a significant barrier to preserving the high segmentation accuracy of the old classes when learning from new classes because of the catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate that simply using high-quality pseudo labels can fairly mitigate this problem in the setting of organ segmentation. Furthermore, we put forward an innovative architecture designed specifically for continuous organ and tumor segmentation, which incurs minimal computational overhead. Our proposed design involves replacing the conventional output layer with a suite of lightweight, class-specific heads, thereby offering the flexibility to accommodate newly emerging classes. These heads enable independent predictions for newly introduced and previously learned classes, effectively minimizing the impact of new classes on old ones during the course of continual learning. We further propose incorporating Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) embeddings into the organ-specific heads. These embeddings encapsulate the semantic information of each class, informed by extensive image-text co-training. The proposed method is evaluated on both in-house and public abdominal CT datasets under organ and tumor segmentation tasks. Empirical results suggest that the proposed design improves the segmentation performance of a baseline neural network on newly-introduced and previously-learned classes along the learning trajectory."}}

Despite their success, these models have two limitations: (1) their optimal depth is apriori unknown, requiring extensive architecture search or inefficient ensemble of models of varying depths; and (2) their skip connections impose an unnecessarily restrictive fusion scheme, forcing aggregation only at the same-scale feature maps of the encoder and decoder sub-networks. To overcome these two limitations, we propose UNet++, a new neural architecture for semantic and instance segmentation, by (1) alleviating the unknown network depth with an efficient ensemble of U-Nets of varying depths, which partially share an encoder and co-learn simultaneously using deep supervision; (2) redesigning skip connections to aggregate features of varying semantic scales at the decoder sub-networks, leading to a highly flexible feature fusion scheme; and (3) devising a pruning scheme to accelerate the inference speed of UNet++. We have evaluated UNet++ using six different medical image segmentation datasets, covering multiple imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electron microscopy (EM), and demonstrating that (1) UNet++ consistently outperforms the baseline models for the task of semantic segmentation across different datasets and backbone architectures; (2) UNet++ enhances segmentation quality of varying-size objects-an improvement over the fixed-depth U-Net; (3) Mask RCNN++ (Mask R-CNN with UNet++ design) outperforms the original Mask R-CNN for the task of instance segmentation; and (4) pruned UNet++ models achieve significant speedup while showing only modest performance degradation.
