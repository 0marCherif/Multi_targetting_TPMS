In this task, several deep generative modeling methods have been proposed and demonstrated their usefulness, e.g., generative adversarial imputation networks. Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity because of their effectiveness in the generative modeling task in images, texts, audio, etc. To our knowledge, less attention has been paid on the investigation of the effectiveness of diffusion models for missing value imputation in tabular data. Based on a recent development of diffusion models for time-series data imputation, we propose a diffusion model approach called ``Conditional Score-based Diffusion Models for Tabular data'' (CSDI_T). To effectively handle categorical variables and numerical variables simultaneously, we investigate three techniques: one-hot encoding, analog bit encoding, and feature tokenization. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of CSDI_T compared with well-known existing methods, and also emphasized the importance of the categorical embedding techniques."}}

In this paper, we first theoretically show that robust imitation learning can be achieved by optimizing a classification risk with a symmetric loss. Based on this theoretical finding, we then propose a new imitation learning method that optimizes the classification risk by effectively combining pseudo-labeling with co-training. Unlike existing methods, our method does not require additional labels or strict assumptions about noise distributions. Experimental results on continuous-control benchmarks show that our method is more robust compared to state-of-the-art methods."}}

Examples of well-known surrogate losses for binary classification include the logistic loss, hinge loss, and sigmoid loss. It is known that the choice of a surrogate loss can highly influence the performance of the trained classifier and therefore it should be carefully chosen. Recently, surrogate losses that satisfy a certain symmetric condition (aka., symmetric losses) have demonstrated their usefulness in learning from corrupted labels. In this article, we provide an overview of symmetric losses and their applications. First, we review how a symmetric loss can yield robust classification from corrupted labels in balanced error rate (BER) minimization and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) maximization. Then, we demonstrate how the robust AUC maximization method can benefit natural language processing in the problem where we want to learn only from relevant keywords and unlabeled documents. Finally, we conclude this article by discussing future directions, including potential applications of symmetric losses for reliable machine learning and the design of non-symmetric losses that can benefit from the symmetric condition."}}

A well-known example is multiple instance learning (MIL). In this paper, we extend MIL beyond binary classification to other problems such as multiclass classification and regression. We present a general probabilistic framework that accommodates a variety of aggregate observations, e.g., pairwise similarity/triplet comparison for classification and mean/difference/rank observation for regression. Simple maximum likelihood solutions can be applied to various differentiable models such as deep neural networks and gradient boosting machines. Moreover, we develop the concept of consistency up to an equivalence relation to characterize our estimator and show that it has nice convergence properties under mild assumptions. Experiments on three problem settings -- classification via triplet comparison and regression via mean/rank observation indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

If the black-box function varies with time, then time-varying Bayesian optimization is a promising framework. However, a drawback with current methods is in the assumption that the evaluation time for every observation is constant, which can be unrealistic for many practical applications, e.g., recommender systems and environmental monitoring. As a result, the performance of current methods can be degraded when this assumption is violated. To cope with this problem, we propose a novel time-varying Bayesian optimization algorithm that can effectively handle the non-constant evaluation time. Furthermore, we theoretically establish a regret bound of our algorithm. Our bound elucidates that a pattern of the evaluation time sequence can hugely affect the difficulty of the problem. We also provide experimental results to validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

Unlike fully labeled data, triplet comparison data can be collected in a more accurate and human-friendly way. Although learning from triplet comparison data has been considered in many applications, an important fundamental question of whether we can learn a classifier only from triplet comparison data without all the labels has remained unanswered. In this letter, we give a positive answer to this important question by proposing an unbiased estimator for the classification risk under the empirical risk minimization framework. Since the proposed method is based on the empirical risk minimization framework, it inherently has the advantage that any surrogate loss function and any model, including neural networks, can be easily applied. Furthermore, we theoretically establish an estimation error bound for the proposed empirical risk minimizer. Finally, we provide experimental results to show that our method empirically works well and outperforms various baseline methods."}}

In this paper, we first prove that the focal loss is classification-calibrated, i.e., its minimizer surely yields the Bayes-optimal classifier and thus the use of the focal loss in classification can be theoretically justified. However, we also prove a negative fact that the focal loss is not strictly proper, i.e., the confidence score of the classifier obtained by focal loss minimization does not match the true class-posterior probability and thus it is not reliable as a class-posterior probability estimator. To mitigate this problem, we next prove that a particular closed-form transformation of the confidence score allows us to recover the true class-posterior probability. Through experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed transformation significantly improves the accuracy of class-posterior probability estimation."}}
