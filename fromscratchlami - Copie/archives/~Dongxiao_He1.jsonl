Graph neural networks for HIN embeddings typically adopt a hierarchical attention (including node-level and meta-path-level attentions) to capture the information from meta-path-based neighbors. However, this complicated attention structure often cannot achieve the function of selecting meta-paths due to severe overfitting. Moreover, when propagating information, these methods do not distinguish direct (one-hop) meta-paths from indirect (multi-hop) ones. But from the perspective of network science, direct relationships are often believed to be more essential, which can only be used to model direct information propagation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel neural network method via <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">implicitly</i> utilizing attention and meta-paths, which can relieve the severe overfitting brought by the current over-parameterized attention mechanisms on HIN. We first use the multi-layer graph convolutional network (GCN) framework, which performs a discriminative aggregation at each layer, along with stacking the information propagation of direct linked meta-paths layer-by-layer, realizing the function of attentions for selecting meta-paths in an indirect way. We then give an effective relaxation and improvement via introducing a new propagation operation which can be separated from aggregation. That is, we first model the whole propagation process with well-defined probabilistic diffusion dynamics, and then introduce a random graph-based constraint which allows it to reduce noise with the increase of layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the new approach over state-of-the-art methods."}}

However, graphs in the real world are usually text-rich, implying that valuable semantic structures need to be considered carefully. Existing GNNs for text-rich networks typically treat the text as attribute words alone, which inevitably leads to the loss of important semantic structures, limiting the representation capability of GNNs. To solve this limitation, we propose AS-GNN, an end-to-end adaptive GNN architecture via unified modelling of semantic structure and network propagation on text-rich networks. Specifically, we utilize semantic structure modelling part to capture both the local word-sequence and the global topic semantic structures from text. We then augment the original text-rich network into a tri-typed heterogeneous network (including document nodes, word nodes, and topic nodes) and accordingly design a semantic-aware propagation of information by introducing a discriminative convolutional mechanism. We further train these two parts together by leveraging distribution sharing and joint training strategies, so as to adaptively generate an appropriate network structure aiming at the learning objectives. In addition, we present a simplified semantic architecture S-GNN, which adopts the cascaded \u201cStructure-GNN\u201d pattern, to promote the efficiency of the model and be easily combined with existing GNNs. Extensive experiments on text-rich networks demonstrate the superiority of our new architectures over state of the arts. Meanwhile, such architectures can also be applied to e-commerce search scenes, and experiments on a real e-commerce problem from JD further illustrate the effectiveness of AS-GNN over the baselines."}}

Community detection has been extensively studied in and broadly applied to many real-world network problems. Classical approaches to community detection typically utilize probabilistic graphical models and adopt a variety of prior knowledge to infer community structures. As the problems that network methods try to solve and the network data to be analyzed become increasingly more sophisticated, new approaches have also been proposed and developed, particularly those that utilize deep learning and convert networked data into low dimensional representation. Despite all the recent advancement, there is still a lack of insightful understanding of the theoretical and methodological underpinning of community detection, which will be critically important for future development of the area of network analysis. In this paper, we develop and present a unified architecture of network community-finding methods to characterize the state-of-the-art of the field of community detection. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing community detection methods and introduce a new taxonomy that divides the existing methods into two categories, namely probabilistic graphical model and deep learning. We then discuss in detail the main idea behind each method in the two categories. Furthermore, to promote future development of community detection, we release several benchmark datasets from several problem domains and highlight their applications to various network analysis tasks. We conclude with discussions of the challenges of the field and suggestions of possible directions for future research."}}

Unfortunately, most of them suffer a common and fatal drawback: irrelevant propagation to one node and in multi-channels. These two kinds of irrelevances make propagation weights in multi-channels free to be determined by the labeled data, and thus the GNNs are exposed to overfitting. To tackle this issue, a novel Orthogonal Propagation with Ego-Network modeling (OPEN) is proposed by modeling relevances between propagations. Specifically, the relevance between propagations to one node is modeled by whole ego-network modeling, while the relevance between propagations in multi-channels is modeled via diversity requirement. By interpreting the propagations to one node from the perspective of dimension reduction, propagation weights are inferred from principal components of the ego-network, which are orthogonal to each other. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations reveal four attractive characteristics of OPEN as modeling high-order relationships beyond pairwise one, preventing overfitting, robustness, and high efficiency.

Temporal networks are an important type of network whose topological structure changes over time. Compared with methods on static networks, temporal network embedding (TNE) methods are facing three challenges: 1) it cannot describe the temporal dependence across network snapshots; 2) the node embedding in the latent space fails to indicate changes in the network topology; and 3) it cannot avoid a lot of redundant computation via parameter inheritance on a series of snapshots. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel TNE method named temporal network embedding method based on the VAE framework (TVAE), which is based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) to capture the evolution of temporal networks for link prediction. It not only generates low-dimensional embedding vectors for nodes but also preserves the dynamic nonlinear features of temporal networks. Through the combination of a self-attention mechanism and recurrent neural networks, TVAE can update node representations and keep the temporal dependence of vectors over time. We utilize parameter inheritance to keep the new embedding close to the previous one, rather than explicitly using regularization, and thus, it is effective for large-scale networks. We evaluate our model and several baselines on synthetic data sets and real-world networks. The experimental results demonstrate that TVAE has superior performance and lower time cost compared with the baselines."}}

However, it also leads to serious over-smoothing issue by stacking many layers. Recently, many efforts have been paid to overcome this issue in semi-supervised learning. Unfortunately, it is more serious in unsupervised node representation learning task due to the lack of supervision information. Thus, most of the unsupervised or self-supervised GNNs often employ \\textit{one-layer GCN} as the encoder. Essentially, the over-smoothing issue is caused by the over-simplification of the existing message passing, which possesses two intrinsic limits: blind message and uniform passing. In this paper, a novel Diverse and Interactive Message Passing (DIMP) is proposed for self-supervised learning by overcoming these limits. Firstly, to prevent the message from blindness and make it interactive between two connected nodes, the message is determined by both the two connected nodes instead of the attributes of one node. Secondly, to prevent the passing from uniformness and make it diverse over different attribute channels, different propagation weights are assigned to different elements in the message. To this end, a natural implementation of the message in DIMP is the element-wise product of the representations of two connected nodes. From the perspective of numerical optimization, the proposed DIMP is equivalent to performing an overlapping community detection via expectation-maximization (EM). Both the objective function of the community detection and the convergence of EM algorithm guarantee that DMIP can prevent from over-smoothing issue. Extensive evaluations on node-level and graph-level tasks demonstrate the superiority of DIMP on improving performance and overcoming over-smoothing issue."}}

Existing GNNs only focus on networks with first-order dependency, that is, conventional networks following the Markov property. However, many networks in real life own the higher-order dependency, such as click-stream data where the choice of the next page depends not only on the current page but also on previous pages. This kind of sequential data from complex systems (including natural dependencies) are often ignored by existing GNNs which makes them ineffective. To address this problem, we propose for the first time new GNN approaches for higher-order networks in this paper. First, we form sequence fragments by the current node and its predecessor nodes of different orders as candidate higher-order dependencies. When the fragment significantly affects the probability distribution of different successor nodes of the current node, we include it in the higher-order dependency set. We formulize the network with higher-order dependency as an augmented conventional first-order network, and then feed it into GNNs to derive network embeddings. Moreover, we further propose a new end-to-end GNN framework for dealing with higher-order networks directly in the model. Specifically, the higher-order dependency is used as the neighbor aggregation controller when the node is embedded and updated. In the graph convolutional layer, in addition to the first-order neighbor information, we also aggregate the middle node information from the higher-order dependency segment. We finally test the new approaches on three real networks with higher-order dependency, and compare with some state-of-the-art methods. The results show significant improvements of the new approaches which consider higher-order dependency."}}
