This has culminated in a $$\\frac{5}{3}$$ -approximation algorithm. However, the algorithm and its analysis are fairly involved and do not compare against the problem\u2019s well-known LP relaxation called the cut LP. In this paper, we propose a simple algorithm that, guided by an optimal solution to the cut LP, first selects a DFS tree and then finds a solution to MAP by computing an optimum augmentation of this tree. Using properties of extreme point solutions, we show that our algorithm always returns (in polynomial time) a better than 2-approximation when compared to the cut LP. We thereby also obtain an improved upper bound on the integrality gap of this natural relaxation."}}

[STOC'09] as a central special case of the general Santa Claus problem, which constitutes a notorious open question in approximation algorithms. In the former problem we are given a directed graph with sources and sinks and our goal is to find vertex disjoint arborescences rooted in the sources such that at each non-sink vertex of an arborescence the out-degree is at least $k$, where $k$ is to be maximized. This problem is of particular interest, since it appears to capture much of the difficulty of the Santa Claus problem: (1) like in the Santa Claus problem the configuration LP has a large integrality gap in this case and (2) previous progress by Bateni et al. was quickly generalized to the Santa Claus problem (Chakrabarty et al. [FOCS'09]). These results remain the state-of-the-art both for the Santa Claus problem and for max-min degree arborescence and they yield a polylogarithmic approximation in quasi-polynomial time. We present an exponential improvement to this, a $\\mathrm{poly}(\\log\\log n)$-approximation in quasi-polynomial time for the max-min degree arborescence problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of breaking the logarithmic barrier for a special case of the Santa Claus problem, where the configuration LP cannot be utilized."}}

In the mentioned problem $n$ unsplittable resources have to be assigned to $m$ players, each with a monotone submodular utility function $f_i$. The goal is to maximize $\\min_i f_i(S_i)$ where $S_1,\\dotsc,S_m$ is a partition of the resources. The result by Goemans et al. implies a polynomial time $O(n^{1/2 +\\varepsilon})$-approximation algorithm. Since then progress on this problem was limited to the linear case, that is, all $f_i$ are linear functions. In particular, a line of research has shown that there is a polynomial time constant approximation algorithm for linear valuation functions in the restricted assignment case. This is the special case where each player is given a set of desired resources $\\Gamma_i$ and the individual valuation functions are defined as $f_i(S) = f(S \\cap \\Gamma_i)$ for a global linear function $f$. This can also be interpreted as maximizing $\\min_i f(S_i)$ with additional assignment restrictions, i.e., resources can only be assigned to certain players. In this paper we make comparable progress for the submodular variant. Namely, if $f$ is a monotone submodular function, we can in polynomial time compute an $O(\\log\\log(n))$-approximate solution."}}

Our goal is to select a matching that covers all of $P$, but we allow each selected hyperedge to drop all but an $(1/\\alpha)$-fraction of its intersection with $R$ (thus relaxing the matching constraint). Here $\\alpha$ is to be minimized. We dub this problem the Combinatorial Santa Claus problem, since we show in this paper that this problem and the Santa Claus problem are almost equivalent in terms of their approximability. The non-trivial observation that any uniform regular hypergraph admits a relaxed matching for $\\alpha = O(1)$ was a major step in obtaining a constant approximation rate for a special case of the Santa Claus problem, which received great attention in literature. It is natural to ask if the uniformity condition can be omitted. Our main result is that every (non-uniform) regular hypergraph admits a relaxed matching for $\\alpha = O(\\log\\log(|R|))$, when all hyperedges are sufficiently large (a condition that is necessary). In particular, this implies an $O(\\log\\log(|R|))$-approximation algorithm for the Combinatorial Santa Claus problem with large hyperedges."}}

A classical algorithm consists in letting each vertex choose its side of the cut uniformly at random. This does not require any communication and achieves an approximation ratio of at least 1 2 in expectation. When the graph is d-regular and triangle-free, a slightly better approximation ratio can be achieved with a randomized algorithm running in a single round. Here, we investigate the round complexity of deterministic distributed algorithms for MaxCut in regular graphs. We first prove that if G is d-regular, with d even and fixed, no deterministic algorithm running in a constant number of rounds can achieve a constant approximation ratio. We then give a simple one-round deterministic algorithm achieving an approximation ratio of 1 d for d-regular graphs when d is odd. We show that this is best possible in several ways, and in particular no deterministic algorithm with approximation ratio 1 d + \u03f5 (with \u03f5 > 0 ) can run in a constant number of rounds. We also prove results of a similar flavor for the MaxDiCut problem in regular oriented graphs, where we want to maximize the number of arcs oriented from the left part to the right part of the cut."}}
