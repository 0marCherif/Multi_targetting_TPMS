It aims to learn task-independent, low-dimensional, and continuous vectors for nodes preserving both topology and attribute information. Most of the existing methods, such as random-walk based methods and GCNs, mainly focus on the local information, i.e., the attributes of the neighbours. Thus, they have been well studied for assortative networks (i.e., networks with communities) but ignored disassortative networks (i.e., networks with multipartite, hubs, and hybrid structures), which are common in the real world. To model both assortative and disassortative networks, we propose a block-based generative model for attributed network embedding from a probability perspective. Specifically, the nodes are assigned to several blocks wherein the nodes in the same block share the similar linkage patterns. These patterns can define assortative networks containing communities or disassortative networks with the multipartite, hub, or any hybrid structures. To preserve the attribute information, we assume that each node has a hidden embedding related to its assigned block. We use a neural network to characterize the nonlinearity between node embeddings and node attributes. We perform extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic attributed networks. The results show that our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art embedding methods for both clustering and classification tasks, especially on disassortative networks."}}

So far, various neural methods have been proposed to address the causal effect estimation based on observational data, where the counterfactual prediction commonly assumes the same availability of variables at both training and inference (i.e., runtime) stages. In reality, the accessibility of variables is usually impaired due mainly to privacy and ethical concerns, like medical records. We term this \\textit{runtime domain corruption}, which seriously challenges the generalizability of the trained counterfactual predictor on top of the existence of confoundedness and selection bias. To counteract runtime domain corruption, we subsume counterfactual prediction under the notion of domain adaptation. Specifically, we upper-bound the error w.r.t. the target domain (i.e., runtime covariates) by the sum of source domain error and inter-domain distribution distance. In addition, we build an adversarially unified variational causal effect model, named VEGAN, with a novel two-stage adversarial domain adaptation to implicitly reduce the distribution disparity between treated and control groups first, and between training and inference domains afterwards. With extensive experiments on causal inference benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines on individual-level causal effect estimation in the presence of runtime domain corruption."}}

Although this problem has been well researched from the view of imbalanced class samples, we further argue that graph neural networks (GNNs) expose a unique source of imbalance from the influenced nodes of different classes of labeled nodes, i.e., labeled nodes are imbalanced in terms of the number of nodes they influenced during the influence propagation in GNNs. To tackle this previously unexplored influence-imbalance issue, we connect social influence maximization with the imbalanced node classification problem, and propose balanced influence maximization (BIM). Specifically, BIM greedily assigns the pseudo label to the node which can maximize the number of influenced nodes in GNN training while making the influence of each class more balance. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in relieving influence-imbalance issue. For example, when training a GCN with the imbalance ratio of 0.1, BIM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline ReNode by 8.9\\%-13.5\\% in four public datasets in terms of the F1 score."}}

Recent APR works have achieved remarkable progress via applying deep learning (DL), particularly neural machine translation (NMT) techniques. However, we observe that existing DL-based APR models suffer from at least two severe drawbacks: (1) Most of them can only generate patches for a single programming language, as a result, to repair multiple languages, we have to build and train many repairing models. (2) Most of them are developed offline. Therefore, they won\u2019t function when there are new-coming requirements. To address the above problems, a T5-based APR framework equipped with continual learning ability across multiple programming languages is proposed, namely ContInual Repair aCross Programming LanguagEs (CIRCLE). Specifically, (1) CIRCLE utilizes a prompting function to narrow the gap between natural language processing (NLP) pre-trained tasks and APR. (2) CIRCLE adopts a difficulty-based rehearsal strategy to achieve lifelong learning for APR without access to the full historical data. (3) An elastic regularization method is employed to strengthen CIRCLE\u2019s continual learning ability further, preventing it from catastrophic forgetting. (4) CIRCLE applies a simple but effective re-repairing method to revise generated errors caused by crossing multiple programming languages. We train CIRCLE for four languages (i.e., C, JAVA, JavaScript, and Python) and evaluate it on five commonly used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that CIRCLE not only effectively and efficiently repairs multiple programming languages in continual learning settings, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance (e.g., fixes 64 Defects4J bugs) with a single repair model."}}

As a fundamental problem, the timely prediction of passenger demands in different regions is vital for effective traffic flow control and route planning. As both spatial and temporal patterns are indispensable passenger demand prediction, relevant research has evolved from pure time series to graph-structured data for modeling historical passenger demand data, where a snapshot graph is constructed for each time slot by connecting region nodes via different relational edges (origin-destination relationship, geographical distance, etc.). Consequently, the spatiotemporal passenger demand records naturally carry dynamic patterns in the constructed graphs, where the edges also encode important information about the directions and volume (i.e., weights) of passenger demands between two connected regions. aspects in the graph-structure data. representation for DDW is the key to solve the prediction problem. However, existing graph-based solutions fail to simultaneously consider those three crucial aspects of dynamic, directed, and weighted graphs, leading to limited expressiveness when learning graph representations for passenger demand prediction. Therefore, we propose a novel spatiotemporal graph attention network, namely Gallat (Graph prediction with allattention) as a solution. In Gallat, by comprehensively incorporating those three intrinsic properties of dynamic directed and weighted graphs, we build three attention layers to fully capture the spatiotemporal dependencies among different regions across all historical time slots. Moreover, the model employs a subtask to conduct pretraining so that it can obtain accurate results more quickly. We evaluate the proposed model on real-world datasets, and our experimental results demonstrate that Gallat outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches."}}

FL has also facilitated recent research on upscaling and privatizing personalized recommendation services, using on-device data to learn recommender models locally. These models are then aggregated globally to obtain a more performant model, while maintaining data privacy. Typically, federated recommender systems (FRSs) do not consider the lack of resources and data availability at the end-devices. In addition, they assume that the interaction data between users and items is i.i.d. and stationary across end-devices, and that all local recommender models can be directly averaged without considering the user's behavioral diversity. However, in real scenarios, recommendations have to be made on end-devices with sparse interaction data and limited resources. Furthermore, users' preferences are heterogeneous and they frequently visit new items. This makes their personal preferences highly skewed, and the straightforwardly aggregated model is thus ill-posed for such non-i.i.d. data. In this paper, we propose Resource Efficient Federated Recommender System (ReFRS) to enable decentralized recommendation with dynamic and diversified user preferences. On the device side, ReFRS consists of a lightweight self-supervised local model built upon the variational autoencoder for learning a user's temporal preference from a sequence of interacted items. On the server side, ReFRS utilizes a semantic sampler to adaptively perform model aggregation within each identified user cluster. The clustering module operates in an asynchronous and dynamic manner to support efficient global model update and cope with shifting user interests. As a result, ReFRS achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and scalability, as demonstrated by comparative experiments."}}

To tackle this problem, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is introduced to automatically search for the proper candidates for different parts of deep recommender systems. This survey performs a comprehensive review of the literature in this field. Firstly, we propose an abstract concept for AutoML for deep recommender systems (AutoRecSys) that describes its building blocks and distinguishes it from conventional AutoML techniques and recommender systems. Secondly, we present a taxonomy as a classification framework containing feature selection search, embedding dimension search, feature interaction search, model architecture search, and other components search. Furthermore, we put a particular emphasis on the search space and search strategy, as they are the common thread to connect all methods within each category and enable practitioners to analyze and compare various approaches.

In group recommendation, the core is to design preference aggregation functions to obtain a quality summary of all group members' preferences. Such user and group preferences are commonly represented as points in the vector space (i.e., embeddings), where multiple user embeddings are compressed into one to facilitate ranking for group-item pairs. However, the resulted group representations, as points, lack adequate flexibility and capacity to account for the multi-faceted user preferences. Also, the point embedding-based preference aggregation is a less faithful reflection of a group's decision-making process, where all users have to agree on a certain value in each embedding dimension instead of a negotiable interval. In this paper, we propose a novel representation of groups via the notion of hypercubes, which are subspaces containing innumerable points in the vector space. Specifically, we design the hypercube recommender (CubeRec) to adaptively learn group hypercubes from user embeddings with minimal information loss during preference aggregation, and to leverage a revamped distance metric to measure the affinity between group hypercubes and item points. Moreover, to counteract the long-standing issue of data sparsity in group recommendation, we make full use of the geometric expressiveness of hypercubes and innovatively incorporate self-supervision by intersecting two groups. Experiments on four real-world datasets have validated the superiority of CubeRec over state-of-the-art baselines."}}

Existing collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms compute the likelihood by utilizing simple relationships between objects, e.g., user-item, item-item, or user-user. They always rely on a single type of object-object relationship, ignoring other useful relationship information in data. In this paper, we model an interaction between user and item as an edge and propose a novel CF framework, called learnable edge collaborative filtering (LECF). LECF predicts the existence probability of an edge based on the connections among edges and is able to capture the complex relationship in data. Specifically, we first adopt the concept of line graph where each node represents an interaction edge; then calculate a weighted sum of similarity between the query edge and the observed edges (i.e., historical interactions) that are selected from the neighborhood of query edge in the line graph for a recommendation. In addition, we design an efficient propagation algorithm to speed up the training and inference of LECF. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate LECF can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art methods."}}
