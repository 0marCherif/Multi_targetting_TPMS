They provide asymptotically consistent estimates as the number of iterations tends to infinity. However, in large data applications, MCMC can be computationally expensive per iteration. This has catalyzed interest in sampling methods such as approximate MCMC, which trade off asymptotic consistency for improved computational speed. In this article, we propose estimators based on couplings of Markov chains to assess the quality of such asymptotically biased sampling methods. The estimators give empirical upper bounds of the Wassertein distance between the limiting distribution of the asymptotically biased sampling method and the original target distribution of interest. We apply our sample quality measures to two stylized examples in high dimensions. "}}

Various theoretical results provide upper bounds on the distance between the target and marginal distribution after a fixed number of iterations. These upper bounds are on a case by case basis and typically involve intractable quantities, which limits their use for practitioners. We introduce L-lag couplings to generate computable, non-asymptotic upper bound estimates for the total variation or the Wasserstein distance of general Markov chains. We apply L-lag couplings to three tasks: (i) determining MCMC burn-in with guarantees; (ii) comparison of different MCMC algorithms targeting the same distribution; (iii) comparison of exact and approximate MCMC algorithms such as Metropolis adjusted Langevin and unadjusted Langevin."}}
