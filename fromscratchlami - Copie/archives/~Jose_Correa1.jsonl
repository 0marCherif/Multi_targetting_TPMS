In this work, we consider the particular pricing problem where a firm wants to sell one item to a single buyer in order to maximize expected revenues. The firm commits to a price function over an infinite horizon. The buyer has a private value for the item and purchases at the time when his utility is maximized. In our model, the buyer is more impatient than the seller and we study how important is to observe the buyer time arrival in terms of the seller's expected revenue. When the seller can observe the arrival of the buyer, she can make the price function contingent on the buyer's arrival time. On the contrary, when the seller cannot observe the arrival, her price function is fixed at time zero for the whole horizon. The value of observabilityis defined as the worst case ratio between the expected revenue of the seller when she observes the buyer's arrival and that when she does not. Our main result is to prove that in a very general setting, the value of observability is at most~4.911. To obtain this result we fully characterize the observable setting and use this solution to construct a random and periodic price function for the unobservable case."}}

Upon seeing an element we have to make an irrevocable take-it-or-leave-it decision. The goal is to maximize the probability of picking the element of maximum value. The most classic version of the problem is that in which the elements arrive in random order and their values are arbitrary. However, by varying the available information, new interesting problems arise. Also the case in which the arrival order is adversarial instead of random leads to interesting variants that have been considered in the literature.   In this paper we study both the random order and adversarial order secretary problems with an additional twist. The values are arbitrary, but before starting the online sequence we independently sample each element with a fixed probability $p$. The sampled elements become our information or history set and the game is played over the remaining elements. We call these problems the random order secretary problem with $p$-sampling (ROS$p$ for short) and the adversarial order secretary problem with $p$-sampling (AOS$p$ for short). Our main result is to obtain best possible algorithms for both problems and all values of $p$. As $p$ grows to 1 the obtained guarantees converge to the optimal guarantees in the full information case. In the adversarial order setting, the best possible algorithm turns out to be a simple fixed threshold algorithm in which the optimal threshold is a function of $p$ only. In the random order setting we prove that the best possible algorithm is characterized by a fixed sequence of time thresholds, dictating at which point in time we should start accepting a value that is both a maximum of the online sequence and has a given ranking within the sampled elements."}}

In this paper we consider a variant of the problem and explore its connections to data-driven online selection. Specifically, we are given n cards with arbitrary nonnegative numbers written on both sides. The cards are randomly placed on n consecutive positions on a table, and for each card, the visible side is also selected at random. The player sees the visible side of all cards and wants to select the card with the maximum hidden value. To this end, the player flips the first card, sees its hidden value and decides whether to pick it or drop it and continue with the next card. We study algorithms for two natural objectives. In the first one, similar to the secretary problem, the player wants to maximize the probability of selecting the maximum hidden value. We show that this can be done with probability at least 0.45292. In the second objective, similar to the prophet inequality, the player wants to maximize the expectation of the selected hidden value. Here we show a guarantee of at least 0.63518 with respect to the expected maximum hidden value. Our algorithms result from combining three basic strategies. One is to stop whenever we see a value larger than the initial n visible numbers. The second one is to stop the first time the last flipped card's value is the largest of the currently n visible numbers in the table. And the third one is similar to the latter but to stop it additionally requires that the last flipped value is larger than the value on the other side of its card. We apply our results to the prophet secretary problem with unknown distributions, but with access to a single sample from each distribution. In particular, our guarantee improves upon 1 \u2013 1/e for this problem, which is the currently best known guarantee and only works for the i.i.d. prophet inequality with samples."}}

In the problem we consider, a decision maker (DM) initially gets to sample each of $N$ items independently with probability $p$, and can observe the relative rankings of these sampled items. Then, the DM faces the remaining items in an online fashion, observing the relative rankings of all revealed items. While scanning the sequence the DM makes irrevocable stop/continue decisions and her reward for stopping the sequence facing the item with rank $i$ is $Y_i$. The goal of the DM is to maximize her reward. We start by studying the case in which the values $Y_i$ are known to the DM, and then move to the case in which these values are adversarial. For the former case, we write the natural linear program that captures the performance of an algorithm, and take its continuous limit. We prove a structural result about this continuous limit, which allows us to reduce the problem to a relatively simple real optimization problem. We establish that the optimal algorithm is given by a sequence of thresholds $t_1\\le t_2\\le\\cdots$ such that the DM should stop if seeing an item with current ranking $i$ after time $t_i$. Additionally we are able to recover several classic results in the area such as those for secretary problem and the minimum ranking problem. For the adversarial case, we obtain a similar linear program with an additional stochastic dominance constraint. Using the same machinery we are able to pin down the optimal competitive ratios for all values of $p$. Notably, we prove that as $p$ approaches 1, our guarantee converges linearly to 0.745, matching that of the i.i.d.~prophet inequality. Also interesting is the case $p=1/2$, where our bound evaluates to $0.671$, which improves upon the state of the art."}}

These applications immediately raise the issue of analyzing dynamic network flows from a game-theoretic perspective. In this paper we study dynamic equilibria in the deterministic fluid queuing model in single-source single-sink networks, arguably the most basic model for flows over time. In the last decade we have witnessed significant developments in the theoretical understanding of the model. However, several fundamental questions remain open. One of the most prominent ones concerns the Price of Anarchy, measured as the worst case ratio between the minimum time required to route a given amount of flow from the source to the sink, and the time a dynamic equilibrium takes to perform the same task. Our main result states that if we could reduce the inflow of the network in a dynamic equilibrium, then the Price of Anarchy is exactly $\\e/(\\e-1)\\approx 1.582$. This significantly extends a result by Bhaskar, Fleischer, and Anshelevich (SODA 2011). Furthermore, our methods allow to determine that the Price of Anarchy in parallel-link networks is exactly 4/3. Finally, we argue that if a certain very natural monotonicity conjecture holds, the Price of Anarchy in the general case is exactly $\\e/(\\e-1)$."}}
{"id": "qdCAEqoCG3l", "cdate": 1546300800000, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Prophet Secretary Through Blind Strategies", "abstract": "In the classic prophet inequality, a problem in optimal stopping theory, samples from independent random variables (possibly differently distributed) arrive online. A gambler that knows the distributions, but cannot see the future, must decide at each point in time whether to stop and pick the current sample or to continue and lose that sample forever. The goal of the gambler is to maximize the expected value of what she picks and the performance measure is the worst case ratio between the expected value the gambler gets and what a prophet, that sees all the realizations in advance, gets. In the late seventies, Krengel and Sucheston, and Garling [16], established that this worst case ratio is a constant and that 1/2 is the best possible such constant. In the last decade the theory of prophet inequalities has resurged as an important problem due to its connections to posted price mechanisms, frequently used in online sales. A particularly interesting variant is the so-called Prophet Secretary problem, in which the only difference is that the samples arrive in a uniformly random order. For this variant several algorithms are known to achieve a constant of 1 \u2013 1/e and very recently this barrier was slightly improved by Azar et al. [3]. In this paper we derive a way of analyzing multithreshold strategies that basically sets a nonincreasing sequence of thresholds to be applied at different times. The gambler will thus stop the first time a sample surpasses the corresponding threshold. Specifically we consider a class of very robust strategies that we call blind quantile strategies. These constitute a clever generalization of single threshold strategies and consist in fixing a function which is used to define a sequence of thresholds once the instance is revealed. Our main result shows that these strategies can achieve a constant of 0.669 in the Prophet Secretary problem, improving upon the best known result of Azar et al. [3], and even that of Beyhaghi et al. [4] that works in the case the gambler can select the order of the samples. The crux of the analysis is a very precise analysis of the underlying stopping time distribution for the gambler's strategy that is inspired by the theory of Schur convex functions. We further prove that our family of blind strategies cannot lead to a constant better than 0.675. Finally we prove that no nonadaptive algorithm for the gambler can achieve a constant better than 0.732, which also improves upon a recent result of Azar et al. [3]. Here, a nonadaptive algorithm is an algorithm whose decision to stop can depend on the index of the random variable being sampled, on the value sampled, and on the time, but not on the history that has been observed."}}
