Of particular note is the field of ``AI-Art'', which has seen unprecedented growth with the emergence of powerful multimodal models such as CLIP. By combining speech and image synthesis models, so-called ``prompt-engineering'' has become established, in which carefully selected and composed sentences are used to achieve a certain visual style in the synthesized image. In this note, we present an alternative approach based on retrieval-augmented diffusion models (RDMs). In RDMs, a set of nearest neighbors is retrieved from an external database during training for each training instance, and the diffusion model is conditioned on these informative samples. During inference (sampling), we replace the retrieval database with a more specialized database that contains, for example, only images of a particular visual style. This provides a novel way to prompt a general trained model after training and thereby specify a particular visual style. As shown by our experiments, this approach is superior to specifying the visual style within the text prompt. We open-source code and model weights at https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion ."}}

This naturally suggests a bijective mapping between the video domain and the static content as well as residual information. In contrast to common stochastic image-to-video synthesis, such a model does not merely generate arbitrary videos progressing the initial image. Given this image, it rather provides a one-to-one mapping between the residual vectors and the video with stochastic outcomes when sampling. The approach is naturally implemented using a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) that can explain videos by independently modelling static and other video characteristics, thus laying the basis for controlled video synthesis. Experiments on diverse video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both the quality and diversity of the synthesized results.

Being bound to local convolutions, CNNs need explicit 3D biases to model geometric transformations. In contrast, we demonstrate that a transformer-based model can synthesize entirely novel views without any hand-engineered 3D biases. This is achieved by (i) a global attention mechanism for implicitly learning long-range 3D correspondences between source and target views, and (ii) a probabilistic formulation necessary to capture the ambiguity inherent in predicting novel views from a single image, thereby overcoming the limitations of previous approaches that are restricted to relatively small viewpoint changes. We evaluate various ways to integrate 3D priors into a transformer architecture. However, our experiments show that no such geometric priors are required and that the transformer is capable of implicitly learning 3D relationships between images. Furthermore, this approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of visual quality while covering the full distribution of possible realizations. Code is available at https://git.io/JOnwn"}}

Experiments show greatly improved image modification capabilities over autoregressive models while also providing high-fidelity image generation, both of which are enabled through efficient training in a compressed latent space. Specifically, our approach can take unrestricted, user-provided masks into account to perform local image editing. Thus, in contrast to pure autoregressive models, it can solve free-form image inpainting and, in the case of conditional models, local, text-guided image modification without requiring mask-specific training."}}

However, results of current approaches still fall short of their promise of high-resolution synthesis. We hypothesize that this is mostly due to the highly engineered nature of these approaches which often rely on auxiliary losses and intermediate steps such as mask generators. In this note, we present an orthogonal approach to this task, where the generative model is based on pure likelihood training without additional objectives. To do so, we first optimize a powerful compression model with adversarial training which learns to reconstruct its inputs via a discrete latent bottleneck and thereby effectively strips the latent representation of high-frequency details such as texture. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive transformer model to learn the distribution of the discrete image representations conditioned on a tokenized version of the layouts. Our experiments show that the resulting system is able to synthesize high-quality images consistent with the given layouts. In particular, we improve the state-of-the-art FID score on COCO-Stuff and on Visual Genome by up to 19% and 53% and demonstrate the synthesis of images up to 512 x 512 px on COCO and Open Images."}}
