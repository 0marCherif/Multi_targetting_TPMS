Among existing clustering methods, multiple kernel clustering (MKC) has been widely investigated due to its effectiveness to capture non-linear relationships among samples. However, most of the existing MKC methods bear intensive computational complexity in learning an optimal kernel and seeking the final clustering partition. In this paper, based on the spectral perturbation theory, we propose an efficient MKC method that reduces the computational complexity from O(n3) to O(nk2 + k3), with n and k denoting the number of data samples and the number of clusters, respectively. The proposed method recovers the optimal clustering partition from base partitions by maximizing the eigen gaps to approximate the perturbation errors. An equivalent optimization objective function is introduced to obtain base partitions. Furthermore, a kernel weighting scheme is embedded to capture the diversity among multiple kernels. Finally, the optimal partition, base partitions, and kernel weights are jointly learned in a unified framework. An efficient alternate iterative optimization algorithm is designed to solve the resultant optimization problem. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method when compared to other state-of-the-art ones in terms of both clustering efficacy and efficiency."}}

Through classification of Remote Sensing (RS) images combined with deep learning approaches, however, previous studies did not attach enough attention to boundary ambiguity, thus achieving relatively low accuracy and demands artificial refinements in farmland extraction. To remedy flaws in current approaches and improve overall accuracy, our work reviewed relevant literature and utilized K-Means model, U-Net model and DeelLabV3 model respectively, to refine and make adjustments to farmland extraction model of RS image afterwards. After model training and parameter tuning, the final result of the classification model reached 95.76% in terms of overall accuracy, and the average cross-comparison ratio in farmland recognition rate reached 85.44%.

To deal with these issues, we propose a deep neural network which recurrently fuses and refines multi-scale deep features (DeFusionNet) for defocus blur detection. We first fuse the features from different layers of FCN as shallow features and semantic features, respectively. Then, the fused shallow features are propagated to deep layers for refining the details of detected defocus blur regions, and the fused semantic features are propagated to shallow layers to assist in better locating blur regions. The fusion and refinement are carried out recurrently. In order to narrow the gap between low-level and high-level features, we embed a feature adaptation module before feature propagating to exploit the complementary information as well as reduce the contradictory response of different feature layers. Since different feature channels are with different extents of discrimination for detecting blur regions, we design a channel attention module to select discriminative features for feature refinement. Finally, the output of each layer at last recurrent step are fused to obtain the final result. We collect a new dataset consists of various challenging images and their pixel-wise annotations for promoting further study. Extensive experiments on two commonly used datasets and our newly collected one are conducted to demonstrate both the efficacy and efficiency of DeFusionNet."}}

In such a way, the cross-view information could be ignored. In addition, they usually assume that different feature views are projected from a latent feature space while the diversity of different views cannot be fully captured. In this work, we resent a MV-UFS model via cross-view local structure preserved diversity and consensus learning, referred to as CvLP-DCL briefly. In order to exploit both the shared and distinguishing information across different views, we project each view into a label space, which consists of a consensus part and a view-specific part. Therefore, we regularize the fact that different views represent same samples. Meanwhile, a cross-view similarity graph learning term with matrix-induced regularization is embedded to preserve the local structure of data in the label space. By imposing the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$l_{2,1}$</tex-math></inline-formula> -norm on the feature projection matrices for constraining row sparsity, discriminative features can be selected from different views. An efficient algorithm is designed to solve the resultant optimization problem and extensive experiments on six publicly datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed CvLP-DCL."}}

However, locating changed objects with fine structural details is still a challenging problem in RSCD. In this article, we propose a novel RSCD network via temporal feature interaction and guided refinement (TFI-GR) to solve this issue. Specifically, unlike previous methods, which just employ one single concatenation or subtraction operation for bi-temporal feature fusion, we design a temporal feature interaction module (TFIM) to enhance interaction between bi-temporal features and capture temporal difference information at diverse feature levels. Afterward, a guided refinement modules (GRMs), which aggregates both low- and high-level temporal difference representations to polish the location information of high-level features and filter the background clutters of low-level features, is repeatedly performed. Finally, the multilevel temporal difference features are progressively fused to generate change maps for change detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TFI-GR, comprehensive experiments are performed on three high spatial resolution RSCD datasets. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art change detection methods.

Existing methods have improved in clustering performance, most of them learn graph structure depending on all samples, which are high complexity. Bipartite graph-based multi-view clustering can obtain clustering result by establishing the relationship between the sample points and small anchor points, which improve the efficiency of clustering. Most bipartite graph-based clustering methods only focus on topological graph structure learning depending on sample nodes, ignore the influence of node features. In this paper, we propose bipartite graph-based discriminative feature learning for multi-view clustering, which combines bipartite graph learning and discriminative feature learning to a unified framework. Specifically, the bipartite graph learning is proposed via multi-view subspace representation with manifold regularization terms. Meanwhile, our feature learning utilizes data pseudo-labels obtained by fused bipartite graph to seek projection direction, which make the same label be closer and make data points with different labels be far away from each other. At last, the proposed manifold regularization terms establish the relationship between constructed bipartite graph and new data representation. By leveraging the interactions between structure learning and discriminative feature learning, we are able to select more informative features and capture more accurate structure of data for clustering. Extensive experimental results on different scale datasets demonstrate our method achieves better or comparable clustering performance than the results of state-of-the-art methods."}}

However, most existing methods directly learn a similarity graph from original multi-view features, which inevitably contain noises and redundancy information. The learned similarity graph is inaccurate and is insufficient to depict the underlying cluster structure of multi-view data. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-view clustering method that is able to construct an essential similarity graph in a spectral embedding space instead of the original feature space. Concretely, we first obtain multiple spectral embedding matrices from the view-specific similarity graphs, and reorganize the gram matrices constructed by the inner product of the normalized spectral embedding matrices into a tensor. Then, we impose a weighted tensor nuclear norm constraint on the tensor to capture high-order consistent information among multiple views. Furthermore, we unify the spectral embedding and low rank tensor learning into a unified optimization framework to determine the spectral embedding matrices and tensor representation jointly. Finally, we obtain the consensus similarity graph from the gram matrices via an adaptive neighbor manner. An efficient optimization algorithm is designed to solve the resultant optimization problem. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets are conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed method.
