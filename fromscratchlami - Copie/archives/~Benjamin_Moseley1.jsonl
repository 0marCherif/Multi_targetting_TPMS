The goal is to order elements for all the functions to have value above a certain threshold as soon on average as possible, assuming we choose one element per time. The problem is flexible enough to capture various applications in machine learning, including decision trees.\nThis paper considers the min-max version of SR where multiple instances share the ground set. With the view of each instance being associated with an agent, the min-max problem is to order the common elements to minimize the maximum objective of all agents -- thus, finding a fair solution for all agents. We give approximation algorithms for this problem and demonstrate their effectiveness in the application of finding a decision tree for multiple agents."}}

In this work, we build on this idea to improve the performance of the widely used Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for computing maximum flows by seeding Ford-Fulkerson with predicted flows. Our proposed method offers strong theoretical performance in terms of the quality of the prediction. We then consider image segmentation, a common use-case of flows in computer vision, and complement our theoretical analysis with strong empirical results."}}

Specifically, the size of each job is a random variable whose distribution is known to the algorithm, but whose realization is revealed only after the job is scheduled. While minimizing the total completion time is easy in the deterministic setting, the stochastic problem has long been notorious: all known algorithms have approximation ratios that either depend on the variances, or depend linearly on the number of machines. We give an -approximation for stochastic jobs which have Bernoulli processing times. This is the first approximation for this problem that is both independent of the variance in the job sizes, and is sublinear in the number of machines m. Our algorithm is based on a novel reduction from minimizing the total completion time to a natural makespan-like objective, which we call the weighted free time. We hope this free time objective will be useful in further improvements to this problem, as well as other stochastic scheduling problems."}}

As there are lower bound instances that show that an online algorithm cannot achieve a competitive ratio that is a function of $n$ and $k$, we consider a beyond worst-case analysis model in which the algorithm is provided a priori with a predicted budget $B$ that upper bounds the optimal objective value. We give an algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio that is exponential in the the number $k$ of clusters, and show that the competitive ratio of every algorithm must be linear in $k$. To the best of our knowledge this is the first investigation in the literature that considers cluster consistency using competitive analysis."}}

Our algorithms are the first purely combinatorial approximation algorithms for this problem. We construct a novel semi-metric on the set of vertices, which we call the correlation metric, that indicates to our clustering algorithms whether pairs of nodes should be in the same cluster. The paper demonstrates empirically that, compared to prior work, our algorithms sacrifice little in the objective quality to obtain significantly better run-time. Moreover, our algorithms scale to larger networks that are effectively intractable for known algorithms."}}

Most previous work has assumed that the algorithm has access to a single predictor. However, in practice, there are many machine learning methods available, often with incomparable generalization guarantees, making it hard to pick a best method a priori. In this work we consider scenarios where multiple predictors are available to the algorithm and the question is how to best utilize them. \n\nIdeally, we would like the algorithm's performance to depend on the quality of the {\\em best} predictor.  However, utilizing more predictions comes with a cost, since we now have to identify which prediction is best.  We study the use of multiple predictors for a number of fundamental problems, including matching, load balancing, and non-clairvoyant scheduling, which have been well-studied in the single predictor setting. For each of these problems we introduce new algorithms that take advantage of multiple predictors, and prove bounds on the resulting performance. "}}

We consider the online Steiner tree problem in this model for both directed and undirected graphs. Steiner tree is known to have strong lower bounds in the online setting and any algorithm\u2019s worst-case guarantee is far from desirable. This paper considers algorithms that predict which terminal arrives online. The predictions may be incorrect and the algorithms\u2019 performance is parameterized by the number of incorrectly predicted terminals. These guarantees ensure that algorithms break through the online lower bounds with good predictions and the competitive ratio gracefully degrades as the prediction error grows. We then observe that the theory is predictive of what will occur empirically. We show on graphs where terminals are drawn from a distribution, the new online algorithms have strong performance even with modestly correct predictions."}}
