We propose a new approach to 6D object pose estimation which consists of an end-to-end differentiable architecture that makes use of geometric knowledge. Our approach iteratively refines both pose and correspondence in a tightly coupled manner, allowing us to dynamically remove outliers to improve accuracy. We use a novel differentiable layer to perform pose refinement by solving an optimization problem we refer to as Bidirectional Depth-Augmented Perspective-N-Point (BD-PnP). Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on standard 6D Object Pose benchmarks."}}
