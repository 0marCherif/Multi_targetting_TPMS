We first outline the challenges in the SVOL task and build the Sketch-Video Attention Network (SVANet) with the following design principles: (i) to consider temporal information of video and bridge the domain gap between sketch and video; (ii) to accurately identify and localize multiple objects simultaneously; (iii) to handle various styles of sketches; (iv) to be classification-free. In particular, SVANet is equipped with a Cross-modal Transformer that models the interaction between learnable object tokens, query sketch, and video through attention operations, and learns upon a per-frame set matching strategy that enables frame-wise prediction while utilizing global video context. We evaluate SVANet on a newly curated SVOL dataset. By design, SVANet successfully learns the mapping between the query sketches and video objects, achieving state-of-the-art results on the SVOL benchmark. We further confirm the effectiveness of SVANet via extensive ablation studies and visualizations. Lastly, we demonstrate its transfer capability on unseen datasets and novel categories, suggesting its high scalability in real-world applications"}}
