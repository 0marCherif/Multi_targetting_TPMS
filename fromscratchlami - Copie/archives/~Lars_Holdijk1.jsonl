For this purpose, we study the hypothesis margin. We prove that if NPCs use a dissimilarity measure induced by a seminorm, the hypothesis margin is a tight lower bound on the size of adversarial attacks and can be calculated in constant time\u2014this provides the first adversarial robustness certificate calculable in reasonable time. Finally, we show that each NPC trained by a triplet loss maximizes the hypothesis margin and is therefore optimized for adversarial robustness.

Due to the existence of high energy barriers separating the states, these transition paths are unlikely to be sampled with standard Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. Traditional methods to augment MD with a bias potential to increase the probability of the transition rely on a dimensionality reduction step based on Collective Variables (CVs). Unfortunately, selecting appropriate CVs requires chemical intuition and traditional methods are therefore not always applicable to larger systems. Additionally, when incorrect CVs are used, the bias potential might not be minimal and bias the system along dimensions irrelevant to the transition. Showing a formal relation between the problem of sampling molecular transition paths, the Schr\\\"odinger bridge problem and stochastic optimal control with neural network policies, we propose a machine learning method for sampling said transitions. Unlike previous non-machine learning approaches our method, named PIPS, does not depend on CVs. We show that our method successful generates low energy transitions for Alanine Dipeptide as well as the larger Polyproline and Chignolin proteins."}}

The replication experiment focuses on three main claims: (1) Is it possible to reimplement the proposed method in a different framework? (2) Do the main claims with respect to the GNNExplainer hold? (3) Is the used evaluation method a valid method for explaining the classification decision by Graph Neural Networks? \n\nMethodology\nThe authors' TensorFlow code was largely used as starting point for our reimplementation in PyTorch. However, large parts of the evaluation setup were missing and differences were found between the listed configurations in the paper and the code. As a result, our codebase contains a large portion of novel code and introduces a different method for tracking experimental configurations. Using the new codebase all experiments are replicated. In addition to this, a short ablation study is performed.\n\nResults\nDue to numerous inconsistencies between code and paper, it is not possible to replicate the original results using the paper alone. With help of the original codebase, a number of the original results can be retrieved. The main comparison claim of the paper, to improve over the preceding GNNExplainer, does hold. However, after performing the replication experiments, some questions regarding the validity of the used evaluation setup in the original paper remain. \n\nWhat was easy\nThe method proposed by the authors for explaining the Graph Neural Networks is easy to comprehend and intuitive. Re-implementation of the method is straightforward using a modern deep learning framework. The datasets used for the experimental setup were all provided together with their codebase. \n\nWhat was difficult\nThe main difficulty arose from the difference between the experimental configurations discussed in the paper and implemented in the code. There were a number of small inconsistencies (eg. incorrect hyper-parameter settings), but also some major ones (eg. using batch-normalization in training mode during evaluation). This issue was worsened by the fractured reporting of configurations in the code. \n\nCommunication with original authors\nContact was made with the authors on two occasions. During the first exchange the authors confirmed a number of clarifying questions and confirmed that the configurations as presented in the codebase were to be used instead of those provided in the paper. In the second exchange our reservations concerning the used experimental evaluation were conveyed to the authors. The authors did not share our concerns. "}}

The robustness of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) models against adversarial attacks has however not yet been studied to the same extent. We therefore present an extensive evaluation of three LVQ models: Generalized LVQ, Generalized Matrix LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ. The evaluation suggests that both Generalized LVQ and Generalized Tangent LVQ have a high base robustness, on par with the current state-of-the-art in robust neural network methods. In contrast to this, Generalized Matrix LVQ shows a high susceptibility to adversarial attacks, scoring consistently behind all other models. Additionally, our numerical evaluation indicates that increasing the number of prototypes per class improves the robustness of the models."}}

This issue can be partly alleviated by constructing a precise decision process within the neural network. In this work, a network architecture, denoted as Classification-By-Components network (CBC), is proposed. It is restricted to follow an intuitive reasoning based decision process inspired by Biederman's recognition-by-components theory from&nbsp;cognitive psychology. The network is trained to learn and detect generic components that characterize objects.&nbsp;In parallel, a class-wise reasoning strategy based on these components is learned to solve the classification problem. In contrast to other work on reasoning, we propose three different types of reasoning: positive, negative, and indefinite. These three types together form a probability space to provide a probabilistic classifier. The decomposition of objects into generic components combined with the probabilistic reasoning provides by design a clear interpretation of the classification decision process. The evaluation of the approach on MNIST shows that CBCs are viable classifiers. Additionally, we demonstrate that the inherent interpretability offers a profound understanding of the classification behavior such that we can explain the success of an adversarial attack. The method's scalability is successfully tested using the ImageNet dataset."}}
