Due to the fact that policy resilience is an add-on concern to RL algorithms, it must be resource-efficient, time-conserving, and widely applicable without compromising the performance of RL algorithms.\nThis paper proposes such a policy-resilience mechanism based on an idea of sharing the environment knowledge. We summarize the policy resilience as three stages: preparation, diagnosis, recovery. Specifically, we design the mechanism as a federated architecture coupled with a meta-learning approach, pursuing an efficient extraction and sharing of environment knowledge. With the shared knowledge, a poisoned agent can quickly identify the deployment condition and accordingly recover its policy performance. We empirically evaluate the resilience mechanism for both model-based and model-free RL algorithms, showing its effectiveness and efficiency in restoring the deployment performance of a poisoned policy."}}

Research such as Gato and Multi-Game Decision Transformer have displayed outstanding performance and generalization capabilities on many games and domains. However, there exists a research blank about developing highly capable and generalist models in multi-agent RL (MARL), which can substantially accelerate progress towards general AI. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent multi-Game ENtity TrAnsformer (MAGENTA) from the entity perspective as an orthogonal research to previous time-sequential modeling. Specifically, to deal with different state/observation spaces in different games, we analogize games as languages, thus training different \"tokenizers\" for various games. The feature inputs are split according to different entities and tokenized in the same continuous space. Then, two types of transformer-based model are proposed as permutation-invariant architectures to deal with various numbers of entities and capture the attention over different entities. MAGENTA is trained on Honor of Kings, Starcraft II micromanagement, and Neural MMO with a single set of transformer weights. Extensive experiments show that MAGENTA can play games across various categories with arbitrary numbers of agents and increase the efficiency of fine-tuning in new games and scenarios by 50\\%-100\\%.

However, common MARL algorithms still suffer from scalability and sparse reward issues. One promising approach to resolve them is automated curriculum learning (ACL), where a student (curriculum learner) train on tasks of increasing difficulty controlled by a teacher (curriculum generator). Unfortunately, in spite of its success, ACL\u2019s applicability is restricted due to: (1) lack of a general student framework to deal with the varying number of agents across tasks and the sparse reward problem, and (2) the non-stationarity in the teacher\u2019s task due to the ever-changing student strategies. As a remedy for ACL, we introduce a novel automatic curriculum learning framework, Skilled Population Curriculum (SPC), adapting curriculum learning to multi-agent coordination. To be specific, we endow the student with population-invariant communication and a hierarchical skill set. Thus, the student can learn cooperation and behavior skills from distinct tasks with a varying number of agents. In addition, we model the teacher as a contextual bandit conditioned by student policies. As a result, a team of agents can change its size while retaining previously acquired skills. We also analyze the inherent non-stationarity of this multi-agent automatic curriculum teaching problem, and provide a corresponding regret bound. Empirical results show that our method improves scalability, sample efficiency, and generalization in multiple MARL environments.

LeGEM builds agents\u2019 episodic memories by utilizing agents\u2019 individual experiences. It boosts multi-agent learning by addressing the challenging temporal credit assignment problem raised by the off-beat actions via our novel reward redistribution scheme, alleviating the issue of non-Markovian reward.
