Despite its promising performance, practical gaps exist when deploying DRL in real-world scenarios. One main barrier is the over-fitting issue that leads to poor generalizability of the policy learned by DRL. In particular, for offline DRL with observational data, model selection is a challenging task as there is no ground truth available for performance demonstration, in contrast with the online setting with simulated environments. In this work, we propose a pessimistic model selection (PMS) approach for offline DRL with a theoretical guarantee, which features a tuning-free framework for finding the best policy among a set of candidate models. Two refined approaches are also proposed to address the potential bias of DRL model in identifying the optimal policy. Numerical studies demonstrated the superior performance of our approach over existing methods."}}

This work studies offline personalized pricing under endogeneity using an instrumental variable approach. Standard instrumental variable methods in causal inference/econometrics either focus on a discrete treatment space or require the exclusion restriction of instruments from having a direct effect on the outcome, which limits their applicability in personalized pricing. In this paper, we propose a new policy learning method for Personalized pRicing using Invalid iNsTrumental variables (PRINT) for continuous treatment that allow direct effects on the outcome. Specifically, relying on the structural models of revenue and price, we establish the identifiability condition of an optimal pricing strategy under endogeneity with the help of invalid instrumental variables. Based on this new identification, which leads to solving conditional moment restrictions with generalized residual functions, we construct an adversarial min-max estimator and learn an optimal pricing strategy. Furthermore, we establish an asymptotic regret bound to find an optimal pricing strategy. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method via extensive simulation studies as well as a real data application from an US online auto loan company."}}

Nearly all existing algorithms rely on the absolutely continuous assumption on the distribution induced by target policies with respect to the data distribution, so that the batch data can be used to calibrate target policies via the change of measure. However, the absolute continuity assumption could be violated in practice (e.g., no-overlap support), especially when the state-action space is large or continuous. In this paper, we propose a new batch RL algorithm without requiring absolute continuity in the setting of an infinite-horizon Markov decision process with continuous states and actions. We call our algorithm STEEL: SingulariTy-awarE rEinforcement Learning. Our algorithm is motivated by a new error analysis on off-policy evaluation, where we use maximum mean discrepancy, together with distributionally robust optimization, to characterize the error of off-policy evaluation caused by the possible singularity and to enable model extrapolation. By leveraging the idea of pessimism and under some mild conditions, we derive a finite-sample regret guarantee for our proposed algorithm without imposing absolute continuity. Compared with existing algorithms, by requiring only minimal data-coverage assumption, STEEL significantly improves the applicability and robustness of batch RL. Extensive simulation studies and one real experiment on personalized pricing demonstrate the superior performance of our method in dealing with possible singularity in batch RL."}}

Most of methods in the existing literature are developed in \\textit{online} settings where the data are easy to collect or simulate. Motivated by high stake domains such as mobile health studies with limited and pre-collected data, in this paper, we study \\textit{offline} reinforcement learning methods. To efficiently use these datasets for policy optimization, we propose a novel value enhancement method to improve the performance of a given initial policy computed by existing state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Specifically, when the initial policy is not consistent, our method will output a policy whose value is no worse and often better than that of the initial policy. When the initial policy is consistent, under some mild conditions, our method will yield a policy whose value converges to the optimal one at a faster rate than the initial policy, achieving the desired ``value enhancement\" property. The proposed method is generally applicable to any parametrized policy that belongs to certain pre-specified function class (e.g., deep neural networks). Extensive numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of our method."}}

A firm does not know the underlying customer choice model but has access to an offline dataset consisting of the historically offered assortment set, customer choice, and revenue. The objective is to use the offline dataset to find an optimal assortment. Due to the combinatorial nature of assortment optimization, the problem of insufficient data coverage is likely to occur in the offline dataset. Therefore, designing a provably efficient offline learning algorithm becomes a significant challenge. To this end, we propose an algorithm referred to as Pessimistic ASsortment opTimizAtion (PASTA for short) designed based on the principle of pessimism, that can correctly identify the optimal assortment by only requiring the offline data to cover the optimal assortment under general settings. In particular, we establish a regret bound for the offline assortment optimization problem under the celebrated multinomial logit model. We also propose an efficient computational procedure to solve our pessimistic assortment optimization problem. Numerical studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the existing baseline method."}}

Consequently, it is common practice to construct a state which is larger than necessary, e.g., by concatenating measurements over contiguous time points. However, needlessly increasing the dimension of the state can slow learning and obfuscate the learned policy. We introduce the notion of a minimal sufficient state in a Markov decision process (MDP) as the smallest subvector of the original state under which the process remains an MDP and shares the same optimal policy as the original process. We propose a novel sequential knockoffs (SEEK) algorithm that estimates the minimal sufficient state in a system with high-dimensional complex nonlinear dynamics. In large samples, the proposed method controls the false discovery rate, and selects all sufficient variables with probability approaching one. As the method is agnostic to the reinforcement learning algorithm being applied, it benefits downstream tasks such as policy optimization. Empirical experiments verify theoretical results and show the proposed approach outperforms several competing methods in terms of variable selection accuracy and regret."}}

Furthermore, to address the issue of unmeasured confounding in finding super-policies, a number of non-parametric identification results are established.
