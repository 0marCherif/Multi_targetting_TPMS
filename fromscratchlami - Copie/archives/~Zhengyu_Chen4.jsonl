In this work, we develop a modification of AltMinLowRaP, called AltMinLowRaP-Ptych, that is designed for reducing the sample complexity (number of measurements required for accurate recovery) for dynamic Fourier ptychographic imaging. Fourier ptychography is a computational imaging technique that enables high-resolution microscopy using multiple \n low-resolution cameras. Via exhaustive experiments on real image sequences with simulated ptychographic measurements, we show the power of our algorithm for reducing the number of samples required for accurate recovery"}}

Fourier ptychography is an image acquisition scheme that uses an array of images to produce high-resolution images in microscopy as well as long-distance imaging, to mitigate the effects of diffraction blurring. The number of measurements is typically much larger than the size of the signal (image or video) to be reconstructed, which translates to high storage and computational requirements. The issue of high sample complexity can be alleviated by utilizing structural properties of the image (or video). In this article, we first discuss a range of subsampling schemes which can reduce the amount of measurements in Fourier ptychography setups; however, this makes the problem ill-posed. Correspondingly, we impose structural constraints on the signals to be recovered, to regularize the problem. Through our novel framework of recovery algorithms, we show that one can reconstruct high-resolution images (or video) from fewer samples, via simple and natural assumptions on the structure of the images (or video). We demonstrate the validity of our claims through a series of experiments, both on simulated and real data."}}

To the best of our knowledge, this setting has not been explicitly addressed in the ptychography literature. We argue that such a setting is very natural, and that our methods provide an important first step towards helping reduce the sample complexity (and hence acquisition time) of imaging dynamic scenes to managaeble levels. With significantly reduced acquisition times per image, it is conceivable that dynamic ptychographic imaging of fast changing scenes indeeed becomes practical in the near future."}}

We extend recent works in low rank Fourier ptychographic imaging, to incorporate model-correction schemes, which correct for errors propagated due to inaccuracies in fitting an exact low rank model to the target video acquired. Through our algorithm, we are able to demonstrate superior reconstruction quality of video from phaseless Fourier ptychographic measurements, at low sample complexities, as compared to conventional ptychographic setups."}}

Extracting meaningful information from images obtained from such microscopes remains a formidable challenge. Fourier analysis is commonly used to analyze the underlying structure of fundamental motifs present in an image. However, the Fourier transform fundamentally suffers from severe phase noise when applied to aperiodic images. Here, we report the development of a new algorithm based on nonconvex optimization, applicable to any microscopy modality, that directly uncovers the fundamental motifs present in a real-space image. Apart from being quantitatively superior to traditional Fourier analysis, we show that this novel algorithm also uncovers phase sensitive information about the underlying motif structure. We demonstrate its usefulness by studying scanning tunneling microscopy images of a Co-doped iron arsenide superconductor and prove that the application of the algorithm allows for the complete recovery of quasiparticle interference in this material. Our phase sensitive quasiparticle interference imaging results indicate that the pairing symmetry in optimally doped NaFeAs is consistent with a sign-changing s+- order parameter."}}

We adapt conventional Fourier ptychographic approaches, for the case where the images to be acquired have an underlying structured sparsity. We propose some sub-sampling strategies which can be easily adapted to existing ptychographic setups. We then use a novel technique called CoPRAM with some modifications, to recover sparse (and block sparse) images from sub-sampled pty-chographic measurements. We demonstrate experimentally that this algorithm performs better than existing phase retrieval techniques, in terms of quality of reconstruction, using fewer number of samples."}}
