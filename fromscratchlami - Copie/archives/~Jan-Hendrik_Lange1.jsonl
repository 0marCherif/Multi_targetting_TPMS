One way of encoding decompositions is by multicuts, the subsets of those edges that straddle distinct components. Recently, a lifting of multicuts from a graph $G = (V, E)$ to an augmented graph $\\hat G = (V, E \\cup F)$ has been proposed in the field of image analysis, with the goal of obtaining a more expressive characterization of graph decompositions in which it is made explicit also for pairs $F \\subseteq \\tbinom{V}{2} \\setminus E$ of non-neighboring nodes whether these are in the same or distinct components. In this work, we study in detail the polytope in $\\mathbb{R}^{E \\cup F}$ whose vertices are precisely the characteristic vectors of multicuts of $\\hat G$ lifted from $G$, connecting it, in particular, to the rich body of prior work on the clique partitioning and multilinear polytope."}}

This paper studies graph signatures that allow the optimal partition to be found efficiently. We define the class of flow-partitionable signed graphs, which have the property that the standard linear programming relaxation based on so-called cycle inequalities is tight. In other words, flow-partitionable signed graphs satisfy an exact max-multiflow-min-multicut relation in the associated instances of minimum multicut. In this work we propose to characterize flow-partitionable signed graphs in terms of forbidden minors. Our initial results include two infinite classes of forbidden minors, which are sufficient if the positive subgraph is a circuit or a tree. For the general case we present another forbidden minor and point out a connection to open problems in the theory of ideal clutters."}}

In particular, we characterize facets of the lifted multicut polytope for trees defined by the inequalities of a canonical relaxation. Moreover, we present an additional class of inequalities associated with paths that are facet-defining. Taken together, our facets yield a complete totally dual integral description of the lifted multicut polytope for paths. This description establishes a connection to the combinatorial properties of alternative formulations such as sequential set partitioning."}}

We propose persistency criteria for the multicut and max-cut problem as well as fast combinatorial routines to verify them. The criteria that we derive are based on mappings that improve feasible multicuts, respectively cuts. Our elementary criteria can be checked enumeratively. The more advanced ones rely on fast algorithms for upper and lower bounds for the respective cut problems and max-flow techniques for auxiliary min-cut problems. Our methods can be used as a preprocessing technique for reducing problem sizes or for computing partial optimality guarantees for solutions output by heuristic solvers. We show the efficacy of our methods on instances of both problems from computer vision, biomedical image analysis and statistical physics."}}

The considered task is posed as a joint optimization problem in the continuous classifier parameters and the discrete label variables. In contrast to prior approaches such as convex relaxations, we propose an advantageous decoupling of the objective function into discrete and continuous subproblems and a novel, efficient optimization method related to ADMM. This approach preserves integrality of the discrete label variables and guarantees global convergence to a critical point. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach in several experiments including video object segmentation on the DAVIS data set and interactive image segmentation."}}

Jug et al. [21] have proposed a mathematical abstraction of this task, the moral lineage tracing problem (MLTP), whose feasible solutions define both a segmentation of every image and a lineage forest of cells. Their branch-and-cut algorithm, however, is prone to many cuts and slow convergence for large instances. To address this problem, we make three contributions: (i) we devise the first efficient primal feasible local search algorithms for the MLTP, (ii) we improve the branch-and-cut algorithm by separating tighter cutting planes and by incorporating our primal algorithms, (iii) we show in experiments that our algorithms find accurate solutions on the problem instances of Jug et al. and scale to larger instances, leveraging moral lineage tracing to practical significance."}}
