However, this assumption rarely holds for data in-the-wild, where instances belonging to novel classes may appear at testing time. Here, we introduce a novel open-world semi-supervised learning setting that formalizes the notion that novel classes may appear in the unlabeled test data. In this novel setting, the goal is to solve the class distribution mismatch problem between labeled and unlabeled data, where at the test time every input instance either needs to be classified into one of the existing classes or a new unseen class needs to be initialized and the instance assigned to it. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose ORCA, an end-to-end approach that assigns instances to previously seen classes or  forms novel classes by grouping similar instances without assuming any prior knowledge. The key idea in ORCA is to utilize uncertainty adaptive margin to circumvent the bias towards seen classes caused by learning seen classes faster than the novel classes. In this way, ORCA gradually increases the discriminability of the model during the training and reduces the gap between intra-class variance of seen with respect to novel classes. Extensive experiments on image classification datasets and a single-cell dataset demonstrate that ORCA consistently outperforms alternative baselines, achieving 25% improvement on seen and 96% improvement on novel classes of the ImageNet dataset.

Recently, promising results have been achieved by incorporating knowledge graph as side information in hard classification tasks with severely limited data. However, prior models consist of highly complex architectures with many sub-components that all seem to impact performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study on graph embedded few-shot learning. We introduce a graph regularization approach that allows a deeper understanding of the impact of incorporating graph information between labels. Our proposed regularization is widely applicable and model-agnostic, and boosts the performance of any few-shot learning model, including fine-tuning, metric-based, and optimization-based meta-learning. Our approach improves the performance of strong base learners by up to 2% on Mini-ImageNet and 6.7% on ImageNet-FS, outperforming state-of-the-art graph embedded methods. Additional analyses reveal that graph regularizing models result in a lower loss for more difficult tasks, such as those with fewer shots and less informative support examples."}}

The core of human cognition lies in the structured, reusable concepts that help us to rapidly adapt to new tasks and provide reasoning behind our decisions. However, existing meta-learning methods learn complex representations across prior labeled tasks without imposing any structure on the learned representations. Here we propose COMET, a meta-learning method that improves generalization ability by learning to learn along human-interpretable concept dimensions. Instead of learning a joint unstructured metric space, COMET learns mappings of high-level concepts into semi-structured metric spaces, and effectively combines the outputs of independent concept learners. We evaluate our model on few-shot tasks from diverse domains, including fine-grained image classification, document categorization  and cell type annotation on a novel dataset from a biological domain developed in our work. COMET significantly outperforms strong meta-learning baselines, achieving 6-15% relative improvement on the most challenging 1-shot learning tasks, while unlike existing methods providing interpretations behind the model's predictions."}}

However, the real world is often open and dynamic, and thus novel previously unseen classes may appear in the test data or during the model deployment. Here, we introduce a new open-world semi-supervised learning setting in which the model is required to recognize previously seen classes, as well as to discover novel classes never seen in the labeled dataset. To tackle the problem, we propose ORCA, an approach that jointly learns a feature representation and a classifier on the labeled and unlabeled subsets of the data. The key idea in ORCA is in introducing uncertainty based adaptive margin that effectively circumvents the bias caused by the imbalance of variance between seen and novel classes. We demonstrate that ORCA accurately discovers novel classes and assigns samples to previously seen classes on standard benchmark image classification datasets, including  CIFAR and ImageNet. Remarkably, despite solving the harder task ORCA outperforms semi-supervised methods on seen classes, as well as novel class discovery methods on unseen classes, achieving 7% and 151% improvements on seen and unseen classes of the ImageNet dataset."}}

In the representation learning step SSC finds a lower dimensional representation of data points, while in the spectral clustering step data points are clustered according to the underlying subspaces. However, both steps suffer from high computational and memory complexity, preventing the application of SSC to large-scale datasets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Selective Sampling-based Scalable Sparse Subspace Clustering (S5C) algorithm which selects subsamples based on the subgradient approximation and linearly scales with the number of data points in terms of time and memory requirements. Along with the computational advantages, we derive theoretical guarantees for the correctness of S5C. Our theoretical result presents novel contribution for SSC in the case of limited number of subsamples. Extensive experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.  "}}
