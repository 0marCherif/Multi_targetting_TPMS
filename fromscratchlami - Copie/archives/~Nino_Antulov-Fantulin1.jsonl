With an ever-increasing number of questions and high in-flow and out-flow of users in these communities, a key challenge is to design effective strategies for recommending experts for new questions. This requires robust approaches that facilitate modeling users\u2019 expertise given their changing interests and sparse historical data, at the same time being computationally less expensive for periodic updates. In this paper, we propose a simple graph diffusion-based expert recommendation model for CQA, that can outperform state-of-the-art convolutional neural network and transformers-based deep learning representatives and collaborative models. Our proposed method learns users\u2019 expertise in the context of both semantic and temporal information to capture their changing interests and activity levels with time. Experiments on six real-world datasets from the Stack Exchange network demonstrate that our approach outperforms competitive baseline methods. Further, experiments on cold-start users (users with a limited historical record) show our model achieves an average of 50% performance gain compared to the best baseline method."}}

This paper focuses on a complex system whose dynamics is described with a system of such equations, coupled through a complex network. Numerous real-world systems, including financial, social, and neural systems, belong to this class of dynamical models. We propose essential elements for approximating these dynamical systems using neural networks, including necessary biases and an appropriate neural architecture. Emphasizing the differences from static supervised learning, we advocate for evaluating generalization beyond classical assumptions of statistical learning theory. To estimate confidence in prediction during inference time, we introduce a dedicated null model. By studying various complex network dynamics, we demonstrate that the neural approximations of dynamics generalize across complex network structures, sizes, and statistical properties of inputs. Our comprehensive framework enables accurate and reliable deep learning approximations of high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamical systems."}}

By analysing high-frequency market-microstructure observables with different information theoretic measures for dynamical systems, we find temporal changes in information sharing across markets. In particular, we study the time-varying components of predictability, memory, and synchronous coupling, measured by transfer entropy, active information storage, and multi-information. By comparing these empirical findings with several models we argue that some results could relate to intra-market and inter-market regime shifts, and changes in direction of information flow between different market observables."}}

In this Letter we present a versatile neural ordinary-differential-equation control (NODEC) framework with implicit energy regularization and use it to obtain neural-network-generated control signals that can steer dynamical systems towards a desired target state within a predefined amount of time. We demonstrate the ability of NODEC to learn control signals that closely resemble those found by corresponding optimal control frameworks in terms of control energy and deviation from the desired target state. Our results suggest that NODEC is capable to solve a wide range of control and optimization problems, including those that are analytically intractable."}}

To do so, we present a neural-ODE control (NODEC) framework and find that it can learn feedback control signals that drive graph dynamical systems into desired target states. While we use loss functions that do not constrain the control energy, our results show, in accordance with related work, that NODEC produces low energy control signals. Finally, we evaluate the performance and versatility of NODEC against well-known feedback controllers and deep reinforcement learning. We use NODEC to generate feedback controls for systems of more than one thousand coupled, non-linear ODEs that represent epidemic processes and coupled oscillators."}}

We develop a processing pipeline to identify news articles associated with the constituent companies in the S\\&P 500 index, an equity market index that measures the stock performance of U.S. companies. Using machine learning techniques, we extract sentiment scores from the Common Crawl News data and employ tools from information theory to quantify the information transfer from public news articles to the U.S. stock market. Furthermore, we analyze and quantify the economic significance of the news-based information with a simple sentiment-based portfolio trading strategy. Our findings provides support for that information in publicly available news on the World Wide Web has a statistically and economically significant impact on events in financial markets."}}
