Recent works have developed various dynamic weighting algorithms for MOL such as MGDA and its variants, where the central idea is to find an update direction that avoids conflicts among objectives. Albeit its appealing intuition, empirical studies show that dynamic weighting methods may not always outperform static ones. To understand this theory-practical gap, we focus on a new stochastic variant of MGDA - the Multi-objective gradient with Double sampling (MoDo) algorithm, and study the generalization performance of the dynamic weighting-based MoDo and its interplay with optimization through the lens of algorithm stability. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that the key rationale behind MGDA -- updating along conflict-avoidant direction - may hinder dynamic weighting algorithms from achieving the optimal $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ population risk, where  is the number of training samples. We further demonstrate the variability of dynamic weights on the three-way trade-off among optimization, generalization, and conflict avoidance that is unique in MOL."}}

In those settings, the meta model is usually overparameterized. While the conventional statistical learning theory suggests that overparameterized models tend to overfit, empirical evidence reveals that overparameterized meta learning methods still work well -- a phenomenon often called ``benign overfitting.'' To understand this phenomenon, we focus on the meta learning settings with a challenging bilevel structure that we term the gradient-based meta learning, and analyze its generalization performance under an overparameterized meta linear regression model. While our analysis uses the relatively tractable linear models, our theory contributes to understanding the delicate interplay among data heterogeneity, model adaptation and benign overfitting in gradient-based meta learning tasks. We corroborate our theoretical claims through numerical simulations. "}}

Widely used meta learning methods include model agnostic meta learning (MAML), implicit MAML, Bayesian MAML. Thanks to its ability of modeling uncertainty, Bayesian MAML often has advantageous empirical performance. However, the theoretical understanding of Bayesian MAML is still limited, especially on questions such as if and when Bayesian MAML has provably better performance than MAML. In this paper, we aim to provide theoretical justifications for Bayesian MAML\u2019s advantageous performance by comparing the meta test risks of MAML and Bayesian MAML. In the meta linear regression, under both the distribution agnostic and linear centroid cases, we have established that Bayesian MAML indeed has provably lower meta test risks than MAML. We verify our theoretical results through experiments, the code of which is available at https://github.com/lishachen/Bayesian-MAML-vs-MAML."}}

Many studies have employed graph-based deep learning methods to exploit the dependencies among AUs. However, the dependencies among AUs in real world data are often noisy and the uncertainty is essential to be taken into consideration. Rather than employing a deterministic mode, we propose an uncertain graph neural network (UGN) to learn the probabilistic mask that simultaneously captures both the individual dependencies among AUs and the uncertainties. Further, we propose an adaptive weighted loss function based on the epistemic uncertainties to adaptively vary the weights of the training samples during the training process to account for unbalanced data distributions among AUs. We also provide an insightful analysis on how the uncertainties are related to the performance of AU detection. Extensive experiments, conducted on two benchmark datasets, i.e., BP4D and DISFA, demonstrate our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance."}}

We are developing a platform that supports a new type of AI competition that involves both agent-agent and human-agent interactions situated in an immersive environment. In this competition, human buyers haggle (in English) with two life-size AI agents that attempt to sell them various goods.

However, when the testing image is challenging due to low resolution, occlusion or adversarial attacks, the accuracy of a deep neural network suffers greatly. Therefore, it is important to quantify the uncertainty in its predictions. A probabilistic neural network with Gaussian distribution over the target is typically used to quantify uncertainty for regression problems. However, in real-world problems especially computer vision tasks, the Gaussian assumption is too strong. To model more general distributions, such as multi-modal or asymmetric distributions, we propose to develop a kernel density deep neural network. Specifically, for face alignment, we adapt state-of-the-art hourglass neural network into a probabilistic neural network framework with landmark probability map as its output. The model is trained by maximizing the conditional log likelihood. To exploit the output probability map, we extend the model to multi-stage so that the logits map from the previous stage can feed into the next stage to progressively improve the landmark detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art unconstrained deep learning method demonstrate that the proposed kernel density network achieves comparable or superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy. It further provides aleatoric uncertainty estimation in predictions."}}

A Practical Attention-Aware Embodied Agent", "abstract": "Most present-day voice-based assistants require that users utter a wake-up word to signify that they are addressing the assistant. While this may be acceptable for one-shot requests such as \u201cTurn on the lights\u201d, it becomes tiresome when one is engaged in an extended interaction with such an assistant. To support the goal of developing low-complexity, low-cost alternatives to a wake-up word, we present the results of two studies in which users engage with an assistant that infers whether it is being addressed from the user\u2019s head orientation. In the first experiment, we collected informal user feedback regarding a relatively simple application of head orientation as a substitute for a wake-up word. We discuss that feedback and how it influenced the design of a second prototype assistant designed to correct many of the issues identified in the first experiment. The most promising insight was that users were willing to adapt to the interface, leading us to hypothesize that it would be beneficial to provide visual feedback about the assistant\u2019s belief about the user\u2019s attentional state. In a second experiment conducted using the improved assistant, we collected more formal user feedback on likability and usability and used it to establish that, with high confidence, head orientation combined with visual feedback is preferable to the traditional wake-up word approach. We describe the visual feedback mechanisms and quantify their usefulness in the second experiment."}}
