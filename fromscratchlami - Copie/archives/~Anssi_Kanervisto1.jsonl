This paper studies their application as observation-to-action models for imitating human behaviour in sequential environments. Human behaviour is stochastic and multimodal, with structured correlations between action dimensions. Meanwhile, standard modelling choices in behaviour cloning are limited in their expressiveness and may introduce bias into the cloned policy. We begin by pointing out the limitations of these choices. We then propose that diffusion models are an excellent fit for imitating human behaviour, since they learn an expressive distribution over the joint action space. We introduce several innovations to make diffusion models suitable for sequential environments; designing suitable architectures, investigating the role of guidance, and developing reliable sampling strategies. Experimentally, diffusion models closely match human demonstrations in a simulated robotic control task and a modern 3D gaming environment."}}

Yet, reproducing the PPO's results has been challenging in the community.  While recent works conducted ablation studies to provide insight on PPO's implementation details, these works are not structured as tutorials and only focus on details concerning robotics tasks. As a result, reproducing PPO from scratch can become a daunting experience. Instead of introducing additional improvements, or doing further ablation studies, this blog post takes a step back and focuses on delivering a thorough reproduction of PPO in all accounts, as well as aggregating, documenting, and cataloging its most salient implementation details. This blog post also points out software engineering challenges in PPO and further efficiency improvement via the accelerated vectorized environments. With these, we believe this blog post will help people understand PPO faster and better, facilitating customization and research upon this versatile RL algorithm."}}

For example, the CM can first determine whether the input is human speech, then the ASV can determine whether this speech matches the speaker&#x2019;s identity. The performance of such a tandem system can be measured with a tandem detection cost function (t-DCF). However, ASV and CM systems are usually trained separately, using different metrics and data, which does not optimize their combined performance. In this work, we propose to optimize the tandem system directly by creating a differentiable version of t-DCF and employing techniques from reinforcement learning. The results indicate that these approaches offer better outcomes than finetuning, with our method providing a 20&#x0025; relative improvement in the t-DCF in the ASVSpoof19 dataset in a constrained setting."}}

A common understanding is that A2C and PPO are separate algorithms because PPO's clipped objective appears significantly different than A2C's objective. In this paper, however, we show A2C is a special case of PPO. We present theoretical justifications and pseudocode analysis to demonstrate why. To validate our claim, we conduct an empirical experiment using \\texttt{Stable-baselines3}, showing A2C and PPO produce the \\textit{exact} same models when other settings are controlled."}}

Both traditional software-based methods and statistical systems have been successful in protecting against cheating, but recent advances in the automatic generation of content, such as images or speech, threaten the video game industry; they could be used to generate artificial gameplay indistinguishable from that of legitimate human players. To better understand this threat, we begin by reviewing the current state of multiplayer video game cheating, and then proceed to build a proof-of-concept method, GAN-Aimbot. By gathering data from various players in a first-person shooter game we show that the method improves players' performance while remaining hidden from automatic and manual protection mechanisms. By sharing this work we hope to raise awareness on this issue and encourage further research into protecting the gaming communities."}}

To promote the development of more broadly applicable methods, organizers need to enforce the use of general techniques, the use of sample-efficient methods, and the reproducibility of the results. While beneficial for the research community, these restrictions come at a cost -- increased difficulty. If the barrier for entry is too high, many potential participants are demoralized. With this in mind, we hosted the third edition of the MineRL ObtainDiamond competition, MineRL Diamond 2021, with a separate track in which we permitted any solution to promote the participation of newcomers. With this track and more extensive tutorials and support, we saw an increased number of submissions. The participants of this easier track were able to obtain a diamond, and the participants of the harder track progressed the generalizable solutions in the same task."}}
