A popular approach for dealing with the large label space is to arrange the labels into a shallow tree-based index and then learn an ML model to efficiently search this index via beam search. Existing methods initialize the tree index by clustering the label space into a few mutually exclusive clusters based on pre-defined features and keep it fixed throughout the training procedure. This approach results in a sub-optimal indexing structure over the label space and limits the search performance to the quality of choices made during the initialization of the index. In this paper, we propose a novel method ELIAS which relaxes the tree-based index to a specialized weighted graph-based index which is learned end-to-end with the final task objective. More specifically, ELIAS models the discrete cluster-to-label assignments in the existing tree-based index as soft learnable parameters that are learned jointly with the rest of the ML model. ELIAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on several large-scale extreme classification benchmarks with millions of labels. In particular, ELIAS can be up to 2.5% better at precision@$1$ and up to 4% better at recall@$100$ than existing XMC methods. A PyTorch implementation of ELIAS along with other resources is available at https://github.com/nilesh2797/ELIAS."}}

DRONE can be applied to both fully connected and self-attention layers appearing in the BERT model. In addition to compressing standard models, out method can also be used on distilled BERT models to further improve compression rate. Experimental results show that DRONE is able to improve both model size and inference speed with limited loss in accuracy. Specifically, DRONE alone achieves 1.92x speedup on the MRPC task with only 1.5% loss in accuracy, and when DRONE is combined with distillation, it further achieves over 12.3x speedup on various natural language inference tasks."}}

However, these language-model-based encoders are difficult to train due to their large parameter\nsize and high computational complexity. By carefully examining the training procedure,\nwe observe that the softmax layer, which predicts a distribution of the target word, often induces significant overhead, especially when the vocabulary size is large. Therefore, we revisit the design of the output layer and consider directly predicting the pre-trained embedding of the target word for a given context. When applied to ELMo, the proposed approach achieves a 4-fold speedup and eliminates 80% trainable parameters while achieving competitive performance on downstream tasks. Further analysis shows that the approach maintains the speed advantage under various settings, even when the sentence encoder is scaled up."}}

A natural way to tackle this problem is to replace the human-designed optimizer by an LSTM network and train the parameters on some simple optimization problems (Andrychowicz et al., 2016).  Despite their success compared to traditional optimizers such as SGD on a short horizon, theselearnt (meta-) optimizers suffer from two key deficiencies: they fail to converge(or can even diverge) on a longer horizon (e.g., 10000 steps). They also often fail to generalize to new tasks. To address the convergence problem, we rethink the architecture design of the meta-optimizer and develop an embarrassingly simple,yet powerful form of meta-optimizers\u2014a coordinate-wise RNN model. We provide insights into the problems with the previous designs of each component and re-design our SimpleOptimizer to resolve those issues. Furthermore, we propose anew mechanism to allow information sharing between coordinates which enables the meta-optimizer to exploit second-order information with negligible overhead.With these designs, our proposed SimpleOptimizer outperforms previous meta-optimizers and can successfully converge to optimal solutions in the long run.Furthermore, our empirical results show that these benefits can be obtained with much smaller models compared to the previous ones."}}

However, it is challenging to deploy these models on mobile devices due to their slow prediction speed, where the bottleneck is to compute top candidates in the softmax layer. In this paper, we introduce a novel softmax layer approximation algorithm by exploiting the clustering structure of context vectors. Our algorithm uses a light-weight screening model to predict a much smaller set of candidate words based on the given context, and then conducts an exact softmax only within that subset. Training such a procedure end-to-end is challenging as traditional clustering methods are discrete and non-differentiable, and thus unable to be used with back-propagation in the training process. Using the Gumbel softmax, we are able to train the screening model end-to-end on the training set to exploit data distribution. The algorithm achieves an order of magnitude faster inference than the original softmax layer for predicting top-k words in various tasks such as beam search in machine translation or next words prediction. For example, for machine translation task on German to English dataset with around 25K vocabulary, we can achieve 20.4 times speed up with 98.9% precision@1 and 99.3% precision@5 with the original softmax layer prediction, while state-of-the-art (Zhang et al., 2018) only achieves 6.7x speedup with 98.7% precision@1 and 98.1% precision@5 for the same task."}}
