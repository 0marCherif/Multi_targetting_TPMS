For this setting, we design a novel sample-efficient algorithm GP-MRO, which sequentially learns about the unknown objective from noisy point evaluations. GP-MRO seeks to discover a robust and randomized mixed strategy, that maximizes the worst-case expected objective value. To achieve this, it combines techniques from online learning with nonparametric confidence bounds from Gaussian processes. Our theoretical results characterize the number of samples required by GP-MRO to discover a robust near-optimal mixed strategy for different GP kernels of interest. We experimentally demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on synthetic datasets and on human-assisted trajectory planning tasks for autonomous vehicles. In our simulations, we show that robust deterministic strategies can be overly conservative, while the mixed strategies found by GP-MRO significantly improve the overall performance."}}

This problem arises in applications such as surveillance, emergency rescue, and autonomous driving. It is a challenging problem due to modeling and integrating dynamical uncertainties into a safe planning framework, and finding a solution in a computationally tractable way. In this work, we first develop a probabilistic model for dynamical uncertainties. Then, we provide a framework to generate a path that maximizes safety for complex missions by incorporating the uncertainty model. We also devise a Monte Carlo method to obtain a safe path efficiently. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our approach and compare it to potential alternatives in several case studies."}}

Dispatched rates include fine-grained data on aggregate electricity consumption in a zone and could potentially be used to infer a household's pattern of energy use or its occupancy. In this paper, we propose Blowfish privacy to protect the occupancy state of the houses connected to a smart grid. First, we introduce a Markov model of the relationship between electricity rate and electricity consumption. Next, we develop an algorithm that perturbs electricity rates before publishing them to ensure users' privacy. Last, the proposed algorithm is tested on data inspired by household occupancy models and its performance is compared to an alternative solution."}}

This problem arises in safety-critical applications, where certain parameters need to be adapted online in a data-driven fashion, such as in personalized medicine, robotics, manufacturing, etc. In such cases, it is important to ensure constraints are not violated while taking measurements and seeking the minimum of the cost function. We propose a new algorithm s0-LBM, which provides provably feasible iterates with high probability and applies to the challenging case of uncertain zero-th order oracle. We also analyze the convergence rate of the algorithm, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness."}}

Subspace constraints naturally arise in the field of distributed control and present a significant challenge in the sense that standard model-based optimization and learning leads to intractable numerical programs in general. Building upon recent results in zeroth-order optimization, we establish model-free sample-complexity bounds for the class of distributed LQ problems where a local gradient dominance constant exists on any sublevel set of the cost function. %which admit a local gradient dominance constant valid on the sublevel set of the cost function. We prove that a fundamental class of distributed control problems - commonly referred to as Quadratically Invariant (QI) problems - as well as others possess this property. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first sample-complexity bound guarantee on learning globally optimal distributed output-feedback control policies."}}

Our goal in this paper is to find a set of actuators minimizing the metric that measures the average energy consumption of the control inputs while ensuring structural controllability of the network. As this problem is intractable, greedy algorithm can be used to obtain an approximate solution. To provide a performance guarantee for this approach, we first define the submodularity ratio for the metric under consideration and then reformulate the structural controllability constraint as a matroid constraint. This shows that the problem under study can be characterized by a matroid optimization involving a weakly submodular objective function. Then, we derive a novel performance guarantee for the greedy algorithm applied to this class of optimization problems. Finally, we show that the matroid feasibility check for the greedy algorithm can be cast as a maximum matching problem in a certain auxiliary bipartite graph related to the network graph."}}

We propose a distributed algorithm to learn a Nash equilibrium, whereby each agent uses only obtained values of her cost function at each joint played action, lacking any information of the functional form of her cost or other agents' costs or strategy sets. In contrast to past work where convergent algorithms required strong monotonicity, we prove algorithm convergence under mere monotonicity assumption. This significantly widens algorithm's applicability, such as to games with linear coupling constraints."}}

Single player online learning algorithms attain strong regret bounds when provided with full information feedback, which unfortunately is unavailable in many real-world scenarios. Bandit feedback alone, i.e., observing outcomes only for the selected action, yields substantially worse performance. In this paper, we consider a natural model where, besides a noisy measurement of the obtained reward, the player can also observe the opponents' actions. This feedback model, together with a regularity assumption on the reward function, allows us to exploit the correlations among different game outcomes by means of Gaussian processes (GPs). We propose a novel confidence-bound based bandit algorithm GP-MW, which utilizes the GP model for the reward function and runs a multiplicative weight (MW) method. We obtain novel kernel-dependent regret bounds that are comparable to the known bounds in the full information setting, while substantially improving upon the existing bandit results. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of GP-MW in random matrix games, as well as real-world problems of traffic routing and movie recommendation. In our experiments, GP-MW consistently outperforms several baselines, while its performance is often comparable to methods that have access to full information feedback."}}

As second contribution, we propose two decentralized algorithms that converge to such equilibria and are capable of coping with constraints coupling the strategies of different agents. Finally, we study the applications of charging of electric vehicles and of route choice on a road network."}}

For such games, simple no-regret learning algorithms exist in several cases and ensure convergence to coarse correlated equilibria (CCE). The efficiency of such equilibria with respect to a social function, however, is not well understood. In this paper, we define the class of valid utility games with continuous strategies and provide efficiency bounds for their CCEs. Our bounds rely on the social function being a monotone DR-submodular function. We further refine our bounds based on the curvature of the social function. Furthermore, we extend our efficiency bounds to a class of non-submodular functions that satisfy approximate submodularity properties. Finally, we show that valid utility games with continuous strategies can be designed to maximize monotone DR-submodular functions subject to disjoint constraints with approximation guarantees. The approximation guarantees we derive are based on the efficiency of the equilibria of such games and can improve the existing ones in the literature. We illustrate and validate our results on a budget allocation game and a sensor coverage problem."}}
