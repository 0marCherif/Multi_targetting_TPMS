Although the emphasis fundamentally depends on an interest function which defines the intrinsic importance of each state, most approaches simply adopt a uniform interest over all states (except where a hand-designed interest is possible based on domain knowledge). In this paper, we investigate adaptive methods that allow the interest function to dynamically vary over states and iterations. In particular, we leverage meta-gradients to automatically discover online an interest function that would accelerate the agent\u2019s learning process. Empirical evaluations on a wide range of environments show that adapting the interest is key to provide significant gains. Qualitative analysis indicates that the learned interest function emphasizes states of particular importance, such as bottlenecks, which can be especially useful in a transfer learning setting."}}

Using two separate networks enables the agent to hedge against issues that arise when performing bootstrapping. In this paper we endow two popular deep reinforcement learning algorithms, namely DQN and Rainbow, with updates that incentivize the online network to remain in the proximity of the target network. This improves the robustness of deep reinforcement learning in presence of noisy updates. The resultant agents, called DQN Pro and Rainbow Pro, exhibit significant performance improvements over their original counterparts on the Atari benchmark demonstrating the effectiveness of this simple idea in deep reinforcement learning.

Proximal Iteration is a computationally efficient technique that enables us to bias the optimization procedure towards more desirable solutions. As a concrete application of Proximal Iteration in deep reinforcement learning, we endow the objective function of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent with a proximal term to ensure that the online-network component of DQN remains in the vicinity of the target network. The resultant agent, which we call DQN with Proximal Iteration, or DQNPro, exhibits significant improvements over the original DQN on the Atari benchmark. Our results accentuate the power of employing sound optimization techniques for deep reinforcement learning."}}

We propose an algorithm for batch RL, where effective policies are learned using only a fixed offline dataset instead of online interactions with the environment. The limited data in batch RL produces inherent uncertainty in value estimates of states/actions that were insufficiently represented in the training data. This leads to particularly severe extrapolation when our candidate policies diverge from one that generated the data. We propose to mitigate this issue via two straightforward penalties: a policy-constraint to reduce this divergence and a value-constraint that discourages overly optimistic estimates. Over a comprehensive set of $32$ continuous-action batch RL benchmarks, our approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods, regardless of how the offline data were collected."}}

This operation is often challenging when the learned value function takes continuous actions as input. We introduce deep radial-basis value functions (RBVFs): value functions learned using a deep network with a radial-basis function (RBF) output layer. We show that the maximum action-value with respect to a deep RBVF can be approximated easily and accurately. Moreover, deep RBVFs can represent any true value function owing to their support for universal function approximation. We extend the standard DQN algorithm to continuous control by endowing the agent with a deep RBVF. We show that the resultant agent, called RBF-DQN, significantly outperforms value-function-only baselines, and is competitive with state-of-the-art actor-critic algorithms."}}
