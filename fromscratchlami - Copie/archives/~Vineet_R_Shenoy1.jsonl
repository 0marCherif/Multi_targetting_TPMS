Despite the challenges, multi-camera vehicle tracking has immense potential in transportation applications including speed, volume, origin-destination (O-D), and routing data generation. Several recent works have addressed the multi-camera tracking problem. However, most of the effort has gone towards improving accuracy on high-quality benchmark datasets while disregarding lower camera resolutions, compression artifacts and the overwhelming amount of computational power and time needed to carry out this task on its edge and thus making it prohibitive for large-scale and real-time deployment. Therefore, in this work we shed light on practical issues that should be addressed for the design of a multi-camera tracking system to provide actionable and timely insights. Moreover, we propose a real-time city-scale multi-camera vehicle tracking system that compares favorably to computationally intensive alternatives and handles real-world, low-resolution CCTV instead of idealized and curated video streams. To show its effectiveness, in addition to integration into the Regional Integrated Transportation Information System (RITIS), we participated in the 2021 NVIDIA AI City multi-camera tracking challenge and our method is ranked among the top five performers on the public leaderboard."}}

Among these technologies is Vehicle Re-Identification which is one of the key elements in city-scale vehicle analytics systems. Many state-of-the-art solutions for vehicle re-id mostly focus on improving the accuracy on existing re-id benchmarks and often ignore computational complexity. To balance the demands of accuracy and computational efficiency, in this work we propose a simple yet effective hybrid solution empowered by self-supervised training which only uses a single network during inference time and is free of intricate and computation-demanding add-on modules often seen in state-of-the-art approaches. Through extensive experiments, we show our approach, termed Self-Supervised and Boosted VEhicle Re-Identification (SSBVER), is on par with state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of accuracy without introducing any additional overhead during deployment. Additionally we show that our approach, generalizes to different backbone architectures which facilitates various resource constraints and consistently results in a significant accuracy boost."}}

Both vehicle re-id and multi-camera tracking are challenging due to variations in aspect-ratio, occlusion, and orientation. Robust re-id and tracking systems must consider small scale variations in a vehicle's appearance to accurately distinguish among vehicles of the same make, model, and color. Scalability is critical for multi-camera systems, as the number of objects in a scene is not known a-priori. Anomaly detection presents a unique challenge due to a dearth of annotations and varied video quality. In this paper, we address the task of vehicle re-id by introducing an unsupervised excitation layer to enhance representation learning. We propose a multi-camera tracking pipeline leveraging this re-id feature extractor to compute a distance matrix and perform clustering to obtain multi-camera vehicle trajectories. Lastly, we leverage background modeling techniques to localize anomalies such as stalled vehicles and collisions. We show the effectiveness of our proposed method on the NVIDIA AI City Challenge, where we obtain 7th place out of 41 teams for the task of vehicle re-id, with an mAP score of 66.68% and achieve state-of-the-art results on the Vehicle-ID dataset. We also obtain an IDF1 score of 12.45% on multi-camera vehicle tracking, and an S4 score of 29.52% for task of anomaly detection, ranking in the top 5 for both tracks."}}

The standards body formulating various specifications for the CBRS operation has taken these timing constraints into consideration in the Spectrum Access System (SAS) - CBRS Device (CBSD) protocol. A transmitting CBSD continually heartbeats with its SAS. When required, the SAS sends commands to vacate a channel through these heartbeat messages. In this paper, we study the impact of the heartbeat interval on the CBRS system in terms of meeting the FCC timing constraints. We also study how the heartbeat interval can overload a SAS and how it can be used to determine the number of CBSDs a SAS can serve without causing unnecessary suspension of CBSD transmissions. We show the tradeoff between using a short heartbeat interval to meet the timing constraint early and the number of CBSDs that can be served by a SAS without causing unnecessary suspension of CBSD transmissions."}}
