Nevertheless, transferring practices between healthcare organizations is a challenging and under explored task. In this paper, we take a step towards enabling the transfer of best practices by identifying the likely beneficial opportunities for such transfer. Specifically, we analyze the output of machine learning models trained at different organizations with the aims of (i) detecting the opportunity for the transfer of best practices, and (ii) providing a stop-gap solution while the actual transfer process takes place. We show the benefits of this methodology on a dataset of medical inpatient claims, demonstrating our ability to identify practice gaps and to support the transfer processes that address these gaps."}}

Due to the unstructured nature of these narratives, providers employ dedicated staff to assign diagnostic codes to patients' diagnoses using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding system. This manual process is not only time-consuming but also costly and error-prone. Prior work demonstrated potential utility of Machine Learning (ML) methodology in automating this process, but it has relied on large quantities of manually labeled data to train the models. Additionally, diagnostic coding systems evolve with time, which makes traditional supervised learning strategies unable to generalize beyond local applications. In this work, we introduce a general weakly-supervised text classification framework that learns from class-label descriptions only, without the need to use any human-labeled documents. It leverages the linguistic domain knowledge stored within pre-trained language models and the data programming framework to assign code labels to individual texts. We demonstrate the efficacy and flexibility of our method by comparing it to state-of-the-art weak text classifiers across four real-world text classification datasets, in addition to assigning ICD codes to medical notes in the publicly available MIMIC-III database."}}

Abstract We present a statistical inference model for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of hospital associated infection. The approach combines patient exposures, determined from electronic medical records, and pathogen similarity, determined by whole-genome sequencing, to simultaneously identify probable outbreaks and their root-causes. We show how our model can be used to target isolates for whole-genome sequencing, improving outbreak detection and characterization even without comprehensive sequencing. Additionally, we demonstrate how to learn model parameters from reference data of known outbreaks. We demonstrate model performance using semi-synthetic experiments.

Few models exist that reliably determine prognosis among comatose post-arrest patients within hours of hospital admission. We present an efficient method designed to detect anomalous patterns in streaming EEG data that combines scan statistics with multiple structural break tests. Some patterns of change show non-trivial power in prognosticating patient outcomes at clinically relevant prediction horizons. Empirical evaluation of the proposed method shows its potential utility in determining cardiac arrest patient outcomes earlier and more confidently than existing alternatives."}}

CLR aims to find the partition of the data into $k$ clusters, such that linear regressions fitted to each of the clusters minimize overall mean squared error on the whole data. The main obstacle preventing to use found regression models for prediction on the unseen test points is the absence of a reasonable way to obtain CLR cluster labels when the values of target variable are unknown. In this paper we propose two novel approaches on how to solve this problem. The first approach, predictive CLR builds a separate classification model to predict test CLR labels. The second approach, constrained CLR utilizes a set of user-specified constraints that enforce certain points to go to the same clusters. Assuming the constraint values are known for the test points, they can be directly used to assign CLR labels. We evaluate these two approaches on three UCI ML datasets as well as on a large corpus of health insurance claims. We show that both of the proposed algorithms significantly improve over the known CLR-based regression methods. Moreover, predictive CLR consistently outperforms linear regression and random forest, and shows comparable performance to support vector regression on UCI ML datasets. The constrained CLR approach achieves the best performance on the health insurance dataset, while enjoying only $\\approx 20$ times increased computational time over linear regression."}}
