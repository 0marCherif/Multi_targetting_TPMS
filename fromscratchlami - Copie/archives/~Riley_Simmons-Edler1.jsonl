Several recent methods provide an intrinsic motivation to explore by directly encouraging agents to seek novel states. A potential disadvantage of pure state novelty-seeking behavior is that unknown states are treated equally regardless of their potential for future reward. In this paper, we propose an exploration objective using the temporal difference error experienced on extrinsic rewards as a secondary reward signal for exploration in deep reinforcement learning. Our objective yields novelty-seeking in the absence of extrinsic reward, while accelerating exploration of reward-relevant states in sparse (but nonzero) reward landscapes. This objective draws inspiration from dopaminergic pathways in the brain that influence animal behavior. We implement the objective with an adversarial Q-learning method in which Q and Qx are the action-value functions for extrinsic and secondary rewards, respectively. Secondary reward is given by the absolute value of the TD-error of Q. Training is off-policy, based on a replay buffer containing a mix of trajectories sampled using Q and Qx.  We characterize performance on a set of continuous control benchmark tasks, and demonstrate comparable or faster convergence on all tasks when compared with other state-of-the-art exploration methods."}}

Standard methods for applying Q-learning to continuous-valued action domains involve iteratively sampling the Q-function to find a good action (e.g. via hill-climbing), or by learning a policy network at the same time as the Q-function (e.g. DDPG). Both approaches make tradeoffs between stability, speed, and accuracy. We propose a novel approach, called Cross-Entropy Guided Policies, or CGP, that draws inspiration from both classes of techniques. CGP aims to combine the stability and performance of iterative sampling policies with the low computational cost of a policy network. Our approach trains the Q-function using iterative sampling with the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM), while training a policy network to imitate CEM's sampling behavior. We demonstrate that our method is more stable to train than state of the art policy network methods, while preserving equivalent inference time compute costs, and achieving competitive total reward on standard benchmarks."}}
