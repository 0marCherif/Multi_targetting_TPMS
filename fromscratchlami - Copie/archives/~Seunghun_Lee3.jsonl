To do so, we design a multi-target domain transfer network (MTDT-Net) that aligns visual attributes across domains by transferring the domain distinctive features through a new target adaptive denormalization (TAD) module. Moreover, we propose a bi-directional adaptive region selection (BARS) that reduces the attribute ambiguity among the class labels by adaptively selecting the regions with consistent feature statistics. We show that our single MTDT-Net can synthesize visually pleasing domain transferred images with complex driving datasets, and BARS effectively filters out the unnecessary region of training images for each target domain. With the collaboration of MTDT-Net and BARS, our ADAS achieves state-of-the-art performance for multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA). To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first MTDA method that directly adapts to multiple domains in semantic segmentation."}}

Unlike the existing domain adaptation methods that learn associated features sharing a domain, DRANet preserves the distinctiveness of each domain's characteristics. Our model encodes individual representations of content (scene structure) and style (artistic appearance) from both source and target images. Then, it adapts the domain by incorporating the transferred style factor into the content factor along with learnable weights specified for each domain. This learning framework allows bi-/multi-directional domain adaptation with a single encoder-decoder network and aligns their domain shift. Additionally, we propose a content-adaptive domain transfer module that helps retain scene structure while transferring style. Extensive experiments show our model successfully separates content-style factors and synthesizes visually pleasing domain-transferred images. The proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on standard digit classification tasks as well as semantic segmentation tasks."}}
