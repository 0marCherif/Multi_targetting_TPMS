This is a particularly challenging problem being faced by small and marginal farmers in any emerging economy. Farmer collectives (FCs), which are cooperative societies of farmers, offer an excellent prospect for enabling cost-effective procurement of inputs with assured quality to the farmers. In this paper, our objective is to design sound, explainable mechanisms by which an FC will be able to procure agri-inputs in bulk and distribute the inputs procured to the individual farmers who are members of the FC. In the methodology proposed here, an FC engages qualified suppliers in a competitive, volume discount procurement auction in which the suppliers specify price discounts based on volumes supplied. The desiderata of properties for such an auction include: minimization of the total cost of procurement; incentive compatibility; individual rationality; fairness; and other business constraints. An auction satisfying all these properties is analytically infeasible and a key contribution of this paper is to develop a deep learning based approach to design such an auction. We use two realistic, stylized case studies from chili seeds procurement and a popular pesticide procurement to demonstrate the efficacy of these auctions."}}

But this reliance can be abused -- strategic machines might craft representations that manipulate their users. How can a user make good choices based on strategic representations? We formalize this as a learning problem, and pursue algorithms for decision-making that are robust to manipulation. In our main setting of interest, the system represents attributes of an item to the user, who then decides whether or not to consume. We model this interaction through the lens of strategic classification (Hardt et al. 2016), reversed: the user, who learns, plays first; and the system, which responds, plays second. The system must respond with representations that reveal `nothing but the truth' but need not reveal the entire truth. Thus, the user faces the problem of learning set functions under strategic subset selection, which presents distinct algorithmic and statistical challenges. Our main result is a learning algorithm that minimizes error despite strategic representations, and our theoretical analysis sheds light on the trade-off between learning effort and susceptibility to manipulation."}}

In many of these applications, the time horizon is unknown to the decision-maker beforehand, which motivates the study of the IMAB problem in the technically more challenging horizon-unaware setting. We study the tension that arises between two seemingly conflicting objectives in the horizon-unaware setting: a) maximizing the cumulative reward at any time based on current rewards of the arms, and b) ensuring that arms with better long-term rewards get sufficient opportunities even if they initially have low rewards. We show that, surprisingly, the two objectives are aligned with each other in this setting. Our main contribution is an anytime algorithm for the IMAB problem that achieves the best possible cumulative reward while ensuring that the arms reach their true potential given sufficient time.

This work considers an interesting variant of the problem where agents are embedded on a graph. The graphical constraint entails that each agent evaluates her allocated share only against her neighbors' share. Given a graph, the goal is to efficiently find a \\emph{locally envy-free} allocation where every agent values her share of the cake to be at least as much as that of any of her neighbors' share. The most significant contribution of this work is a bounded protocol that finds a locally envy-free allocation among $n$ agents on a tree graph using $n^{O(n)}$ queries under the standard Robertson-Webb (RW) query model. The query complexity of our proposed protocol, though exponential, significantly improves the currently best known hyper-exponential query complexity bound of Aziz and Mackenzie [AM16] for complete graphs. In particular, we also show that if the underlying tree graph has a depth of at most two, one can find a locally envy-free allocation with $O(n^4 \\log n)$ RW queries. This is the first and the only known locally envy-free cake cutting protocol with polynomial query complexity for a non-trivial graph structure. Interestingly, our discrete protocols are simple and easy to understand, as opposed to highly involved protocol of [AM16]. This simplicity can be attributed to their recursive nature and the use of a single agent as a designated \\emph{cutter}. We believe that these results will help us improve our algorithmic understanding of the arguably challenging problem of envy-free cake-cutting by uncovering the bottlenecks in its query complexity and its relation to the underlying graph structures."}}
