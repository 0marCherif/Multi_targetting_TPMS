Statistical models, fitted with survey or health system data, can be combined with lab and field studies to provide reliable predictions of future population-level disease dynamics distributions and the effects of interventions. All too often, however, the end result of epidemiological modeling and cost-effectiveness studies is in the form of a report or journal paper. These are inherently limited in their coverage of locations, policy options, and derived outcome measures. Here, we describe a tool to support population health policy planning. The tool allows users to explore simulations of various policies, to view and compare interventions spanning multiple variables, time points, and locations. The design's modular architecture, and data representation separate the modeling methods, the outcome measures calculations, and the visualizations, making each component easily replaceable. These advantages make it extremely versatile and suitable for multiple uses."}}

Here we reveal that this continuous stream of affective information is commonly represented in the brains of different listeners and that particular musical attributes mediate this link. We examined participants' brain responses to two naturalistic musical pieces using functional Magnetic Resonance imaging (fMRI). Following scanning, as participants listened to the musical pieces for a second time, they continuously indicated their emotional experience on scales of valence and arousal. These continuous reports were used along with a detailed annotation of the musical features, to predict a novel index of Dynamic Common Activation (DCA) derived from ten large-scale data-driven functional networks. We found an association between the unfolding music-induced emotionality and the DCA modulation within a vast network of limbic regions. The limbic-DCA modulation further corresponded with continuous changes in two temporal musical features: beat-strength and tempo. Remarkably, this \u201ccollective limbic sensitivity\u201d to temporal features was found to mediate the link between limbic-DCA and the reported emotionality. An additional association with the emotional experience was found in a left fronto-parietal network, but only among a sub-group of participants with a high level of musical experience (>\u00a05\u00a0years). These findings may indicate two processing-levels underlying the unfolding of common music emotionality; (1) a widely shared core-affective process that is confined to a limbic network and mediated by temporal regularities in music and (2) an experience based process that is rooted in a left fronto-parietal network that may involve functioning of the \u2018mirror-neuron system\u2019.

The solution is being used by IBM services groups that support IBM xSeries\u00ae servers on a regular basis. MELODY was recently tested with ten large IBM customers who use zSeries\u00ae machines and was found to be extremely useful for the information technology experts in those companies.

Second, analysis of the characteristics of such methods can reveal the significance of various features of neural activity, stimuli and responses to the encoding-decoding task. In this study we adapted, implemented and tested a machine learning method, called Kernel Auto-Regressive Moving Average (KARMA), for the task of inferring movements from neural activity in primary motor cortex. Our version of this algorithm is used in an on-line learning setting and is updated when feedback from the last inferred sequence become available. We first used it to track real hand movements executed by a monkey in a standard 3D motor control task. We then applied it in a closed-loop BMI setting to infer intended movement, while arms were restrained, allowing a monkey to perform the task using the BMI alone. KARMA is a recurrent method that learns a nonlinear model of output dynamics. It uses similarity functions (termed kernels) to compare between inputs. These kernels can be structured to incorporate domain knowledge into the method. We compare KARMA to various state-of-the-art methods by evaluating tracking performance and present results from the KARMA based BMI experiments."}}
