In this paper, we tackle the problem of drivable road boundary extraction from LiDAR and camera imagery. Towards this goal, we design a structured model where a fully convolutional network obtains deep features encoding the location and direction of road boundaries and then, a convolutional recurrent network outputs a polyline representation for each one of them. Importantly, our method is fully automatic and does not require a user in the loop. We showcase the effectiveness of our method on a large North American city where we obtain perfect topology of road boundaries 99.3% of the time at a high precision and recall."}}

Towards this goal, given multiple LiDAR sweeps and the corresponding imagery, we project both inputs onto the ground surface to produce a top down view of the scene. We then leverage convolutional neural networks to extract semantic cues about the location of the crosswalks. These are then used in combination with road centerlines from freely available maps (e.g., OpenStreetMaps) to solve a structured optimization problem which draws the final crosswalk boundaries. Our experiments over crosswalks in a large city area show that 96.6% automation can be achieved."}}

Our benchmark provides different perspectives of the world captured from airplanes, drones and cars driving around the city. Manually labeling such a large scale dataset is infeasible. Instead, we propose to utilize different sources of high-precision maps to create our ground truth. Towards this goal, we develop algorithms that allow us to align all data sources with the maps while requiring minimal human supervision. We have designed a wide variety of tasks including building height estimation (reconstruction), road centerline and curb extraction, building instance segmentation, building contour extraction (reorganization), semantic labeling and scene type classification (recognition). Our pilot study shows that most of these tasks are still difficult for modern convolutional neural networks."}}
