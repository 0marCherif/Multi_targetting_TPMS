We use existing spatially invariant deconvolution methods in a local and robust way to compute initial estimates of the latent image. The camera motion is represented as a Motion Density Function (MDF) which records the fraction of time spent in each discretized portion of the space of all possible camera poses. Spatially varying blur kernels are derived directly from the MDF. We show that 6D camera motion is well approximated by 3 degrees of motion (in-plane translation and rotation) and analyze the scope of this approximation. We present results on both synthetic and captured data. Our system out-performs current approaches which make the assumption of spatially invariant blur."}}
