The recent success of data-driven FWI methods results in a rapidly increasing demand for open datasets to serve the geophysics community. We present OpenFWI, a collection of large-scale multi-structural benchmark datasets, to facilitate diversified, rigorous, and reproducible research on FWI. In particular, OpenFWI consists of $12$ datasets ($2.1$TB in total) synthesized from multiple sources. It encompasses diverse domains in geophysics (interface, fault, CO$_2$ reservoir, etc.), covers different geological subsurface structures (flat, curve, etc.), and contain various amounts of data samples (2K - 67K). It also includes a dataset for 3D FWI. Moreover, we use OpenFWI to perform benchmarking over four deep learning methods, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning regimes. Along with the benchmarks, we implement additional experiments, including physics-driven methods, complexity analysis, generalization study, uncertainty quantification, and so on, to sharpen our understanding of datasets and methods. The studies either provide valuable insights into the datasets and the performance, or uncover their current limitations. We hope OpenFWI supports prospective research on FWI and inspires future open-source efforts on AI for science. All datasets and related information can be accessed through our website at https://openfwi-lanl.github.io/"}}

However, it is not clear if Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) can similarly benefit from such a technique. In this paper, inspired by the similarity between CNNs and GCNs, we study the impact of the Global Self-attention mechanism on GCNs. We find that consistent with the intuition, the GSA mechanism allows GCNs to capture feature-based vertex relations regardless of edge connections; As a result, the GSA mechanism can introduce extra expressive power to the GCNs. Furthermore, we analyze the impacts of the GSA mechanism on the issues of overfitting and over-smoothing. We prove that the GSA mechanism can alleviate both the overfitting and the over-smoothing issues based on some recent technical developments. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets illustrate both superior expressive power and less significant overfitting and over-smoothing problems for the GSA-augmented GCNs, which corroborate the intuitions and the theoretical results."}}
