However, when it comes to nonconvex minimax optimization, direct extensions of such adaptive optimizers without proper time-scale separation may fail to work in practice. We provide such an example proving that the simple combination of Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA) with adaptive stepsizes can diverge if the primal-dual stepsize ratio is not carefully chosen; hence, a fortiori, such adaptive extensions are not parameter-agnostic. To address the issue, we formally introduce a Nested Adaptive framework, NeAda for short, that carries an inner loop for adaptively maximizing the dual variable with controllable stopping criteria and an outer loop for adaptively minimizing the primal variable. Such mechanism can be equipped with off-the-shelf adaptive optimizers and automatically balance the progress in the primal and dual variables. Theoretically, for nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax problems, we show that NeAda with AdaGrad stepsizes can achieve the near-optimal $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ gradient complexities respectively in the deterministic and stochastic settings, without prior information on the problem's smoothness and strong concavity parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that simultaneously achieves near-optimal convergence rates and parameter-agnostic adaptation in the nonconvex minimax setting. Numerically, we further illustrate the robustness of the NeAda family with experiments on simple test functions and a real-world application.\n"}}

Albeit its desirable simplicity, recent work shows inferior convergence rates of GDA in theory even assuming strong concavity of the objective on one side. This paper establishes new convergence results for two alternative single-loop algorithms -- alternating GDA and smoothed GDA -- under the mild assumption that the objective satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition about one variable. We prove that, to find an $\\epsilon$-stationary point, (i) alternating GDA and its stochastic variant (without mini batch) respectively require $O(\\kappa^{2} \\epsilon^{-2})$ and $O(\\kappa^{4} \\epsilon^{-4})$ iterations, while (ii) smoothed GDA and its stochastic variant (without mini batch) respectively require $O(\\kappa \\epsilon^{-2})$ and $O(\\kappa^{2} \\epsilon^{-4})$ iterations. The latter greatly improves over the vanilla GDA and gives the hitherto best known complexity results among single-loop algorithms under similar settings. We further showcase the empirical efficiency of these algorithms in training GANs and robust nonlinear regression."}}

Despite its simplicity, this leads to a family of near-optimal algorithms with improved complexity over all existing methods designed for strongly-convex-concave minimax problems. Additionally, we obtain the first variance-reduced algorithms for this class of minimax problems with finite-sum structure and establish even faster convergence rate. Furthermore, when extended to the nonconvex-concave minimax optimization, our algorithm again achieves the state-of-the-art complexity for finding a stationary point.

Simple algorithms such as the gradient descent ascent (GDA) are the common practice for solving these nonconvex games and receive lots of empirical success. Yet, it is known that these vanilla GDA algorithms with constant stepsize can potentially diverge even in the convex setting. In this work, we show that for a subclass of nonconvex-nonconcave objectives satisfying a so-called two-sided Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz inequality, the alternating gradient descent ascent (AGDA) algorithm converges globally at a linear rate and the stochastic AGDA achieves a sublinear rate. We further develop a variance reduced algorithm that attains a provably faster rate than AGDA when the problem has the finite-sum structure."}}
