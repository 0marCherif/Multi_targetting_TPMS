Recent contrastive learning methods have focused on encouraging the learned visual representations to be linearly separable among the individual items regardless of their semantic similarity; however, it could lead to a sub-optimal solution if a given downstream task is related to non-discriminative ones such as cluster analysis and information retrieval. In this work, we propose an advanced approach to consider the instance semantics in an unsupervised environment by both i) Contrasting batch-wise Cluster assignment features and ii) Bootstrapping an INstance representations without considering negatives simultaneously, referred to as C2BIN. Specifically, instances in a mini-batch are appropriately assigned to distinct clusters, each of which aims to capture apparent similarity among instances. Moreover, we introduce a pyramidal multi-heads technique, showing positive effects on the representations by capturing multi-scale semantics. Empirically, our method achieves comparable or better performance than both representation learning and clustering baselines on various benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10."}}

In order to transfer the information from an exemplar to an input image, existing methods often use a normalization technique, e.g., adaptive instance normalization, that controls the channel-wise statistics of an input activation map at a particular layer, such as the mean and the variance. Meanwhile, style transfer approaches similar task to image translation by nature, demonstrated superior performance by using the higher-order statistics such as covariance among channels in representing a style. In detail, it works via whitening (given a zero-mean input feature, transforming its covariance matrix into the identity). followed by coloring (changing the covariance matrix of the whitened feature to those of the style feature). However, applying this approach in image translation is computationally intensive and error-prone due to the expensive time complexity and its non-trivial backpropagation. In response, this paper proposes an end-to-end approach tailored for image translation that efficiently approximates this transformation with our novel regularization methods. We further extend our approach to a group-wise form for memory and time efficiency as well as image quality. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is fast, both in training and inference, and highly effective in reflecting the style of an exemplar."}}
