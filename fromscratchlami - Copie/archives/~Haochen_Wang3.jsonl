To address this limitation, we make the following three contributions. First, we introduce the novel task of Open-Vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation, which aims to simultaneously segment, track, and classify objects in videos from open-set categories, including novel categories unseen during training. Second, to benchmark Open-Vocabulary VIS, we collect a Large-Vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation dataset (LV-VIS), that contains well-annotated objects from 1,196 diverse categories, significantly surpassing the category size of existing datasets by more than one order of magnitude. Third, we propose an efficient Memory-Induced Transformer architecture, OV2Seg, to first achieve Open-Vocabulary VIS in an end-to-end manner with near real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments on LV-VIS and four existing VIS datasets demonstrate the strong zero-shot generalization ability of OV2Seg on novel categories. The dataset and code are released here https://github.com/haochenheheda/LVVIS."}}

In such a task, target ambiguity remains a problem hindering the accuracy and efficiency of segmentation. That is, in scenes with rich context, one click may correspond to multiple potential targets, while most previous interactive segmentors only generate a single mask and fail to deal with target ambiguity. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive segmentation network named PiClick, to yield all potentially reasonable masks and suggest the most plausible one for the user. Specifically, PiClick utilizes a Transformer-based architecture to generate all potential target masks by mutually interactive mask queries. Moreover, a Target Reasoning module is designed in PiClick to automatically suggest the user-desired mask from all candidates, relieving target ambiguity and extra-human efforts. Extensive experiments on 9 interactive segmentation datasets demonstrate PiClick performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts considering the segmentation results. Moreover, we show that PiClick effectively reduces human efforts in annotating and picking the desired masks. To ease the usage and inspire future research, we release the source code of PiClick together with a plug-and-play annotation tool at https://github.com/cilinyan/PiClick."}}

Most of the existing FSS models focus on the feature matching between support and query to tackle FSS. However, the appearance variations between objects from the same category could be extremely large, leading to unreliable feature matching and query mask prediction. To this end, we propose a Support-induced Graph Convolutional Network (SiGCN) to explicitly excavate latent context structure in query images. Specifically, we propose a Support-induced Graph Reasoning (SiGR) module to capture salient query object parts at different semantic levels with a Support-induced GCN. Furthermore, an instance association (IA) module is designed to capture high-order instance context from both support and query instances. By integrating the proposed two modules, SiGCN can learn rich query context representation, and thus being more robust to appearance variations. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i demonstrate that our SiGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance."}}

Existing methods are usually derived from standard detection models and tackle few-shot instance segmentation indirectly by conducting classification, box regression, and mask prediction on a large set of redundant proposals followed by indispensable post-processing, e.g., Non-Maximum Suppression. Such complicated hand-crafted procedures and hyperparameters lead to degraded optimization and insufficient generalization ability. In this work, we propose an end-to-end Dynamic Transformer Network, DTN for short, to directly segment all target object instances from arbitrary categories given by reference images, relieving the requirements of dense proposal generation and post-processing. Specifically, a small set of Dynamic Queries, conditioned on reference images, are exclusively assigned to target object instances and generate all the instance segmentation masks of reference categories simultaneously. Moreover, a Semantic-induced Transformer Decoder is introduced to constrain the cross-attention between dynamic queries and target images within the pixels of the reference category, which suppresses the noisy interaction with the background and irrelevant categories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the COCO-20 dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed Dynamic Transformer Network significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts."}}

Most research considers learning representations from single images, ignoring any potential interactions between them. However, due to the high intra-identity variations, ignoring such interactions typically leads to outlier features. To tackle this issue, we propose a Neighbor Transformer Network, or NFormer, which explicitly models interactions across all input images, thus suppressing outlier features and leading to more robust representations overall. As modelling interactions between enormous amount of images is a massive task with lots of distractors, NFormer introduces two novel modules, the Landmark Agent Attention, and the Reciprocal Neighbor Softmax. Specifically, the Landmark Agent Attention efficiently models the relation map between images by a low-rank factorization with a few landmarks in feature space. Moreover, the Reciprocal Neighbor Softmax achieves sparse attention to relevant -- rather than all -- neighbors only, which alleviates interference of irrelevant representations and further relieves the computational burden. In experiments on four large-scale datasets, NFormer achieves a new state-of-the-art. The code is released at \\url{https://github.com/haochenheheda/NFormer}."}}

A probabilistic latent variable model infers the distribution of the prototype that is treated as the latent variable. We formulate the optimization as a variational inference problem, which is established with an amortized inference network based on an auto-encoder architecture. The probabilistic modeling of the prototype enhances its generalization ability to handle the inherent uncertainty caused by limited data and the huge intra-class variations of objects. Moreover, it offers a principled way to incorporate the prototype extracted from support images into the prediction of the segmentation maps for query images. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of variational prototype inference for few-shot semantic segmentation by probabilistic modeling. On all three benchmarks, our proposal achieves high segmentation accuracy and surpasses previous methods by considerable margins."}}
