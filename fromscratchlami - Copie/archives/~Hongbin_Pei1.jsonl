In cross-modality re-ID, the query and gallery images are in different modalities. Given a training identity, the popular deep classification baseline shares the same proxy (i.e., a weight vector in the last classification layer) for two modalities. We find that it has considerable tolerance for the modality gap, because the shared proxy acts as an intermediate relay between two modalities. In response, we propose a Memory-Augmented Unidirectional Metric (MAUM) learning method consisting of two novel designs, i.e., unidirectional metrics, and memory-based augmentation. Specifically, MAUM first learns modality-specific proxies (MS-Proxies) independently under each modality. Afterward, MAUM uses the already-learned MS-Proxies as the static references for pulling close the features in the counterpart modality. These two unidirectional metrics (IR image to RGB proxy and RGB image to IR proxy) jointly alleviate the relay effect and benefit cross-modality association. The cross-modality association is further enhanced by storing the MS-Proxies into memory banks to increase the reference diversity. Importantly, we show that MAUM improves cross-modality re-ID under the modality-balanced setting and gains extra robustness against the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets demonstrate the superiority of MAUM over the state-of-the-art. The code will be available."}}

Although traditional embedding-based models can learn many implicit features, resulting in good performance, they cannot provide the reason for their recommendations. Existing explainable recommender methods can be mainly divided into two types. The first type models highlight reviews written by users to provide an explanation. For the second type, attribute information is taken into consideration. These approaches only consider one aspect and do not make the best use of the existing information. In this paper, we propose a novel neural explainable recommender model based on attributes and reviews (NERAR) for recommendation that combines the processing of attribute features and review features. We employ a tree-based model to extract and learn attribute features from auxiliary information, and then we use a time-aware gated recurrent unit (T-GRU) to model user review features and process item review features based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Extensive experiments on Amazon datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation models in accuracy of recommendations. The presented examples also show that our model can offer more reasonable explanations. Crowd-sourcing based evaluations are conducted to verify our model\u2019s superiority in explainability."}}

However, the existing RL-based recommendation methods are limited by their unstructured state/action representations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel way that builds high-quality graph-structured states/actions according to the user-item bipartite graph. More specifically, we develop an end-to-end RL agent, termed Graph Convolutional Q-network (GCQN), which is able to learn effective recommendation policies based on the inputs of the proposed graph-structured representations. We show that GCQN achieves significant performance margins over the existing methods, across different datasets and task settings."}}

Most graph embedding methods preserve the proximity in a graph into a manifold in an embedding space. We argue an important but neglected problem about this proximity-preserving strategy: Graph topology patterns, while preserved well into an embedding manifold by preserving proximity, may distort in the ambient embedding Euclidean space, and hence to detect them becomes difficult for machine learning models. To address the problem, we propose curvature regularization, to enforce flatness for embedding manifolds, thereby preventing the distortion. We present a novel angle-based sectional curvature, termed ABS curvature, and accordingly three kinds of curvature regularization to induce flat embedding manifolds during graph embedding. We integrate curvature regularization into five popular proximity-preserving embedding methods, and empirical results in two applications show significant improvements on a wide range of open graph datasets."}}

However, two fundamental weaknesses of MPNNs' aggregators limit their ability to represent graph-structured data: losing the structural information of nodes in neighborhoods and lacking the ability to capture long-range dependencies in disassortative graphs. Few studies have noticed the weaknesses from different perspectives. From the observations on classical neural network and network geometry, we propose a novel geometric aggregation scheme for graph neural networks to overcome the two weaknesses.  The behind basic idea is the aggregation on a graph can benefit from a continuous space underlying the graph. The proposed aggregation scheme is permutation-invariant and consists of three modules, node embedding, structural neighborhood, and bi-level aggregation. We also present an implementation of the scheme in graph convolutional networks, termed Geom-GCN, to perform transductive learning on graphs. Experimental results show the proposed Geom-GCN achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of open datasets of graphs."}}

In this work, we develop a Social Attentive Deep Q-network (SADQN) agent, which is able to provide high-quality recommendations during user-agent interactions by leveraging social influence among users. Specifically, SADQN is able to estimate action-values not only based on the users' personal preferences, but also based on their social neighbors' preferences by employing a particular social attention layer. The experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SADQN significantly improves the performance of deep reinforcement learning agents that overlook social influence."}}

It's known challenging due to the feature distribution bias between the source domain and target domain. The previous methods directly reduce the bias by image-to-image style translation between the source and the target domain in an unsupervised manner. However, these methods only consider the rough bias between the source domain and the target domain but neglect the detailed bias between the source domain and the target camera domains (divided by camera views), which contain critical factors influencing the testing performance of re-ID model. In this work, we particularly focus on the bias between the source domain and the target camera domains. To overcome this problem, a multi-domain image-to-image translation network, termed Identity Preserving Generative Adversarial Network (IPGAN) is proposed to learn the mapping relationship between the source domain and the target camera domains. IPGAN can translate the styles of images from the source domain to the target camera domains and generate many images with styles of target camera domains. Then the re-ID model is trained with the translated images generated by IPGAN. During the training of the re-ID model, we aim to learn the discriminative feature. We design and train a novel re-ID model, termed IBN-reID, in which Instance and Batch Normalization block (IBN-block) are introduced. Experimental results on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17 show that the images generated by IPGAN are more suitable for cross-domain re-ID. Very competitive re-ID accuracy is achieved by our method."}}

In the face of a sudden infectious disease outbreak, contact tracking systems can help medical professionals quickly locate and isolate infected persons and high-risk individuals, preventing further spread and a large-scale outbreak of infectious disease. Furthermore, the transmission networks of infectious diseases established using contact tracking technology can aid in the visualization of actual virus transmission paths, which enables simulations and predictions of the transmission process, assessment of the outbreak trend, and further development and deployment of more effective prevention and control strategies. Exploring effective contact tracking methods will be significant. Governments, academics, and industries have all given extensive attention to this goal. In this paper, we review the developments and challenges of current contact tracing technologies regarding individual and group contact from both static and dynamic perspectives, including static individual contact tracing, dynamic individual contact tracing, static group contact tracing, and dynamic group contact tracing. With the purpose of providing useful reference and inspiration for researchers and practitioners in related fields, directions in multi-view contact tracing, multi-scale contact tracing, and AI-based contact tracing are provided for next-generation technologies for epidemic prevention and control."}}
