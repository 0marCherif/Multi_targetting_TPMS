To address this problem, the paradigm of weak supervision aims to collect and then aggregate multiple noisy labels.  We propose a Bayesian probabilistic model that employs a tractable Sinkhorn-based optimal transport formulation to derive a ground-truth label.  The translation between true and weak labels is cast as a transport problem with an inferred cost structure.  Our approach achieves strong performance on the WRENCH weak supervision benchmark. Moreover, the posterior distribution over cost matrices allows for exploratory analysis of the weak sources."}}

We conducted user interviews with researchers about their workflow and their needs when carrying out literature research. Based on this study, we identify a set of problems encountered by researchers. We then propose to embed classified citation networks into articles as a solution, and to complement this graph with optional comments about references by authors.  We demonstrate this idea by implementing it for this article. We argue that our solution helps increase inclusivity and improves the efficiency of reading scientific articles."}}

To realize these approaches there is a need for research and innovation with respect to automation and tooling, and furthermore for research into the organizational changes that support flexible data-driven decision-making in the development lifecycle. Most importantly, deep synergies are needed between software engineers, managers, and data scientists. This paper reports on the results of the joint 5th International Workshop on Rapid Continuous Software Engineering (RCoSE 2019) and the 1st International Workshop on Data-Driven Decisions, Experimentation and Evolution (DDrEE 2019), which focuses on the challenges and potential solutions in the area of continuous data-driven software engineering."}}

We present a fairness-aware variation of the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) re-ranking method which uses representations of demographic groups computed using a labeled dataset. This method is intended to incorporate fairness with respect to these demographic groups. We perform an experiment on a stock photo dataset and examine the trade-off between relevance and fairness against a well known baseline, MMR, by using human judgment to examine the results of the re-ranking when using different fractions of a labeled dataset, and by performing a quantitative analysis on the ranked results of a set of query images. We show that our proposed method can incorporate fairness in the ranked results while obtaining higher precision than the baseline, while our case study shows that even a limited amount of labeled data can be used to compute the representations to obtain fairness. This method can be used as a post-processing step for recommender systems and search."}}

Unlike content-based image search, such users of photography websites are not just looking for photos with certain content, but more generally for photos with a certain photographic \"aesthetic\". In this context, we explore personalized photo recommendation and propose two aesthetic feature extraction methods based on (i) color space and (ii) deep style transfer embeddings. Using a dataset from 500px, we evaluate how these features can be best leveraged by collaborative filtering methods and show that (ii) provides a significant boost in photo recommendation performance."}}

To what extent can we benefit from prior program investigation activities to decrease this effort? To investigate this question, we studied the revision history of two systems to determine how knowledge derived from prior investigation activities could have been reused to support other change tasks. Our initial investigation used a tool, ConcernDetector, that can recommend sets of program elements associated with a high-level concern when elements in the set overlap with elements currently being modified. We discovered that simple overlap-based techniques for retrieving prior investigation knowledge have important limitations, and that effective reuse of prior program investigation knowledge requires analyses that can partially infer the nature and intent of a task."}}
