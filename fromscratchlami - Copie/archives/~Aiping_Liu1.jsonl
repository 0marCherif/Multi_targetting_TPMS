The commonly challenging issue of pan-sharpening is how to correctly select consistent features and propagate them, and properly handle inconsistent ones between PAN and MS modalities. To solve this issue, we propose a Normalization-based Feature Selection and Restitution mechanism, which is capable of filtering out the inconsistent features and promoting to learn the consistent ones. Specifically, we first modulate the PAN feature as the MS style in feature space by AdaIN operation \\citeAdaIN. However, such operation inevitably removes the favorable features. We thus propose to distill the effective information from the removed part and restitute it back to the modulated part. To better distillation, we enforce a contrastive learning constraint to close the distance between the restituted feature and the ground truth, and push the removed part away from the ground truth. In this way, the consistent features of PAN images are correctly selected and the inconsistent ones are filtered out, thus relieving the over-transferred artifacts in the process of PAN-guided MS super-resolution. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed network and demonstrate its favorable performance against other state-of-the-art methods.

Therefore, pan-sharpening technology has been widely explored as a popular tool to generate images with both high-spatial and high-spectral resolutions by integrating PAN and MS images. In this paper, we propose an effective pan-sharpening network, which consists of two core designs: a PAN-guided band-aware multi-spectral feature enhancement module and a multi-focus feature fusion module. To be specific, the former exploits the PAN features to perform band-aware multi-spectral feature modulation and selectively enhance the information of each spectral band while the latter covers various convolution kernels to extract multi-scale features, benefiting the fusion performance of the remote sensing scene. Equipped with the above core modules, our proposed framework is capable of achieving the best performance when compared with existing state-of-the-art Pan-sharpening methods over multiple satellite datasets. Extensive ablation studies are additionally conducted to verify the effectiveness of our key components both visually and quantitatively."}}

Heart rate variability (HRV) has been identified as a prognostic indicator for CHF. The traditional diagnosis methods based on analyzing the electrocardiogram (ECG) are time-consuming and laborious, and the interpretation of the results is subjective. Inspired by the outstanding performance of U-shaped networks in medical image segmentation, in this article, we propose a novel end-to-end classification model based on 2000 intervals between successive R-peaks of ECG signals. The proposed model integrates the outputs of encoders, decoders, and intermediate units through a unified scale operation, which can not only preserve low-level details from the input signals but also extract the high-level pathology-related information. We further employ a variant of residual module with group convolution and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block, enhancing the network\u2019s expression capability. In addition, considering the challenge of collecting large and diverse samples by individual institutions, we decentralize the data across different clients and extend the proposed model with a federated version, which is able to facilitate multi-institutional collaborations while maintaining data anonymity. A total of 29 CHF patients and 177 non-CHF subjects (i.e., 54 normal sinus rhythm (NSR) subjects, 84 atrial fibrillation (AF), and 39 Apnea subjects) from PhysioBank are included in this article. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state of the art both in centralized and decentralized learning, with an accuracy of 89.83% and 87.54%, respectively. The diagnosis model trained in federated framework provides competitive performance to that in centralized learning, which demonstrates its potential of utilizing multisite data to improve CHF detection performance without sharing patient privacy."}}

To address this issue, some latest studies applied supervised domain adaptation (SDA), utilizing limited labeled data from the target patient to calibrate the model. However, as the epileptic EEG representation even varies within one single patient, limited target data could hardly cover the data distribution, thus the model still shows poor generalization on the target patient. To this end, we introduce a novel semi-supervised domain adaptive seizure prediction model (SSDA-SPM), using limited labeled target data and extra unlabeled target data for adaptation. SSDA-SPM mainly consists of two unsupervised modules, namely feature alignment (FA) module and consistency regularization (CR) module. The FA module aims to transfer knowledge from existing patients to the target patient coarsely by globally aligning the data distribution between them. Then the CR module further enhances the discriminability on the target patient by pushing the decision boundary into the low-density area. Our proposed method achieves 88.8% sensitivity (Sens), 0.182/h false prediction rate (FPR), and 0.849 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on the CHB-MIT database and 75.7% Sens, 0.165/h FPR, and 0.763 AUC on the Kaggle database. Experimental results demonstrate that our method has provided a promising solution to improve the cross-patient generalization for seizure prediction."}}

Owing to the powerful learning capability of convolution neural network (CNN), CNN-based methods have dominated this field. However, due to the limitation of the convolution operator, long-range spatial features are often not accurately obtained, thus limiting the overall performance. To this end, we propose a novel and effective method by exploiting a customized transformer architecture and information-lossless invertible neural module for long-range dependencies modeling and effective feature fusion in this paper. Specifically, the customized transformer formulates the PAN and MS features as queries and keys to encourage joint feature learning across two modalities while the designed invertible neural module enables effective feature fusion to generate the expected pan-sharpened results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to introduce transformer and invertible neural network into pan-sharpening field. Extensive experiments over different kinds of satellite datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms both visually and quantitatively with fewer parameters and flops. Further, the ablation experiments also prove the effectiveness of the proposed customized long-range transformer and effective invertible neural feature fusion module for pan-sharpening."}}
