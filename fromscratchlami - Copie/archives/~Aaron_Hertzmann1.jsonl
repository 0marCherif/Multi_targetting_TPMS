The article first introduces new theory for contour visibility of smooth surfaces. Necessary and sufficient conditions are introduced for when a sampled occluding contour is valid, that is, when it may be assigned consistent visibility. Previous methods do not guarantee these conditions, which helps explain why smooth contour visibility has been such a challenging problem in the past. The article then proposes an algorithm that, given a subdivision surface, finds sampled contours satisfying these conditions, and then generates a new triangle mesh matching the given occluding contours. The contours of the output triangle mesh may then be rendered with standard non-photorealistic rendering algorithms, using the mesh for visibility computation. The method can be applied to any triangle mesh, by treating it as the base mesh of a subdivision surface."}}

This paper describes the first general-purpose smooth surface construction for which the occluding contours can be computed in closed form. Given an input mesh and camera viewpoint, we show how to approximate the mesh with a G1 piecewise-quadratic surface, for which the occluding contours are piecewise-rational curves in image-space. We show that this method produces smooth contours with consistent visibility much more efficiently than the state-of-the-art."}}

The generative capabilities of these tools are likely to fundamentally alter the creative processes by which creators formulate ideas and put them into production. As creativity is reimagined, so too may be many sectors of society. Understanding the impact of generative AI - and making policy decisions around it - requires new interdisciplinary scientific inquiry into culture, economics, law, algorithms, and the interaction of technology and creativity. We argue that generative AI is not the harbinger of art's demise, but rather is a new medium with its own distinct affordances. In this vein, we consider the impacts of this new medium on creators across four themes: aesthetics and culture, legal questions of ownership and credit, the future of creative work, and impacts on the contemporary media ecosystem. Across these themes, we highlight key research questions and directions to inform policy and beneficial uses of the technology."}}

In this paper, we present a physics-based method for inferring 3D human motion from video sequences that takes initial 2D and 3D pose estimates as input. We first estimate ground contact timings with a novel prediction network which is trained without hand-labeled data. A physics-based trajectory optimization then solves for a physically-plausible motion, based on the inputs. We show this process produces motions that are significantly more realistic than those from purely kinematic methods, substantially improving quantitative measures of both kinematic and dynamic plausibility. We demonstrate our method on character animation and pose estimation tasks on dynamic motions of dancing and sports with complex contact patterns.\n\n"}}

Based on examples from expert artists and from the author's own experience, the paper argues that creative processes often involve two important components: vague, high-level goals (e.g., \"make a good painting\"), and exploratory processes for discovering new ideas. This paper then sketches out possible computational mechanisms for imitating those elements of the painting process, including underspecified loss functions and iterative painting procedures with explicit task decompositions."}}

We argue that more attention needs to be paid to both the design and reporting of user studies in computer vision and graphics papers. In an attempt to improve practitioners' knowledge and increase the trustworthiness and replicability of user studies, we provide an overview of methodologies from user experience research (UXR), human-computer interaction (HCI), and related fields. We discuss foundational user research methods (e.g., needfinding) that are presently underutilized in computer vision and graphics research, but can provide valuable guidance for research projects. We provide further pointers to the literature for readers interested in exploring other UXR methodologies. Finally, we describe broader open issues and recommendations for the research community. We encourage authors and reviewers alike to recognize that not every research contribution requires a user study, and that having no study at all is better than having a carelessly conducted one."}}
