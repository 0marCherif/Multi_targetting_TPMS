One important, desired characteristic of these transformations, is their graduality, which corresponds to a smooth change between the source and the target image when their respective latent-space representations are linearly interpolated. However, state-of-the-art methods usually perform poorly when evaluated using inter-domain interpolations, often producing abrupt changes in the appearance or non-realistic intermediate images. In this paper, we argue that one of the main reasons behind this problem is the lack of sufficient inter-domain training data and we propose two different regularization methods to alleviate this issue: a new shrinkage loss, which compacts the latent space, and a Mixup data-augmentation strategy, which flattens the style representations between domains. We also propose a new metric to quantitatively evaluate the degree of the interpolation smoothness, an aspect which is not sufficiently covered by the existing I2I translation metrics. Using both our proposed metric and standard evaluation protocols, we show that our regularization techniques can improve the state-of-the-art multi-domain I2I translations by a large margin. Our code will be made publicly available upon the acceptance of this article."}}

In this paper, we explicitly encourage the emergence of this spatial clustering as a form of training regularization, this way including a self-supervised pretext task into the standard supervised learning. In more detail, we exploit the assumption that, in a given image, objects usually correspond to few connected regions, and we propose a spatial formulation of the information entropy to quantify this object-based inductive bias. By minimizing the proposed spatial entropy, we include an additional self-supervised signal during training. Using extensive experiments, we show that the proposed regularization is beneficial with different training scenarios, datasets, downstream tasks and VT architectures.

At the same time, advances in machine learning and complex systems enable us to build explanatory and/or predictive computational models of human behavior. Interestingly, these data and models can also be used to better understand the factors associated with specific neighborhoods\u2019 outcomes such as vitality, safety perception, crime levels, innovation, segregation, traffic congestion, etc., and to design more efficient policymakers\u2019 interventions. In particular, leveraging census data, mobile phone traces, information from OpenStreetMap, and street view images, we describe a set of studies where we (i) infer how vital and livable a city is; (ii) find urban appearance conditions that magnify and influence urban life; (iii) study the relationship of urban conditions with societal outcomes such as urban crime levels; and (iv) model the impact of pandemic shocks such as COVID-19 and related non-pharmaceutical interventions on human behavior."}}

In this work, we study how individuals adapted their daily movements and person-to-person contact patterns over time in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the NPIs. We leverage longitudinal GPS mobility data of hundreds of thousands of anonymous individuals in four US states and empirically show the dramatic disruption in people's life. We find that local interventions did not just impact the number of visits to different venues but also how people experience them. Individuals spend less time in venues, preferring simpler and more predictable routines and reducing person-to-person contact activities. Moreover, we show that the stringency of interventions alone does explain the number and duration of visits to venues: individual patterns of visits seem to be influenced by the local severity of the pandemic and a risk adaptation factor, which increases the people's mobility regardless of the stringency of interventions."}}
