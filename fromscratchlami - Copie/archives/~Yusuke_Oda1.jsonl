The method is based on predicting a binary code for each word and can reduce computation time/memory requirements of the output layer to be logarithmic in vocabulary size in the best case. In addition, we also introduce two advanced approaches to improve the robustness of the proposed model: using error-correcting codes and combining softmax and binary codes. Experiments on two English-Japanese bidirectional translation tasks show proposed models achieve BLEU scores that approach the softmax, while reducing memory usage to the order of less than 1/10 and improving decoding speed on CPUs by x5 to x10."}}

However, short segments pose problems for syntaxbased translation methods, as it is difficult to generate accurate parse trees for sub-sentential segments. In this paper, we perform the first experiments applying syntax-based SMT to simultaneous translation, and propose two methods to prevent degradations in accuracy: a method to predict unseen syntactic constituents that help generate complete parse trees, and a method that waits for more input when the current utterance is not enough to generate a fluent translation. Experiments on English-Japanese translation show that the proposed methods allow for improvements in accuracy, particularly with regards to word order of the target sentences."}}

PCFG-LA parsers are known to achieve highly competitive performance, but sometimes the parsing process fails completely, and no parses can be generated. Ckylark introduces three new techniques that prevent possible causes for parsing failure: outputting intermediate results when coarse-to-fine analysis fails, smoothing lexicon probabilities, and scaling probabilities to avoid underflow. An experiment shows that this allows millions of sentences can be parsed without any failures, in contrast to other publicly available PCFG-LA parsers. Ckylark is implemented in C++, and is available opensource under the LGPL license.1"}}

In contrast to previously proposed heuristic methods, our method finds a segmentation that directly maximizes the performance of the machine translation system. We describe two methods based on greedy search and dynamic programming that search for the optimal segmentation strategy. An experimental evaluation finds that our algorithm is able to segment the input two to three times more frequently than conventional methods in terms of number of words, while maintaining the same score of automatic evaluation. 1"}}
