Users are typically concerned with preserving the privacy of their sample, and also with minimizing the amount of data they must transmit to the server. We give improved private and communication-efficient algorithms for estimating several popular measures of the entropy of a distribution. All of our algorithms have constant communication cost and satisfy local differential privacy. For a joint distribution on many variables whose conditional independence graph is a tree, we describe algorithms for estimating Shannon entropy that require a number of samples that is linear in the number of variables, compared to the quadratic sample complexity of prior work. We also describe an algorithm for estimating Gini entropy whose sample complexity has no dependence on the support size of the distribution and can be implemented using a single round of concurrent communication between the users and the server, while the previously best-known algorithm has high communication cost and requires the server to facilitate interaction between the users. Finally, we describe an algorithm for estimating collision entropy that matches the space and sample complexity of the best known algorithm but generalizes it to the private and communication-efficient setting."}}

Existing algorithms for enforcing $k$-anonymity in the released data assume that the curator performing the anonymization has complete access to the original data. Reasons for limiting this access range from undesirability to complete infeasibility. This paper explores ideas -- objectives, metrics, protocols, and extensions -- for reducing the trust that must be placed in the curator, while still maintaining a statistical notion of $k$-anonymity. We suggest trust (amount of information provided to the curator) and privacy (anonymity of the participants) as the primary objectives of such a framework. We describe a class of protocols aimed at achieving these goals, proposing new metrics of privacy in the process, and proving related bounds. We conclude by discussing a natural extension of this work that completely removes the need for a central curator."}}

Here, we compare two statistical tests that use subgraph counts to address this question. The first uses the empirical subgraph densities themselves as estimates of those of the underlying distribution. The second test uses a new approach that converts these subgraph densities into estimates of the \\textit{graph cumulants} of the distribution (without any increase in computational complexity). We demonstrate -- via theory, simulation, and application to real data -- the superior statistical power of using graph cumulants. In summary, when analyzing data using subgraph/motif densities, we suggest using the corresponding graph cumulants instead."}}

However, this task is nontrivial; proposed summary statistics are as diverse as the networks they describe, and a standardized hierarchy has not yet been established. In contrast, vector-valued random variables admit such a description in terms of their cumulants (e.g., mean, (co)variance, skew, kurtosis). Here, we introduce the natural analogue of cumulants for networks, building a hierarchical description based on correlations between an increasing number of connections, seamlessly incorporating additional information, such as directed edges, node attributes, and edge weights. These graph cumulants provide a principled and unifying framework for quantifying the propensity of a network to display any substructure of interest (such as cliques to measure clustering). Moreover, they give rise to a natural hierarchical family of maximum entropy models for networks (i.e., ERGMs) that do not suffer from the \"degeneracy problem\", a common practical pitfall of other ERGMs."}}

It is important to quantify gender differences in subdomains of scientific work in order to detect potential biases and monitor progress. In this work, we study the relevance of gender in scientific collaboration patterns in the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS), a professional society with sixteen peer-reviewed journals. Using their publication data from 1952 to 2016, we constructed a large temporal bipartite network between authors and publications, and augmented the author nodes with gender labels. We characterized differences in several basic statistics of this network over time, highlighting how they have changed with respect to relevant historical events. We find a steady increase in participation by women (e.g., fraction of authorships by women and of new women authors) starting around 1980. However, women still comprise less than 25% of the INFORMS society and an even smaller fraction of authors with many publications. Moreover, we describe a methodology for quantifying the structural role of an authorship with respect to the overall connectivity of the network, using it to measure subtle differences between authorships by women and by men. Specifically, as measures of structural importance of an authorship, we use effective resistance and contraction importance, two measures related to diffusion throughout a network. As a null model, we propose a degree-preserving temporal and geometric network model with emergent communities. Our results suggest the presence of systematic differences between the collaboration patterns of men and women that cannot be explained by only local statistics."}}

There has been extensive work on both graph sparsification (removing edges) and graph coarsening (merging nodes, often by edge contraction); however, these operations are currently treated separately. Interestingly, for a planar graph, edge deletion corresponds to edge contraction in its planar dual (and more generally, for a graphical matroid and its dual). Moreover, with respect to the dynamics induced by the graph Laplacian (e.g., diffusion), deletion and contraction are physical manifestations of two reciprocal limits: edge weights of $0$ and $\\infty$, respectively. In this work, we provide a unifying framework that captures both of these operations, allowing one to simultaneously sparsify and coarsen a graph while preserving its large-scale structure. The limit of infinite edge weight is rarely considered, as many classical notions of graph similarity diverge.
