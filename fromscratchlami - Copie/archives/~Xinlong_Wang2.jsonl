Unlike previous fixed or learnable positional encodings that are predefined and independent of input tokens, CPE is dynamically generated and conditioned on the local neighborhood of the input tokens. As a result, CPE can easily generalize to the input sequences that are longer than what the model has ever seen during the training. Besides, CPE can keep the desired translation equivalence in vision tasks, resulting in improved performance. We implement CPE with a simple Position Encoding Generator (PEG) to get seamlessly incorporated into the current Transformer framework. Built on PEG, we present Conditional Position encoding Vision Transformer (CPVT). We demonstrate that CPVT has visually similar attention maps compared to those with learned positional encodings and delivers outperforming results."}}

In order to predict a mask for each instance, mainstream approaches either follow the 'detect-then-segment' strategy (e.g., Mask R-CNN), or predict embedding vectors first then cluster pixels into individual instances. In this paper, we view the task of instance segmentation from a completely new perspective by introducing the notion of \"instance categories\", which assigns categories to each pixel within an instance according to the instance's location. With this notion, we propose segmenting objects by locations (SOLO), a simple, direct, and fast framework for instance segmentation with strong performance. We derive a few SOLO variants (e.g., Vanilla SOLO, Decoupled SOLO, Dynamic SOLO) following the basic principle. Our method directly maps a raw input image to the desired object categories and instance masks, eliminating the need for the grouping post-processing or the bounding box detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for instance segmentation in terms of both speed and accuracy, while being considerably simpler than the existing methods. Besides instance segmentation, our method yields state-of-the-art results in object detection (from our mask byproduct) and panoptic segmentation. We further demonstrate the flexibility and high-quality segmentation of SOLO by extending it to perform one-stage instance-level image matting. Code is available at: https://git.io/AdelaiDet"}}

Recent methods typically develop sophisticated pipelines to tackle this task. Here, we propose a new video instance segmentation framework built upon Transformers, termed VisTR, which views the VIS task as a direct end-to-end parallel sequence decoding/prediction problem. Given a video clip consisting of multiple image frames as input, VisTR outputs the sequence of masks for each instance in the video in order directly. At the core is a new, effective instance sequence matching and segmentation strategy, which supervises and segments instances at the sequence level as a whole. VisTR frames the instance segmentation and tracking in the same perspective of similarity learning, thus considerably simplifying the overall pipeline and is significantly different from existing approaches. Without bells and whistles, VisTR achieves the highest speed among all existing VIS models, and achieves the best result among methods using single model on the YouTube-VIS dataset. For the first time, we demonstrate a much simpler and faster video instance segmentation framework achieving competitive accuracy. We hope that VisTR can motivate future research for more video understanding tasks. Code is available at: https://git.io/VisTR"}}

Different from existing methods, which often require ROI (Region of Interest) operations and/or grouping post-processing, FCPose eliminates the ROIs and grouping post-processing with dynamic instance-aware keypoint estimation heads. The dynamic keypoint heads are conditioned on each instance (person), and can encode the instance concept in the dynamically-generated weights of their filters. Moreover, with the strong representation capacity of dynamic convolutions, the keypoint heads in FCPose are designed to be very compact, resulting in fast inference and makes FCPose have almost constant inference time regardless of the number of persons in the image. For example, on the COCO dataset, a real-time version of FCPose using the DLA-34 backbone infers about 4.5 times faster than Mask R-CNN (ResNet-101) (41.67 FPS vs. 9.26 FPS) while achieving improved performance (64.8% AP vs. 64.3% AP). FCPose also offers better speed/accuracy trade-off than other state-of-the-art methods. Our experiment results show that FCPose is a simple yet effective multi-person pose estimation framework.

These pre-trained models can be sub-optimal for dense prediction tasks due to the discrepancy between image-level prediction and pixel-level prediction. To fill this gap, we aim to design an effective, dense self-supervised learning method that directly works at the level of pixels (or local features) by taking into account the correspondence between local features. We present dense contrastive learning, which implements self-supervised learning by optimizing a pairwise contrastive (dis)similarity loss at the pixel level between two views of input images. Compared to the baseline method MoCo-v2, our method introduces negligible computation overhead (only <1% slower), but demonstrates consistently superior performance when transferring to downstream dense prediction tasks including object detection, semantic segmentation and instance segmentation; and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Specifically, over the strong MoCo-v2 baseline, our method achieves significant improvements of 2.0% AP on PASCAL VOC object detection, 1.1% AP on COCO object detection, 0.9% AP on COCO instance segmentation, 3.0% mIoU on PASCAL VOC semantic segmentation and 1.8% mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation.

Recent methods can be categorized into two groups, i.e., two-step and end-to-end approaches. The former views person search as two independent tasks and achieves dominant results using separately trained person detection and re-identification (Re-ID) models. The latter performs person search in an end-to-end fashion. Although the end-to-end approaches yield higher inference efficiency, they largely lag behind those two-step counterparts in terms of accuracy. In this paper, we argue that the gap between the two kinds of methods is mainly caused by the Re-ID sub-networks of end-to-end methods. To this end, we propose a simple yet strong end-to-end network with diverse knowledge distillation to break the bottleneck. We also design a spatial-invariant augmentation to assist model to be invariant to inaccurate detection results. Experimental results on the CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method against existing approaches -- it achieves on par accuracy with state-of-the-art two-step methods while maintaining high efficiency due to the single joint model.

Almost all methods treat foreground and background regions (\u201cthings and stuff\u201d) in an image equally. However, not all pixels are equal. Depth of foreground objects plays a crucial role in 3D object recognition and localization. To date how to boost the depth prediction accuracy of foreground objects is rarely discussed. In this paper, we first analyze the data distributions and interaction of foreground and background, then propose the foreground-background separated monocular depth estimation (ForeSeE) method, to estimate the foreground and background depth using separate optimization objectives and decoders. Our method significantly improves the depth estimation performance on foreground objects. Applying ForeSeE to 3D object detection, we achieve 7.5 AP gains and set new state-of-the-art results among other monocular methods. Code will be available at: https://github.com/WXinlong/ForeSeE."}}

Previous methods that predict metric depth often work well only for a specific scene. In contrast, learning relative depth (information of being closer or further) can enjoy better generalization, with the price of failing to recover the accurate geometric shape of the scene. In this work, we propose a dataset and methods to tackle this dilemma, aiming to predict accurate depth up to an affine transformation with good generalization to diverse scenes. First we construct a large-scale and diverse dataset, termed Diverse Scene Depth dataset (DiverseDepth), which has a broad range of scenes and foreground contents. Compared with previous learning objectives, i.e., learning metric depth or relative depth, we propose to learn the affine-invariant depth using our diverse dataset to ensure both generalization and high-quality geometric shapes of scenes. Furthermore, in order to train the model on the complex dataset effectively, we propose a multi-curriculum learning method. Experiments show that our method outperforms previous methods on 8 datasets by a large margin with the zero-shot test setting, demonstrating the excellent generalization capacity of the learned model to diverse scenes. The reconstructed point clouds with the predicted depth show that our method can recover high-quality 3D shapes. Code and dataset are available at: https://tinyurl.com/DiverseDepth"}}

To this end, we propose a novel and effective approach, termed SOLOv2, following the principle of the SOLO method [32]. First, our new framework is empowered by an efficient and holistic instance mask representation scheme, which dynamically segments each instance in the image, without resorting to bounding box detection. Specifically, the object mask generation is decoupled into a mask kernel prediction and mask feature learning, which are responsible for generating convolution kernels and the feature maps to be convolved with, respectively. Second, SOLOv2 significantly reduces inference overhead with our novel matrix non-maximum suppression (NMS) technique. Our Matrix NMS performs NMS with parallel matrix operations in one shot, and yields better results. We demonstrate that the proposed SOLOv2 achieves the state-of-the- art performance with high efficiency, making it suitable for both mobile and cloud applications. A light-weight version of SOLOv2 executes at 31.3 FPS and yields 37.1% AP on COCO test-dev.

While this setting has been studied in the literature, here we show significantly stronger performance with a simple design (e.g., dramatically improving previous best reported mask AP of 21.1% in Hsu et al. (2019) to 31.6% on the COCO dataset). Our core idea is to redesign the loss of learning masks in instance segmentation, with no modification to the segmentation network itself. The new loss functions can supervise the mask training without relying on mask annotations. This is made possible with two loss terms, namely, 1) a surrogate term that minimizes the discrepancy between the projections of the ground-truth box and the predicted mask; 2) a pairwise loss that can exploit the prior that proximal pixels with similar colors are very likely to have the same category label. Experiments demonstrate that the redesigned mask loss can yield surprisingly high-quality instance masks with only box annotations. For example, without using any mask annotations, with a ResNet-101 backbone and 3x training schedule, we achieve 33.2% mask AP on COCO test-dev split (vs. 39.1% of the fully supervised counterpart). Our excellent experiment results on COCO and Pascal VOC indicate that our method dramatically narrows the performance gap between weakly and fully supervised instance segmentation.
