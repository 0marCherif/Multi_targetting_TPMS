However, existing methods struggle in tasks that require generalization since the learned subgoals are highly task-specific and therefore hardly reusable. In this paper, we propose a novel HRL framework called \\textit{$\\epsilon$-Invariant HRL} that uses abstract, task-agnostic subgoals reusable across tasks, resulting in a more generalizable policy. Although such subgoals are reusable, a transition mismatch problem caused by the inevitable incorrect value evaluation of subgoals can lead to non-stationary learning and even collapse. We mitigate this mismatch problem by training the high-level policy to be adaptable to the stochasticity manually injected into the low-level policy. As a result, our framework can leverage reusable subgoals to constitute a hierarchical policy that can effectively generalize to unseen new tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental results in continuous control navigation tasks and challenging zero-shot generalization tasks show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}}

We call such task as the objective-constrained task, which is inherently a multi-objective problem. Due to the conflict among different objectives, a trade-off is needed. A common compromise is to design a scalar reward function through clarifying the relationship among these objectives using the prior knowledge of experts. However, reward engineering is extremely cumbersome. This will result in behaviors that optimize our reward function without actually satisfying our preferences. In this paper, we explicitly cast the objective-constrained task as preference multi-objective reinforcement learning, with the overall goal of finding a Pareto optimal policy. Combined with Trajectory Preference Domination we propose, a weight vector that reflects the agent's preference for each objective can be learned. We analyzed the feasibility of our algorithm in theory, and further proved in experiments its better performance compared to those that design the reward function by experts."}}
