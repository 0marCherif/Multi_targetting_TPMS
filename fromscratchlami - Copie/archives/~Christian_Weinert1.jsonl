However, recent research has highlighted vulnerabilities in FL, including the potential disclosure of sensitive information through individual model updates and even the aggregated global model. While much attention has been given to clients' data privacy, limited research has addressed the issue of global model privacy. Furthermore, local training at the client's side has opened avenues for malicious clients to launch powerful model poisoning attacks. Unfortunately, no existing work has provided a comprehensive solution that tackles all these issues. Therefore, we introduce HyFL, a hybrid framework that enables data and global model privacy while facilitating large-scale deployments. The foundation of HyFL is a unique combination of secure multi-party computation (MPC) techniques with hierarchical federated learning. One notable feature of HyFL is its capability to prevent malicious clients from executing model poisoning attacks, confining them to less destructive data poisoning alone. We evaluate HyFL's effectiveness using an open-source PyTorch-based FL implementation integrated with Meta's CrypTen PPML framework. Our performance evaluation demonstrates that HyFL is a promising solution for trustworthy large-scale FL deployment."}}

In this work, we demonstrate that severe privacy issues exist in currently deployed contact discovery methods and propose suitable mitigations. Our study of three popular messengers\u00a0(WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram) shows that large-scale crawling attacks are\u00a0(still) possible. Using an accurate database of mobile phone number prefixes and very few resources, we queried\u00a010 % of\u00a0US mobile phone numbers for\u00a0WhatsApp and\u00a0100 % for\u00a0Signal. For\u00a0Telegram, we find that its\u00a0API exposes a wide range of sensitive information, even about numbers not registered with the service. We present interesting\u00a0(cross-messenger) usage statistics, which also reveal that very few users change the default privacy settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that currently deployed hashing-based contact discovery protocols are severely broken by comparing three methods for efficient hash reversal. Most notably, we show that with the password cracking tool\u00a0\u201cJTR,\u201d we can iterate through the entire worldwide mobile phone number space in\u00a0< 150 s on a consumer-grade\u00a0GPU. We also propose a significantly improved rainbow table construction for non-uniformly distributed input domains that is of independent interest. Regarding mitigations, we most notably propose two novel rate-limiting schemes: our\u00a0incremental contact discovery for services without server-side contact storage strictly improves over\u00a0Signal\u2019s current approach while being compatible with private set intersection, whereas our\u00a0differential scheme allows even stricter rate limits at the overhead for service providers to store a small constant-size state that does not reveal any contact information."}}

Unfortunately, most existing secure aggregation schemes ignore two critical orthogonal research directions that aim to (i) significantly reduce client-server communication and (ii) mitigate the impact of malicious clients. However, both of these additional properties are essential to facilitate cross-device FL with thousands or even millions of (mobile) participants. In this paper, we unite both research directions by introducing ScionFL, the first secure aggregation framework for FL that operates efficiently on quantized inputs and simultaneously provides robustness against malicious clients. Our framework leverages (novel) multi-party computation (MPC) techniques and supports multiple linear (1-bit) quantization schemes, including ones that utilize the randomized Hadamard transform and Kashin's representation. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive evaluations. We show that with no overhead for clients and moderate overhead on the server side compared to transferring and processing quantized updates in plaintext, we obtain comparable accuracy for standard FL benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our framework against state-of-the-art poisoning attacks."}}

In a paper presented at USENIX Security'21, we theoretically describe two attacks to exploit these vulnerabilities and propose \"PrivateDrop\" as a privacy-preserving drop-in replacement for Apple's AirDrop protocol based on private set intersection. In this demo, we show how these vulnerabilities are efficiently exploitable via Wi-Fi and physical proximity to a target. Privacy and security implications include the possibility of conducting advanced spear phishing attacks or deploying multiple \"collector\" devices in order to build databases that map contact identifiers to specific locations. For our proof-of-concept, we leverage a custom rainbow table construction to reverse SHA-256 hashes of phone numbers in a matter of milliseconds. We discuss the trade-off between success rate and storage requirements of the rainbow table and, after following responsible disclosure with Apple, we publish our proof-of-concept implementation as \"AirCollect\" on GitHub."}}
