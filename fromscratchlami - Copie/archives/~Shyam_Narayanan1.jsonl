In particular, they show that the WL test can be simulated by GNNs. However, those simulations involve neural networks for the \u201ccombine\u201d function of size polynomial or even exponential in the number of graph nodes $n$, as well as feature vectors of length linear in $n$. \n\nWe present an improved simulation of the WL test on GNNs with {\\em exponentially} lower complexity. In particular,  the neural network implementing the  combine function  in each node has only $\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ parameters, and the feature vectors exchanged by the nodes of GNN consists of only $O(\\log n)$ bits. We also give logarithmic lower bounds for the feature vector length and the size of the neural networks, showing the (near)-optimality of our construction. "}}

We provide two near-optimal algorithms where the near-optimality is in three aspects: they both achieve (1). $O(1)$ parallel computation rounds, (2). near-linear in $n$ and polynomial in $k$ total computational work (i.e., near-linear running time when $n$ is a sufficient polynomial in $k$), (3). $O(1)$ relative approximation and $\\text{poly}(k, d)$ additive error. Note that $\\Omega(1)$ relative approximation is provably necessary even for any polynomial-time non-private algorithm, and $\\Omega(k)$ additive error is a provable lower bound for any polynomial-time DP $k$-means/median algorithm. Our two algorithms provide a tradeoff between the relative approximation and the additive error: the first has $O(1)$ relative approximation and $\\sim (k^{2.5} + k^{1.01} \\sqrt{d})$ additive error, and the second one achieves $(1+\\gamma)$ relative approximation to the optimal non-private algorithm for an arbitrary small constant $\\gamma>0$ and with $\\text{poly}(k, d)$ additive error for a larger polynomial dependence on $k$ and $d$.\n  \n  To achieve our result, we develop a general framework which partitions the data and reduces the DP clustering problem for the entire dataset to the DP clustering problem for each part. To control the blow-up of the additive error introduced by each part, we develop a novel charging argument which might be of independent interest."}}
