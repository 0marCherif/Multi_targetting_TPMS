The central idea set forward is that by endowing machines with the ability to argue with forms of machine argumentation that are cognitively compatible with those of human argumentation, we will be able to support a naturally effective, enhancing and ethical human-machine cooperation and \u201csocial\u201d integration."}}

The language is associated with a provably efficient deduction process, and owing it to its interpretation under an argumentative semantics it can naturally offer ante-hoc explanations on its drawn inferences. Relatedly, the language is associated with a knowledge acquisition process based on the paradigm of machine coaching, guaranteeing the probable approximate correctness of the acquired knowledge against a target policy. The paper focuses on demonstrating the implemented features of the representation language and its exposed APIs and libraries, and discusses some of its more advanced features that allow the calling of procedural code, and the computation of in-line operations when evaluating rules."}}

Adopting the position that technology is not value-neutral, we seek to answer the question of how technology-mediated social platforms can accommodate diversity by design by balancing the often tension-ridden principles of protection and inclusion. In this paper, we present our research program, developed strategy, as well as first analyses and results. Building on approaches from scenario analysis and Value Sensitive Design, we identify key arguments for a \"diversity by design''-agenda. Furthermore, we discuss how these arguments can be operationalized and implemented in a diversity-aware chatbot and provide a critical reflection on the limits and drawbacks of the proposed approach."}}

In a Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from her randomized strategy. The Price of Defense is the worst-case ratio, over all Nash equilibria, of $$\\nu $$ \u03bd over the expected utility of the defender at a Nash equilibrium.We orchestrate a strong interplay of arguments from Game Theory and Graph Theory to obtain both general and specific results in the considered setting:(1) Via a reduction to a Two-Players, Constant-Sum game, we observe that an arbitrary Nash equilibrium is computable in polynomial time. Further, we prove a general lower bound of $$\\frac{\\textstyle |V|}{\\textstyle 2}$$ | V | 2 on the Price of Defense. We derive a characterization of graphs with a Nash equilibrium attaining this lower bound, which reveals a promising connection to Fractional Graph Theory; thereby, it implies an efficient recognition algorithm for such Defense-Optimal graphs.(2) We study some specific classes of Nash equilibria, both for their computational complexity and for their incurred Price of Defense. The classes are defined by imposing structure on the players\u2019 randomized strategies: either graph-theoretic structure on the supports, or symmetry and uniformity structure on the probabilities. We develop novel graph-theoretic techniques to derive trade-offs between computational complexity and the Price of Defense for these classes. Some of the techniques touch upon classical milestones of Graph Theory; for example, we derive the first game-theoretic characterization of K\u00f6nig-Egerv\u00e1ry graphs as graphs admitting a Matching Nash equilibrium."}}
