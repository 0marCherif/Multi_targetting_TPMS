LLMs only use a fraction of the existing training data for in-context learning, while task-specific models harness the full dataset for fine-tuning. In this work, we tackle the problem of leveraging training data to improve the performance of LLMs without fine-tuning. Our approach directly targets LLM predictions without requiring access to their weights. We create a pool of candidates from the LLM through few-shot prompting and we employ a compact model, the LM-corrector (LMCor), specifically trained to merge these candidates to produce an enhanced output. Our experiments on four natural language generation tasks demonstrate that even a small LMCor model (250M) substantially improves the few-shot performance of LLMs (62B), matching and even outperforming standard fine-tuning. Furthermore, we illustrate the robustness of LMCor against different prompts, thereby minimizing the need for extensive prompt engineering. Finally, we show that LMCor can be seamlessly integrated with different LLMs at inference, serving as a plug-and-play module to improve their performance."}}

EdiT5 is faster at inference times than conventional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, while being capable of modeling flexible input-output transformations.

The tagging and re-ordering steps, which are responsible for generating the largest portion of the output, are non-autoregressive, while the insertion uses an autoregressive decoder. Depending on the task, EdiT5 requires significantly fewer autoregressive steps demonstrating speedups of up to 25x when compared to classic seq2seq models. Quality-wise, EdiT5 is initialized with a pre-trained T5 checkpoint yielding comparable performance to T5 in high-resource settings and clearly outperforms it on low-resource settings when evaluated on three NLG tasks: Sentence Fusion, Grammatical Error Correction, and Decontextualization."}}

These tasks share a common trait - they exhibit a large amount of textual overlap between the source and target texts. Text-editing models take advantage of this observation and learn to generate the output by predicting edit operations applied to the source sequence. In contrast, seq2seq models generate outputs word-by-word from scratch thus making them slow at inference time. Text-editing models provide several benefits over seq2seq models including faster inference speed, higher sample efficiency, and better control and interpretability of the outputs. This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of text-editing models and current state-of-the-art approaches, and analyzes their pros and cons. We discuss challenges related to productionization and how these models can be used to mitigate hallucination and bias, both pressing challenges in the field of text generation."}}

We achieve this by first proposing a language-agnostic method to generate a large number of synthetic examples. The second ingredient is to use large-scale multilingual language models (up to 11B parameters). Once fine-tuned on language-specific supervised sets we surpass the previous state-of-the-art results on GEC benchmarks in four languages: English, Czech, German and Russian. Having established a new set of baselines for GEC, we make our results easily reproducible and accessible by releasing a cLang-8 dataset. It is produced by using our best model, which we call gT5, to clean the targets of a widely used yet noisy lang-8 dataset. cLang-8 greatly simplifies typical GEC training pipelines composed of multiple fine-tuning stages -- we demonstrate that performing a single fine-tuning step on cLang-8 with the off-the-shelf language models yields further accuracy improvements over an already top-performing gT5 model for English."}}

To tackle cases when no parallel source\u2013target pairs are available, we train masked language models (MLMs) for both the source and the target domain. Then we find the text spans where the two models disagree the most in terms of likelihood. This allows us to identify the source tokens to delete to transform the source text to match the style of the target domain. The deleted tokens are replaced with the target MLM, and by using a padded MLM variant, we avoid having to predetermine the number of inserted tokens. Our experiments on sentence fusion and sentiment transfer demonstrate that Masker performs competitively in a fully unsupervised setting. Moreover, in low-resource settings, it improves supervised methods\u2019 accuracy by over 10 percentage points when pre-training them on silver training data generated by Masker."}}

Target texts are reconstructed from the inputs using three main edit operations: keeping a token, deleting it, and adding a phrase before the token. To predict the edit operations, we propose a novel model, which combines a BERT encoder with an autoregressive Transformer decoder. This approach is evaluated on English text on four tasks: sentence fusion, sentence splitting, abstractive summarization, and grammar correction. LaserTagger achieves new state-of-the-art results on three of these tasks, performs comparably to a set of strong seq2seq baselines with a large number of training examples, and outperforms them when the number of examples is limited. Furthermore, we show that at inference time tagging can be more than two orders of magnitude faster than comparable seq2seq models, making it more attractive for running in a live environment."}}
