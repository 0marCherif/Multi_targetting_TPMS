More specifically, the input layout consists of one or more semantic regions with free-form text descriptions and adjustable precision levels, which can be set based on the desired controllability. The framework naturally reduces to text-to-image (T2I) at the lowest level with no shape information, and it becomes segmentation-to-image (S2I) at the highest level. By supporting the levels in-between, our framework is flexible in assisting users of different drawing expertise and at different stages of their creative workflow. We introduce several novel techniques to address the challenges coming with this new setup, including a pipeline for collecting training data; a precision-encoded mask pyramid and a text feature map representation to jointly encode precision level, semantics, and composition information; and a multi-scale guided diffusion model to synthesize images. To evaluate the proposed method, we collect a test dataset containing user-drawn layouts with diverse scenes and styles. Experimental results show that the proposed method can generate high-quality images following the layout at given precision, and compares favorably against existing methods.

Many current panoptic segmentation methods, however, predict masks of semantic classes and object instances in separate branches, yielding inconsistent predictions. Moreover, because state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation models rely on box proposals, the instance masks predicted are often of low-resolution. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Panoptic Refinement Network (PRN), which takes masks from base panoptic segmentation models and refines them jointly to produce coherent results. PRN extends the offset map-based architecture of Panoptic-Deeplab with several novel ideas including a foreground mask and instance bounding box offsets, as well as coordinate convolutions for improved spatial prediction. Experimental results on COCO and Cityscapes show that PRN can significantly improve already accurate results from a variety of panoptic segmentation networks."}}

During deployment, one may expect that large-scale pretrained models should trigger a conservative fallback policy when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, which suggests the importance of OOD detection. However, most existing OOD detection methods focus on single-modal inputs such as images or texts. While documents are multi-modal in nature, it is underexplored if and how multi-modal information in documents can be exploited for OOD detection. In this work, we first provide a systematic and in-depth analysis on OOD detection for document understanding models. We study the effects of model modality, pretraining, and finetuning across various types of OOD inputs. In particular, we find that spatial information is critical for document OOD detection. To better exploit spatial information, we propose a simple yet effective special-aware adapter, which serves as an add-on module to adapt transformer-based language models to document domain. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently improves ID accuracy and OOD detection performance compared to baselines. We hope our findings can help inspire future works on understanding OOD robustness for documents."}}

Previous works have outlined two important qualities that a reliable confidence estimation model should possess, i.e., the ability to perform well under label imbalance and the ability to handle various out-of-distribution data inputs. In this work, we propose a meta-learning framework that can simultaneously improve upon both qualities in a confidence estimation model. Specifically, we first construct virtual training and testing sets with some intentionally designed distribution differences between them. Our framework then uses the constructed sets to train the confidence estimation model through a virtual training and testing scheme leading it to learn knowledge that generalizes to diverse distributions. We show the effectiveness of our framework on both monocular depth estimation and image classification."}}

However, due to the long-tailed training data in datasets, the generalization performance of existing VidSGG models can be affected by the spatio-temporal conditional bias problem. In this work, from the perspective of meta-learning, we propose a novel Meta Video Scene Graph Generation (MVSGG) framework to address such a bias problem. Specifically, to handle various types of spatio-temporal conditional biases, our framework first constructs a support set and a group of query sets from the training data, where the data distribution of each query set is different from that of the support set w.r.t. a type of conditional bias. Then, by performing a novel meta training and testing process to optimize the model to obtain good testing performance on these query sets after training on the support set, our framework can effectively guide the model to learn to well generalize against biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework."}}

Recent self-supervised learning methods on large-scale unlabeled document datasets have opened up promising directions towards reducing annotation efforts by training models with self-supervised objectives. However, most of the existing document pretraining methods are still language-dominated. We present UDoc, a new unified pretraining framework for document understanding. UDoc is designed to support most document understanding tasks, extending the Transformer to take multimodal embeddings as input. Each input element is composed of words and visual features from a semantic region of the input document image. An important feature of UDoc is that it learns a generic representation by making use of three self-supervised losses, encouraging the representation to model sentences, learn similarities, and align modalities. Extensive empirical analysis demonstrates that the pretraining procedure learns better joint representations and leads to improvements in downstream tasks."}}

Yet, the number of object-level categories annotated in detection datasets is an order of magnitude smaller than image-level classification labels. State-of-the art object detection models are trained in a supervised fashion and this limits the number of object classes they can detect. In this paper, we propose a novel weight transfer network (WTN) to effectively and efficiently transfer knowledge from classification network's weights to detection network's weights to allow detection of novel classes without box supervision. We first introduce input and feature normalization schemes to curb the under-fitting during training of a vanilla WTN. We then propose autoencoder-WTN (AE-WTN) which uses reconstruction loss to preserve classification network's information over all classes in the target latent space to ensure generalization to novel classes. Compared to vanilla WTN, AE-WTN obtains absolute performance gains of 6% on two Open Images evaluation sets with 500 seen and 57 novel classes respectively, and 25% on a Visual Genome evaluation set with 200 novel classes."}}

However, current human-annotated visual relationship datasets suffer from the long-tailed predicate distribution problem which limits the potential of visual relationship models. In this work, we introduce a self-supervised method that implicitly learns the visual relationships without relying on any ground-truth visual relationship annotations. Our method relies on 1) intra- and inter-modality encodings to respectively model relationships within each modality separately and jointly, and 2) relationship probing, which seeks to discover the graph structure within each modality. By leveraging masked language modeling, contrastive learning, and dependency tree distances for self-supervision, our method learns better object features as well as implicit visual relationships. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method on various vision-language tasks that benefit from improved visual relationship understanding."}}

In many cases however, the computational budget that the system has for inference cannot be known beforehand during training, or the inference budget is dependent on the changing real-time resource availability. Thus, it is inadequate to train just inference-efficient CNNs, whose inference costs are not adjustable and cannot adapt to varied inference budgets. We propose a novel approach for cost-adjustable inference in CNNs - Stochastic Downsampling Point (SDPoint). During training, SDPoint applies feature map downsampling to a random point in the layer hierarchy, with a random downsampling ratio. The different stochastic downsampling configurations known as SDPoint instances (of the same model) have computational costs different from each other, while being trained to minimize the same prediction loss. Sharing network parameters across different instances provides significant regularization boost. During inference, one may handpick a SDPoint instance that best fits the inference budget. The effectiveness of SDPoint, as both a cost-adjustable inference approach and a regularizer, is validated through extensive experiments on image classification."}}

However, the methods based on a single feature vector are not sufficient enough to overcome visual ambiguity, which frequently occurs in real scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable framework, called Dual ATtention Matching network (DuATM), to learn context-aware feature sequences and perform attentive sequence comparison simultaneously. The core component of our DuATM framework is a dual attention mechanism, in which both intra-sequence and inter-sequence attention strategies are used for feature refinement and feature-pair alignment, respectively. Thus, detailed visual cues contained in the intermediate feature sequences can be automatically exploited and properly compared. We train the proposed DuATM network as a siamese network via a triplet loss assisted with a de-correlation loss and a cross-entropy loss. We conduct extensive experiments on both image and video based ReID benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}}
