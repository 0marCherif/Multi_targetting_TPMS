The idea is to divide the input 3D video data into three 2D data planes and use three 2D filters, implemented by 2D ViT, to extract spatial and motion features. Such a design not only effectively reduces the computational complexity of a 3D ViT, but also guides the network to focus on learning correlations among more relevant tokens. Compared with other decomposition methods, the proposed T2D is shown to be more powerful at a similar computational complexity. The CLIP-initialized T2D-B model achieves state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of 85.0% and 70.5% on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-v2 datasets, respectively. It also outperforms other methods by a large margin on FineGym (+17.9%) and Diving-48 (+1.3%) datasets. Under the zero-shot setting, the T2D model obtains a 2.5% top-1 accuracy gain over X-CLIP on HMDB-51 dataset. In addition, T2D is a general decomposition method that can be plugged into any ViT structure of any model size. We demonstrate this by building a tiny size of T2D model based on a hierarchical ViT structure named DaViT. The resulting DaViT-T2D-T model achieves 82.0\\% and 71.3\\% top-1 accuracy with only 91 GFLOPs on Kinectics-400 and Something-Something-v2 datasets, respectively. Source code will be made publicly available. "}}

Partitioning the entire visual field into multiple contour regions based on the distance to the center of our gaze, the peripheral vision provides us the ability to perceive various visual features at different regions. In this work, we take a biologically inspired approach and explore to model peripheral vision in deep neural networks for visual recognition. We propose to incorporate peripheral position encoding to the multi-head self-attention layers to let the network learn to partition the visual field into diverse peripheral regions given training data. We evaluate the proposed network, dubbed PerViT, on ImageNet-1K and systematically investigate the inner workings of the model for machine perception, showing that the network learns to perceive visual data similarly to the way that human vision does. The performance improvements in image classification over the baselines across different model sizes demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method."}}

It adopts a unified transformer-based visual encoder for both image and video inputs, and thus can perform joint image-language and video-language pretraining. We demonstrate, for the first time, such a paradigm benefits both image and video tasks, as opposed to the conventional one-directional transfer (e.g., use image-language to help video-language). To this end, we propose a \\emph{decoupled} joint pretraining of image-language and video-language to effectively decompose the vision-language modeling into spatial and temporal dimensions and obtain performance boost on both image and video tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel unified vision-language contrastive (UniVLC) loss to leverage image-text, video-text, image-label (e.g., image classification), video-label (e.g., video action recognition) data together, so that both supervised and noisily supervised pretraining data are utilized as much as possible. Without incurring extra task-specific adaptors, OmniVL can simultaneously support visual only tasks (e.g., image classification, video action recognition), cross-modal alignment tasks (e.g., image/video-text retrieval), and multi-modal understanding and generation tasks (e.g., image/video question answering, captioning). We evaluate OmniVL on a wide range of downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results with similar model size and data scale."}}

In this work, we explore whether the core self-attention module in Transformer is the key to achieving excellent performance in image recognition. To this end, we build an attention-free network called sMLPNet based on the existing MLP-based vision models. Specifically, we replace the MLP module in the token-mixing step with a novel sparse MLP (sMLP) module. For 2D image tokens, sMLP applies 1D MLP along the axial directions and the parameters are shared among rows or columns. By sparse connection and weight sharing, sMLP module significantly reduces the number of model parameters and computational complexity, avoiding the common over-fitting problem that plagues the performance of MLP-like models. When only trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset, the proposed sMLPNet achieves 81.9% top-1 accuracy with only 24M parameters, which is much better than most CNNs and vision Transformers under the same model size constraint. When scaling up to 66M parameters, sMLPNet achieves 83.4% top-1 accuracy, which is on par with the state-of-the-art Swin Transformer. The success of sMLPNet suggests that the self-attention mechanism is not necessarily a silver bullet in computer vision.

However, is the attention mechanism truly an indispensable part of ViT? Can it be replaced by some other alternatives? To demystify the role of attention mechanism, we simplify it into an extremely simple case: ZERO FLOP and ZERO parameter. Concretely, we revisit the shift operation. It does not contain any parameter or arithmetic calculation. The only operation is to exchange a small portion of the channels between neighboring features. Based on this simple operation, we construct a new backbone network, namely ShiftViT, where the attention layers in ViT are substituted by shift operations. Surprisingly, ShiftViT works quite well in several mainstream tasks, e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation. The performance is on par with or even better than the strong baseline Swin Transformer. These results suggest that the attention mechanism might not be the vital factor that makes ViT successful. It can be even replaced by a zero-parameter operation. We should pay more attentions to the remaining parts of ViT in the future work. Code is available at github.com/microsoft/SPACH."}}

In the proposed paradigm, global and local factors in speech are explicitly decomposed and separately manipulated to achieve high speaker similarity and continuous prosody. Specifically, we proposed to represent the global factors by multiple tokens, which are extracted by cross-attention operation and then injected back by link-attention operation. Due to the rich representation of global factors, we manage to achieve high speaker similarity in a zero-shot manner. In addition, we introduce a prosody smoothing task to make the local prosody factor context-aware and therefore achieve satisfactory prosody continuity. We further achieve high voice quality with an adversarial training stage. In the subjective test, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both naturalness and similarity.

Existing methods adopt a two-stage approach: synthesize the input text using a generic text-to-speech (TTS) engine and then transform the voice to the desired voice using voice conversion (VC). A major problem of this framework is that VC is a challenging problem which usually needs a moderate amount of parallel training data to work satisfactorily. In this paper, we propose a one-stage context-aware framework to generate natural and coherent target speech without any training data of the target speaker. In particular, we manage to perform accurate zero-shot duration prediction for the inserted text. The predicted duration is used to regulate both text embedding and speech embedding. Then, based on the aligned cross-modality input, we directly generate the mel-spectrogram of the edited speech with a transformer-based decoder. Subjective listening tests show that despite the lack of training data for the speaker, our method has achieved satisfactory results. It outperforms a recent zero-shot TTS engine by a large margin."}}

In the design of MGF, speech hierarchy is taken into consideration. Specifically, we propose to use generative learning approaches to capture fine-grained information at small time scales and use discriminative learning approaches to distill coarse-grained or semantic information at large time scales. For phoneme-scale learning, we borrow idea from the masked language model but tailor it for the continuous speech signal by replacing classification loss with a contrastive loss. We corroborate our design by evaluating MGF representation on various downstream tasks, including phoneme classification, speaker classification, speech recognition, and emotion classification. Experiments verify that training at different time scales needs different training targets and loss functions, which in general complement each other and lead to a better performance."}}

Recently, Transformer and multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models, such as Vision Transformer and MLP-Mixer, started to lead new trends as they showed promising results in the ImageNet classification task. In this paper, we conduct empirical studies on these DNN structures and try to understand their respective pros and cons. To ensure a fair comparison, we first develop a unified framework called SPACH which adopts separate modules for spatial and channel processing. Our experiments under the SPACH framework reveal that all structures can achieve competitive performance at a moderate scale. However, they demonstrate distinctive behaviors when the network size scales up. Based on our findings, we propose two hybrid models using convolution and Transformer modules. The resulting Hybrid-MS-S+ model achieves 83.9% top-1 accuracy with 63M parameters and 12.3G FLOPS. It is already on par with the SOTA models with sophisticated designs.

We point out that the ID task has an implicit semantic consistency (SC) assumption, which may not hold in unconstrained datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive mask prediction (CMP) task for visual representation learning and design a mask contrast (MaskCo) framework to implement the idea. MaskCo contrasts region-level features instead of view-level features, which makes it possible to identify the positive sample without any assumptions. To solve the domain gap between masked and unmasked features, we design a dedicated mask prediction head in MaskCo. This module is shown to be the key to the success of the CMP. We evaluated MaskCo on training datasets beyond ImageNet and compare its performance with MoCo V2 [4]. Results show that MaskCo achieves comparable performance with MoCo V2 using ImageNet training dataset, but demonstrates a stronger performance across a range of downstream tasks when COCO or Conceptual Captions are used for training. MaskCo provides a promising alternative to the ID-based methods for self-supervised learning in the wild."}}
