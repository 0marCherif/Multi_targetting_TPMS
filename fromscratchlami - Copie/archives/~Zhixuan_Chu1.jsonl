To make AI systems good enough and trustworthy, plenty of researches have been done to build guidelines for trustworthy AI systems. Machine learning is one of the most important parts for AI systems and representation learning is the fundamental technology in machine learning. How to make the representation learning trustworthy in real-world application, e.g., cross domain scenarios, is very valuable and necessary for both machine learning and AI system fields. Inspired by the concepts in trustworthy AI, we proposed the first trustworthy representation learning across domains framework which includes four concepts, i.e, robustness, privacy, fairness, and explainability, to give a comprehensive literature review on this research direction. Specifically, we first introduce the details of the proposed trustworthy framework for representation learning across domains. Second, we provide basic notions and comprehensively summarize existing methods for the trustworthy framework from four concepts. Finally, we conclude this survey with insights and discussions on future research directions."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to construct personalized reasoning graphs. These graphs link a user\u2019s profile and behavioral sequences through causal and logical inferences, representing the user\u2019s interests in an interpretable way. Our approach, LLM reasoning graphs (LLMRG), has four components: chained graph reasoning, divergent extension, self-verification and scoring, and knowledge base selfimprovement. The resulting reasoning graph is encoded using graph neural networks, which serves as additional input to improve conventional recommender systems, without requiring extra user or item information. Our approach demonstrates how LLMs can enable more logical and interpretable recommender systems through personalized reasoning graphs. LLMRG allows recommendations to benefit from both engineered recommendation systems and LLM-derived reasoning graphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMRG on\nbenchmarks and real-world scenarios in enhancing base recommendation models."}}

Although significant advances have been made to overcome the challenges in causal effect estimation with observational data, such as missing counterfactual outcomes and selection bias between treatment and control groups, the existing methods mainly focus on source-specific and stationary observational data. Such learning strategies assume that all observational data are already available during the training phase and from only one source. This practical concern of accessibility is ubiquitous in various academic and industrial applications. That's what it boiled down to: in the era of big data, we face new challenges in causal inference with observational data, i.e., the extensibility for incrementally available observational data, the adaptability for extra domain adaptation problem except for the imbalance between treatment and control groups, and the accessibility for an enormous amount of data. In this position paper, we formally define the problem of continual treatment effect estimation, describe its research challenges, and then present possible solutions to this problem. Moreover, we will discuss future research directions on this topic.  "}}

Existing work on fair graph learning simply assumes that attributes of all nodes are available for model training and then makes fair predictions. In practice, however, the attributes of some nodes might not be accessible due to missing data or privacy concerns, which makes fair graph learning even more challenging. In this paper, we propose FairAC, a fair attribute completion method, to complement missing information and learn fair node embeddings for graphs with missing attributes. FairAC adopts an attention mechanism to deal with the attribute missing problem and meanwhile, it mitigates two types of unfairness, i.e., feature unfairness from attributes and topological unfairness due to attribute completion. FairAC can work on various types of homogeneous graphs and generate fair embeddings for them and thus can be applied to most downstream tasks to improve their fairness performance. To our best knowledge, FairAC is the first method that jointly addresses the graph attribution completion and graph unfairness problems. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method achieves better fairness performance with less sacrifice in accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art methods of fair graph learning.

To address this issue, recent literature has explored domain-invariant representation learning based on different domain divergence metrics (e.g., Wasserstein distance, maximum mean discrepancy, position-dependent metric, and domain overlap). In this paper, we reveal the weaknesses of these strategies, i.e., they lead to the loss of predictive information when enforcing the domain invariance; and the treatment effect estimation performance is unstable, which heavily relies on the characteristics of the domain distributions and the choice of domain divergence metrics. Motivated by information theory, we propose to learn the Infomax and Domain-Independent Representations to solve the above puzzles. Our method utilizes the mutual information between the global feature representations and individual feature representations, and the mutual information between feature representations and treatment assignment predictions, in order to maximally capture the common predictive information for both treatment and control groups. Moreover, our method filters out the influence of instrumental and irrelevant variables, and thus it effectively increases the predictive ability of potential outcomes. Experimental results on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on causal effect inference. Moreover, our method exhibits reliable prediction performances when facing data with different characteristics of data distributions, complicated variable types, and severe covariate imbalance."}}

In this paper, we describe causal inference for application in a novel clinical design called basket trial that tests how well a new drug works in patients who have different types of cancer that all have the same mutation. We propose a multi-task adversarial learning (MTAL) method, which incorporates feature selection multi-task representation learning and adversarial learning to estimate potential outcomes across different tumor types for patients sharing the same genetic mutation but having different tumor types. In our paper, the basket trial is employed as an intuitive example to present this new causal inference setting. This new causal inference setting includes, but is not limited to basket trials. This setting has the same challenges as the traditional causal inference problem, i.e., missing counterfactual outcomes under different subgroups and treatment selection bias due to confounders. We present the practical advantages of our MTAL method for the analysis of synthetic basket trial data and evaluate the proposed estimator on two benchmarks, IHDP and News. The results demonstrate the superiority of our MTAL method over the competing state-of-the-art methods."}}

In multi-horizon and multi-series forecasting tasks, accurately capturing the local information in a sequence and effectively sharing global information across different sequences are very challenging, due to the complex dependencies over time in a long sequence and the heterogeneous nature across multiple time series. In this paper, from the perspective of causal inference, we give a theoretical analysis of these difficulties and establish a causal graph to identify the confounding relationship that generates harmful bias and misleads the time series model to capture the spurious correlations. We propose a causal triple attention time series forecasting model with three interpretable attention modules, which leverages the front-door adjustment to remove the confounding effect and help the model effectively utilize the local and global temporal information.  We evaluate the performance of our model on four benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the superiority over the state-of-the-art methods.\n"}}

In this paper, we propose a Graph Infomax Adversarial Learning (GIAL) model for treatment effect estimation, which makes full use of the network structure to capture more information by recognizing the imbalance in network structure. We evaluate the performance of our GIAL model on two benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate superiority over the state-of-the-art methods."}}

Embraced with the rapidly developed machine learning area, various causal effect estimation methods for observational data have sprung up. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of causal inference methods under the potential outcome framework, one of the well-known causal inference frameworks. The methods are divided into two categories depending on whether they require all three assumptions of the potential outcome framework or not. For each category, both the traditional statistical methods and the recent machine learning enhanced methods are discussed and compared. The plausible applications of these methods are also presented, including the applications in advertising, recommendation, medicine, and so on. Moreover, the commonly used benchmark datasets as well as the open-source codes are also summarized, which facilitate researchers and practitioners to explore, evaluate and apply the causal inference methods."}}
