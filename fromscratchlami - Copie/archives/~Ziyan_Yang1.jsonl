We refer to this objective as Attention Mask Consistency (AMC) and demonstrate that it produces superior visual grounding results than previous methods that rely on using vision-language models to score the outputs of object detectors. Particularly, a model trained with AMC on top of standard vision-language modeling objectives obtains a state-of-the-art accuracy of 86.49% in the Flickr30k visual grounding benchmark, an absolute improvement of 5.38% when compared to the best previous model trained under the same level of supervision. Our approach also performs exceedingly\nwell on established benchmarks for referring expression comprehension where it obtains 80.34% accuracy in the easy test of RefCOCO+, and 64.55% in the difficult split. AMC is effective, easy to implement, and is general as it can be adopted by any vision-language model, and can use any type of region annotations."}}

We refer to this objective as Attention Mask Consistency (AMC) and demonstrate that it produces superior visual grounding performance compared to models that rely instead on region-level annotations for explicitly training an object detector such as Faster R-CNN. AMC works by encouraging gradient-based explanation masks that focus their attention scores mostly within annotated regions of interest for images that contain such annotations.

This leaves how to close the generalization gap of adaptive gradient methods an open problem. In this work, we show that adaptive gradient methods such as Adam, Amsgrad, are sometimes \"over adapted\". We design a new algorithm, called Partially adaptive momentum estimation method, which unifies the Adam/Amsgrad with SGD by introducing a partial adaptive parameter $p$, to achieve the best from both worlds. We also prove the convergence rate of our proposed algorithm to a stationary point in the stochastic nonconvex optimization setting. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our proposed algorithm can maintain fast convergence rate as Adam/Amsgrad while generalizing as well as SGD in training deep neural networks. These results would suggest practitioners pick up adaptive gradient methods once again for faster training of deep neural networks."}}

In this paper, we introduce ChairSegments, a novel and compact semi-synthetic dataset for object segmentation. We also show empirical findings in transfer learning that mirror recent findings for image classification. We particularly show that models that are fine-tuned from a pretrained set of weights lie in the same basin of the optimization landscape. ChairSegments consists of a diverse set of prototypical images of chairs with transparent backgrounds composited into a diverse array of backgrounds. We aim for ChairSegments to be the equivalent of the CIFAR-10 dataset but for quickly designing and iterating over novel model architectures for segmentation. On Chair Segments, a U-Net model can be trained to full convergence in only thirty minutes using a single GPU. Finally, while this dataset is semi-synthetic, it can be a useful proxy for real data, leading to state-of-the-art accuracy on the Object Discovery dataset when used as a source of pretraining."}}
