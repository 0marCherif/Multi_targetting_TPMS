In spite of several recent advancements in the fields of machine learning and data mining, correctly classifying items for a particular user search query has been a long-standing challenge, which still has a large room for improvement. This paper introduces the \"Shopping Queries Dataset\", a large dataset of difficult Amazon search queries and results, publicly released with the aim of fostering research in improving the quality of search results. The dataset contains around 130 thousand unique queries and 2.6 million manually labeled (query,product) relevance judgements. The dataset is multilingual with queries in English, Japanese, and Spanish. The Shopping Queries Dataset is being used in one of the KDDCup'22 challenges. In this paper, we describe the dataset and present three evaluation tasks along with baseline results: (i) ranking the results list, (ii) classifying product results into relevance categories, and (iii) identifying substitute products for a given query. We anticipate that this data will become the gold standard for future research in the topic of product search."}}

But managing it becomes harder as the demand for new functionalities grow. Microservice architecture is seen as an alternative as it advocates building an application through a set of loosely coupled small services wherein each service owns a single functional responsibility. But the challenges associated with the separation of functional modules, slows down the migration of a monolithic code into microservices. In this work, we propose a representation learning based solution to tackle this problem. We use a heterogeneous graph to jointly represent software artifacts (like programs and resources) and the different relationships they share (function calls, inheritance, etc.), and perform a constraint-based clustering through a novel heterogeneous graph neural network. Experimental studies show that our approach is effective on monoliths of different types."}}

Forecasting soil moisture is essential to schedule the irrigation and optimize the use of water. Physics based soil moisture models need rich features and heavy computation which is not scalable. In recent literature, conventional machine learning models have been applied for this problem. These models are fast and simple, but they often fail to capture the spatio-temporal correlation that soil moisture exhibits over a region. In this work, we propose a novel graph neural network based solution that learns temporal graph structures and forecast soil moisture in an end-to-end framework. Our solution is able to handle the problem of missing ground truth soil moisture which is common in practice. We show the merit of our algorithm on real-world soil moisture data."}}

Ideally, it is required for any graph embedding algorithm to preserve the structural aspects of the graph as well as the graph properties in the embedding space. While there exists a large number of works in the literature to preserve certain structural properties, there are only a few attempts to preserve distance-based graph properties such as asymmetric transitivity in directed graphs [Ou et al., in: 22nd ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining (SIGKDD), 2016] and structural balance property in signed networks [Derr et al., in: 27th ACM international conference on information and knowledge management (CIKM), 2018; Wang et al., in: SIAM International conference on data mining (SDM), 2017]. In the context of preserving distance-based graph properties in the embedding space, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any notable work in the literature that preserves shortest distance-based graph properties such as closeness centrality, diameter, radius, and relative ordering of node pairs based on shortest distances in the embedding space. We address this important research gap in this paper. In particular, we first present a set of four metrics to measure how effectively any graph embedding algorithm preserves certain shortest distance-based graph properties. Surprisingly, we notice that several well-known graph embedding algorithms do not satisfactorily preserve these important graph distance-based properties. To address this research gap, we present a new graph embedding algorithm, CAscading-based Robust Embedding (CARE), which is based on a novel idea of cascading embedding vectors through the underlying graph to effectively preserve shortest distance-based graph properties. We then conduct thorough empirical analysis of the proposed CARE algorithm to demonstrate its efficacy using certain well-known graph analysis tasks (such as clustering, node label classification, and visualization) vis-\u00e0-vis several state-of-the-art graph embedding algorithms."}}

Due to the recent success of graph neural networks for node classification and representation, researchers started extending them for the entire graph classification purpose. The main challenge is to represent the whole graph by a single vector which can be used to classify the graph in an end-to-end fashion. Global pooling, where node representations are directly aggregated to form the graph representation and more recently hierarchical pooling, where the whole graph is converted to a smaller graph through a set of hierarchies, are proposed in the literature. Though hierarchical pooling shows promising results for graph classification, it looses a significant amount of information in the hierarchical architecture. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid graph pooling architecture, which finds the importance of different hierarchies of pooling and aggregates them accordingly. We use a series of graph isomorphism networks, along with a bi-directional LSTM with self attention to implement the proposed hybrid pooling. Experiments show the merit of the proposed architecture with respect to a diverse set of state-of-the-art algorithms on multiple datasets."}}

Data remains susceptible to errors or irregularities that may be introduced during collection, aggregation or annotation stage. This necessitates profiling and assessment of data to understand its suitability for machine learning tasks and failure to do so can result in inaccurate analytics and unreliable decisions. While researchers and practitioners have focused on improving the quality of models, there are limited efforts towards improving the data quality. Assessing the quality of the data across intelligently designed metrics and developing corresponding transformation operations to address the quality gaps helps to reduce the effort of a data scientist for iterative debugging of the ML pipeline to improve model performance. This tutorial highlights the importance of analysing data quality in terms of its value for ML applications. Finding the data quality issues in data helps different personas like data stewards, data scientists, subject matter experts, or machine learning scientists to get relevant data insights and take remedial actions to rectify any issue. This tutorial surveys all the important data quality related approaches for structured, unstructured and spatio-temporal domains discussed in literature, focusing on the intuition behind them, highlighting their strengths and similarities, and illustrates their applicability to real-world problems. Finally we will discuss the interesting work IBM Research is doing in this space."}}
