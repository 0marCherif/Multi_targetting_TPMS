The drawback of quadratic complexity of its token-wise multi-head self-attention (MHSA), is extensively addressed via either token sparsification or dimension reduction (in spatial or channel). However, the therein redundancy of MHSA is usually overlooked and so is the feed-forward network (FFN). To this end, we propose attention map hallucination and FFN compaction to fill in the blank. Specifically, we observe similar attention maps exist in vanilla ViT and propose to hallucinate half of the attention maps from the rest with much cheaper operations, which is called hallucinated-MHSA (hMHSA). As for FFN, we factorize its hidden-to-output projection matrix and leverage the re-parameterization technique to strengthen its capability, making it compact-FFN (cFFN). With our proposed modules, a 10$\\%$-20$\\%$ reduction of floating point operations (FLOPs) and parameters (Params) is achieved for various ViT-based backbones, including straight (DeiT), hybrid (NextViT) and hierarchical (PVT) structures, meanwhile, the performances are quite competitive."}}
