FSPNs are designed to overcome the drawbacks of existing PGMs in terms of estimation accuracy and inference efficiency. Specifically, Bayesian networks (BNs) have low inference speed and performance of tree-structured sum-product networks(SPNs) significantly degrades in presence of highly correlated variables. FSPNs absorb their advantages by adaptively modeling the joint distribution of variables according to their dependence degree, so that one can simultaneously attain the two desirable goals\u2014high estimation accuracy and fast inference speed. We present efficient probability inference and structure learning algorithms for FSPNs, along with a theoretical analysis and extensive evaluation evidence. Our experimental results on synthetic and benchmark datasets indicate the superiority of FSPN over other PGMs."}}

Utilizing a formal synchronization policy description in the PS-setting, we are able to derive a suitable and compact description of states and actions, allowing us to efficiently use the standard off-the-shelf deep Q-learning algorithm. As a result, we are able to learn synchronization policies which generalize to different cluster environments, different training datasets and small model variations and (most importantly) lead to considerable decreases in training time when compared to standard policies such as bulk synchronous parallel (BSP), asynchronous parallel (ASP), or stale synchronous parallel (SSP). To support our claims we present extensive numerical results obtained from experiments performed in simulated cluster environments. In our experiments training time is reduced by 44 on average and learned policies generalize to multiple unseen circumstances."}}
