This explicit diagonalization makes it possible to get sharp rates of convergence to stationarity. The process, the Burnside process, is a special case of the celebrated \u2018Swendsen\u2013Wang\u2019 or \u2018data augmentation\u2019 algorithm. The description involves the beta-binomial distribution and Mallows model on permutations. It introduces a useful generalization of the Burnside process."}}
