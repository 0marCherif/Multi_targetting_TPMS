Loosely speaking, work under this umbrella falls into two categories: (a) use a predefined graph hierarchy to perform pooling; and (b) learn the hierarchy for a given graph through differentiable parameterization of the coarsening process. These approaches are supervised; a predictive task with ground-truth labels is used to drive the learning. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach, \\textsc{BayesPool}, with the use of variational Bayes. It produces graph representations given a predefined hierarchy. Rather than relying on labels, the training signal comes from the evidence lower bound of encoding a graph and decoding the subsequent one in the hierarchy. Node features are treated latent in this variational machinery, so that they are produced as a byproduct and are used in downstream tasks. We demonstrate a comprehensive set of experiments to show the usefulness of the learned representation in the context of graph classification."}}

In recent years, a variety of  graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied for representation learning and prediction on such graphs. However, in many of the applications, the underlying graph changes over time and existing GNNs are inadequate for handling such dynamic graphs. In this paper we propose a novel technique for learning embeddings of dynamic graphs based on a tensor algebra framework. Our method extends the popular graph convolutional network (GCN) for learning representations of dynamic graphs using the recently proposed tensor M-product technique. Theoretical results that establish the connection between the proposed tensor approach and spectral convolution of tensors are developed. Numerical experiments on real datasets demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method for an edge classification task on dynamic graphs."}}

We introduce the Union of Intersections (UoI) method, a flexible, modular, and scalable framework for enhanced model selection and estimation. The method performs model selection and model estimation through intersection and union operations, respectively. We show that UoI can satisfy the bi-criteria of low-variance and nearly unbiased estimation of a small number of interpretable features, while maintaining high-quality prediction accuracy. We perform extensive numerical investigation to evaluate a UoI algorithm ($UoI_{Lasso}$) on synthetic and real data. In doing so, we demonstrate the extraction of interpretable functional networks from human electrophysiology recordings as well as the accurate prediction of phenotypes from genotype-phenotype data with reduced features. We also show (with the $UoI_{L1Logistic}$ and $UoI_{CUR}$ variants of the basic framework) improved prediction parsimony for classification and matrix factorization on several benchmark biomedical data sets. These results suggest that methods based on UoI framework could improve interpretation and prediction in data-driven discovery across scientific fields."}}
