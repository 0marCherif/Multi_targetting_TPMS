Obtaining a diverse ensemble set of model parameters results in better model averaging performance and better approximation of the true posterior distribution of these parameters. In this paper, we propose the diversity-enhanced probabilistic ensemble method with the adaptive uncertainty-guided ensemble learning strategy for better quantifying uncertainty and further improving the model robustness. Specifically, we construct the probabilistic ensemble model by building a Gaussian distribution of the model parameters for each ensemble component using Laplacian approximation in a post-processing manner. Then a mixture of Gaussian model is established with learnable and refinable parameters in an EM-like algorithm. During ensemble training, we leverage the uncertainty estimated from previous models as guidance when training the next one such that the new model will focus more on the less explored regions by previous models. Various experiments including out-of-distribution detection and image classification under distributional shifts have demonstrated better uncertainty estimation and improved model generalization ability of our proposed method."}}

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{KNOWN}, a framework that effectively utilizes body \\textbf{KNOW}ledge and u\\textbf{N}certainty modeling to compensate for insufficient 3D supervisions. KNOWN exploits a comprehensive set of generic body constraints derived from well-established body knowledge. These generic constraints precisely and explicitly characterize the reconstruction plausibility and enable 3D reconstruction models to be trained without any 3D data. Moreover, existing methods typically use images from multiple datasets during training, which can result in data noise (\\textit{e.g.}, inconsistent joint annotation) and data imbalance (\\textit{e.g.}, minority images representing unusual poses or captured from challenging camera views). KNOWN solves these problems through a novel probabilistic framework that models both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatoric uncertainty is encoded in a robust Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) training loss, while epistemic uncertainty is used to guide model refinement. Experiments demonstrate that KNOWN's body reconstruction outperforms prior weakly-supervised approaches, particularly on the challenging minority images."}}

To build a trusted AI system, it is therefore critical to accurately quantify the prediction uncertainties. While current efforts focus on improving uncertainty quantification accuracy and efficiency, there is a need to identify uncertainty sources and take actions to mitigate their effects on predictions. Therefore, we propose to develop explainable and actionable Bayesian deep learning methods to not only perform accurate uncertainty quantification but also explain the uncertainties, identify their sources, and propose strategies to mitigate the uncertainty impacts. Specifically, we introduce a gradient-based uncertainty attribution method to identify the most problematic regions of the input that contribute to the prediction uncertainty. Compared to existing methods, the proposed UA-Backprop has competitive accuracy, relaxed assumptions, and high efficiency. Moreover, we propose an uncertainty mitigation strategy that leverages the attribution results as attention to further improve the model performance. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods."}}

Though BP has been applied successfully to many different fields, it offers no performance guarantee and often performs poorly on loopy graphs. To improve the performance on loopy graphs and to scale up to large graphs, we propose a variational message passing neural network (V-MPNN), where we leverage both the power of neural networks in modeling complex functions and the well-established algorithmic theories on variational belief propagation. Instead of relying on a hand-crafted variational assumption, we propose a neural free energy where a general variational distribution is parameterized through a neural network. A message passing neural network is utilized for the minimization of neural free energy. Training of the MPNN is thus guided by neural free energy, without requiring exact MAP configurations as annotations. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed V-MPNN by comparing against both state-of-the-art training-free methods and training-based methods."}}
