Given that state-of-the-art GNNs share many similarities with their CNN cousins and that CNNs suffer adversarial vulnerabilities, there has also been interest in exploring analogous vulnerabilities in GNNs. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated that node classification performance of several graph models, including the popular graph convolution network (GCN) model, can be severely degraded through adversarial perturbations to the graph structure and the node features. In this work, we take a first step towards detecting adversarial attacks against graph models. We first propose a straightforward single node threshold test for detecting nodes subject to targeted attacks. Subsequently, we describe a kernel-based two-sample test for detecting whether a given subset of nodes within a graph has been maliciously corrupted. The efficacy of our algorithms is established via thorough experiments using commonly used node classification benchmark datasets. We also illustrate the potential practical benefit of our detection method by demonstrating its application to a real-world Bitcoin transaction network."}}

With the increased interest in graph based machine learning techniques, there have been investigations which suggest that these models are also vulnerable to attacks. In particular, corruptions of the graph topology can degrade the performance of graph based learning algorithms severely. This is due to the fact that the prediction capability of these algorithms relies mostly on the similarity structure imposed by the graph connectivity. Therefore, detecting the location of the corruption and correcting the induced errors becomes crucial. There has been some recent work which tackles the detection problem, however these methods do not address the effect of the attack on the downstream learning task. In this work, we propose an algorithm that uses node copying to mitigate the degradation in classification that is caused by adversarial attacks. The proposed methodology is applied only after the model for the downstream task is trained and the added computation cost scales well for large graphs.

Active learning can improve the achieved classification performance for a given budget on the number of queried labels. The best existing methods are based on graph neural networks, but they often perform poorly unless a sizeable validation set of labelled nodes is available in order to choose good hyperparameters. We propose a novel graph-based active learning algorithm for the task of node classification in attributed graphs; our algorithm uses graph cognizant logistic regression, equivalent to a linearized graph convolutional neural network (GCN), for the prediction phase and maximizes the expected error reduction in the query phase. To reduce the delay experienced by a labeller interacting with the system, we derive a preemptive querying system that calculates a new query during the labelling process, and to address the setting where learning starts with almost no labelled data, we also develop a hybrid algorithm that performs adaptive model averaging of label propagation and linearized GCN inference. We conduct experiments on five public benchmark datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches and illustrate the practical value of the method by applying it to a private microwave link network dataset."}}

Recent endeavours in machine learning for graph-structured data have led to many architectures and learning algorithms. However, the graph used by these algorithms is often constructed based on inaccurate modelling assumptions and/or noisy data. As a result, it fails to represent the true relationships between nodes. A Bayesian framework which targets posterior inference of the graph by considering it as a random quantity can be beneficial. In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric graph model for constructing the posterior distribution of graph adjacency matrices. The proposed model is flexible in the sense that it can effectively take into account the output of graph-based learning algorithms that target specific tasks. In addition, model inference scales well to large graphs. We demonstrate the advantages of this model in three different problem settings: node classification, link prediction and recommendation."}}

One of the most effective non-linear filtering approaches, particle filtering, suffers from weight degeneracy in high-dimensional filtering scenarios. Several avenues have been pursued to address high dimensionality. Among these, particle flow filters construct effective proposal distributions by using invertible flow to migrate particles continuously from the prior distribution to the posterior, and sequential Markov chain Monte Carlo (SMCMC) methods use a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) accept-reject approach to improve filtering performance. In this paper, we propose to combine the strengths of invertible particle flow and SMCMC by constructing a composite MH kernel within the SMCMC framework using invertible particle flow. In addition, we propose a Gaussian-mixture-model-based particle flow algorithm to construct effective MH kernels for multi-modal distributions. Simulation results show that for high-dimensional state estimation example problems, the proposed kernels significantly increase the acceptance rate with minimal additional computational overhead and improve estimation accuracy compared with state-of-the-art filtering algorithms."}}

In this framework, the observed graph is considered to be a random realization from a parametric random graph model and the joint Bayesian inference of the graph and GCNN weights is performed. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric generative model for graphs and incorporate it within the BGCN framework.
