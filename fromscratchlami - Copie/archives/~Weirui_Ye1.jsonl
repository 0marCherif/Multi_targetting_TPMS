It is difficult for operators to obtain accurate day-ahead forecasts of renewable generation, thereby requiring the future scheduling system to make real-time scheduling decisions aligning with ultra-short-term forecasts. Restricted by the computation speed, traditional optimization-based methods can not solve this problem. Recent developments in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the potential to solve this challenge. However, the existing RL methods are inadequate in terms of constraint complexity, algorithm performance, and environment fidelity. We are the first to propose a systematic solution based on the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm and the real power grid environment. The proposed approach enables planning and finer time resolution adjustments of power generators, including unit commitment and economic dispatch, thus increasing the grid's ability to admit more renewable energy. The well-trained scheduling agent significantly reduces renewable curtailment and load shedding, which are issues arising from traditional scheduling's reliance on inaccurate day-ahead forecasts. High-frequency control decisions exploit the existing units' flexibility, reducing the power grid's dependence on hardware transformations and saving investment and operating costs, as demonstrated in experimental results. This research exhibits the potential of reinforcement learning in promoting low-carbon and intelligent power systems and represents a solid step toward sustainable electricity generation."}}

On the other hand, state-of-the-art model-based RL methods can achieve human-level sample efficiency but often take a much longer over all training time than model-free methods. However, high sample efficiency and fast training time are both important to many real-world applications. We develop SpeedyZero, a distributed RL system built upon a state-of-the-art model-based RL method, EfficientZero, with a dedicated system design for fast distributed computation. We also develop two novel algorithmic techniques, Priority Refresh and Clipped LARS, to stabilize training with massive parallelization and large batch size. SpeedyZero maintains on-par sample efficiency compared with EfficientZero while achieving a 14.5X speedup in wall-clock time, leading to human-level performances on the Atari benchmark within 35 minutes using only 300k samples. In addition, we also present an in-depth analysis on the fundamental challenges in further scaling our system to bring insights to the community."}}

However, it suffers from the low sample efficiency and poor generalization ability, which prevent RL from being useful in real-world scenarios. Inspired by the huge success of unsupervised pre-training methods on language and vision domains, we propose to improve the sample efficiency via a novel pre-training method for model-based RL. \nInstead of using pre-recorded agent trajectories that come with their own actions, we consider the setting where the pre-training data are action-free videos, which are more common and available in the real world. We introduce a two-phase training pipeline as follows: for the pre-training phase, we implicitly extract the hidden action embedding from videos and pre-train the visual representation and the environment dynamics network through a novel \\Changes{forward-inverse} cycle consistency \\Changes{(FICC)} objective based on vector quantization; for down-stream tasks, we finetune with small amount of task data based on the learned models. Our framework can significantly improve the sample efficiency on Atari Games with data of only one hour of game playing. We achieve 118.4\\% mean human performance and 36.0\\% median performance with only 50k environment steps, which is 85.6\\% and 65.1\\% better than the scratch EfficientZero model. We believe such pre-training approach can provide an option for solving real-world RL problems. The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/YeWR/FICC.git}."}}
