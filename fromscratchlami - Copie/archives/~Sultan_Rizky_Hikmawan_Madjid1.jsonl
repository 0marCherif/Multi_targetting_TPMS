Amongst them, momentum-based frameworks have attracted significant attention. Despite being a great success, these momentum-based SSL frameworks suffer from a large gap in representation between the online encoder (student) and the momentum encoder (teacher), which hinders performance on downstream tasks. This paper is the first to investigate and identify this invisible gap as a bottleneck that has been overlooked in the existing SSL frameworks, potentially preventing the models from learning good representation. To solve this problem, we propose \"residual momentum\" to directly reduce this gap to encourage the student to learn the representation as close to that of the teacher as possible, narrow the performance gap with the teacher, and significantly improve the existing SSL. Our method is straightforward, easy to implement, and can be easily plugged into other SSL frameworks. Extensive experimental results on numerous benchmark datasets and diverse network architectures have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method over the state-of-the-art contrastive learning baselines."}}

SoftNet jointly learns the model weights and adaptive non-binary soft masks at a base training session in which each mask consists of the major and minor subnetwork; the former aims to minimize catastrophic forgetting during training, and the latter aims to avoid overfitting to a few samples in each new training session.

However, to the best of our knowledge, few of these studies are mainly focused on compressed images. A problem such as complicated compression artifacts hinders the advance of this study in spite of its high practical values. To tackle this problem, we proposed CISRNet; a network that employs a two-stage coarse-to-fine learning framework that is mainly optimized for Compressed Image Super-Resolution Problem. Specifically, CISRNet consists of two main subnetworks; the coarse and refinement network, where recursive and residual learning is employed within these two networks respectively. Extensive experiments show that with a careful design choice, CISRNet performs favorably against competing Single-Image Super-Resolution methods in the Compressed Image Super-Resolution tasks."}}

Given the body postures of the patient in the Dix-Hallpike and lateral head turns test, the visual information of both eyes is captured and fed into LAD for analyzing and classifying into one of six possible disorders which the patient might be suffering from. The proposed system consists of two streams: (1) an RNN-based stream that takes raw RGB images of both eyes to extract visual features and optical flow of each eye followed by ternary classification to determine left/right posterior canal (PC) or other; and (2) pupil detector stream that detects the pupil when it is classified as Non-PC and classifies the direction and strength of the beating to categorize the Non-PC types into the remaining four classes: Geotropic BPPV (left and right) and Apogeotropic BPPV (left and right). Experimental results show that with the given body postures of the patient, the system is capable of accurately classifying given BPPV disorder into the six types of disorder with an accuracy of 91% on the validation set. The proposed method can successfully classify disorders with an accuracy of 93% for the Posterior Canal disorder and 95% for the Geotropic and Apogeotropic disorder, paving a potential direction for research with the medical data."}}
