Despite recent successes of deep reinforcement learning (RL) in various decision making problems, an important but under-explored aspect is how to leverage oracle observation (the information that is invisible during online decision making, but is available during offline training) to facilitate learning. For example, human experts will look at the replay after a Poker game, in which they can check the opponents' hands to improve their estimation of the opponents' hands from the visible information during playing. In this work, we study such problems based on Bayesian theory and derive an objective to leverage oracle observation in RL using variational methods. Our key contribution is to propose a general learning framework referred to as variational latent oracle guiding (VLOG) for DRL. VLOG is featured with preferable properties such as its robust and promising performance and its versatility to incorporate with any value-based DRL algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of VLOG in online and offline RL domains with tasks ranging from video games to a challenging tile-based game Mahjong. Furthermore, we publish the Mahjong environment and an offline RL dataset as a benchmark to facilitate future research on oracle guiding (https://github.com/Agony5757/mahjong)."}}

We propose a novel computational framework of decision making with Bayesian inference, in which everything is integrated as an entire neural network model. The model learns to predict environmental state transitions by self-exploration and generating motor actions by sampling stochastic internal states ${z}$. Habitual behavior, which is obtained from the prior distribution of ${z}$, is acquired by reinforcement learning. Goal-directed behavior is determined from the posterior distribution of ${z}$ by planning, using active inference which optimizes the past, current and future ${z}$ by minimizing the variational free energy for the desired future observation constrained by the observed sensory sequence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by experiments in a sensorimotor navigation task with camera observations and continuous motor actions."}}

A developmental system can overcome this difficulty by learning from both demonstrations and self-exploration. However, existing methods are not applicable to most real-world robotic controlling problems because they assume that environments follow Markov decision processes (MDP); thus, they do not extend to partially observable environments where historical observations are necessary for decision making. This paper builds on the idea of replaying demonstrations for memory-dependent continuous control, by proposing a novel algorithm, Recurrent Actor-Critic with Demonstration and Experience Replay (READER). Experiments involving several memory-crucial continuous control tasks reveal significantly reduce interactions with the environment using our method with a reasonably small number of demonstration samples. The algorithm also shows better sample efficiency and learning capabilities than a baseline reinforcement learning algorithm for memory-based control from demonstrations."}}

In many FFNs, neurons in one layer have intrinsic properties that are distinct from those in their pre-/postsynaptic layers, but how this affects network-level information processing remains unexplored. Here we show that layer-to-layer heterogeneity arising from lamina-specific cellular properties facilitates signal and information transmission in FFNs. Specifically, we found that signal transformations, made by each layer of neurons on an input-driven spike signal, demodulate signal distortions introduced by preceding layers. This mechanism boosts information transfer carried by a propagating spike signal, and thereby supports reliable spike signal and information transmission in a deep FFN. Our study suggests that distinct cell types in neural circuits, performing different computational functions, facilitate information processing on the whole."}}

However, little effort has been spent on improving RNN architectures and on understanding the underlying neural mechanisms for performance gain. In this paper, we propose a novel, multiple-timescale, stochastic RNN for RL. Empirical results show that the network can autonomously learn to abstract sub-goals and can self-develop an action hierarchy using internal dynamics in a challenging continuous control task. Furthermore, we show that the self-developed compositionality of the network enhances faster re-learning when adapting to a new task that is a re-composition of previously learned sub-goals, than when starting from scratch. We also found that improved performance can be achieved when neural activities are subject to stochastic rather than deterministic dynamics."}}

However, current policy evaluation algorithms, which plays a key role in many RL algorithms, are either prone to noise or inefficient. To solve this issue, we introduce a novel policy evaluation algorithm, which we call Gap-increasing RetrAce Policy Evaluation (GRAPE). It leverages two recent ideas: (1) gap-increasing value update operators in advantage learning for noise-tolerance and (2) off-policy eligibility trace in Retrace algorithm for efficient learning. We provide detailed theoretical analysis of the new algorithm that shows its efficiency and noise-tolerance inherited from Retrace and advantage learning. Furthermore, our analysis shows that GRAPE's learning is significantly efficient than that of a simple learning-rate-based approach while keeping the same level of noise-tolerance. We applied GRAPE to control problems and obtained experimental results supporting our theoretical analysis."}}
