Its key objective is to determine the initial locations of large chip modules with minimized wirelength while adhering to the density constraint, which in essence is a process of constructing an optimized mapping from circuit connectivity to physical locations. Proven to be an NP-hard problem, chip floorplanning is difficult to be solved efficiently using algorithmic approaches. This article presents GraphPlanner, a variational graph-convolutional-network-based deep learning technique for chip floorplanning. GraphPlanner is able to learn an optimized and generalized mapping between circuit connectivity and physical wirelength and produce a chip floorplan using efficient model inference. GraphPlanner is further equipped with an efficient clustering method, a unification of hyperedge coarsening with graph spectral clustering, to partition a large-scale netlist into high-quality clusters with minimized inter-cluster weighted connectivity. GraphPlanner has been integrated with two state-of-the-art mixed-size placers. Experimental studies using both academic benchmarks and industrial designs demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art mixed-size placers alone, GraphPlanner improves placement runtime by 25% with 4% wirelength reduction on average."}}

We study the prospect of a recent deep-learning advent, dataset condensation (DC), in sharing healthcare data for AI research, and the results are promising. The condensed data abstracts original records and irreversibly conceals individual-level knowledge to achieve a bona fide de-identification, which permits free sharing. Moreover, the original deep-learning utilities are well preserved in the condensed data with compressed volume and accelerated model convergences. In PhysioNet-2012, a condensed dataset of 20 samples can orient deep models attaining 80.3% test AUC of mortality prediction (versus 85.8% of 5120 original records), an inspiring discovery generalised to MIMIC-III and Coswara datasets. We also interpret the inhere privacy protections of DC through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Dataset condensation opens a new gate to sharing healthcare data for AI research with multiple desirable traits."}}

However, due to the lack of appropriate datasets and platforms, the existing literature is limited in understanding the impact of recommender systems on this evolutionary process and the underlying mechanisms, resulting in sub-optimal system designs that may affect long-term utilities. In this work, we propose SimuLine, a simulation platform to dissect the evolution of news recommendation ecosystems and present a detailed analysis of the evolutionary process and underlying mechanisms. SimuLine first constructs a latent space well reflecting the human behaviors, and then simulates the news recommendation ecosystem via agent-based modeling. Based on extensive simulation experiments and the comprehensive analysis framework consisting of quantitative metrics, visualization, and textual explanations, we analyze the characteristics of each evolutionary phase from the perspective of life-cycle theory, and propose a relationship graph illustrating the key factors and affecting mechanisms. Furthermore, we explore the impacts of recommender system designing strategies, including the utilization of cold-start news, breaking news, and promotion, on the evolutionary process, which shed new light on the design of recommender systems."}}

To address these challenges, recommendation unlearning has emerged as a promising approach, which allows specific data and models to be forgotten, mitigating the risks of sensitive/malicious/toxic user data. However, existing methods often struggle to balance completeness, utility, and efficiency, i.e., compromising one for the other, leading to suboptimal recommendation unlearning. In this paper, we propose an Interaction and Mapping Matrices Correction (IMCorrect) method for recommendation unlearning. Firstly, we reveal that many collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms can be formulated as mapping-based approach, in which the recommendation results can be obtained by multiplying the user-item interaction matrix with a mapping matrix. Then, IMCorrect can achieve efficient recommendation unlearning by correcting the interaction matrix and enhance the completeness and utility by correcting the mapping matrix, all without costly model retraining. Unlike existing methods, IMCorrect is a whitebox model that offers greater flexibility in handling various recommendation unlearning scenarios. Additionally, it has the unique capability of incrementally learning from new data, which further enhances its practicality. We conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of IMCorrect and the results demonstrate that IMCorrect is superior in completeness, utility, and efficiency, and is applicable in many recommendation unlearning scenarios."}}
