As a representative, late fusion multi-view clustering algorithm has attracted extensive attention due to its low computation complexity yet promising performance. However, most of them deal with the clustering problem in which all data views are available in advance, and overlook the scenarios where data observations of new views are accumulated over time. To solve this issue, we propose a continual approach on the basis of late fusion multi-view clustering framework. In specific, it only needs to maintain a consensus partition matrix and update knowledge with the incoming one of a new data view rather than keep all of them. This benefits a lot by preventing the previously learned knowledge from recomputing over and over again, saving a large amount of computation resource/time and labor force. Nevertheless, we design an alternate and convergent strategy to solve the resultant optimization problem. Also, the proposed algorithm shows excellent clustering performance and time/space efficiency in the experiment."}}

Recently we witness a strong tendency of combining autoencoder and graph neural networks to exploit structure information for clustering performance enhancement. However, we observe that existing literature 1) lacks a dynamic fusion mechanism to selectively integrate and refine the information of graph structure and node attributes for consensus representation learning; 2) fails to extract information from both sides for robust target distribution (i.e., \u201cgroundtruth\u201d soft labels) generation. To tackle the above issues, we propose a Deep Fusion Clustering Network (DFCN). Specifically, in our network, an interdependency learning-based Structure and Attribute Information Fusion (SAIF) module is proposed to explicitly merge the representations learned by an autoencoder and a graph autoencoder for consensus representation learning. Also, a reliable target distribution generation measure and a triplet self-supervision strategy, which facilitate cross-modality information exploitation, are designed for network training. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets have demonstrated that the proposed DFCN consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art deep clustering methods."}}

Existing studies are limited by their representation capability, sample efficiency, and approximation error. To address these challenges, we propose, ResQ, a MARL value function factorization method, which can find the optimal joint policy for any state-action value function through residual functions. ResQ masks some state-action value pairs from a joint state-action value function, which is transformed as the sum of a main function and a residual function. ResQ can be used with mean-value and stochastic-value RL. We theoretically show that ResQ can satisfy both the individual global max (IGM) and the distributional IGM principle without representation limitations. Through experiments on matrix games, the predator-prey, and StarCraft benchmarks, we show that ResQ can obtain better results than multiple expected/stochastic value factorization methods."}}

However, current methods still face two problems: inefficient when handling out-of-sample data points and lack of theoretical study of the stability and generalization of clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can efficiently compute the embedding of out-of-sample data with a solid generalization guarantee. Specifically, we approximate the eigen functions of the integral operator associated with the linear combination of base kernel functions to construct low-dimensional embeddings of out-of-sample points for efficient multiple kernel clustering. In addition, we, for the first time, theoretically study the stability of clustering algorithms and prove that the single-view version of the proposed method has uniform stability as $\\mathcal{O}\\left(Kn^{-3/2}\\right)$ and establish an upper bound of excess risk as $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(Kn^{-3/2}+n^{-1/2}\\right)$, where $K$ is the cluster number and $n$ is the number of samples. We then extend the theoretical results to multiple kernel scenarios and find that the stability of MKC depends on kernel weights. As an example, we apply our method to a novel MKC algorithm termed SimpleMKKM and derive the upper bound of its excess clustering risk, which is tighter than the current results. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."}}

Although widely applied in large-scale applications, existing approaches do not pay sufficient attention to establishing correct correspondences between the anchor sets across views. To be specific, anchor graphs obtained from different views are not aligned column-wisely. Such an Anchor-Unaligned Problem (AUP) would cause inaccurate graph fusion and degrade the clustering performance. Under multi-view scenarios, generating correct correspondences could be extremely difficult since anchors are not consistent in feature dimensions. To solve this challenging issue, we propose the first study of the generalized and flexible anchor graph fusion framework termed Fast Multi-View Anchor-Correspondence Clustering (FMVACC). Specifically, we show how to find anchor correspondence with both feature and structure information, after which anchor graph fusion is performed column-wisely. Moreover, we theoretically show the connection between FMVACC and existing multi-view late fusion and partial view-aligned clustering, which further demonstrates our generality. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Moreover, the proposed alignment module also shows significant performance improvement applying to existing multi-view anchor graph competitors indicating the importance of anchor alignment.

The intrinsic correlation, different views describing same set of instances, makes it possible and necessary to jointly learn multiple metrics of different views, accordingly, we propose a multi-view metric learning method based on Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criteria (HSIC), termed as Fisher-HSIC Multi-View Metric Learning (FISH-MML). In our approach, the class separability is enforced in the spirit of FDA within each single view, while the consistence among different views is enhanced based on HSIC. Accordingly, both intra-view class separability and inter-view correlation are well addressed in a unified framework. The learned metrics can improve multi-view classification, and experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

A recent study shows that kernel matrix works considerably better than covariance matrix for this kind of representation, by modeling the higher-order, nonlinear relationship among pooled visual descriptors. Nevertheless, in that study neither the descriptors nor the kernel matrix is deeply learned. Worse, they are considered separately, hindering the pursuit of an optimal representation. To improve this situation, this work designs a deep network that jointly learns local descriptors and kernel-matrix-based pooled representation in an end-to-end manner. The derivatives for the mapping from a local descriptor set to this representation are derived to carry out backpropagation. More importantly, we introduce the Dalecki\u01d0-Kre\u01d0n formula from Operator theory to give a concise and unified result on differentiating general functions defined on symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrix, which shows its better numerical stability in conducting backpropagation compared with the existing method when handling the Riemannian geometry of SPD matrix. Experiments on fine-grained image benchmark datasets not only show the superiority of kernel-matrix-based SPD representation with deep local descriptors, but also verify the advantage of the proposed deep network in pursuing better SPD representations. Also, ablation study is provided to explain why and from where these improvements are attained."}}

Most existing multi-label learning methods do not sufficiently consider the complementary information among multiple views, leading to unsatisfying performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach for multi-view multi-label learning based on matrix factorization to exploit complementarity among different views. Specifically, under the assumption that there exists a common representation across different views, the uncovered latent patterns are enforced to be aligned across different views in kernel spaces. In this way, the latent semantic patterns underlying in data could be well uncovered and this enhances the reasonability of the common representation of multiple views. As a result, the consensus multi-view representation is obtained which encodes the complementarity and consistence of different views in latent semantic space. We provide theoretical guarantee for the strict convexity for our method by properly setting parameters. Empirical evidence shows the clear advantages of our method over the state-of-the-art ones."}}
