On regular grids, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a U-net structure can resolve this challenge by efficient stride, pooling, and upsampling operations. Nonetheless, these tools are much less developed for graph neural networks (GNNs), especially when GNNs are employed for learning large-scale mesh-based physics. The challenges arise from the highly irregular meshes and the lack of effective ways to construct the multi-level structure without losing connectivity. Inspired by the bipartite graph determination algorithm, we introduce Bi-Stride Multi-Scale Graph Neural Network (BSMS-GNN) by proposing \\textit{bi-stride} as a simple pooling strategy for building the multi-level GNN. \\textit{Bi-stride} pools nodes by striding every other BFS frontier; it 1) works robustly on any challenging mesh in the wild, 2) avoids using a mesh generator at coarser levels, 3) avoids the spatial proximity for building coarser levels, and 4) uses non-parametrized aggregating/returning instead of MLPs during pooling and unpooling. Experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method's computational efficiency in representative physics-based simulation cases."}}

Unlike elastic forces such as spring forces, these plastic forces do not result from the positional gradient of any potential energy, imposing great challenges on the stability and flexibility of their simulation. Our method effectively resolves this issue by learning a generalizable plastic energy whose derivative closely matches the analytical behavior of plastic forces. Our method, for the first time, enables the simulation of a wide range of arbitrary elasticity-plasticity combinations using time step-independent, unconditionally stable optimization-based time integrators. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by learning and producing challenging 2D and 3D effects of metal, sand, and snow with complex dynamics."}}
