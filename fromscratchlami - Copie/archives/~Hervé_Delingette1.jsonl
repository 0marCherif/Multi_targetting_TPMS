Data are generated with a physics-based simulator that simulates the echoes from a dense cloud of monodisperse microbubbles and captures the full, nonlinear response of resonant, lipid-coated microbubbles. The network is trained with a novel dual-loss function, which features elements of both a classification loss and a regression loss and improves the detection-localization characteristics of the output. The potential of the presented approach to super-resolution ultrasound imaging is demonstrated with a delay-and-sum reconstruction with deconvolved ultrasound data. The resulting image shows an order-of-magnitude gain in axial resolution compared to a delay-and-sum reconstruction with unprocessed element data."}}

However, the sheer size of WSIs is a real challenge, as they are often up to 100,000 pixels wide and high at the highest resolution, and therefore cannot be processed directly by any model. Moreover, as the manual delineation of structures within WSIs is tedious, histological datasets often only contain slide-level labels, or a limited amount of delineated slides. In this context, multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches have been proposed, considering WSIs as bags of smaller images, designated as tiles or patches. Among these methods, the attention-based MIL aims at learning the importance of each tile for the slide final classification while at the same time performing a clustering of those tiles. In this paper, we introduce the concept of  mixed supervision within this framework, by exploiting tile-level labels in addition to slide-level labels to improve the classification of slides. More precisely, we show on the  Camelyon16 dataset that even a small proportion  of slides with pixel-wise annotations can improve their classification  but also the localization of tumorous regions. This improves the consistency of the results between the tile and slide levels and the interpretability of the algorithm.  "}}

The computational complexity of SDM for 3D parametric shapes is often a bottleneck in many applications, thus limiting their interest. In this paper, we propose a learning-based SDM generation neural network which is demonstrated on a tridimensional cochlea shape model parameterized by 4 shape parameters. \n\nThe proposed SDM Neural Network generates a cochlea signed distance map depending on four input parameters and we show that the deep learning approach leads to a 60 fold improvement in the time of computation compared to more classical SDM generation methods. Therefore, the proposed approach achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. "}}

LogDemons algorithm is a fast non-linear registration method that computes diffeomorphic transformations parameterised by stationary velocity fields. Although computationally efficient, its use for tissue tracking has been limited because of its ad-hoc Gaussian regularisation, which hampers the implementation of more biologically motivated regularisations. In this work, we improve the logDemons by integrating elasticity and incompressibility for soft-tissue tracking. To that end, a mathematical justification of demons Gaussian regularisation is proposed. Building on this result, we replace the Gaussian smoothing by an efficient elastic-like regulariser based on isotropic differential quadratic forms of vector fields. The registration energy functional is finally minimised under the divergence-free constraint to get incompressible deformations. As the elastic regulariser and the constraint are linear, the method remains computationally tractable and easy to implement. Tests on synthetic incompressible deformations showed that our approach outperforms the original logDemons in terms of elastic incompressible deformation recovery without reducing the image matching accuracy. As an application, we applied the proposed algorithm to estimate 3D myocardium strain on clinical cine MRI of two adult patients. Results showed that incompressibility constraint improves the cardiac motion recovery when compared to the ground truth provided by 3D tagged MRI."}}

Given two input curves to be matched, our approach establishes a dense correspondence field between them, where the characteristics of the matching field closely resemble those in an a priori learning set. We build a shape distance matrix from the values of a shape descriptor computed at every point along the curves. This matrix embeds the correspondence problem in a highly expressive and redundant construct and provides the basis for a pattern matching strategy for curve matching. We selected the previously introduced observed transport measure as a shape descriptor, as its properties make it particularly amenable to the matching problem. Synthetic and real examples are presented along with discussions of the robustness and applications of the technique."}}

The first and oldest approach represents active contours in an explicit (or parametric) manner corresponding to the Lagrangian formulation. The second approach represent active contours in an implicit manner corresponding to the Eulerian framework. After comparing these two approaches, we describe several new topological and physical constraints applied on parametric active contours in order to combine the advantages of these two contour representations. We introduce three key algorithms for independently controlling active contour parameterization, shape and topology. We compare our result to the level-set method and show similar results with a significant speed-up."}}

Simplex meshes are topologically dual of triangulations and have the advantage of permitting smooth deformations in a simple and efficient manner. Our reconstruction algorithm can handle surfaces without any restriction on their shape or topology. The different tasks performed during the reconstruction include the segmentation of given objects in the scene, the extrapolation of missing data, and the control of smoothness, density, and geometric quality of the reconstructed meshes. The reconstruction takes place in two stages. First, the initialization stage creates a simplex mesh in the vicinity of the data model either manually or using an automatic procedure. Then, after a few iterations, the mesh topology can be modified by creating holes or by increasing its genus. Finally, an iterative refinement algorithm decreases the distance of the mesh from the data while preserving high geometric and topological quality. Several reconstruction examples are provided with quantitative and qualitative results."}}

Furthermore, the closeness of the initial model greatly influences the time of computation needed for the recovery. In this paper, we propose a method for initializing deformable models from range data or volumetric images. The proposed method solves two distinct problems. First, we use the topological segmentation of volumetric images in order to recover the approximate topology of the object. Second, we use an efficient mesh sampling algorithm to control the number of vertices of the initial model. The method takes into account missing data and outliers."}}

The deformable model framework locally applies internal and external forces to fit 3D data. The non-rigid registration framework iteratively computes the best global transformation that minimizes the distance between a template and the data. In this paper first we show that applying a global transformation on a surface model, is equivalent to applying an external force on a deformable model without any regularizing force. Second we propose a hybrid framework that combines the registration framework and the deformable models framework. Our hybrid deformation approach allows us to control the scale at which the model is deformed. This is clearly beneficial for performing both reconstruction and registration tasks. We show examples of this approach on active contours and deformable surfaces. Furthermore, a global transformation based on axial symmetry is introduced."}}
