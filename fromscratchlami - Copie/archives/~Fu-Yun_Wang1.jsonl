Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable neural networks to learn different categories at multi-stages. Recently, dynamic-structure-based CIL methods achieve remarkable performance. However, these methods train all modules in a coupled manner and do not consider possible conflicts among modules, resulting in spoilage of eventual predictions. In this work, we propose a unifying energy-based theory and framework called Bi-Compatible Energy-Based Expansion and Fusion (BEEF) to analyze and achieve the goal of CIL. We demonstrate the possibility of training independent modules in a decoupled manner while achieving bi-directional compatibility among modules through two additionally allocated prototypes, and then integrating them into a unifying classifier with minimal cost. Furthermore, BEEF extends the exemplar-set to a more challenging setting, where exemplars are randomly selected and imbalanced, and maintains its performance when prior methods fail dramatically.\nExtensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks: CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1000 demonstrate that BEEF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both the ordinary and challenging  CIL settings.

This scenario becomes more challenging when new class instances are insufficient, which is called few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL). Current methods handle incremental learning retrospectively by making the updated model similar to the old one. By contrast, we suggest learning prospectively to prepare for future updates, and propose ForwArd Compatible Training (FACT) for FSCIL. Forward compatibility requires future new classes to be easily incorporated into the current model based on the current stage data, and we seek to realize it by reserving embedding space for future new classes. In detail, we assign virtual prototypes to squeeze the embedding of known classes and reserve for new ones. Besides, we forecast possible new classes and prepare for the updating process. The virtual prototypes allow the model to accept possible updates in the future, which act as proxies scattered among embedding space to build a stronger classifier during inference. FACT efficiently incorporates new classes with forward compatibility and meanwhile resists forgetting of old ones. Extensive experiments validate FACT's state-of-the-art performance.

However, real-world applications often face the incoming new classes, and a model should incorporate them continually. The learning paradigm is called Class-Incremental Learning (CIL). We propose a Python toolbox that implements several key algorithms for class-incremental learning to ease the burden of researchers in the machine learning community. The toolbox contains implementations of a number of founding works of CIL such as EWC and iCaRL, but also provides current state-of-the-art algorithms that can be used for conducting novel fundamental research.
