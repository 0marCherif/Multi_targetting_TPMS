We propose the latent space Hawkes (LSH) model, a novel generative model for continuous-time networks of relational events, using a latent space representation for nodes. We model relational events between nodes using mutually exciting Hawkes processes with baseline intensities dependent upon the distances between the nodes in the latent space and sender and receiver specific effects. We demonstrate that our proposed LSH model can replicate many features observed in real temporal networks including reciprocity and transitivity, while also achieving superior prediction accuracy and providing more interpretable fits than existing models."}}

Conventional adjacency-based data structures used for storing networks such as adjacency lists were designed without incorporating time and can thus quickly retrieve all edges between two sets of nodes (a node-based slice) but cannot quickly retrieve all edges that occur within a given time interval (a time-based slice). We propose a hybrid data structure for storing temporal networks that stores edges in both an adjacency dictionary, enabling rapid node-based slices, and an interval tree, enabling rapid time-based slices. Our hybrid structure also enables compound slices, where one needs to slice both over nodes and time, either by slicing first over nodes or slicing first over time. We further propose an approach for predictive compound slicing, which attempts to predict whether a node-based or time-based compound slice is more efficient. We evaluate our hybrid data structure on many real temporal network data sets and find that they achieve much faster slice times than existing data structures with only a modest increase in creation time and memory usage."}}

One such trend that this paper aims to address is political homophily. Evidence of political homophily is well researched and indicates that people have a strong tendency to interact with others with similar political ideologies. Additionally, as links naturally form in a social network, either through recommendations or indirect interaction, new links are very likely to reinforce communities. This serves to make social media more insulated and ultimately more polarizing. We aim to address this problem by providing link recommendations that will reduce network homophily. We propose several variants of common neighbor-based link prediction algorithms that aim to recommend links to users who are similar but also would decrease homophily. We demonstrate that acceptance of these recommendations can indeed reduce the homophily of the network, whereas acceptance of link recommendations from a standard common neighbors algorithm does not."}}

Many continuous-time dynamic network models are built upon the same assumption as the SBM: edges or events between all pairs of nodes are conditionally independent given the block or community memberships, which prevents them from reproducing higher-order motifs such as triangles that are commonly observed in real networks. We propose the multivariate community Hawkes (MULCH) model, an extremely flexible community-based model for continuous-time networks that introduces dependence between node pairs using structured multivariate Hawkes processes. We fit the model using a spectral clustering and likelihood-based local refinement procedure. We find that our proposed MULCH model is far more accurate than existing models both for predictive and generative tasks."}}

Successful kidney transplants still fail over time, known as graft failure; however, the time to graft failure, or graft survival time, can vary significantly between different recipients. A significant biological factor affecting graft survival times is the compatibility between the human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the donor and recipient. We propose to model HLA compatibility using a network, where the nodes denote different HLAs of the donor and recipient, and edge weights denote compatibilities of the HLAs, which can be positive or negative. The network is indirectly observed, as the edge weights are estimated from transplant outcomes rather than directly observed. We propose a latent space model for such indirectly-observed weighted and signed networks. We demonstrate that our latent space model can not only result in more accurate estimates of HLA compatibilities, but can also be incorporated into survival analysis models to improve accuracy for the downstream task of predicting graft survival times."}}

A significant factor that affects graft survival time (the time until the transplant fails and the patient requires another transplant) for kidney transplantation is the compatibility of the Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLAs) between the donor and recipient. In this paper, we propose 4 new biologically-relevant feature representations for incorporating HLA information into machine learning-based survival analysis algorithms. We evaluate our proposed HLA feature representations on a database of over 100,000 transplants and find that they improve prediction accuracy by about 1%, modest at the patient level but potentially significant at a societal level. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve transplant survival outcomes, enabling better allocation of donors to recipients and reducing the number of re-transplants due to graft failure with poorly matched donors."}}
