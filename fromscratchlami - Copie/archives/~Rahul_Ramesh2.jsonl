We also show that if we know which samples are OOD, then using a weighted objective between the target and OOD samples ensures that the generalization error decreases monotonically.

We develop a technique to visualize such representations using an isometric embedding of the space of probabilistic models into a lower-dimensional space, i.e., one that preserves pairwise distances. We discover the following surprising phenomena that shed light upon the structure in the space of learning tasks: (1) the manifold of probabilistic models trained on different tasks using different representation learning methods is effectively low-dimensional; (2) supervised learning on one task results in a surprising amount of progress on seemingly dissimilar tasks; progress on other tasks is larger if the training task has diverse classes; (3) the structure of the space of tasks indicated by our visualization technique is consistent with parts of the Wordnet phylogenetic tree; (4) fine-tuning a model upon a sub-task does not change the representation much if the model was trained for a large number of epochs; (5) episodic meta-learning algorithms fit similar models eventually as that of supervised learning, even if the two traverse different trajectories during training; (6) contrastive learning methods trained on different datasets learn similar representations. We use classification tasks constructed from the CIFAR-10  and Imagenet datasets to study these phenomena."}}

This paper formalizes the question using the theory of reference priors. Reference priors are objective, uninformative Bayesian priors that maximize the mutual information between the task and the weights of the model. Such priors enable the task to maximally affect the Bayesian posterior, e.g., reference priors depend upon the number of samples available for learning the task and for very small sample sizes, the prior puts more probability mass on low-complexity models in the hypothesis space. This paper presents the first demonstration of reference priors for medium-scale deep networks and image-based data. We develop generalizations of reference priors and demonstrate applications to two problems. First, by using unlabeled data to compute the reference prior, we develop new Bayesian semi-supervised learning methods that remain effective even with very few samples per class. Second, by using labeled data from the source task to compute the reference prior, we develop a new pretraining method for transfer learning that allows data from the target task to maximally affect the Bayesian posterior. Empirical validation of these methods is conducted on image classification datasets."}}
