Given the economic importance and influence of these systems, they have increasingly faced the cybersecurity attacks. In this paper, we provide a dataset of real-life security incident reports on cyber-physical systems annotated with entities and events that are important for analysing such security incidents. We analyze and identify the limitations of the 'Domain Objects' in Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) standard as well as recent research literature for the entity type clas- sification schemes in cybersecurity domain. We propose an updated classification scheme for entity types in the cybersecurity domain. The enhanced coverage provided by the entity scheme is important for automated information extraction and natural language understanding of textual reports containing details of the cybersecurity incident reports. We use deep-learning based sequence labelling techniques and cybersecurity domain specific word embed dings to set up a benchmark for entity and event extraction for cyber- physical security incident report analysis. The annotated dataset of real-life industrial security incidents will be made available for research purpose."}}

However, much of the existing work for QG has focused on open-domain and not specifically on technical domain. We propose to generate technical questions using semantic templates. We also focus on ensuring that a large fraction of the generated questions are long-form, i.e., they require longer answers spanning multiple sentences. This is in contrast with existing work which has predominantly focused on generating factoid questions which have a few words or phrases as answers. Using the technical topics selected from undergraduate and graduate-level courses in Computer Science, we show that the proposed approach is able to generate questions with high acceptance rate. Further, we also show that the proposed template-based approach can be effectively leveraged using the distant supervision paradigm to finetune and significantly improve the existing sequence-to-sequence deep learning models for generating long-form, technical questions."}}

The importance for query correction increases with increasing use of hand-held devices and technologies such as SMS, tweets to search and access information. The task is further complicated for domain-specific search engines as the amount of query logs may be significantly smaller than general purpose search engines. In this paper, we propose to use the community detection technique from social network analysis for spelling correction of a set of noisy queries such as SMS messages. We focus on the task of identifying relevant questions from a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for different domains for a set of incoming noisy queries. Experimental validation shows that the proposed CD-Speller method performs significantly better than Hunspell, the popular and industry-strength spelling correction tool."}}

Abstract We consider the task of Medical Concept Normalization (MCN) which aims to map informal medical phrases such as \u201cloosing weight\u201d to formal medical concepts, such as \u201cWeight loss\u201d. Deep learning models have shown high performance across various MCN datasets containing small number of target concepts along with adequate number of training examples per concept. However, scaling these models to millions of medical concepts entails the creation of much larger datasets which is cost and effort intensive. Recent works have shown that training MCN models using automatically labeled examples extracted from medical knowledge bases partially alleviates this problem. We extend this idea by computationally creating a distant dataset from patient discussion forums. We extract informal medical phrases and medical concepts from these forums using a synthetically trained classifier and an off-the-shelf medical entity linker respectively. We use pretrained sentence encoding models to find the k-nearest phrases corresponding to each medical concept. These mappings are used in combination with the examples obtained from medical knowledge bases to train an MCN model. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 15.9% and 17.1% classification accuracy across two datasets while avoiding manual labeling."}}

A major challenge for the supervised learning based current approaches for this task is the need for labeled training data. Creating such data is an expensive and effort-intensive task requiring domain-specific expertise. In this paper, we propose to circumvent this problem by carrying out concept-based classification (CBC) of software defect reports with help of the Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) framework. We first create the concept-based representations of a software defect report and the defect types in the software defect classification scheme by projecting their textual descriptions into a concept-space spanned by the Wikipedia articles. Then, we compute the \u201csemantic\u201d similarity between these concept-based representations and assign the software defect type that has the highest similarity with the defect report. The proposed approach achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised and active learning approach for this task without requiring labeled training data. Additional advantages of the CBC approach are: (i) unlike the state-of-the-art, it does not need the source code used to fix a software defect, and (ii) it does not suffer from the class-imbalance problem faced by the supervised learning paradigm."}}
