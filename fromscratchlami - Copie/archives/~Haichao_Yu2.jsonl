Conventionally, deep learning approaches take the whole input image and an associated trimap to infer the alpha matte using convolutional neural networks. Such approaches set state-of-the-arts in image matting; however, they may fail in real-world matting applications due to hardware limitations, since real-world input images for matting are mostly of very high resolution. In this paper, we propose HDMatt, a first deep learning based image matting approach for high-resolution inputs. More concretely, HDMatt runs matting in a patch-based crop-and-stitch manner for high-resolution inputs with a novel module design to address the contextual dependency and consistency issues between different patches. Compared with vanilla patch-based inference which computes each patch independently, we explicitly model the cross-patch contextual dependency with a newly-proposed Cross-Patch Contextual module (CPC) guided by the given trimap. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its necessity for high-resolution inputs. Our HDMatt approach also sets new state-of-the-art performance on Adobe Image Matting and AlphaMatting benchmarks and produce impressive visual results on more real-world high-resolution images."}}

Specifically, we go beyond the domain of natural images to include drastically different domains such as X-ray images, satellite images and ultrasound images. We find cross-domain calibration leads to surprisingly stable performance of quantized models on 10 tasks in different image domains with 13 different calibration datasets. We also find that the performance of quantized models is correlated with the similarity of the Gram matrices between the source and calibration domains, which can be used as a criterion to choose calibration set for better performance.

We empirically find that random convex combinations of the learned queries are still good queries for the corresponding models. We then propose to learn a convex combination with dynamic coefficients based on the high-level semantics of the image. The generated dynamic queries better capture the prior of object locations and categories in the different images. Equipped with our dynamic queries, a wide range of DETR-based models achieve consistent and superior performance across multiple tasks (object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation) and on different benchmarks (MS COCO, CityScapes, YoutubeVIS)."}}

A typical EDNN has multiple prediction heads at different layers of the network backbone. During inference, the model will exit at either the last prediction head or an intermediate prediction head where the prediction confidence is higher than a predefined threshold. To optimize the model, these prediction heads together with the network backbone are trained on every batch of training data. This brings a train-test mismatch problem that all the prediction heads are optimized on all types of data in training phase while the deeper heads will only see difficult inputs in testing phase. Treating training and testing inputs differently at the two phases will cause the mismatch between training and testing data distributions. To mitigate this problem, we formulate an EDNN as an additive model inspired by gradient boosting, and propose multiple training techniques to optimize the model effectively. We name our method BoostNet. Our experiments show it achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets in both anytime and budgeted-batch prediction modes.

However, using dropout in practice can be expensive as it requires running dropout inferences many times. In this paper, we study how to estimate dropout prediction uncertainty in a resource-efficient manner. We demonstrate that we can use neuron activation strengths to estimate dropout prediction uncertainty under different dropout settings and on a variety of tasks using three large datasets, MovieLens, Criteo, and EMNIST. Our approach provides an inference-once method to estimate dropout prediction uncertainty as a cheap auxiliary task. We also demonstrate that using activation features from a subset of the neural network layers can be sufficient to achieve uncertainty estimation performance almost comparable to that of using activation features from all layers, thus reducing resources even further for uncertainty estimation."}}
