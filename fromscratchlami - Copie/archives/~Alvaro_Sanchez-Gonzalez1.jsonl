While graph neural network (GNN)-based models are effective at learning to simulate complex physical dynamics, such as fluids, cloth and articulated bodies, they have been less effective and efficient on rigid-body physics, except with very simple shapes. Existing methods that model collisions through the meshes' nodes are often inaccurate because they struggle when collisions occur on faces far from nodes. Alternative approaches that represent the geometry densely with many particles are prohibitively expensive for complex shapes. Here we introduce the ``Face Interaction Graph Network'' (FIGNet) which extends beyond GNN-based methods, and computes interactions between mesh faces, rather than nodes. Compared to learned node- and particle-based methods, FIGNet is around 4x more accurate in simulating complex shape interactions, while also 8x more computationally efficient on sparse, rigid meshes. Moreover, FIGNet can learn frictional dynamics directly from real-world data, and can be more accurate than analytical solvers given modest amounts of training data. FIGNet represents a key step forward in one of the few remaining physical domains which have seen little competition from learned simulators, and offers allied fields such as robotics, graphics and mechanical design a new tool for simulation and model-based planning."}}

A common claim is that deep networks are incapable of accurately modeling rigid-body dynamics without explicit modules for handling contacts, due to the continuous nature of how deep networks are parameterized. Here we investigate this claim with experiments on established real and simulated datasets and show that general-purpose graph network simulators, with no contact-specific assumptions, can learn and predict contact discontinuities. Furthermore, contact dynamics learned by graph network simulators capture real-world cube tossing trajectories more accurately than highly engineered robotics simulators, even when provided with only 8 -- 16 trajectories. Overall, this suggests that rigid-body dynamics do not pose a fundamental challenge for deep networks with the appropriate general architecture and parameterization.  Instead, our work opens new directions for considering when deep learning-based models might be preferable to traditional simulation environments for accurately modeling real-world contact dynamics."}}

Though automating design using machine learning has tremendous promise, existing methods are often limited by the task-dependent distributions they were exposed to during training. Here we showcase a task-agnostic approach to inverse design, by combining general-purpose graph network simulators with gradient-based design optimization. This constitutes a simple, fast, and reusable approach that solves high-dimensional problems with complex physical dynamics, including designing surfaces and tools to manipulate fluid flows and optimizing the shape of an airfoil to minimize drag. This framework produces high-quality designs by propagating gradients through trajectories of hundreds of steps, even when using models that were pre-trained for single-step predictions on data substantially different from the design tasks. In our fluid manipulation tasks, the resulting designs outperformed those found by sampling-based optimization techniques. In airfoil design, they matched the quality of those obtained with a specialized solver. Our results suggest that despite some remaining challenges, machine learning-based simulators are maturing to the point where they can support general-purpose design optimization across a variety of fluid-structure interaction domains."}}

However, many traditional simulation engines use a constraint-based approach instead of direct prediction. Here we present a framework for constraint-based learned simulation, where a scalar constraint function is implemented as a trainable function approximator, and future predictions are computed as the solutions to a constraint satisfaction problem. We implement our method using a graph neural network as the constraint function and gradient descent as the constraint solver. The architecture can be trained by standard backpropagation. We test the model on a variety of challenging physical domains, including simulated ropes, bouncing balls, colliding irregular shapes and splashing fluids. Our model achieves better or comparable performance to top learned simulators. A key advantage of our model is the ability to generalize to more solver iterations at test time to improve the simulation accuracy. We also show how hand-designed constraints can be added at test time to satisfy objectives which were not present in the training data, which is not possible with forward approaches. Our constraint-based framework is applicable to any setting in which forward learned simulators are used, and more generally demonstrates key ways that learned models can leverage popular methods in numerical methods."}}

The diverse node level loss encourages latent node diversity, and the denoising objective encourages graph manifold learning.  Our regulariser applies well-studied methods in simple, straightforward ways which allow even generic architectures to overcome oversmoothing and achieve state of the art results on quantum chemistry tasks such as QM9 and Open Catalyst, and improve results significantly on Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets.

Our model is trained end-to-end from data and is capable of learning a range of challenging chaotic and turbulent dynamics at low resolution, including trajectories generated by the state-of-the-art Athena++ engine. We show that our simpler, general-purpose architecture outperforms various more specialized, turbulence-specific architectures from the learned turbulence simulation literature. In general, we see that learned simulators yield unstable trajectories; however, we show that tuning training noise and temporal downsampling solves this problem. We also find that while generalization beyond the training distribution is a challenge for learned models, training noise, added loss constraints, and dataset augmentation can help. Broadly, we conclude that our learned simulator outperforms traditional solvers run on coarser grids, and emphasize that simple design choices can offer stability and robust generalization."}}
