However, estimated reward signals often become uncertain and fail to train a reliable statistical model since the existing methods tend to solve hard optimization problems directly. Inspired by a first-order optimization method called mirror descent, this paper proposes to predict a sequence of reward functions, which are iterative solutions for a constrained convex problem. IRL solutions derived by mirror descent are tolerant to the uncertainty incurred by target density estimation since the amount of reward learning is regulated with respect to local geometric constraints. We prove that the proposed mirror descent update rule ensures robust minimization of a Bregman divergence in terms of a rigorous regret bound of $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ for step sizes $\\{\\eta_t\\}_{t=1}^{T}$. Our IRL method was applied on top of an adversarial framework, and it outperformed existing adversarial methods in an extensive suite of benchmarks."}}

However, unbiased minimization of these divergences is not usually guaranteed due to the geometry of the underlying space. Furthermore, when the size of demonstrations is not sufficient, estimated reward functions from the discriminative signals become uncertain and fail to give informative feedback. Instead of formulating a global cost at once, we consider reward functions as an iterative sequence in a proximal method. In this paper, we show that rewards dervied by mirror descent  ensures minimization of a Bregman divergence in terms of a rigorous regret bound of $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ for a particular condition of step sizes $\\{\\eta_t\\}_{t=1}^T$. The resulting mirror descent adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (MD-AIRL) algorithm gradually advances a parameterized reward function in an associated reward space, and the sequence of such functions provides optimization targets for the policy space. We empirically validate our method in discrete and continuous benchmarks and show that MD-AIRL outperforms previous methods in various settings."}}

However, we point out that previous methods commonly exploited occupancy-dependent reward learning formulation\u2014which hinders the reconstruction of optimal decision as an energy-based model. Despite the theoretical justification, the occupancy measures tend to cause issues in practice because of high variance and low vulnerability to domain shifts. Another reported problem is termination biases induced by provided rewarding and regularization schemes around terminal states. In order to deal with these issues, this work presents a novel algorithm called causal adversarial inverse reinforcement learning. Our formulation draws a strong connection between adversarial learning and energy-based reinforcement learning; thus, the architecture is capable of recovering a reward function that induces a multi-modal policy. In experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior methods in challenging continuous control tasks, even under significant variation in the environments."}}
