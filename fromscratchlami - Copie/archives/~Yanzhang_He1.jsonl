In traditional hidden Markov model-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, confidence scores can be reliably obtained from word posteriors in decoding lattices. However, for an ASR system with an auto-regressive decoder, such as an attention-based sequence-to-sequence model, computing word posteriors is difficult. An obvious alternative is to use the decoder softmax probability as the model confidence. In this paper, we first examine how some commonly used regularisation methods influence the softmax-based confidence scores and study the overconfident behaviour of end-to-end models. Then we propose a lightweight and effective approach named confidence estimation module (CEM) on top of an existing end-to-end ASR model. Experiments on LibriSpeech show that CEM can mitigate the overconfidence problem and can produce more reliable confidence scores with and without shallow fusion of a language model. Further analysis shows that CEM generalises well to speech from a moderately mismatched domain and can potentially improve downstream tasks such as semi-supervised learning."}}

Since distinct label histories correspond to distinct models states, such models are decoded using an approximate beam-search which produces a tree of hypotheses.In this work, we study the influence of the amount of label context on the model\u2019s accuracy, and its impact on the efficiency of the decoding process. We find that we can limit the context of the recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) during training to just four previous word-piece labels, without degrading word error rate (WER) relative to the full-context baseline. Limiting context also provides opportunities to improve decoding efficiency by removing redundant paths from the active beam, and instead retaining them in the final lattice. This path-merging scheme can also be applied when decoding the baseline full-context model through an approximation. Overall, we find that the proposed path-merging scheme is extremely effective, allowing us to improve oracle WERs by up to 36% over the baseline, while simultaneously reducing the number of model evaluations by up to 5.3% without any degradation in WER, or up to 15.7% when lattice rescoring is applied."}}

However, emitting fast without degrading quality, as measured by word error rate (WER), is highly challenging. Existing approaches including Early and Late Penalties [1] and Constrained Alignments [2], [3] penalize emission delay by manipulating per-token or per-frame probability prediction in sequence transducer models [4]. While being successful in reducing delay, these approaches suffer from significant accuracy regression and also require additional word alignment information from an existing model. In this work, we propose a sequence-level emission regularization method, named FastEmit, that applies latency regularization directly on per-sequence probability in training transducer models, and does not require any alignment. We demonstrate that FastEmit is more suitable to the sequence-level optimization of transducer models [4] for streaming ASR by applying it on various end-to-end streaming ASR networks including RNN-Transducer [5], Transformer-Transducer [6], [7], ConvNet-Transducer [8] and Conformer-Transducer [9]. We achieve 150 ~ 300ms latency reduction with significantly better accuracy over previous techniques on a Voice Search test set. FastEmit also improves streaming ASR accuracy from 4.4%/8.9% to 3.1%/7.5% WER, meanwhile reduces 90th percentile latency from 210ms to only 30ms on LibriSpeech."}}

This is done by limiting the context size of previous labels and/or using a simpler architecture for its layers instead of LSTMs. The benefits of such changes include reduction in model size, faster inference and power savings, which are all useful for on-device applications. In this work, we study ways to make the RNN-T decoder (prediction network + joint network) smaller and faster without degradation in recognition performance. Our prediction network performs a simple weighted averaging of the input embeddings, and shares its embedding matrix weights with the joint network's output layer (a.k.a. weight tying, commonly used in language modeling arXiv:1611.01462 [cs.LG]). This simple design, when used in conjunction with additional Edit-based Minimum Bayes Risk (EMBR) training, reduces the RNN-T Decoder from 23M parameters to just 2M, without affecting word-error rate (WER)."}}

This is achieved by using an attention mechanism on multiple speaker embeddings to compute a single attentive embedding, which is then used as a side input to the model. We implemented multi-user VoiceFilter-Lite and evaluated it for three tasks: (1) a streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) task; (2) a text-independent speaker verification task; and (3) a personalized keyphrase detection task, where ASR has to detect keyphrases from multiple enrolled users in a noisy environment. Our experiments show that, with up to four enrolled users, multi-user VoiceFilter-Lite is able to significantly reduce speech recognition and speaker verification errors when there is overlapping speech, without affecting performance under other acoustic conditions. This attentive speaker embedding approach can also be easily applied to other speaker-conditioned models such as personal VAD and personalized ASR."}}

This paper proposes to jointly learn word confidence, word deletion, and utterance confidence. Empirical results show that multi-task learning with all three objectives improves confidence metrics (NCE, AUC, RMSE) without the need for increasing the model size of the confidence estimation module.

To address the challenge of detecting these keyphrases under various noisy conditions, a speaker separation model is added to the feature frontend of the speaker verification model, and an adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) algorithm is included to exploit cross-microphone noise coherence.

However, the model still tends to delay the predictions towards the end and thus has much higher partial latency compared to a conventional ASR model. To address this issue, we look at encouraging the E2E model to emit words early, through an algorithm called FastEmit [3]. Naturally, improving on latency results in a quality degradation. To address this, we explore replacing the LSTM layers in the encoder of our E2E model with Conformer layers [4], which has shown good improvements for ASR. Secondly, we also explore running a 2nd-pass beam search to improve quality. In order to ensure the 2nd-pass completes quickly, we explore non-causal Conformer layers that feed into the same 1st-pass RNN-T decoder, an algorithm called Cascaded Encoders [5]. Overall, the Conformer RNN-T with Cascaded Encoders offers a better quality and latency tradeoff for streaming ASR."}}
