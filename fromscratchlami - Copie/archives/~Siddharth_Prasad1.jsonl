These solvers are the foremost method for solving discrete optimization problems and thus have a vast array of applications in machine learning, operations research, and many other fields. Choosing cutting planes effectively is a major research topic in the theory and practice of integer programming. We conduct a novel structural analysis of branch-and-cut that pins down how every step of the algorithm is affected by changes in the parameters defining the cutting planes added to the input integer program. Our main application of this analysis is to derive sample complexity guarantees for using machine learning to determine which cutting planes to apply during branch-and-cut. These guarantees apply to infinite families of cutting planes, such as the family of Gomory mixed integer cuts, which are responsible for the main breakthrough speedups of integer programming solvers. We exploit geometric and combinatorial structure of branch-and-cut in our analysis, which provides a key missing piece for the recent generalization theory of branch-and-cut."}}

In this paper we formulate the first formal model of shrinking markets in multi-item settings, and study how mechanism design and machine learning can help preserve revenue in an uncertain, shrinking market. Via a sample-based learning mechanism, we prove the first guarantees on how much revenue can be preserved by truthful multi-item, multi-bidder auctions (for limited supply) when only a random unknown fraction of the population participates in the market. We first present a general reduction that converts any sufficiently rich auction class into a randomized auction robust to market shrinkage. Our main technique is a novel combinatorial construction called a winner diagram that concisely represents all possible executions of an auction on an uncertain set of bidders. Via a probabilistic analysis of winner diagrams, we derive a general possibility result: a sufficiently rich class of auctions always contains an auction that is robust to market shrinkage and market uncertainty. Our result has applications to important practically-constrained settings such as auctions with a limited number of winners. We then show how to efficiently learn an auction that is robust to market shrinkage by leveraging practically-efficient routines for solving the winner determination problem."}}

An increasingly popular approach is to use machine learning to configure these parameters based on a training set of integer programs from the application domain. We bound how large the training set should be to ensure that for any configuration, its average performance over the training set is close to its expected future performance. Our guarantees apply to parameters that control the most important aspects of branch-and-cut: node selection, branching constraint selection, and cut selection, and are sharper and more general than those from prior research."}}

In this paper we provide sample complexity bounds for cut-selection in branch-and-cut (B&C).

Our mechanism learns within an instance. It generalizes and improves over previously-studied random-sampling mechanisms. It first samples a participatory group of bidders, then samples several learning groups of bidders from the remaining pool of bidders, learns a high-revenue auction from the learning groups, and finally runs that auction on the participatory group. Previous work on random-sampling mechanisms focused primarily on unlimited supply. Limited supply poses additional significant technical challenges, since allocations of items to bidders must be feasible. We prove guarantees on the performance of our mechanism based on a market-shrinkage term and a new complexity measure we coin partition discrepancy. Partition discrepancy simultaneously measures the intrinsic complexity of the mechanism class and the uniformity of the set of bidders. We then introduce new auction classes that can be parameterized in a way that does not depend on the number of bidders participating, and prove strong guarantees for these classes. We show how our mechanism can be implemented efficiently by leveraging practically-efficient routines for solving winner determination. Finally, we show how to use structural revenue maximization to decide what auction class to use with our framework when there is a constraint on the number of learning groups."}}

The main application of our results is to economic experiments, in which a learner seeks to infer the parameters of a subject\u2019s preferences: for example their attitudes towards risk, or their beliefs over uncertain events. By cleverly adapting the experimental design, one can save on the time spent by subjects in the laboratory, or maximize the information obtained from each subject in a given laboratory session; but the resulting adaptive design raises complications due to incentive compatibility. A subject in the lab may answer questions strategically, and not truthfully, so as to steer subsequent questions in a profitable direction. We analyze two standard economic problems: inference of preferences over risk from multiple price lists, and belief elicitation in experiments on choice over uncertainty. In the first setting, we tune a simple and fast learning algorithm to retain certain incentive compatibility properties. In the second setting, we provide an incentive compatible learning algorithm based on scoring rules with query complexity that differs from obvious methods of achieving fast learning rates only by subpolynomial factors. Thus, for these areas of application, incentive compatibility may be achieved without paying a large sample complexity price."}}

Various products in the real world are sold via a menu, or list, of two-part tariffs---for example gym memberships, cell phone data plans, etc. We study learning high-revenue menus of two-part tariffs from buyer valuation data, in the setting where the mechanism designer has access to samples from the distribution over buyers' values rather than an explicit description thereof. Our algorithms have clear direct uses, and provide the missing piece for the recent generalization theory of two-part tariffs. We present a polynomial time algorithm for optimizing one two-part tariff. We also present an algorithm for optimizing a length-L menu of two-part tariffs with run time exponential in L but polynomial in all other problem parameters. We then generalize the problem to multiple markets. We prove how many samples suffice to guarantee that a two-part tariff scheme that is feasible on the samples is also feasible on a new problem instance with high probability. We then show that computing revenue-maximizing feasible prices is hard even for buyers with additive valuations. Then, for buyers with identical valuation distributions, we present a condition that is sufficient for the two-part tariff scheme from the unsegmented setting to be optimal for the market-segmented setting. Finally, we prove a generalization result that states how many samples suffice so that we can compute the unsegmented solution on the samples and still be guaranteed that we get a near-optimal solution for the market-segmented setting with high probability."}}

We present a large class of preference models defined by a structural criterion for which we are able to obtain an exponential improvement over previously known learning bounds for more general preference models. This in particular implies that the three most important discounted utility models of intertemporal choice - exponential, hyperbolic, and quasi-hyperbolic discounting - are learnable in the PAC setting with VC dimension that grows logarithmically in the number of time periods. We also examine these models in the framework of active learning. We find that the commonly studied stream-based setting is in general difficult to analyze for preference models, but we provide a redeeming situation in which the learner can indeed improve upon the guarantees provided by PAC learning. In contrast to the stream-based setting, we show that if the learner is given full power over the data he learns from - in the form of learning via membership queries - even very naive algorithms significantly outperform the guarantees provided by higher level active learning algorithms."}}
