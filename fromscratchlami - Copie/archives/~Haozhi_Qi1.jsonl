Our system is trained in simulation, where it has access to ground-truth object shapes and physical properties. Then we distill it to operate on realistic yet noisy simulated visuotactile and proprioceptive sensory inputs. These multimodal inputs are fused via a visuotactile transformer, enabling online inference of object shapes and physical properties during deployment. We show significant performance improvements over prior methods and highlight the importance of visual and tactile sensing."}}

As a small step towards this grand goal, we demonstrate how to design and learn a simple adaptive controller to achieve in-hand object rotation using only fingertips. The controller is trained entirely in simulation on only cylindrical objects, which then \u2013 without any fine-tuning \u2013 can be directly deployed to a real robot hand to rotate dozens of objects with diverse sizes, shapes, and weights over the z-axis. This is achieved via rapid online adaptation of the robot\u2019s controller to the object properties using only proprioception history. Furthermore, natural and stable finger gaits automatically emerge from training the control policy via reinforcement learning.

Most existing approaches on learning dynamics from visual input sidestep long-term predictions by resorting to rapid re-planning with short-term models. This not only requires such models to be super accurate but also limits them only to tasks where an agent can continuously obtain feedback and take action at each step until completion. In this paper, we aim to leverage the ideas from success stories in visual recognition tasks to build object representations that can capture inter-object and object-environment interactions over a long range. To this end, we propose Region Proposal Interaction Networks (RPIN), which reason about each object's trajectory in a latent region-proposal feature space. Thanks to the simple yet effective object representation, our approach outperforms prior methods by a significant margin both in terms of prediction quality and their ability to plan for downstream tasks, and also generalize well to novel environments.

We show that the basic iterative gradient ascent scheme for maximizing the rate reduction of learned features naturally leads to a deep network, one iteration per layer. The architectures, operators (linear or nonlinear), and parameters of the network are all explicitly constructed layer-by-layer in a forward propagation fashion. All components of this ``white box'' network have precise optimization, statistical, and geometric interpretation. Our preliminary experiments indicate that such a network can already learn a good discriminative deep representation without any back propagation training. Moreover, all linear operators of the so-derived network naturally become multi-channel convolutions when we enforce classification to be rigorously shift-invariant. The derivation also indicates that such a convolutional network is significantly more efficient to learn and construct in the spectral domain."}}

This paper shows that deep vanilla ConvNets without normalization nor skip connections can also be trained to achieve surprisingly good performance on standard image recognition benchmarks. This is achieved by enforcing the convolution kernels to be near isometric during initialization and training, as well as by using a variant of ReLU that is shifted towards being isometric. Further experiments show that if combined with skip connections, such near isometric networks can achieve performances on par with (for ImageNet) and better than (for COCO) the standard ResNet, even without normalization at all."}}

Compared to the previous methods which first predict an intermediate heat map and then extract straight lines with heuristic algorithms, our method is end-to-end trainable and can directly output a vectorized wireframe that contains semantically meaningful and geometrically salient junctions and lines. To better understand the quality of the outputs, we propose a new metric for wireframe evaluation that penalizes overlapped line segments and incorrect line connectivities. We conduct extensive experiments and show that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art wireframe and line extraction algorithms. We hope our simple approach can be served as a baseline for future wireframe parsing studies. Code has been made publicly available at https://github.com/zhou13/lcnn."}}
