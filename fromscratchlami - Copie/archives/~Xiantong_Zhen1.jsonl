In this\npaper, we specifically focus on referring expression comprehension with commonsense knowledge (KB-Ref), a task which typically requires reasoning beyond spatial, visual or semantic information. We propose a novel framework for Commonsense Knowledge Enhanced Transformers (CK-Transformer) which effectively integrates commonsense knowledge into the representations of objects in an image, facilitating identification of the target objects referred to by the expressions. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmarks for the task of KB-Ref. Our results show that the proposed CK-Transformer achieves a new state of the art, with an absolute improvement of 3.14% accuracy over the existing state of the art."}}

As an effort to bridge this gap, we introduce a meta-learning approach for multimodal few-shot learning, to leverage its strong ability of accruing knowledge across tasks. The full model is based on frozen foundation vision and language models to benefit from their already learned capacity. To translate the visual features into the latent space of the language model, we introduce a light-weight meta-mapper acting as a meta-learner. By updating only the parameters of the meta-mapper, our model learns to quickly adapt to unseen samples with only a few gradient-step updates. Unlike prior multimodal few-shot learners, which need a hand-engineered task induction, our model is able to induce the task in a completely data-driven manner. Experiments on recent multimodal few-shot benchmarks demonstrate that compared to its counterparts our meta-learning approach yields better multimodal few-shot learners, while being computationally more efficient."}}

Existing methods are trying to communicate visual concepts as prompts to frozen language models, but rely on hand-engineered task induction to reduce the hypothesis space. To make the whole process learnable, we introduce a multimodal meta-learning approach. Specifically, our approach decomposes the training of the model into a set of related multimodal few-shot tasks. We define a meta-mapper network, acting as a meta-learner, to efficiently bridge frozen large-scale vision and language models and leverage their already learned capacity. By updating the learnable parameters only of the meta-mapper, it learns to accrue shared meta-knowledge among these tasks. Thus, it can rapidly adapt to newly presented samples with only a few gradient updates. Importantly, it induces the task in a completely data-driven manner, with no need for a hand-engineered task induction. We evaluate our approach on recently proposed multimodal few-shot benchmarks, measuring how rapidly the model can bind novel visual concepts to words and answer visual questions by observing only a limited set of labeled examples. The experimental results show that our meta-learning approach outperforms the baseline across multiple datasets and various training settings while being computationally more efficient."}}

A most successful tactic for test-time adaptation conducts further optimization on the target data using the predictions by the source-trained model. However, due to domain shifts, the source-trained model predictions themselves can be largely inaccurate, which results in a model misspecified to the target data and therefore damages their adaptation ability. In this paper, we address test-time adaptation from a probabilistic perspective. We formulate model adaption as a probabilistic inference problem, which incorporates the uncertainty into source model predictions by modeling pseudo labels as distributions. Based on the probabilistic formalism, we propose variational pseudo labels that explore the information of neighboring target samples to improve pseudo labels and achieve a model better specified to target data. By a meta-learning paradigm, we train our model by simulating domain shifts and the test-time adaptation procedure. In doing so, our model learns the ability to generate more accurate pseudo-label distributions and to adapt to new domains. Experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal. "}}

Where previous works adapt their models to target domains, we adapt the unseen target samples to source-trained models. To this end, we design a discriminative energy-based model, which is trained on source domains to jointly model the conditional distribution for classification and data distribution for sample adaptation. The model is optimized to simultaneously learn a classifier and an energy function. To adapt target samples to source distributions, we iteratively update the samples by energy minimization with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics. Moreover, to preserve the categorical information in the sample during adaptation, we introduce a categorical latent variable into the energy-based model. The latent variable is learned from the original sample before adaptation by variational inference and fixed as a condition to guide the sample update. Experiments on six benchmarks for classification of images and microblog threads demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal."}}

Inspired by the human ability to recall past learning experiences from the brain\u2019s memory, we propose an episodic memory optimization for meta-learning, which we call EMO, that retains the gradient history of past experienced tasks in external memory. It enables few-shot learning in a memory-augmented way by leveraging the meta-learning setting and learns to retain and recall the learning process of past training tasks for gradient descent optimization. By doing so, EMO nudges the parameter updates in the right direction, even when the gradients provided by a limited number of examples are uninformative. Additionally, we prove theoretically that our algorithm converges for smooth, strongly convex objectives. EMO is generic, flexible, and model agnostic, making it a simple plug-and-play optimizer seamlessly embedded into existing optimization-based meta-learning approaches. Empirically, EMO scales well with most of the few-shot classification benchmarks, and our experiments show that the optimization-based meta-learning method enjoys accelerated convergence and improved performance with EMO."}}

The model is trained to locate the pixels belonging to specific instances over a video clip. We firstly take advantage of a novel mixing function to better fuse spatio-temporal embeddings. Moreover, we introduce normalizing flows to further improve the robustness of the learned appearance embedding, which theoretically extends conventional generative flows to a factorized conditional scheme.

The challenges stem from the distribution shift from the source to the target domain, coupled with the unavailability of any source data and labeled target data for optimization. Rather than fine-tuning the model by updating the parameters, we propose to perturb the source model to achieve adaptation to target domains. We introduce perturbations into the model parameters by variational Bayesian inference in a probabilistic framework. By doing so, we can effectively adapt the model to the target domain while largely preserving the discriminative ability. Importantly, we demonstrate the theoretical connection to learning Bayesian neural networks, which proves the generalizability of the perturbed model to target domains. To enable more efficient optimization, we further employ a parameter sharing strategy, which substantially reduces the learnable parameters compared to a fully Bayesian neural network. \nOur model perturbation provides a new probabilistic way for domain adaptation which enables efficient adaptation to target domains while maximally preserving knowledge in source models. Experiments on several source-free benchmarks under three different evaluation settings verify the effectiveness of the proposed variational model perturbation for source-free domain adaptation."}}

In particular, we tackle a new setting, which is more realistic than currently addressed in the literature, where categories shift from training to test data. Hence, individual tasks do not contain complete training data for the categories in the test set. To generalize to such test data, it is crucial for individual tasks to leverage knowledge from related tasks. To this end, we propose learning an association graph to transfer knowledge among tasks for missing classes. We construct the association graph with nodes representing tasks, classes and instances, and encode the relationships among the nodes in the edges to guide their mutual knowledge transfer. By message passing on the association graph, our model enhances the categorical information of each instance, making it more discriminative. To avoid spurious correlations between task and class nodes in the graph, we introduce an assignment entropy maximization that encourages each class node to balance its edge weights. This enables all tasks to fully utilize the categorical information from related tasks. An extensive evaluation on three general benchmarks and a medical dataset for skin lesion classification reveals that our method consistently performs better than representative baselines."}}

However, it remains an open problem to leverage the shared knowledge provided by related tasks. In this paper, we propose to learn Gaussian processes with dense inducing variables by meta-learning for few-shot learning. In contrast to sparse Gaussian processes, we define a set of dense inducing variables to be of a much larger size than the support set in each task, which collects prior knowledge from experienced tasks. The dense inducing variables specify a shared Gaussian process prior over prediction functions of all tasks, which are learned in a variational inference framework and offer a strong inductive bias for learning new tasks. To achieve task-specific prediction functions, we propose to adapt the inducing variables to each task by efficient gradient descent. We conduct extensive experiments on common benchmark datasets for a variety of few-shot learning tasks. Our dense Gaussian processes present significant improvements over vanilla Gaussian processes and comparable or even better performance with state-of-the-art methods. "}}
