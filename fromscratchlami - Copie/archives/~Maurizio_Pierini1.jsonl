In this contribution, we introduce a novel end-to-end procedure that utilizes a machine learning technique called symbolic regression (SR). It searches equation space to discover algebraic relations approximating a dataset. We use PySR (software for uncovering these expressions based on evolutionary algorithm) and extend the functionality of hls4ml (a package for machine learning inference in FPGAs) to support PySR-generated expressions for resource-constrained production environments. Deep learning models often optimise the top metric by pinning the network size because vast hyperparameter space prevents extensive neural architecture search. Conversely, SR selects a set of models on the Pareto front, which allows for optimising the performance-resource tradeoff directly. By embedding symbolic forms, our implementation can dramatically reduce the computational resources needed to perform critical tasks. We validate our procedure on a physics benchmark: multiclass classification of jets produced in simulated proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, and show that we approximate a 3-layer neural network with an inference model that has as low as 5 ns execution time (a reduction by a factor of 13) and over 90% approximation accuracy."}}

However, current experiments do not indicate clear signs of new physics that could guide the development of additional Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories. Identifying signatures of new physics out of the enormous amount of data produced at the LHC falls into the class of anomaly detection and constitutes one of the greatest computational challenges. In this article, we propose a novel strategy to perform anomaly detection in a supervised learning setting, based on the artificial creation of anomalies through a random process. For the resulting supervised learning problem, we successfully apply classical and quantum Support Vector Classifiers (CSVC and QSVC respectively) to identify the artificial anomalies among the SM events. Even more promising, we find that employing an SVC trained to identify the artificial anomalies, it is possible to identify realistic BSM events with high accuracy. In parallel, we also explore the potential of quantum algorithms for improving the classification accuracy and provide plausible conditions for the best exploitation of this novel computational paradigm."}}

A deep learning-based algorithm that pre-selects potentially anomalous images of the sensor surface in real time has been developed to automate the visual inspection. The anomaly detection is done by an ensemble of independent deep convolutional neural networks: an autoencoder and a classifier. The performance is evaluated on images acquired in production. The pre-selection reduces the number of images requiring human inspection by 85%, with recall of 97%. Data gathered in production can be used for continuous learning to improve the accuracy incrementally."}}

The prevailing methods for network compression, namely quantization and pruning, have been shown to enhance efficiency at the cost of performance. Determining the most effective quantization and pruning strategies for individual layers and parameters remains a challenging problem, often requiring computationally expensive and ad hoc numerical optimization techniques. This paper introduces FITCompress, a novel method integrating layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and unstructured pruning using a unified heuristic approach. By leveraging the Fisher Information Metric and path planning through compression space, FITCompress optimally selects a combination of pruning mask and mixed-precision quantization configuration for a given pre-trained model and compression constraint. Experiments on computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves a superior compression-performance trade-off compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. FITCompress stands out for its principled derivation, making it versatile across tasks and network architectures, and represents a step towards achieving optimal compression for neural networks."}}

To accommodate the constraints on the problem size dictated by the limitations of current quantum hardware we develop a classical convolutional autoencoder. The designed quantum anomaly detection models, namely an unsupervised kernel machine and two clustering algorithms, are trained to find new-physics events in the latent representation of LHC data produced by the autoencoder. The performance of the quantum algorithms is benchmarked against classical counterparts on different new-physics scenarios and its dependence on the dimensionality of the latent space and the size of the training dataset is studied. For kernel-based anomaly detection, we identify a regime where the quantum model significantly outperforms its classical counterpart. An instance of the kernel machine is implemented on a quantum computer to verify its suitability for available hardware. We demonstrate that the observed consistent performance advantage is related to the inherent quantum properties of the circuit used."}}

Low precision representations, achieved via quantization of weights and activations, can reduce inference time and memory requirements. However, quantifying and predicting the response of a model to the changes associated with this procedure remains challenging. This response is non-linear and heterogeneous throughout the network. Understanding which groups of parameters and activations are more sensitive to quantization than others is a critical stage in maximizing efficiency. For this purpose, we propose FIT. Motivated by an information geometric perspective, FIT combines the Fisher information with a model of quantization. We find that FIT can estimate the final performance of a network without retraining. FIT effectively fuses contributions from both parameter and activation quantization into a single metric. Additionally, FIT is fast to compute when compared to existing methods, demonstrating favourable convergence properties. These properties are validated experimentally across hundreds of quantization configurations, with a focus on layer-wise mixed-precision quantization."}}

Accelerating JEDI-net is challenging since it requires low latency to deploy the network for event selection at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. This paper proposes an outer-product based matrix multiplication approach customized for GNN-based JEDI-net, which increases data spatial locality and reduces design latency. It is further enhanced by code transformation with strength reduction which exploits sparsity patterns and binary adjacency matrices to increase hardware efficiency while reducing latency. In addition, a customizable template for this architecture has been designed and open-sourced, which enables the generation of low-latency FPGA designs with efficient resource utilization using high-level synthesis tools. Evaluation results show that our FPGA implementation is up to 9.5 times faster and consumes up to 6.5 times less power than a GPU implementation. Moreover, the throughput of our FPGA design is sufficiently high to enable deployment of JEDI-net in a sub-microsecond, real-time collider trigger system, enabling it to benefit from improved accuracy."}}
