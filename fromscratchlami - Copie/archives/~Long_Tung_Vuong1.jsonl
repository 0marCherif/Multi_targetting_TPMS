Recent work on Vector Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (VQ-VAE) has made substantial progress in this direction. However, this quantizes latent representations using the online k-means algorithm which suffers from poor initialization and non-stationary clusters. To strengthen the clustering quality for the latent representations, we propose Vector Quantized Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (VQ-WAE) intuitively developed based on the clustering viewpoint of Wasserstein (WS) distance. Specifically, we endow a discrete distribution over the codewords and learn a deterministic decoder that transports the codeword distribution to the data distribution via minimizing a WS distance between them. We develop further theories to connect it with the clustering viewpoint of WS distance, allowing us to have a better and more controllable clustering solution. Finally, we empirically evaluate our method on several well-known benchmarks, where it achieves better qualitative and quantitative performances than the baselines in terms of the codebook utilization and image reconstruction/generation."}}

To address this issue, we propose to incorporate the spatially conditional normalization to modulate the quantized vectors so as to insert spatially variant information to the embedded index maps, encouraging the decoder to generate more photorealistic images. Moreover, we use multichannel quantization to increase the recombination capability of the discrete codes without increasing the cost of model and codebook. Additionally, to generate discrete tokens at the second stage, we adopt a Masked Generative Image Transformer (MaskGIT) to learn an underlying prior distribution in the compressed latent space, which is much faster than the conventional autoregressive model. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed modulated VQGAN is able to greatly improve the reconstructed image quality as well as provide high-fidelity image generation."}}

While it is a natural and important premise to ground generalization capacity on the target domain, we argue that this assumption could be overly strict and sub-optimal. It is particularly evident when source domains share little information or the target domains leverages information from selective source domains in a compositional way instead of relying on a unique invariant hypothesis across all source domains. Unlike most existing approaches, instead of constructing a single hypothesis shared among domains, we propose a LAtent Sub-Space Orientation (LASSO) method that explores diverse latent sub-spaces and learning individual hypotheses on those sub-spaces. Moreover, in LASSO, since the latent sub-spaces are formed by the label-informative features captured in source domains, they allow us to project target examples onto appropriate sub-spaces, while preserving crucial label-informative features for the label prediction. Finally, we empirically evaluate our method on several well-known DG benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art results."}}

However, existing model-based methods are vulnerable to model bias, which leads to poor generalization and asymptotic performance compared to model-free counterparts. In this paper, we propose a novel policy optimization framework using an uncertainty-aware objective function to handle those issues. In this framework, the agent simultaneously learns an uncertainty-aware dynamics model and optimizes the policy according to these learned models. Under this framework, the objective function can represented end-to-end as a single computational graph, which allows seamless policy gradient computation via backpropagation through the models. In addition to being theoretically sound, our approach shows promising results on challenging continuous control benchmarks with competitive asymptotic performance and sample complexity compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}}
