But is this really the case? This question couples the geometry of the DNN loss landscape with how stochastic optimization algorithms like SGD interact with it during training. Answering this question may help us qualitatively understand the dynamics of deep neural network optimization. We show evidence through qualitative and quantitative experiments that mini-batch SGD rarely crosses barriers during DNN optimization. As we show, the mini-batch induced noise helps SGD explore different regions of the loss surface using a seemingly different mechanism. To complement this finding, we also investigate the qualitative reason behind the slowing down of this exploration when using larger batch-sizes. We show this happens because gradients from larger batch-sizes align more with the top eigenvectors of the Hessian, which makes SGD oscillate in the proximity of the parameter initialization, thus preventing exploration."}}

These observations expose the qualitatively different roles of learning rate and batch-size in DNN optimization and generalization. Specifically we study the DNN loss surface along the trajectory of SGD by interpolating the loss surface between parameters from consecutive \\textit{iterations} and tracking various metrics during training. We find that the loss interpolation between parameters before and after each training iteration's update is roughly convex with a minimum (\\textit{valley floor}) in between for most of the training. Based on this and other metrics, we deduce that for most of the training update steps, SGD moves in valley like regions of the loss surface by jumping from one valley wall to another at a height above the valley floor. This 'bouncing between walls at a height' mechanism helps SGD traverse larger distance for small batch sizes and large learning rates which we find play qualitatively different roles in the dynamics. While a large learning rate maintains a large height from the valley floor, a small batch size injects noise facilitating exploration. We find this mechanism is crucial for generalization because the valley floor has barriers and this exploration above the valley floor allows SGD to quickly travel far away from the initialization point (without being affected by barriers) and find flatter regions, corresponding to better generalization."}}
