To deal with the sensitive data, there are two cases of outsourcing process: i) many clients participate dynamically ii) many clients are pre-determined. The solutions for protecting sensitive data in both cases are the multi-key homomorphic encryption (MKHE) scheme and the threshold multi-key homomorphic encryption (TMKHE) scheme. However, these schemes may be difficult for clients with limited resources to perform MKHE and TMKHE. In addition, due to the large size of the evaluation keys, in particular multiplication and rotation keys, the communication between the clients and server that provide outsourcing service increases. Also, the size of the evaluation keys that the server must hold is tremendous, in particular, for the multiplication and rotation keys, which are essential for bootstrapping operation. In this paper, we propose a variant of MKHE and TMKHE with reduced evaluation keys. To reduce the size of the evaluation keys, we propose a variant of ring learning with errors (RLWE), called RLWE reusing errors (ReRLWE). ReRLWE generates other components by reusing the error that is used when generating an RLWE sample. We prove that RLWE can be reduced to ReRLWE and propose modified evaluation keys under the ReRLWE assumption, which are the modified multiplication and rotation keys. For MKHE, multiplication and rotation keys are reduced by 66% and 25%, respectively. For TMKHE, a multiplication and rotation keys are reduced by 50% and 25%, respectively."}}

This work focuses on PPML using word-wise fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). In order to implement deep learning on word-wise HE, the ReLU and max-pooling functions should be approximated by polynomials for homomorphic operations. Most of the previous studies focus on HE-friendly networks, which approximate the ReLU and max-pooling functions using low-degree polynomials. However, this approximation cannot support deeper neural networks due to large approximation errors in general and can classify only relatively small datasets. Thus, we propose a precise polynomial approximation technique, a composition of minimax approximate polynomials of low degrees for the ReLU and max-pooling functions. If we replace the ReLU and max-pooling functions with the proposed approximate polynomials, standard deep learning models such as ResNet and VGGNet can still be used without further modification for PPML on FHE. Even pre-trained parameters can be used without retraining, which makes the proposed method more practical. We approximate the ReLU and max-pooling functions in the ResNet-152 using the composition of minimax approximate polynomials of degrees 15, 27, and 29. Then, we succeed in classifying the plaintext ImageNet dataset with 77.52% accuracy, which is very close to the original model accuracy of 78.31%. Also, we obtain an accuracy of 87.90% for classifying the encrypted CIFAR-10 dataset in the ResNet-20 without any additional training."}}

It is difficult to accurately estimate the min-entropy of a non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) source. Hence, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-90B adopts ten different min-entropy estimators and then conservatively selects the minimum value among ten min-entropy estimates. Among these estimators, the longest repeated substring (LRS) estimator estimates the collision entropy instead of the min-entropy by counting the number of repeated substrings. Since the collision entropy is an upper bound on the min-entropy, the LRS estimator inherently provides overestimated outputs. In this paper, we propose two techniques to estimate the min-entropy of a non-IID source accurately. The first technique resolves the overestimation problem by translating the collision entropy into the min-entropy. Next, we generalize the LRS estimator by adopting the general R\u00e9nyi entropy instead of the collision entropy (i.e., R\u00e9nyi entropy of order two). We show that adopting a higher order can reduce the variance of min-entropy estimates. By integrating these techniques, we propose a generalized LRS estimator that effectively resolves the overestimation problem and provides stable min-entropy estimates. Theoretical analysis and empirical results support that the proposed generalized LRS estimator improves the estimation accuracy significantly, which makes it an appealing alternative to the current-standard LRS estimator."}}

It is known that bootstrapping is the most challenging part of the CKKS scheme. Further, homomorphic evaluation of modular reduction is the core of the CKKS bootstrapping. As modular reduction is not represented by the addition and multiplication of complex numbers, approximate polynomials for modular reduction should be used. The best-known techniques (Eurocrypt\u201921) use a polynomial approximation for trigonometric functions and their composition. However, all the previous methods are based on an indirect approximation, and thus it requires lots of multiplicative depth to achieve high accuracy. This paper proposes a direct polynomial approximation of modular reduction for CKKS bootstrapping, which is optimal in error variance and depth. Further, we propose an efficient algorithm, namely the lazy baby-step giant-step (BSGS) algorithm, to homomorphically evaluate the approximate polynomial, utilizing the lazy relinearization/rescaling technique. The lazy-BSGS reduces the computational complexity by half compared to the ordinary BSGS algorithm. The performance improvement for the CKKS scheme by the proposed algorithm is verified by implementation using HE libraries. The implementation results show that the proposed method has a multiplicative depth of 10 for modular reduction to achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy, while the previous methods have depths of 11 to 12. Moreover, we achieve higher accuracy within a small multiplicative depth, for example, 93-bit within multiplicative depth 11."}}

The pqsigRM is a code-based PQC digital signature scheme which was accepted in round 1 of the NIST's PQC standardization process. This scheme was revised as the modified pqsigRM by removing all known vulnerabilities during the standardization process. Its advantages include an efficient decoding process, proven security, and small signature sizes. Small signature sizes are very useful in signature schemes because we should send signatures in every signing process. However, it has a problem with large public key sizes. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the public key size of modified pqsigRM. We change the public key into a systematic form, improve its parameters, and fine-tune the bit-security for each parameter. Thus, we can reduce to 0.20, 0.40, and 0.23 times smaller public key sizes compared to the modified pqsigRM parameters for 80, 128, and 256 security levels, respectively. Also, we are able to obtain a larger exact bit-security for these parameters."}}
