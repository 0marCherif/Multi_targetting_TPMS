However, naively extending the existing framework to the domain of multi-modality multi-task learning remains ineffective and even poisonous due to the notorious modality bias and task conflict. Previous works manually coordinate the learning framework with empirical knowledge, which may lead to sub-optima. To mitigate the issue, we propose a novel yet simple multi-level gradient calibration learning framework across tasks and modalities during optimization. Specifically, the gradients, produced by the task heads and used to update the shared backbone, will be calibrated at the backbone's last layer to alleviate the task conflict. Before the calibrated gradients are further propagated to the modality branches of the backbone, their magnitudes will be calibrated again to the same level, ensuring the downstream tasks pay balanced attention to different modalities. Experiments on large-scale benchmark nuScenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, eg, an absolute 14.4% mIoU improvement on map segmentation and 1.4% mAP improvement on 3D detection, advancing the application of 3D autonomous driving in the domain of multi-modality fusion and multi-task learning. We also discuss the links between modalities and tasks."}}

Most of the previous works propose to regress the representational features from the teacher to the student in a one-to-one spatial matching fashion. However, people tend to overlook the fact that, due to the architecture differences, the semantic information on the same spatial location usually vary. This greatly undermines the underlying assumption of the one-to-one distillation approach. To this end, we propose a novel one-to-all spatial matching knowledge distillation approach. Specifically, we allow each pixel of the teacher feature to be distilled to all spatial locations of the student features given its similarity, which is generated from a target-aware transformer. Our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on various computer vision benchmarks, such as ImageNet, Pascal VOC and COCOStuff10k.

We propose an unreliable-to-reliable instance translation model (Un2Reliab) conditioned on unreliable instances which poorly align with pedestrians. Un2Reliab mainly consists of an encoder-decoder-like generative network and a discriminative network, which are jointly trained in a minimax game. We adopt regularization to ensure that the synthesized instances are semantically similar to the corresponding ground truth. Furthermore, to preserve the identities of persons, we propose another regularization to ensure that the synthesized instances associated with the same person should be consistent in appearance. As a result, Un2Reliab learns to restore the missing parts of the original instances. As a side benefit, the synthesized instances are brought into better alignment. Inclusion of the synthesized data improves both the diversity and quality of training data, which eventually leads to better generalization performance. Extensive experiments indicate that Un2Reliab is able to synthesize high-fidelity pedestrian instances and improve the previous state-of-the-art results on multiple semi-supervised pedestrian detection benchmarks."}}

Despite many efforts, prior methods ignore the important role of retaining inter-channel correlation of features, leading to the lack of capturing intrinsic distribution of the feature space and sufficient diversity properties of features in the teacher network. To solve the issue, we propose the novel Inter-Channel Correlation for Knowledge Distillation (ICKD), with which the diversity and homology of the feature space of the student network can align with that of the teacher network. The correlation between these two channels is interpreted as diversity if they are irrelevant to each other, otherwise homology. Then the student is required to mimic the correlation within its own embedding space. In addition, we introduce the grid-level inter-channel correlation, making it capable of dense prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on two vision tasks, including ImageNet classification and Pascal VOC segmentation, demonstrate the superiority of our ICKD, which consistently outperforms many existing methods, advancing the state-of-the-art in the fields of Knowledge Distillation. To our knowledge, we are the first method based on knowledge distillation boosts ResNet18 beyond 72% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification.

For this purpose, we specifically modify the region proposal network (RPN) for learning on a partially labeled dataset. Based on commonly observed false positive types, a verification module is developed to assess foreground human objects in the candidate regions to provide an important cue for filtering the RPN's proposals. The remaining proposals with high confidence scores are then used as pseudo annotations for re-training our detection model. To reduce the risk of error propagation in the training process, we adopt a self-paced training strategy to progressively include more pseudo annotations generated by the previous model over multiple training rounds. The resulting detector re-trained on the augmented data can be expected to have better detection performance. The effectiveness of the main components of this framework is verified through extensive experiments, and the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art detection results on multiple scene-specific human detection benchmarks in the semi-supervised setting."}}

Instead of collecting unreliable detections from unlabeled data, we adopt a class-conditional GAN for synthesizing pedestrian instances to alleviate the problem of insufficient labeled data. With the help of a base detector, we integrate pedestrian instance synthesis and detection by including a post-refinement classifier (PRC) into a minimax game. A generator and the PRC can mutually reinforce each other by synthesizing high-fidelity pedestrian instances and providing more accurate categorical information. Both of them compete with a class-conditional discriminator and a class-specific discriminator, such that the four fundamental networks in our model can be jointly trained. In our experiments, we validate that the proposed model significantly improves the performance of the base detector and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks. As shown in Figure 1, the result indicates the possibility of using inexpensively synthesized instances for improving semi-supervised detection models."}}
