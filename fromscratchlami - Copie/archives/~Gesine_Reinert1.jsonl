As graph representations for complex data become increasingly  popular, we encounter many time series of graphs with temporal and attribute dependencies, such as communication networks, daily bike rentals or bank transactions. However, the analysis of such graphs can be impeded by privacy or data protection issues, calling for synthetic network time series which serve as surrogate of the observed time series. There are many  methods to construct networks, for example transformer-based graph models such as TagGen, but it is harder to create data which are faithful to the observed dependencies, including those of attributes across time. Moreover, tabular data generation methods, such as GANs, fail to emulate complex graph structures. To circumvent these limitations, we introduce CTWalk which combines and leverages the strengths of both methods, by coupling TagGen that learns the distribution of temporal random walks over the input data, and a conditional tabular GAN (CTGAN) that captures the time dependence of the features. CTWalk is able to mimic edge weight distributions,  node labels, and temporal dependencies of the data."}}

Here we assess the effect of RKHS choice for KSD tests of random networks models, developed for exponential random graph models (ERGMs) in Xu and Reinert (2021) and for synthetic graph generators in Xu and Reinert (2022). We investigate the power performance and the computational runtime of the test in different scenarios, including both dense and sparse graph regimes. Experimental results on kernel performance for model assessment tasks are shown and discussed on synthetic and real-world network applications."}}

Here we introduce DAMNETS, a scalable deep generative model for network time series. DAMNETS outperforms competing methods on all of our measures of sample quality, over both real and synthetic data sets.\n"}}

We introduce a graph neural network framework, named DIGRAC, to obtain node embeddings for directed networks in a self-supervised manner, including a novel probabilistic imbalance loss, which can be used for network clustering. Here, we propose \\textit{directed flow imbalance} measures, which are tightly related to directionality, to reveal clusters in the network even when there is no density difference between clusters.  In contrast to standard approaches in the literature, in this paper, directionality is not treated as a nuisance, but rather contains the main signal. DIGRAC optimizes directed flow imbalance for clustering without requiring label supervision, unlike existing graph neural network methods, and can naturally incorporate node features, unlike existing spectral methods. Extensive experimental results on synthetic data, in the form of directed stochastic block models, and real-world data at different scales, demonstrate that our method, based on flow imbalance, attains state-of-the-art results on directed graph clustering when compared against 10 state-of-the-art methods from the literature, for a wide range of noise and sparsity levels, graph structures, and topologies, and even outperforms supervised methods.

Here we introduce a signed directed Laplacian matrix, which we call the magnetic signed Laplacian, as a natural generalization of both the signed Laplacian on signed graphs and the magnetic Laplacian on directed graphs. We then use this matrix to construct a novel efficient spectral GNN architecture and conduct extensive experiments on both node clustering and link prediction tasks. In these experiments, we consider tasks related to signed information, tasks related to directional information, and tasks related to both signed and directional information. We demonstrate that our proposed spectral GNN is effective for incorporating both signed and directional information, and attains leading performance on a wide range of data sets. Additionally, we provide a novel synthetic network model, which we refer to as the Signed Directed Stochastic Block Model, and a number of novel real-world data sets based on lead-lag relationships in financial time series.

In particular, AgraSSt can be used to determine whether a learned graph generating process is capable of generating graphs which resemble a given input graph. Inspired by Stein operators for random graphs, the key idea of AgraSSt is the construction of a kernel discrepancy based on an operator obtained from the graph generator. AgraSSt can provide interpretable criticisms for a graph generator training procedure and help identify reliable sample batches for downstream tasks. We give theoretical guarantees for a broad class of random graph models. Moreover, we provide empirical results on both synthetic input graphs with known graph generation procedures, and real-world input graphs that the state-of-the-art (deep) generative models for graphs are trained on."}}

Assessing the quality of such synthetic data generators hence has to be addressed. As (deep) generative models for synthetic data often do not admit explicit probability distributions, classical statistical procedures for assessing model goodness-of-fit may not be applicable. In this paper, we propose a principled procedure to assess the quality of a synthetic data generator. The procedure is a Kernelised Stein Discrepancy-type test which is based on a non-parametric Stein operator for the synthetic data generator of interest. This operator is estimated from samples which are obtained from the synthetic data generator and hence can be applied even when the model is only implicit. In contrast to classical testing, the sample size from the synthetic data generator can be as large as desired, while the size of the observed data that the generator aims to emulate is fixed. Experimental results on synthetic distributions and trained generative models on synthetic and real datasets illustrate that the method shows improved power performance compared to existing approaches."}}

One way to generate such functional information is to infer biological relationships between genes or proteins, using a network of gene coexpression data that includes functional annotations. Signed distance correlation has proved useful for the construction of unweighted gene coexpression networks. However, transforming correlation values into unweighted networks may lead to a loss of important biological information related to the intensity of the correlation. Here, we introduce a principled method to construct weighted gene coexpression networks using signed distance correlation. These networks contain weighted edges only between those pairs of genes whose correlation value is higher than a given threshold. We analyze data from different organisms and find that networks generated with our method based on signed distance correlation are more stable and capture more biological information compared to networks obtained from Pearson correlation. Moreover, we show that signed distance correlation networks capture more biological information than unweighted networks based on the same metric. While we use biological data sets to illustrate the method, the approach is general and can be used to construct networks in other domains.
