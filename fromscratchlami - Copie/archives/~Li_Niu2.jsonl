We propose the first defect image generation method in the challenging few-shot cases. Given just a handful of defect images and relatively more defect-free ones, our goal is to augment the dataset with new defect images. Our method consists of two training stages. First, we train a data-efficient StyleGAN2 on defect-free images as the backbone. Second, we attach defect-aware residual blocks to the backbone, which learn to produce reasonable defect masks and accordingly manipulate the features within the masked regions by training the added modules on limited defect images. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD dataset not only validate the effectiveness of our method in generating realistic and diverse defect images, but also manifest the benefits it brings to downstream defect inspection tasks.

High-resolution image harmonization is in high demand, but still remains unexplored. Conventional image harmonization methods learn global RGB-to-RGB transformation which could effortlessly scale to high resolution, but ignore diverse local context. Recent deep learning methods learn the dense pixel-to-pixel transformation which could generate harmonious outputs, but are highly constrained in low resolution. In this work, we propose a high-resolution image harmonization network with Collaborative Dual Transformation (CDTNet) to combine pixelto-pixel transformation and RGB-to-RGB transformation coherently in an end-to-end network. Our CDTNet consists of a low-resolution generator for pixel-to-pixel transformation, a color mapping module for RGB-to-RGB transformation, and a refinement module to take advantage of both. Extensive experiments on high-resolution benchmark dataset and our created high-resolution real composite images demonstrate that our CDTNet strikes a good balance between efficiency and effectiveness. Our used datasets can be found in https://github.com/bcmi/CDTNetHigh-Resolution-Image-Harmonization.\n"}}

In this paper, we propose a new type of generative diversity named uniform diversity, which relates to a newly proposed type of mode collapse named $u$-mode collapse where the generative samples distribute nonuniformly over the data manifold. From a geometric perspective, we show that the uniform diversity is closely related with the generator uniformity property, and the maximum uniform diversity is achieved if the generator is uniform. To learn a uniform generator, we propose UniGAN, a generative framework with a Normalizing Flow based generator and a simple yet sample efficient generator uniformity regularization, which can be easily adapted to any other generative framework. A new type of diversity metric named udiv is also proposed to estimate the uniform diversity given a set of generative samples in practice. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our UniGAN in learning a uniform generator and improving uniform diversity."}}

To this end, we focus on the problem named weak-shot semantic segmentation, where the novel classes are learnt from cheaper image-level labels with the support of base classes having off-the-shelf pixel-level labels. To tackle this problem, we propose a dual similarity transfer framework, which is built upon MaskFormer to disentangle the semantic segmentation task into single-label classification and binary segmentation for each proposal. Specifically, the binary segmentation sub-task allows proposal-pixel similarity transfer from base classes to novel classes, which enables the mask learning of novel classes. We also learn pixel-pixel similarity from base classes and distill such class-agnostic semantic similarity to the semantic masks of novel classes, which regularizes the segmentation model with pixel-level semantic relationship across images. In addition, we propose a complementary loss to facilitate the learning of novel classes. Comprehensive experiments on the challenging COCO-Stuff-10K and ADE20K datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}}

When the composite image has photographic foreground and painterly background, the task is called painterly image harmonization. There are only few works on this task, which are either time-consuming or weak in generating well-harmonized results. In this work, we propose a novel painterly harmonization network consisting of a dual-domain generator and a dual-domain discriminator, which harmonizes the composite image in both spatial domain and frequency domain. The dual-domain generator performs harmonization by using AdaIN modules in the spatial domain and our proposed ResFFT modules in the frequency domain. The dual-domain discriminator attempts to distinguish the inharmonious patches based on the spatial feature and frequency feature of each patch, which can enhance the ability of generator in an adversarial manner. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset show the effectiveness of our method. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/bcmi/PHDNet-Painterly-Image-Harmonization."}}

In this paper, we consider a specific and practical application: human-centric image cropping, which focuses on the depiction of a person. To this end, we propose a human-centric image cropping method with two novel feature designs for the candidate crop: partition-aware feature and content-preserving feature. For partition-aware feature, we divide the whole image into nine partitions based on the human bounding box and treat different partitions in a candidate crop differently conditioned on the human information. For content-preserving feature, we predict a heatmap indicating the important content to be included in a good crop, and extract the geometric relation between the heatmap and a candidate crop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can perform favorably against state-of-the-art image cropping methods on human-centric image cropping task.

This problem combines the traditional video object segmentation task with an additional image indicating the content that users are concerned with. Since no existing dataset is perfectly suitable for this new task, we specifically construct a large-scale dataset called LiveVideos, which contains 2418 pairs of target images and live videos with instance-level annotations. In addition, we propose a transformer-based method for this task. We revisit Swin Transformer and design a dual-path structure to fuse video and image features. Then, a transformer decoder is employed to generate object proposals for segmentation and tracking from the fused features. Extensive experiments on LiveVideos dataset show the superiority of our proposed method."}}

To this end, we present a novel framework consisting of a color mapping module and an inharmonious region localization network, in which the former is equipped with a novel domain discrepancy magnification loss and the latter could be an arbitrary localization network.
