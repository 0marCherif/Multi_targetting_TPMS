To avoid these problems, this paper proposes a method, ``Retrospective Adversarial Replay (RAR)'', that synthesizes adversarial samples near the forgetting boundary. RAR perturbs a buffered sample towards its nearest neighbor drawn from the current task in a latent representation space. By replaying such samples, we are able to refine the boundary between previous and current tasks, hence combating forgetting and reducing bias towards the current task. To mitigate the severity of a small replay buffer, we develop a novel MixUp-based strategy to increase replay variation by replaying mixed augmentations. Combined with RAR, this achieves a holistic framework that helps to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. We show that this excels on broadly-used benchmarks and outperforms other continual learning baselines especially when only a small buffer is available. We conduct a thorough ablation study over each key component as well as a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of RAR."}}

Positive-Unlabeled learning (PU learning) provides the ability to train a binary classifier using only positive (P) and unlabeled (U) instances. The unlabeled data comprises of both positive and negative classes. It is possible to find labels for strict subsets of non-malicious actors, e.g., the assumption that only humans purchase during web sessions, or clear CAPTCHAs. However, finding signals of malicious behavior is almost impossible due to the ever-evolving and adversarial nature of bots. Such a set-up naturally lends itself to PU learning. Unfortunately, standard PU learning approaches assume that the labeled set of positives are a random sample of all positives, this is unlikely to hold in practice. In this work, we propose two modifications to PU learning that make it more robust to violations of the selected-completely-at-random assumption, leading to a system that can filter out malicious bots. In one public and one proprietary dataset, we show that proposed approaches are better at identifying humans in web data than standard PU learning methods."}}

We then propose a two-stage Submodular Span Summarization (S3) framework to achieve a form of conditional or query-focused data summarization. The first stage encourages the summary to be relevant to a given query set, and the second stage encourages the final summary to be diverse, thus achieving two important necessities for a good query-focused summary. Unlike previous methods, our framework uses only a single submodular function defined over both data and query. We analyze theoretical properties in the context of both matroids and polymatroids that elucidate when our methods should work well. We find that a scalable approximation algorithm to the polymatroid submodular span problem has good theoretical and empirical properties. We provide empirical and qualitative results on three real-world tasks: conditional multi-document summarization on the DUC 2005-2007 datasets, conditional video summarization on the UT-Egocentric dataset, and conditional image corpus summarization on the ImageNet dataset. We use deep neural networks, specifically a BERT model for text, AlexNet for video frames, and Bi-directional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGAN) for ImageNet images to help instantiate the submodular functions. The result is a minimally supervised form of conditional summarization that matches or improves over the previous state-of-the-art."}}

In Customer Relationship Management, customer segmentation plays an important role, with the goal of targeting different products for different segments. Marketers segment their customers based on customer attributes. In the non-subscription based media business, the customer is analogous to the visitor, the product to the content, and a purchase to consumption. Knowing which segment an audience member belongs to, enables better engagement. In this work, we address the problems: 1) How can we segment audience members of an M&E web property based on their media consumption interests? 2) When a new visitor arrives, how can we classify them into one of the above defined segments (without having to wait for consumption history)? We apply our proposed solution to a real world data-set and show that we can achieve coherent clusters and can predict cluster membership with a high level of accuracy. We also build a tool that the editors can find valuable towards understanding their audience."}}
