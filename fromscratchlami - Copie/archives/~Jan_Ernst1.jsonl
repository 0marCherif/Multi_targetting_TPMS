Current approaches assume that task-relevant target-domain data is available during training. We demonstrate how to perform domain adaptation when no such task-relevant target-domain data is available. To tackle this issue, we propose zero-shot deep domain adaptation (ZDDA), which uses privileged information from task-irrelevant dual-domain pairs. ZDDA learns a source-domain representation which is not only tailored for the task of interest but also close to the target-domain representation. Therefore, the source-domain task of interest solution (e.g. a classifier for classification tasks) which is jointly trained with the source-domain representation can be applicable to both the source and target representations. Using the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, NIST, EMNIST, and SUN RGB-D datasets, we show that ZDDA can perform domain adaptation in classification tasks without access to task-relevant target-domain training data. We also extend ZDDA to perform sensor fusion in the SUN RGB-D scene classification task by simulating task-relevant target-domain representations with task-relevant source-domain data. To the best of our knowledge, ZDDA is the first domain adaptation and sensor fusion method which requires no task-relevant target-domain data. The underlying principle is not particular to computer vision data, but should be extensible to other domains."}}

Various learning approaches have been applied in the past to different stages of the matching pipeline, considering detection, description, or metric learning objectives. These objectives were typically addressed separately and most previous work has focused on image data. This paper proposes an end-to-end learning framework for keypoint detection and its representation (descriptor) for 3D depth maps or 3D scans, where the two can be jointly optimized towards task-specific objectives without a need for separate annotations. We employ a Siamese architecture augmented by a sampling layer and a novel score loss function which in turn affects the selection of region proposals. The positive and negative examples are obtained automatically by sampling corresponding region proposals based on their consistency with known 3D pose labels. Matching experiments with depth data on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods."}}

These attention maps are then available as priors for tasks such as object localization and semantic segmentation. In one common framework we address three shortcomings of previous approaches in modeling such attention maps: We (1) make attention maps an explicit and natural component of the end-to-end training for the first time, (2) provide self-guidance directly on these maps by exploring supervision from the network itself to improve them, and (3) seamlessly bridge the gap between using weak and extra supervision if available. Despite its simplicity, experiments on the semantic segmentation task demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. We clearly surpass the state-of-the-art on PASCAL VOC 2012 test and val. sets. Besides, the proposed framework provides a way not only explaining the focus of the learner but also feeding back with direct guidance towards specific tasks. Under mild assumptions our method can also be understood as a plug-in to existing weakly supervised learners to improve their generalization performance."}}

For instance, we may learn concepts of changing illumination, geometry or albedo of a scene, and try to recombine them to generate physically meaningful, but unseen data for training and testing. In practice however we often do not have samples from the joint concept space available: We may have data on illumination change in one data set and on geometric change in another one without complete overlap. We pose the following question: How can we learn two or more concepts jointly from different data sets with mutual consistency where we do not have samples from the full joint space? We present a novel answer in this paper based on cyclic consistency over multiple concepts, represented individually by generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our method, ConceptGAN, can be understood as a drop in for data augmentation to improve resilience for real world applications. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate its efficacy in generating semantically meaningful images, as well as one shot face verification as an example application."}}

However, unsupervised methods are blind to the video category and often fail to produce semantically meaningful video summaries. On the other hand, acquisition of large amount of training data in supervised approaches is non-trivial and may lead to a biased model. Different from existing methods, we introduce a weakly supervised approach that requires only video-level annotation for summarizing web videos. Casting the problem as a weakly supervised learning problem, we propose a flexible deep 3D CNN architecture to learn the notion of importance using only video-level annotation, and without any human-crafted training data. Specifically, our main idea is to leverage multiple videos of a category to automatically learn a parametric model for categorizing videos and then adopt the model to find important segments from a given video as the ones which have maximum influence to the model output. Furthermore, to unleash the full potential of our 3D CNN architecture, we also explored a series of good practices to reduce the influence of limited training data while summarizing videos. Experiments on two challenging and diverse datasets well demonstrate that our approach produces superior quality video summaries compared to several recently proposed approaches."}}
