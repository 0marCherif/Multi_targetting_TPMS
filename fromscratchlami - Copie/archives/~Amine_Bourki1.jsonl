However, despite the ongoing attention these topics\nreceive, autonomous exploration systems still lack common\nevaluation grounds to assess their relative performance in\nterms of data and experimental tools. We address this\ndeficit by introducing FLYBO, the first unified benchmark\nenvironment that focuses on the performance of such flying\nrobots in terms of autonomous exploration and online surface reconstruction. It includes (i) 11 challenging realistic\nindoor- and outdoor datasets of increasing complexity and\nsize, with ground-truth, (ii) a comprehensive benchmark of\n7 of the top-performing autonomous exploration algorithms\nincluding methods without publicly available code. (iii) A\nunified experimental system factorizes the routines shared\nby autonomous planners in order to fairly and accurately\nassess their exploration performance in a controlled environment."}}

To do so, we\npresent SplatPlanner, an end-to-end autonomous planner that\nis based on a novel Permutohedral Frontier Filtering (PFF)\nwhich relies on a combination of highly efficient operations\nstemming from bilateral filtering using permutohedral lattices\nto guide the entire exploration. In particular, our PFF is\ncomputationally linear in input size, nearly parameter-free, and\naggregates spatial information about frontier-neighborhoods\ninto density scores in one single step. Comparative experiments\nmade on simulated environments of increasing complexity\nshow our method consistently outperforms recent state-of-theart methods in terms of computational efficiency, exploration\nspeed and qualitative coverage of scenes.

We introduce a novel patch-based formulation via energy minimization which combines top-down segmentation hypotheses using appearance and vanishing line detections, as well as an arrangement of creased planar structures which are extracted automatically through a robust analysis of available SfM points and image features. The method produces a compact piecewise-planar depth map and a mesh which are aligned with the scene\u2019s structure. Experiments show that our approach not only reaches similar levels of accuracy w.r.t state-of-the-art pixel-based methods while using much fewer images, but also produces a much more compact, structure-aware mesh in a considerably shorter runtime by several of orders of magnitude"}}

On the other hand, structure-aware 3D reconstruction methods are slow and scale poorly with the size of the input sequences and/or may even require additional restrictive information. The goal of this thesis is to reconcile scalability and structureawareness within common MVS grounds using soft, generic priors which encourage: (i) piecewise planarity, (ii) alignment of objects boundaries with image gradients and (iii) with vanishing directions (VDs), and (iv) objects co-planarity. To do so, we present the novel \u201cPatchwork Stereo\u201d framework which integrates photometric stereo from a handful of wide-baseline views and a sparse 3D point cloud combining robust 3D plane extraction and top-down image partitioning from a unified 2D-3D analysis in a principled Markov Random Field energy minimization. \n\nWe evaluate our contributions quantitatively and qualitatively on challenging urban datasets and illustrate results which are at least on par with state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric structure, but achieved in several orders of magnitude faster paving the way for photo-realistic city-scale modeling.\n\nKeywords: Multi-View Stereo, Structure Priors, 3D Reconstruction, Image-Based Modeling, Scalability, Top-Down Image Segmentation, Urban Modeling."}}
