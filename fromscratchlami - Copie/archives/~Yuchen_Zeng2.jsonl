Automatic scientific discovery has been proposed to help researchers identify new research ideas, but it has generally been limited to finding new combinations of concept pairs using link prediction in a knowledge graph. In this paper, we propose the combinatorial scientific discovery task: predicting combinations of more than two concepts. We standardize the task by providing benchmark datasets and initial models. Our solutions demonstrate the challenge but also the value of the task to find new, meaningful scientific ideas and its advantage over simple link~prediction."}}
