Federated learning enables a group of learners (called clients) to train an MKL model on the data distributed among clients to perform online non-linear function approximation. There are some challenges in online federated MKL that need to be addressed: i) Communication efficiency especially when a large number of kernels are considered ii) Heterogeneous data distribution among clients. The present paper develops an algorithmic framework to enable clients to communicate with the server to send their updates with affordable communication cost while clients employ a large dictionary of kernels. Utilizing random feature (RF) approximation, the present paper proposes scalable online federated MKL algorithm. We prove that using the proposed online federated MKL algorithm, each client enjoys sub-linear regret with respect to the RF approximation of its best kernel in hindsight, which indicates that the proposed algorithm can effectively deal with heterogeneity of the data distributed among clients. Experimental results on real datasets showcase the advantages of the proposed algorithm compared with other online federated kernel learning ones."}}

However, fairness is a largely under-explored territory within the field, which may lead to biased results towards underrepresented groups in ensuing tasks. To this end, this work theoretically explains the sources of bias in node representations obtained via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our analysis reveals that both nodal features and graph structure lead to bias in the obtained representations. Building upon the analysis, fairness-aware data augmentation frameworks on nodal features and graph structure are developed to reduce the intrinsic bias. Our analysis and proposed schemes can be readily employed to enhance the fairness of various GNN-based learning mechanisms. Extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction are carried out over real networks in the context of graph contrastive learning. Comparison with multiple benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed augmentation strategies can improve fairness in terms of statistical parity and equal opportunity, while providing comparable utility to state-of-the-art contrastive methods.

The key problem of MKL is to combine kernels in a prescribed dictionary. Inclusion of irrelevant kernels in the dictionary can deteriorate accuracy of MKL, and increase the computational complexity. To improve the accuracy of function approximation and reduce the computational complexity, the present paper studies data-driven selection of kernels from the dictionary that provide satisfactory function approximations. Specifically, based on the similarities among kernels, the novel framework constructs and refines a graph to assist choosing a subset of kernels. In addition, random feature approximation is utilized to enable online implementation for sequentially obtained data. Theoretical analysis shows that our proposed algorithms enjoy tighter sub-linear regret bound compared with state-of-art graph-based online MKL alternatives. Experiments on a number of real datasets also showcase the advantages of our novel graph-aided framework."}}

Several existing network topology inference approaches rely on structural equation models (SEMs). These presume that exogenous inputs are available, which may be unrealistic in certain applications. Recently, an alternative line of work reformulated SEM-based topology identification as a three-way tensor decomposition task. This way, knowing the exogenous input correlation statistics (rather than the exogenous inputs themselves) suffices for network topology identification. The downside is that this approach is computationally expensive. In addition, it is hard to incorporate prior information of the network structure (e.g., sparsity and local smoothness) into this framework, while such prior information may help enhance performance when handling real-world noisy data. The present work puts forth a joint diagonalizaition (JD)-based approach to directed network topology inference. JD can be viewed as a variant of tensor decomposition, but features more efficient algorithms, and can readily account for the network structure. Different from existing alternatives, novel identifiability guarantees are derived regardless of the exogenous inputs or their statistics. Three JD algorithms tailored for network topology inference are developed, and their performance is showcased using simulated and real data tests."}}

Two major graph-based learning tasks are topology identification and inference of signals over graphs. Among the possible models to explain data interdependencies, structural equation models (SEMs) accommodate a gamut of applications involving topology identification. Obtaining conventional SEMs though requires measurements across nodes. On the other hand, typical signal inference approaches `blindly trust' a given nominal topology. In practice however, signal or topology perturbations may be present in both tasks, due to model mismatch, outliers, outages or adversarial behavior. To cope with such perturbations, this work introduces a regularized total least-squares (TLS) approach and iterative algorithms with convergence guarantees to solve both tasks. Further generalizations are also considered relying on structured and/or weighted TLS when extra prior information on the perturbation is available. Analyses with simulated and real data corroborate the effectiveness of the novel TLS-based approaches."}}

Nodes in networks usually entail attributes, such as the age or gender of users in a social network. However, real-world networks can have very large size, and nodal attributes can be unavailable to a number of nodes, e.g., due to privacy concerns. Moreover, new nodes can emerge over time, which can necessitate real-time evaluation of their nodal attributes. In this context, this paper deals with scalable learning of nodal attributes by estimating a nodal function based on noisy observations at a subset of nodes. A multikernel-based approach is developed, which is scalable to large-size networks. Unlike most existing methods that re-solve the function estimation problem over all existing nodes whenever a new node joins the network, the novel method is capable of providing real-time evaluation of the function values on newly joining nodes without resorting to a batch solver. Interestingly, the novel scheme only relies on an encrypted version of each node's connectivity in order to learn the nodal attributes, which promotes privacy. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."}}

While VARMs postulate that a given region of interest in the brain is directionally connected to another one by virtue of time-lagged influences, SEMs assert that directed dependencies arise due to instantaneous effects, and may even be adopted when nodal measurements are not necessarily multivariate time series. To unify these complementary perspectives, linear structural vector autoregressive models (SVARMs) that leverage both instantaneous and time-lagged nodal data have recently been put forth. Albeit simple and tractable, linear SVARMs are quite limited since they are incapable of modeling nonlinear dependencies between neuronal time series. To this end, the overarching goal of the present paper is to considerably broaden the span of linear SVARMs by capturing nonlinearities through kernels, which have recently emerged as a powerful nonlinear modeling framework in canonical machine learning tasks, e.g., regression, classification, and dimensionality reduction. The merits of kernel-based methods are extended here to the task of learning the effective brain connectivity, and an efficient regularized estimator is put forth to leverage the edge sparsity inherent to real-world complex networks. Judicious kernel choice from a preselected dictionary of kernels is also addressed using a data-driven approach. Numerical tests on ECoG data captured through a study on epileptic seizures demonstrate that it is possible to unveil previously unknown directed links between brain regions of interest."}}
