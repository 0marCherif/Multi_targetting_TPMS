Instead of simply mining opinion ratings on a target (e.g., a restaurant) or on multiple aspects (e.g., food, service) of a target, it is desirable to go deeper, to mine opinion on fine-grained sub-aspects (e.g., fish). However, it is expensive to obtain high-quality annotations at such fine-grained scale. This leads to our proposal of a new framework, FineSum, which advances the frontier of opinion analysis in three aspects: (1) minimal supervision, where no document-summary pairs are provided, only aspect names and a few aspect/sentiment keywords are available; (2) fine-grained opinion analysis, where sentiment analysis drills down to a specific subject or characteristic within each general aspect; and (3) phrase-based summarization, where short phrases are taken as basic units for summarization, and semantically coherent phrases are gathered to improve the consistency and comprehensiveness of summary. Given a large corpus with no annotation, FineSum first automatically identifies potential spans of opinion phrases, and further reduces the noise in identification results using aspect and sentiment classifiers. It then constructs multiple fine-grained opinion clusters under each aspect and sentiment. Each cluster expresses uniform opinions towards certain sub-aspects (e.g., \"fish\" in \"food\" aspect) or characteristics (e.g., \"Mexican\" in \"food\" aspect). To accomplish this, we train a spherical word embedding space to explicitly represent different aspects and sentiments. We then distill the knowledge from embedding to a contextualized phrase classifier, and perform clustering using the contextualized opinion-aware phrase embedding. Both automatic evaluations on the benchmark and quantitative human evaluation validate the effectiveness of our approach."}}

As a key aspect of customization in summarization, granularity is used to measure the semantic coverage between the summary and source document. However, developing systems that can generate summaries with customizable semantic coverage is still an under-explored topic. In this paper, we propose the first unsupervised multi-granularity summarization framework, GranuSum. We take events as the basic semantic units of the source documents and propose to rank these events by their salience. We also develop a model to summarize input documents with given events as anchors and hints. By inputting different numbers of events, GranuSum is capable of producing multi-granular summaries in an unsupervised manner. Meanwhile, we annotate a new benchmark GranuDUC that contains multiple summaries at different granularities for each document cluster. Experimental results confirm the substantial superiority of GranuSum on multi-granularity summarization over strong baselines. Further, by exploiting the event information, GranuSum also exhibits state-of-the-art performance under the conventional unsupervised abstractive setting.

With the negative consequences of these undesired biases, researchers have responded with unprecedented effort and proposed promising approaches for bias mitigation. In spite of considerable practical importance, current algorithmic fairness literature lacks an in-depth understanding of the relations between different forms of biases. Social bias is complex by nature. Numerous studies in social psychology identify the \"generalized prejudice\", i.e., generalized devaluing sentiments across different groups. For example, people who devalue ethnic minorities are also likely to devalue women and gays. Therefore, this work aims to provide a first systematic study toward understanding bias correlations in mitigation. In particular, we examine bias mitigation in two common NLP tasks -- toxicity detection and word embeddings -- on three social identities, i.e., race, gender, and religion. Our findings suggest that biases are correlated and present scenarios in which independent debiasing approaches dominant in current literature may be insufficient. We further investigate whether jointly mitigating correlated biases is more desired than independent and individual debiasing. Lastly, we shed light on the inherent issue of debiasing-accuracy trade-off in bias mitigation. This study serves to motivate future research on joint bias mitigation that accounts for correlated biases."}}

FineSum automatically identifies opinion phrases from the raw corpus, classifies them into different aspects and sentiments, and constructs multiple fine-grained opinion clusters under each aspect/sentiment. Each cluster consists of semantically coherent phrases, expressing uniform opinions towards certain sub-aspect or characteristics (e.g., positive feelings for ``burgers'' in the ``food'' aspect).

Despite the significant progress made thus far, the focus of most existing work on cyberbullying detection lies in the independent content analysis of different comments within a social media session. We argue that such leading notions of analysis suffer from three key limitations: they overlook the temporal correlations among different comments; they only consider the content within a single comment rather than the topic coherence across comments; they remain generic and exploit limited interactions between social media users. In this work, we observe that user comments in the same session may be inherently related, e.g., discussing similar topics, and their interaction may evolve over time. We also show that modeling such topic coherence and temporal interaction are critical to capture the repetitive characteristics of bullying behavior, thus leading to better predicting performance. To achieve the goal, we first construct a unified temporal graph for each social media session. Drawing on recent advances in graph neural network, we then propose a principled graph-based approach for modeling the temporal dynamics and topic coherence throughout user interactions. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach with the tasks of session-level bullying detection and comment-level case study. Our code is released to public.\u00a01"}}
