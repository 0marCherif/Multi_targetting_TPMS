When dealing with novel categories, the model has to be retrained with more bounding box annotations. Natural language supervision is an attractive alternative for its annotation-free attributes and broader object concepts. However, learning open-vocabulary object detection from language is challenging since image-text pairs do not contain fine-grained object-language alignments.  Previous solutions rely on either expensive grounding annotations or distilling classification-oriented vision models. In this paper, we propose a novel open-vocabulary object detection framework directly learning from image-text pair data. We formulate object-language alignment as a set matching problem between a set of image region features and a set of word embeddings. It enables us to train an open-vocabulary object detector on image-text pairs in a much simple and effective way. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, COCO and LVIS, demonstrate our superior performance over the competing approaches on novel categories, e.g. achieving  32.0% mAP on COCO and 21.7% mask mAP on LVIS.

TransTrack leverages the transformer architecture, which is an attention-based query-key mechanism. It applies object features from the previous frame as a query of the current frame and introduces a set of learned object queries to enable detecting new-coming objects. It builds up a novel joint-detection-and-tracking paradigm by accomplishing object detection and object association in a single shot, simplifying complicated multi-step settings in tracking-by-detection methods. On MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark, TransTrack achieves 74.5\\% and 64.5\\% MOTA, respectively, competitive to the state-of-the-art methods. We expect TransTrack to provide a novel perspective for multiple object tracking. The code is available at: \\url{this https URL}."}}

In this work, we propose a simple and unified framework built upon Transformer, termed ReferFormer. It views the language as queries and directly attends to the most relevant regions in the video frames. Concretely, we introduce a small set of object queries conditioned on the language as the input to the Transformer. In this manner, all the queries are obligated to find the referred objects only. They are eventually transformed into dynamic kernels which capture the crucial object-level information, and play the role of convolution filters to generate the segmentation masks from feature maps. The object tracking is achieved naturally by linking the corresponding queries across frames. This mechanism greatly simplifies the pipeline and the end-to-end framework is significantly different from the previous methods. Extensive experiments on Ref-Youtube-vos, Ref-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences and JHMDB-Sentences show the effectiveness of ReferFormer. On Ref-Youtube-vos, ReferFormer achieves 55.6 J&F with a ResNet-50 backbone without bells and whistles, which exceeds the previous state-of-the-art performance by 8.4 points. In addition, with the strong Video-Swin-Base backbone, ReferFormer achieves the best J&F of 64.9 among all existing methods. Moreover, we show the impressive results of 55.0 mAP and 43.7 mAP on A2D-Sentences and JHMDB-Sentences respectively, which significantly outperforms the previous methods by a large margin.

A qualified open-world object detector can not only identify objects of known categories, but also discover unknown objects, and incrementally learn to categorize them when their annotations progressively arrive. Previous works rely on independent modules to recognize unknown categories and perform incremental learning, respectively. In this paper, we provide a unified perspective: Semantic Topology. During the life-long learning of an open-world object detector, all object instances from the same category are assigned to their corresponding pre-defined node in the semantic topology, including the `unknown' category. This constraint builds up discriminative feature representations and consistent relationships among objects, thus enabling the detector to distinguish unknown objects out of the known categories, as well as making learned features of known objects undistorted when learning new categories incrementally. Extensive experiments demonstrate that semantic topology, either randomly-generated or derived from a well-trained language model, could outperform the current state-of-the-art open-world object detectors by a large margin, e.g., the absolute open-set error (the number of unknown instances that are wrongly labeled as known) is reduced from 7832 to 2546, exhibiting the inherent superiority of semantic topology on open-world object detection."}}

This pipeline is partially motivated by recent progress in both object detection and re- ID, and partially motivated by biases in existing tracking datasets, where most objects tend to have distin-guishing appearance and re-ID models are sufficient for es-tablishing associations. In response to such bias, we would like to re-emphasize that methods for multi-object tracking should also work when object appearance is not sufficiently discriminative. To this end, we propose a large-scale dataset for multi-human tracking, where humans have sim-ilar appearance, diverse motion and extreme articulation. As the dataset contains mostly group dancing videos, we name it \u201cDanceTrack\u201d. We expect DanceTrack to provide a better platform to develop more MOT algorithms that rely less on visual discrimination and depend more on motion analysis. We benchmark several state-of-the-art trackers on our dataset and observe a significant performance drop on DanceTrack when compared against existing benchmarks.

During training stage, object boxes diffuse from ground-truth boxes to random distribution, and the model learns to reverse this noising process. In inference, the model refines a set of randomly generated boxes to the output results in a progressive way. The extensive evaluations on the standard benchmarks, including MS-COCO and LVIS, show that DiffusionDet achieves favorable performance compared to previous well-established detectors. Our work brings two important findings in object detection. First, random boxes, although drastically different from pre-defined anchors or learned queries, are also effective object candidates. Second, object detection, one of the representative perception tasks, can be solved by a generative way. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShoufaChen/DiffusionDet."}}
