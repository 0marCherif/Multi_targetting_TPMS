Data heterogeneity across the devices is one of the challenges confronting this emerging field. Personalization is a natural approach to simultaneously utilize information from the other users\u2019 data and take data heterogeneity into account. In this work, we study the linear regression problem where the data across users are generated from different regression vectors. We present an information-theoretic lower bound of the minimax expected excess risk of personalized linear models. We show an upper bound that matches the lower bound within constant factors. The results characterize the effect of data heterogeneity on learning performance and the trade-off between sample size, problem difficulty, and distribution discrepancy, suggesting that the discrepancy-to-difficulty ratio is the key factor governing the effectiveness of heterogeneous data."}}

The nubot model was proposed to describe self-assembly systems involving active components capable of changing internal states and moving relative to each other. A major difference between the nubot model and many previous self-assembly models is its ability to perform exponential growth. Several previous works focused on restricting the nubot model while preserving exponential growth. In this work, we construct a nubot system which performs exponential growth without any state changes. All nubots stay in fixed internal states throughout the growth process. This construction not only improves the previous optimal construction, but also demonstrates new trade-offs between different types of rules in the nubot system."}}
