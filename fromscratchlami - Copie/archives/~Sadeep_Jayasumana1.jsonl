This simple technique has shown strong empirical performance, and has been heavily used as part of semi-supervised learning techniques such as mixmatch~\\citep{berthelot2019mixmatch} and interpolation consistent training (ICT)~\\citep{verma2019interpolation}. In this paper, we look at mixup through a representation learning lens in a semi-supervised learning setup. In particular, we study the role of mixup in promoting linearity in the learned network representations. Towards this, we study two questions: (1) how does the mixup loss that enforces linearity in the last network layer propagate the linearity to the earlier layers?; and (2) how does the enforcement of stronger mixup loss on more than two data points affect the convergence of training? We empirically investigate these properties of mixup on vision datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN. Our results show that supervised mixup training does not make all the network layers linear;\nin fact the intermediate layers become more non-linear during mixup training compared to a network that is trained without mixup. However, when mixup is used as an unsupervised loss, we observe that all the network layers become more linear resulting in faster training convergence. "}}

In this paper, we aim to improve distillation methods that pave the way for the deployment of such models in practice. The proposed distillation approach supports both retrieval and re-ranking stages and crucially leverages the relative geometry among queries and documents learned by the large teacher model. It goes beyond existing distillation methods in the information retrieval literature, which simply rely on the teacher's scalar scores over the training data, on two fronts: providing stronger signals about local geometry via embedding matching and attaining better coverage of data manifold globally via query generation. Embedding matching provides a stronger signal to align the representations of the teacher and student models. At the same time, query generation explores the data manifold to reduce the discrepancies between the student and teacher where the training data is sparse. Our distillation approach is theoretically justified and applies to both dual encoder (DE) and cross-encoder (CE) models. Furthermore, for distilling a CE model to a DE model via embedding matching, we propose a novel dual pooling-based scorer for the CE model that facilitates a more distillation-friendly embedding geometry, especially for DE student models."}}

Learning Diverse Features for Fine-grained and Long-tail Classification", "abstract": "Feature extractors learned from supervised training of deep neural networks have demonstrated superior performance over handcrafted ones. Recently, it is shown that such learned features have a neural collapse property, where within-class features collapse to the class mean and different class means are maximally separated. This paper examines the neural collapse property in the context of fine-grained classification tasks, where a feature extractor pretrained from a classification task with coarse labels is used for generating features for a downstream classification task with fine-grained labels. We argue that the within-class feature collapse is an undesirable property for fine-grained classification. Hence, we introduce a geometric arrangement of features called the maximal-separating-cone, where within-class features lie in a cone of nontrivial radius instead of collapsing to the class mean, and cones of different classes are maximally separated. We present a technique based on classifier weight and training loss design to produce such an arrangement. Experimentally we demonstrate an improved fine-grained classification performance with a feature extractor pretrained by our method. Moreover, our technique also provides benefits for the classification on data with long-tail distribution over classes. Our work may motivate future efforts on the design of better geometric arrangements of deep features."}}

Most models require enormous resources during training, both in terms of computation and in human labeling effort. We show that we can identify informative and diverse subsets of data that lead to deep learning models with similar performance as the ones trained with the original dataset. Prior methods have exploited diversity and uncertainty in submodular objective functions for choosing subsets. In addition to these measures, we show that balancing constraints on predicted class labels and decision boundaries are beneficial. We propose a novel formulation of these constraints using matroids, an algebraic structure that generalizes linear independence in vector spaces, and present an efficient greedy algorithm with constant approximation guarantees. We outperform competing baselines on standard classification datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, as well as long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR-100-LT."}}

Although conventional deep networks use an abundance of nonlinearity for representation (embedding) learning, they almost universally use a linear classifier on the learned embeddings. This is suboptimal since better nonlinear classifiers could exist in the same embedding vector space. We advocate a nonlinear kernelized classification layer for deep networks to tackle this problem. We theoretically show that our classification layer optimizes over all possible kernel functions on the space of embeddings to learn an optimal nonlinear classifier. We then demonstrate the usefulness of this layer in learning more model-efficient classifiers in a number of computer vision and natural language processing tasks."}}

There are two broad flavours of such models:  cross-attention (CA) models, which learn a joint embedding for the query and document, and dual-encoder (DE) models, which learn separate embeddings for the query and document. Empirically, CA models are often found to be more accurate, which has motivated a series of works seeking to bridge this gap. However, a more fundamental question remains less explored:  does this performance gap reflect an inherent limitation in the capacity of DE models, or a limitation in the training of such models? And does such an understanding suggest a principled means of improving DE models? In this paper, we study these questions, with three contributions. First, we establish theoretically that with a sufficiently large embedding dimension, DE models have the capacity to model a broad class of score distributions. Second, we show empirically that on real-world problems,  DE models may overfit to spurious correlations in the training set, and thus under-perform on test samples. To mitigate this behaviour, we propose a suitable distillation strategy, and confirm its practical efficacy on the MSMARCO-Passage and Natural Questions benchmarks."}}

This poses a challenge for generalisation on such labels, and also  makes naive learning biased towards dominant labels. In this paper,  we present a statistical framework that unifies and generalises several recent proposals to cope with these challenges. Our framework revisits the classic idea of logit adjustment based on the label frequencies, which encourages a large relative margin between logits of rare positive versus dominant negative labels. This yields two techniques  for long-tail learning, where such adjustment is either applied post-hoc to a trained model, or enforced in the loss during training. These techniques are statistically grounded, and practically effective on four real-world datasets with long-tailed label distributions. "}}

Most segmentation systems include a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to produce a structured output that is consistent with the image\u2019s visual features. Recent deep learning approaches have incorporated CRFs into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with some even training the CRF end-to-end with the rest of the network. However, these approaches have not employed higher order potentials, which have previously been shown to significantly improve segmentation performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that two types of higher order potential, based on object detections and superpixels, can be included in a CRF embedded within a deep network. We design these higher order potentials to allow inference with the differentiable mean field algorithm. As a result, all the parameters of our richer CRF model can be learned end-to-end with our pixelwise CNN classifier. We achieve state-of-the-art segmentation performance on the PASCAL VOC benchmark with these trainable higher order potentials."}}

Recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities of deep learning techniques for image recognition to tackle pixel-level labelling tasks. One central issue in this methodology is the limited capacity of deep learning techniques to delineate visual objects. To solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)-based probabilistic graphical modelling. To this end, we formulate Conditional Random Fields with Gaussian pairwise potentials and mean-field approximate inference as Recurrent Neural Networks. This network, called CRF-RNN, is then plugged in as a part of a CNN to obtain a deep network that has desirable properties of both CNNs and CRFs. Importantly, our system fully integrates CRF modelling with CNNs, making it possible to train the whole deep network end-to-end with the usual back-propagation algorithm, avoiding offline post-processing methods for object delineation. We apply the proposed method to the problem of semantic image segmentation, obtaining top results on the challenging Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark."}}

In many computer vision problems, the data can be naturally represented as points on a Riemannian manifold. Due to the non-Euclidean geometry of Riemannian manifolds, usual Euclidean computer vision and machine learning algorithms yield inferior results on such data. In this paper, we define Gaussian radial basis function (RBF)-based positive definite kernels on manifolds that permit us to embed a given manifold with a corresponding metric in a high dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space. These kernels make it possible to utilize algorithms developed for linear spaces on nonlinear manifold-valued data. Since the Gaussian RBF defined with any given metric is not always positive definite, we present a unified framework for analyzing the positive definiteness of the Gaussian RBF on a generic metric space. We then use the proposed framework to identify positive definite kernels on two specific manifolds commonly encountered in computer vision: the Riemannian manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices and the Grassmann manifold, i.e., the Riemannian manifold of linear subspaces of a Euclidean space. We show that many popular algorithms designed for Euclidean spaces, such as support vector machines, discriminant analysis and principal component analysis can be generalized to Riemannian manifolds with the help of such positive definite Gaussian kernels."}}
