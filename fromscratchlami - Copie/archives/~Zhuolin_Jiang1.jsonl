We try to make the effects of mislabeled training better understood through analysis of the basic model and equations that characterize the problem. This includes results about the ability of the noisy model to make the same decisions as the clean model and the effects of noise on model performance. In addition to providing better insights we also are able to show that the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimate of the parameters of the noisy model determine those of the clean model. This property is obtained through the use of the ML invariance property and leads to an approach to developing a classifier when training has been mislabeled: namely train the classifier on noisy data and adjust the decision threshold based on the noise levels and/or class priors. We show how our approach to mislabeled training works with multi-layered perceptrons (MLPs)."}}

Bag-of-words or tf-idf based sentence similarity uses exact word matching, but fails to measure the semantic similarity between individual words or to consider the semantic structure of sentences. In order to improve the similarity measure between sentences, we employ off-the-shelf deep embedding features and tf-idf features, and introduce a new text similarity metric. An improved sentence similarity graph is built and used in a submodular objective function for extractive summarization, which consists of a weighted coverage term and a diversity term. A Transformer based compression model is developed for sentence compression to aid in document summarization. Our summarization approach is extractive and unsupervised. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can outperform the tf-idf based approach and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the DUC04 dataset, and comparable performance to the fully supervised learning methods on the CNN/DM and NYT datasets."}}

In this paper, we extend the state-of the-art of training classifiers to jointly deal with both forms of errorful data. We accomplish this by modeling noisy and missing labels in multi-label images with a new Noise Modeling Network (NMN) that follows our convolutional neural network (CNN), integrates with it, forming an end-to-end deep learning system, which can jointly learn the noise distribution and CNN parameters. The NMN learns the distribution of noise patterns directly from the noisy data without the need for any clean training data. The NMN can model label noise that depends only on the true label or is also dependent on the image features. We show that the integrated NMN/CNN learning system consistently improves the classification performance, for different levels of label noise, on the MSR-COCO dataset and MSR-VTT dataset. We also show that noise performance improvements are obtained when multiple instance learning methods are used."}}

Data augmentation techniques have become an essential part of modern speech recognition training. Yet, they are simple, naive, and rarely reflect real-world conditions. Meanwhile, speech synthesis techniques have been rapidly getting closer to the goal of achieving human-like speech. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using synthesized speech as a form of data augmentation to lower the resources necessary to build a speech recognizer. We experiment with three different kinds of synthesizers: statistical parametric, neural, and adversarial. Our findings are interesting and point to new research directions for the future."}}

The model estimates better probabilities for word translations than automatic word alignments alone, and generalizes to unseen source-target word pairs. We further improve the lexical neural translation model (and subsequently CLIR), by incorporating source word context, and by encoding the character sequences of input source words to generate translations of out-of-vocabulary words. To be effective, neural network models typically need training on large amounts of data labeled directly on the final task, in this case relevance to queries. In contrast, our approach only requires parallel data to train the translation model, and uses an unsupervised model to compute CLIR relevance scores.\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                        We report results on the retrieval of text and speech documents from three morphologically complex languages with limited training data resources (Swahili, Tagalog, and Somali) and short English queries. Despite training on only about 2M words of parallel training data for each language, we obtain neural network translation models that are very effective for this task. We also obtain further improvements using (i) a modified relevance model, which uses the probability of occurrence of a translation of each query term in the source document, and (ii) confusion networks (instead of 1-best output) that encode multiple transcription alternatives in the output of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system.\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                        We achieve overall MAP relative improvements of up to 24% on Swahili, 50% on Tagalog, and 39% on Somali over the baseline probabilistic model, and larger improvements over monolingual retrieval from machine translation output."}}
