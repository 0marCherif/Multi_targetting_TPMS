End-to-end modeling of speech summarization models is challenging due to memory and compute constraints arising from long input audio sequences. Recent work in document summarization has inspired methods to reduce the complexity of self-attentions, which enables transformer models to handle long sequences. In this work, we introduce a single model optimized end-to-end for speech summarization. We apply the restricted self-attention technique from text-based models to speech models to address the memory and compute constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed model learns to directly summarize speech for the How-2 corpus of instructional videos. The proposed end-to-end model outperforms the previously proposed cascaded model by 3 points absolute on ROUGE. Further, we consider the spoken language understanding task of predicting concepts from speech inputs and show that the proposed end-to-end model outperforms the cascade model by 4 points absolute F-1."}}

Instead, potential noise sources are visible on screen with the camera emulating the off-screen speaker's view of the outside world. This setting is different from prior work in audio-visual speech enhancement that relies on lip and facial visuals. In this paper, we first demonstrate that egocentric visual information is helpful for noise suppression. We compare object recognition and action classification-based visual feature extractors and investigate methods to align audio and visual representations. Then, we examine different fusion strategies for the aligned features, and locations within the noise suppression model to incorporate visual information. Experiments demonstrate that visual features are most helpful when used to generate additive correction masks. Finally, in order to ensure that the visual features are discriminative with respect to different noise types, we introduce a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes audio-visual noise suppression and video-based acoustic event detection. This proposed multi-task framework outperforms the audio-only baseline on all metrics, including a 0.16 PESQ improvement. Extensive ablations reveal the improved performance of the proposed model with multiple active distractors, overall noise types, and across different SNRs."}}

Accordingly, models that have been proposed for emotion detection use one or the other of these label types. However, psychologists like Russell and Plutchik have proposed theories and models that unite these views, maintaining that these representations have shared and complementary information. This paper is an attempt to validate these viewpoints computationally. To this end, we propose a model to jointly predict continuous and discrete emotional attributes and show how the relationship between these can be utilized to improve the robustness and performance of emotion recognition tasks. Our approach comprises multi-task and hierarchical multi-task learning frameworks that jointly model the relationships between continuous-valued and discrete emotion labels. Experimental results on two widely used datasets (IEMOCAP and MSPPodcast) for speech-based emotion recognition show that our model results in statistically significant improvements in performance over strong baselines with non-unified approaches. We also demonstrate that using one type of label (discrete or continuous-valued) for training improves recognition performance in tasks that use the other type of label. Experimental results and reasoning for this approach (called the mismatched training approach) are also presented."}}

Self-attentions, which are crucial contributors to this performance have quadratic computational complexity, which makes training on longer input sequences challenging. Prior work has produced state-of-the-art transformer variants with linear attention, however, current models sacrifice performance to achieve efficient implementations. In this work, we develop a novel linear transformer by examining the properties of the key-query product within self-attentions. Our model outperforms state of the art approaches on speech recognition and speech summarization, resulting in 1 % absolute WER improvement on the Librispeech-100 speech recognition benchmark and a new INTERVIEW speech recognition benchmark, and 5 points on ROUGE for summarization with How2."}}

In particular, there are not nearly as many SLU task benchmarks, and many of the existing ones use data that is not freely available to all researchers. Recent work has begun to introduce such benchmark datasets for several tasks. In this work, we introduce several new annotated SLU benchmark tasks based on freely available speech data, which complement existing benchmarks and address gaps in the SLU evaluation landscape. We contribute four tasks: question answering and summarization involve inference over longer speech sequences; named entity localization addresses the speech-specific task of locating the targeted content in the signal; dialog act classification identifies the function of a given speech utterance. We follow the blueprint of the Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE) benchmark suite. In order to facilitate the development of SLU models that leverage the success of pre-trained speech representations, we will be publishing for each task (i) annotations for a relatively small fine-tuning set, (ii) annotated development and test sets, and (iii) baseline models for easy reproducibility and comparisons. In this work, we present the details of data collection and annotation and the performance of the baseline models. We also perform sensitivity analysis of pipeline models' performance (speech recognizer + text model) to the speech recognition accuracy, using more than 20 state-of-the-art speech recognition models."}}

The method of choice utilized a combination of spectro-temporal modulation and self-supervised features, followed by an encoder-decoder network organized in a multitask paradigm. We evaluate the complementarity between the tasks posed by examining independent task-specific and joint models, and explore the relative strengths of different feature sets. We also introduce a simple score fusion mechanism to leverage the complementarity of different feature sets for this task. We find that robust data preprocessing in conjunction with score fusion over spectro-temporal receptive field and HuBERT models achieved our best ExVo-MultiTask test score of 0.412."}}
