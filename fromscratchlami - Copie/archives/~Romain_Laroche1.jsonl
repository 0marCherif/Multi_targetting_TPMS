Recent contributions relying on deep learning methods focused on agents communicating via an idealized communication channel, where utterances produced by a speaker are directly perceived by a listener. This comes in contrast with human communication, which instead relies on a sensory-motor channel, where motor commands produced by the speaker (e.g. vocal or gestural articulators) result in sensory effects perceived by the listener (e.g. audio or visual). Here, we investigate if agents can evolve a shared language when they are equipped with a continuous sensory-motor system to produce and perceive signs, e.g. drawings. To this end, we introduce the Graphical Referential Game (GREG) where a speaker must produce a graphical utterance to name a visual referent object consisting of combinations of MNIST digits while a listener has to select the corresponding object among distractor referents, given the produced message. The utterances are drawing images produced using dynamical motor primitives combined with a sketching library. To tackle GREG we present CURVES: a multimodal contrastive deep learning mechanism that represents the energy (alignment) between named referents and utterances generated through gradient ascent on the learned energy landscape. We, then, present a set of experiments and metrics based on a systematic compositional dataset to evaluate the resulting language. We show that our method allows the emergence of a shared, graphical language with compositional properties"}}

This requirement restricts the algorithms derived in that work to the tabular and linear settings where such estimates exist. In this work, we develop a novel method for incorporating scalable uncertainty estimates into an offline reinforcement learning algorithm called deep-SPIBB that extends the SPIBB family of algorithms to environments with larger state and action spaces. We use recent innovations in uncertainty estimation from the deep learning community to get more scalable uncertainty estimates to plug into deep-SPIBB. While these uncertainty estimates do not allow for the same theoretical guarantees as in the tabular case, we argue that the SPIBB mechanism for incorporating uncertainty is more robust and flexible than pessimistic approaches that incorporate the uncertainty as a value function penalty. We bear this out empirically, showing that deep-SPIBB outperforms pessimism based approaches with access to the same uncertainty estimates and performs at least on par with a variety of other strong baselines across several environments and datasets."}}

It follows that the performance of the target policy is strongly related to the performance of the behavior policy and, thus, the trajectory return distribution of the dataset. We show that in mixed datasets consisting of mostly low-return trajectories and minor high-return trajectories, state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms are overly restrained by low-return trajectories and fail to exploit high-performing trajectories to the fullest. To overcome this issue, we show that, in deterministic MDPs with stochastic initial states, the dataset sampling can be re-weighted to induce an artificial dataset whose behavior policy has a higher return. This re-weighted sampling strategy may be combined with any offline RL algorithm. We further analyze that the opportunity for performance improvement over the behavior policy correlates with the positive-sided variance of the returns of the trajectories in the dataset. We empirically show that while CQL, IQL, and TD3+BC achieve only a part of this potential policy improvement, these same algorithms combined with our reweighted sampling strategy fully exploit the dataset. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that, despite its theoretical limitation, the approach may still be efficient in stochastic environments. "}}

Past works have proposed common workarounds based on the pre-training of state representations, followed by policy training. In this work, we introduce a simple, yet effective approach for learning state representations. Our method, Behavior Prior Representation (BPR), learns state representations with an easy-to-integrate objective based on behavior cloning of the dataset: we first learn a state representation by mimicking actions from the dataset, and then train a policy on top of the fixed representation, using any off-the-shelf Offline RL algorithm. Theoretically, we prove that BPR carries out performance guarantees when integrated into algorithms that have either policy improvement guarantees (conservative algorithms) or produce lower bounds of the policy values (pessimistic algorithms). Empirically, we show that BPR combined with existing state-of-the-art Offline RL algorithms leads to significant improvements across several offline control benchmarks.

How to \\textit{specify} and \\textit{ground} these goals in such a way that we can both reliably reach goals during training as well as generalize to new goals during evaluation remains an open area of research. Defining goals in the space of noisy, high-dimensional sensory inputs is one possibility, yet this poses a challenge for training goal-conditioned agents, or even for generalization to novel goals. We propose to address this by learning compositional representations of goals and processing the resulting representation via a discretization bottleneck, for coarser specification of goals, through an approach we call DGRL. We show that discretizing outputs from goal encoders through a bottleneck can work well in goal-conditioned RL setups, by experimentally evaluating this method on tasks ranging from maze environments to complex robotic navigation and manipulation tasks. Additionally, we show a theoretical result which bounds the expected return for goals not observed during training, while still allowing for specifying goals with expressive combinatorial structure."}}

RCSL algorithms learn the distribution of actions conditioned on both the state and the return of the trajectory. Then they define a policy by conditioning on achieving high return. In this paper, we provide a rigorous study of the capabilities and limitations of RCSL something which is crucially missing in previous work. We find that RCSL returns the optimal policy under a set of assumptions that are stronger than those needed for the more traditional dynamic programming-based algorithms. We provide specific examples of MDPs and datasets that illustrate the necessity of these assumptions and the limits of RCSL. Finally, we present empirical evidence that these limitations will also cause issues in practice by providing illustrative experiments in simple point-mass environments and on datasets from the D4RL benchmark."}}

However, little is know about how fast SARSA converges to that region and how large the region is. In this paper, we make progress towards solving this open problem by showing the convergence rate of projected SARSA to a bounded region. Importantly, the region is much smaller than the ball used for projection provided that the the magnitude of the reward is not too large. Our analysis applies to expected SARSA as well as SARSA($\\lambda$). Existing works regarding the convergence of linear SARSA to a fixed point all require the Lipschitz constant of SARSA's policy improvement operator to be sufficiently small; our analysis instead applies to arbitrary Lipschitz constants and thus characterizes the behavior of linear SARSA for a new regime."}}

As a consequence, the learning targets evolve with time and the policy optimization process must be efficient at unlearning what it previously learnt. In this paper, we discover that the policy gradient theorem prescribes policy updates that are slow to unlearn because of their structural symmetry with respect to the value target. To increase the unlearning speed, we study a novel policy update: the gradient of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the action maximizing $q$, but find that such updates may lead to a decrease in value. Consequently, we introduce a modified policy update devoid of that flaw, and prove its guarantees of convergence to global optimality in $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-1})$ under classic assumptions. Further, we assess standard policy updates and our cross-entropy policy updates along six analytical dimensions. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings."}}

To measure expressiveness, we propose to use the Intrinsic Dimension (ID) of the dataset in representation space. Inspired by the human study of Laina et al. (2020), we introduce Cluster Learnability (CL), defined in terms of the learning speed of a KNN classifier trained to predict K-means cluster labels for held-out representations. By collecting 30 state-of-art checkpoints, both supervised and self-supervised, using different architectures, we show that ID and CL can be combined to predict downstream classification performance better than the existing techniques based on contrastive losses or pretext tasks, while having no requirements on data augmentation, model architecture or human labels. To further demonstrate the utility of our framework, we propose modifying DeepCluster (Caron et al., 2018) to improve the learnability of the representations. Using our modification, we are able to outperform DeepCluster on both STL10 and ImageNet benchmarks. The performance of the intermediate checkpoints can also be well predicted under our framework, suggesting the possibility of developing new SSL algorithms without labels."}}
