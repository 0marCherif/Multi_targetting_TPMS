To address the problem, we propose an algorithm named REALS for robust and efficient batch image alignment through simultaneous transformation and low rank and sparse decomposition. REALS is constructed upon our finding that the low rank subspace can be recovered via linear projection, which allows us to perform simultaneous image alignment and decomposition with gradient-based updates.REALS achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in terms of accuracy and speed compared to the state-of-the-art robust image alignment algorithms.

Based on the interpretation that animals have gained their cognitive functions such as object recognition \u2014 without ever being specifically trained for \u2014 as a result of maximizing their fitness to the environment, we place our agent in a custom environment where developing certain functions may facilitate decision making; the custom environment is designed as a partially observable Markov decision process in which an input image and the initial value of hidden variables are given to the agent at each time step. We show that our agent, which consists of a convolutional neural network, a recurrent neural network, and a multilayer perceptron, learns to classify the input image and to predict the hidden variables. The experimental results show that high level functions, such as image classification and hidden variable estimation, can be naturally and simultaneously induced without any pre-training or specifying them."}}
