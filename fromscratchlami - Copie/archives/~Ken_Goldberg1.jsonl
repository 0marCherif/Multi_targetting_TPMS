Our model, called RPT, is a Transformer that operates on sequences of sensorimotor tokens. Given a sequence of camera images, proprioceptive robot states, and actions, we encode the sequence into tokens, mask out a subset, and train a model to predict the missing content from the rest. We hypothesize that if a robot can predict the masked-out content it will have acquired a good model of the physical world that can enable it to act. RPT is designed to operate on latent visual representations which makes prediction tractable, enables scaling to larger models, and allows fast inference on a real robot. To evaluate our approach, we collected a dataset of 20,000 real-world trajectories over 9 months using a combination of motion planning and grasping algorithms. We find that sensorimotor pre-training consistently outperforms training from scratch, has favorable scaling properties, and enables transfer across different tasks, environments, and robots."}}

We propose LERF-TOGO, Language Embedded Radiance Fields for Task-Oriented Grasping of Objects, which uses vision-language models zero-shot to output a grasp distribution over an object given a natural language query. To accomplish this, we first construct a LERF of the scene, which distills CLIP embeddings into a multi-scale 3D language field queryable with text. However, LERF has no sense of object boundaries, so its relevancy outputs often return incomplete activations over an object which are insufficient for grasping. LERF-TOGO mitigates this lack of spatial grouping by extracting a 3D object mask via DINO features and then conditionally querying LERF on this mask to obtain a semantic distribution over the object to rank grasps from an off-the-shelf grasp planner. We evaluate LERF-TOGO\u2019s ability to grasp task-oriented object parts on 31 physical objects, and find it selects grasps on the correct part in 81% of trials and grasps successfully in 69%.

As objects are often organized semantically, we conjecture that semantic information about object relationships can facilitate mechanical search and reduce search time. Large pretrained vision and language models (VLMs and LLMs) have shown promise in generalizing to uncommon objects and previously unseen real-world environments. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Semantic Mechanical Search (SMS). SMS conducts scene understanding and generates a semantic occupancy distribution explicitly using LLMs. Compared to methods that rely on visual similarities offered by CLIP embeddings, SMS leverages the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Unlike prior work that uses VLMs and LLMs as end-to-end planners, which may not integrate well with specialized geometric planners, SMS can serve as a plug-in semantic module for downstream manipulation or navigation policies. For mechanical search in closed-world settings such as shelves, we compare with a geometric-based planner and show that SMS improves mechanical search performance by 24% across the pharmacy, kitchen, and office domains in simulation and 47.1% in physical experiments. For open-world real environments, SMS can produce better semantic distributions compared to CLIP-based methods, with the potential to be integrated with downstream navigation policies to improve object navigation tasks.

For long deformable linear objects (DLOs or simply cables) with many (over 25) crossings, we present HANDLOOM (Heterogeneous Autoregressive Learned Deformable Linear Object Observation and Manipulation) a learning-based algorithm that fits a trace to a greyscale image of cables. We evaluate HANDLOOM on semi-planar DLO configurations where each crossing involves at most 2 segments. HANDLOOM makes use of neural networks trained with 30,000 simulated examples and 568 real examples to autoregressively estimate traces of cables and classify crossings. Experiments find that in settings with multiple identical cables, HANDLOOM can trace each cable with 80% accuracy. In single-cable images, HANDLOOM can trace and identify knots with 77% accuracy. When HANDLOOM is incorporated into a bimanual robot system, it enables state-based imitation of knot tying with 80% accuracy, and it successfully untangles 64% of cable configurations across 3 levels of difficulty. Additionally, HANDLOOM demonstrates generalization to knot types and materials (rubber, cloth rope) not present in the training dataset with 85% accuracy.

Interactive fleet learning (IFL) mitigates distribution shift by allowing robots to access remote human supervisors during task execution and learn from them over time, but different supervisors may demonstrate the task in different ways. Recent work proposes Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC), which is able to represent multimodal demonstrations using energy-based models (EBMs). In this work, we propose Implicit Interactive Fleet Learning (IIFL), an algorithm that builds on IBC for interactive imitation learning from multiple heterogeneous human supervisors. A key insight in IIFL is a novel approach for uncertainty quantification in EBMs using Jeffreys divergence. While IIFL is more computationally expensive than explicit methods, results suggest that IIFL achieves a 2.8x higher success rate in simulation experiments and a 4.5x higher return on human effort in a physical block pushing task over (Explicit) IFL, IBC, and other baselines."}}

Suction grasp planners often target planar surfaces on point clouds near the estimated centroid of an object. In this paper, we propose a compliant suction contact model that computes the quality of the seal between the suction cup and local target surface and a measure of the ability of the suction grasp to resist an external gravity wrench. To characterize grasps, we estimate robustness to perturbations in end-effector and object pose, material properties, and external wrenches. We analyze grasps across 1,500 3D object models to generate Dex-Net 3.0, a dataset of 2.8 million point clouds, suction grasps, and grasp robustness labels. We use Dex-Net 3.0 to train a Grasp Quality Convolutional Neural Network (GQ-CNN) to classify robust suction targets in point clouds containing a single object. We evaluate the resulting system in 350 physical trials on an ABB YuMi fitted with a pneumatic suction gripper. When evaluated on novel objects that we categorize as Basic (prismatic or cylindrical), Typical (more complex geometry), and Adversarial (with few available suction-grasp points) Dex-Net 3.0 achieves success rates of 98%, 82%, and 58% respectively, improving to 81% in the latter case when the training set includes only adversarial objects.

We consider dense (tight) knots that lack space between self-intersections and present an iterative approach that uses learned geometric structure in configurations. We instantiate this into an algorithm, HULK: Hierarchical Untangling from Learned Keypoints, which combines learning-based perception with a geometric planner into a policy that guides a bilateral robot to untangle knots. To evaluate the policy, we perform experiments both in a novel simulation environment modelling cables with varied knot types and textures and in a physical system using the da Vinci surgical robot. We find that HULK is able to untangle cables with dense figure-eight and overhand knots and generalize to varied textures and appearances. We compare two variants of HULK to three baselines and observe that HULK achieves 43.3% higher success rates on a physical system compared to the next best baseline. HULK successfully untangles a cable from a dense initial configuration containing up to two overhand and figure-eight knots in 97.9% of 378 simulation experiments with an average of 12.1 actions per trial. In physical experiments, HULK achieves 61.7% untangling success, averaging 8.48 actions per trial. "}}

We formalize the problem of disentangling multiple cables and present an algorithm, Iterative Reduction Of Non-planar Multiple cAble kNots (IRON-MAN), that outputs robot actions to remove crossings from multi-cable knotted structures. IRONMAN uses a learned perception system inspired by prior work in single-cable untying to imitate a graph-based supervisor, and operates on RGB image inputs of the workspace. Given a sequence of images as input, the system can disentangle twocable twists, three-cable braids, and knots of two or three cables, such as overhand, square, carrick bend, sheet bend, crown, and fisherman\u2019s knots. IRON-MAN keeps track of task-relevant keypoints corresponding to cable endpoints and crossings and iteratively disentangles the cables by identifying and undoing crossings that are critical to knot structure. Using a da Vinci surgical robot, we experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of IRON-MAN on disentangling multi-cable knots of types that appear in the training data, as well as generalizing to novel classes of multi-cable knots. Results suggest that IRON-MAN is effective in disentangling knots involving up to three cables with 80.5% success and generalizing to knot types that are not present during training, with cables of identical or distinct colors.

This work focuses on semi-planar knots, which are knots composed of crossings that each include at most 2 cable segments. We conduct experiments on long cables (3 m in length) with up to 15 semi-planar crossings across 6 different knot types. Crops of crossings from 3 knots (overhand, figure 8, and bowline) of the 6 are seen during training, but none of the full knots are seen during training. This is an improvement from prior work on long cables that can only untangle 2 knot types. Experiments find that in settings with multiple identical cables, TUSK can trace a single cable with 81% accuracy on 7 new knot types. In single-cable images, TUSK can trace and identify the correct knot with 77% success on 3 new knot types.
