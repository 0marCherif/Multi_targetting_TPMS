Directly applying off-policy RL algorithms to offline datasets typically suffers from the distributional shift issue and fails to obtain a reliable value estimation for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To this end, several methods penalize the value function with uncertainty quantification and achieve tremendous success from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. However, such uncertainty-based methods typically require estimating the lower confidence bound (LCB) of the $Q$-function based on a large number of ensemble networks, which is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a lightweight uncertainty quantifier based on approximate Bayesian inference in the last layer of the $Q$-network, which estimates the Bayesian posterior with minimal parameters in addition to the ordinary $Q$-network. We then obtain the uncertainty quantification by the disagreement of the $Q$-posterior. Moreover, to avoid mode collapse in OOD samples and improve diversity in the $Q$-posterior, we introduce a repulsive force for OOD predictions in training. We show that our method recovers the provably efficient LCB-penalty under linear MDP assumptions. We further compare our method with other baselines on the D4RL benchmark. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most tasks with more lightweight uncertainty quantifiers."}}

However, successful offline RL often relies heavily on the coverage and quality of the given dataset. In scenarios where the dataset for a specific task is limited, a natural approach is to improve offline RL with datasets from other tasks, namely, to conduct Multi-Task Data Sharing (MTDS). Nevertheless, directly sharing datasets from other tasks exacerbates the distribution shift in offline RL. As a remedy, previous attempts share only partial data that maximizes a conservative value function. However, such attempts are inefficient in calculating the policy constraints and abandon a large portion of datasets, which could be potentially informative. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-based MTDS approach that shares the entire dataset without data selection. We further provide theoretical analysis, which shows that the optimality gap of our method is only related to the expected data coverage of the shared dataset, thus resolving the distribution shift issue in data sharing. Empirically, we construct an MTDS benchmark and collect datasets from three challenging domains. The experimental results show our algorithm outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in challenging MTDS problems."}}

Due to the distribution shift issue, current offline RL algorithms are generally designed to be conservative in value estimation and action selection. However, such conservatism can impair the robustness of learned policies when encountering observation deviation under realistic conditions, such as sensor errors and adversarial attacks. To trade off robustness and conservatism, we propose Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning (RORL) with a novel conservative smoothing technique. In RORL, we explicitly introduce regularization on the policy and the value function for states near the dataset, as well as additional conservative value estimation on these states. Theoretically, we show RORL enjoys a tighter suboptimality bound than recent theoretical results in linear MDPs. We demonstrate that RORL can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the general offline RL benchmark and is considerably robust to adversarial observation perturbations."}}

Directly applying off-policy algorithms to offline RL usually fails due to the extrapolation error caused by the out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Previous methods tackle such problem by penalizing the Q-values of OOD actions or constraining the trained policy to be close to the behavior policy. Nevertheless, such methods typically prevent the generalization of value functions beyond the offline data and also lack precise characterization of OOD data. In this paper, we propose Pessimistic Bootstrapping for offline RL (PBRL), a purely uncertainty-driven offline algorithm without explicit policy constraints. Specifically, PBRL conducts uncertainty quantification via the disagreement of bootstrapped Q-functions, and performs pessimistic updates by penalizing the value function based on the estimated uncertainty. To tackle the extrapolating error, we further propose a novel OOD sampling method. We show that such OOD sampling and pessimistic bootstrapping yields provable uncertainty quantifier in linear MDPs, thus providing the theoretical underpinning for PBRL. Extensive experiments on D4RL benchmark show that PBRL has better performance compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms."}}

Based on the DB model, we further propose DB-bonus, which encourages the agent to explore state-action pairs with high information gain. We establish theoretical connections between the proposed DB-bonus, the upper confidence bound (UCB) for linear case, and the visiting count for tabular case. We evaluate the proposed method on Atari suits with dynamics-irrelevant noises. Our experiments show that exploration with DB bonus outperforms several state-of-the-art exploration methods in noisy environments."}}

However, such an approach is challenging in developing practical exploration algorithms for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). To address this problem, we propose an Optimistic Exploration algorithm with Backward Bootstrapped Bonus (OEB3) for DRL by following these two principles. OEB3 is built on bootstrapped deep $Q$-learning, a non-parametric posterior sampling method for temporally-extended exploration. Based on such a temporally-extended exploration, we construct an UCB-bonus indicating the uncertainty of $Q$-functions. The UCB-bonus is further utilized to estimate an optimistic $Q$-value, which encourages the agent to explore the scarcely visited states and actions to reduce uncertainty. In the estimation of $Q$-function, we adopt an episodic backward update strategy to propagate the future uncertainty to the estimated $Q$-function consistently. Extensive evaluations show that OEB3 outperforms several state-of-the-art exploration approaches in Mnist maze and 49 Atari games."}}
