We study nonconvex ERM, which takes the form of minimizing a finite-sum of nonconvex loss functions over a training set. We propose a new differentially private stochastic gradient descent algorithm for nonconvex ERM that achieves strong privacy guarantees efficiently, and provide a tight analysis of its privacy and utility guarantees, as well as its gradient complexity. Our algorithm reduces gradient complexity while matching the best-known utility guarantee. Our experiments on benchmark nonconvex ERM problems demonstrate superior performance in terms of both training cost and utility gains compared with previous differentially private methods using the same privacy budgets."}}

One natural example is the \"Smart Reply\" application where a pre-trained model is tuned to provide suggested responses for a given query message. Since these models are often tuned using sensitive data such as emails or chat transcripts, it is important to understand and mitigate the risk that the model leaks its tuning data. We investigate potential information leakage vulnerabilities in a typical Smart Reply pipeline and introduce a new type of active extraction attack that exploits canonical patterns in text containing sensitive data. We show experimentally that it is possible for an adversary to extract sensitive user information present in the training data. We explore potential mitigation strategies and demonstrate empirically how differential privacy appears to be an effective defense mechanism to such pattern extraction attacks."}}

First, we consider skewed priors, to cover cases such as when only a small fraction of the candidate pool targeted by the adversary are actually members and develop a PPV-based metric suitable for this setting. This setting is more realistic than the balanced prior setting typically considered by researchers. Second, we consider adversaries that select inference thresholds according to their attack goals and develop a threshold selection procedure that improves inference attacks. Since previous inference attacks fail in imbalanced prior setting, we develop a new inference attack based on the intuition that inputs corresponding to training set members will be near a local minimum in the loss function, and show that an attack that combines this with thresholds on the per-instance loss can achieve high PPV even in settings where other attacks appear to be ineffective.

However, implementations of privacy-preserving machine learning often select large values of $\\epsilon$ in order to get acceptable utility of the model, with little understanding of the impact of such choices on meaningful privacy. Moreover, in scenarios where iterative learning procedures are used, differential privacy variants that offer tighter analyses are used which appear to reduce the needed privacy budget but present poorly understood trade-offs between privacy and utility. In this paper, we quantify the impact of these choices on privacy in experiments with logistic regression and neural network models. Our main finding is that there is a huge gap between the upper bounds on privacy loss that can be guaranteed, even with advanced mechanisms, and the effective privacy loss that can be measured using current inference attacks. Current mechanisms for differentially private machine learning rarely offer acceptable utility-privacy trade-offs with guarantees for complex learning tasks: settings that provide limited accuracy loss provide meaningless privacy guarantees, and settings that provide strong privacy guarantees result in useless models.
