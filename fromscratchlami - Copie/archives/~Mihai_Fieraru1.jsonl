And where should I improve? Ah, my back hurts slightly... User engagement can be sustained and injuries avoided by being able to reconstruct 3d human pose and motion, relate it to good training practices, identify errors, and provide early, real-time feedback. In this paper we introduce the first automatic system, AIFit, that performs 3d human sensing for fitness training. The system can be used at home, outdoors, or at the gym. AIFit is able to reconstruct 3d human pose and motion, reliably segment exercise repetitions, and identify in real-time the deviations between standards learnt from trainers, and the execution of a trainee. As a result, localized, quantitative feedback for correct execution of exercises, reduced risk of injury, and continuous improvement is possible. To support research and evaluation, we introduce the first large scale dataset, Fit3D, containing over 3 million images and corresponding 3d human shape and motion capture ground truth configurations, with over 37 repeated exercises, covering all the major muscle groups, performed by instructors and trainees. Our statistical coach is governed by a global parameter that captures how critical it should be of a trainee's performance. This is an important aspect that helps adapt to a student's level of fitness (i.e. beginner vs. advanced vs. expert), or to the expected accuracy of a 3d pose reconstruction method. We show that, for different values of the global parameter, our feedback system based on 3d pose estimates achieves good accuracy compared to the one based on ground-truth motion capture. Our statistical coach offers feedback in natural language, and with spatio-temporal visual grounding."}}

Existing 3d reconstruction methods do not focus on body regions in self-contact and consequently recover configurations that are either far from each other or self-intersecting, when they should just touch. This leads to perceptually incorrect estimates and limits impact in those very fine-grained analysis domains where detailed 3d models are expected to play an important role. To address such challenges we detect self-contact and design 3d losses to explicitly enforce it. Specifically, we develop a model for Self-Contact Prediction (SCP), that estimates the body surface signature of self-contact, leveraging the localization of self-contact in the image, during both training and inference. We collect two large datasets to support learning and evaluation: (1) HumanSC3D, an accurate 3d motion capture repository containing 1,032 sequences with 5,058 contact events and 1,246,487 ground truth 3d poses synchronized with images collected from multiple views, and (2) FlickrSC3D, a repository of 3,969 images, containing 25,297 surface-to-surface correspondences with annotated image spatial support. We also illustrate how more expressive 3d reconstructions can be recovered under self-contact signature constraints and present monocular detection of face-touch as one of the multiple applications made possible by more accurate self-contact models."}}

However, most of the existing models focus on analyzing a single person in isolation, and those who process several people focus largely on resolving multi-person data association, rather than inferring interactions. This may lead to incorrect, lifeless 3d estimates, that miss the subtle human contact aspects--the essence of the event--and are of little use for detailed behavioral understanding. This paper addresses such issues and makes several contributions: (1) we introduce models for interaction signature estimation (ISP) encompassing contact detection, segmentation, and 3d contact signature prediction; (2) we show how such components can be leveraged in order to produce augmented losses that ensure contact consistency during 3d reconstruction; (3) we construct several large datasets for learning and evaluating 3d contact prediction and reconstruction methods; specifically, we introduce CHI3D, a lab-based accurate 3d motion capture dataset with 631 sequences containing 2,525 contact events, 728,664 ground truth 3d poses, as well as FlickrCI3D, a dataset of 11,216 images, with 14,081 processed pairs of people, and 81,233 facet-level surface correspondences within 138,213 selected contact regions. Finally, (4) we present models and baselines to illustrate how contact estimation supports meaningful 3d reconstruction where essential interactions are captured.
