Most of the existing methods either start from a set of dictionary functions and then search for a subset that best fits the underlying nonlinear dynamics or they rely on machine learning algorithms to learn these observables. Instead of guessing or learning the observables, in this work we derive them in a systematic way for the quadrotor dynamics on SE(3). In addition, we prove that the proposed sequence of observables converges pointwise to the zero function, which allows us to select only a finite set of observables to form (an approximation of) the lifted space.

Koopman operator theory allows one to analyze nonlinear systems through the lens of linear systems and nonlinear control systems through the lens of bilinear control systems. The key idea of these methods lies in the transformation of the coordinates of the nonlinear system into the Koopman observables, which are coordinates that allow the representation of the original system (control system) as a higher dimensional linear (bilinear control) system. However, for nonlinear control systems, the bilinear control model obtained by applying Koopman operator based learning methods is not necessarily stabilizable. Simultaneous identification of stabilizable lifted bilinear control systems as well as the associated Koopman observables is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a framework to construct these stabilizable bilinear models and identify its associated observables from data by simultaneously learning a bilinear Koopman embedding for the underlying unknown control affine nonlinear system as well as a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) for the Koopman based bilinear model using a learner and falsifier. Our proposed approach thereby provides provable guarantees of asymptotic stability for the Koopman based representation of the unknown control affine nonlinear control system as a bilinear system. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the efficacy of our proposed class of stabilizing feedback controllers for unknown control-affine nonlinear systems."}}

For a given (generally time-varying) channel gain matrix, we provide formulas to compute (i) the mean-square estimation error attainable by the classical Kalman-Bucy filter, and (ii) the mutual information between the source process and its Kalman-Bucy estimate. We then formulate a novel \"optimal channel gain control problem\" where the objective is to control the channel gain matrix strategically to minimize the weighted sum of these two performance metrics. To develop insights into the optimal solution, we first consider the problem of controlling a time-varying channel gain over a finite time interval. A necessary optimality condition is derived based on Pontryagin's minimum principle. For a scalar system, we show that the optimal channel gain is a piece-wise constant signal with at most two switches. We also consider the problem of designing the optimal time-invariant gain to minimize the average cost over an infinite time horizon. A novel semidefinite programming (SDP) heuristic is proposed and the exactness of the solution is discussed."}}

Recognizing that a suitable directional sampling feature could potentially enhance the performance of the GSE algorithm further, this letter proposes two sampling schemes - basic and augmented directional sampling - and presents GSE-D and GSE-AD algorithms, respectively, as expansion over the GSE. These algorithms, by default, enjoy the advantages of the GSE. Both the directional sampling schemes enable drawing random sample points with more preference towards the direction of the Goal leading to lower cost of computed shortest path on an average. While the basic directional sampling strategy faces a drawback in computational time when obstacle density in the direction towards the Goal is high, the augmented directional sampling scheme is free of this limitation. Probabilistic analysis and extensive numerical simulation studies show the effectiveness of the GSE-D and GSE-AD in performance in terms of computational time efficiency and shortest path cost when compared with the GSE, other seminal and existing directional algorithms."}}

The problem of scheduling the sensor gain over a finite time interval to minimize the weighted sum of the data rate (the mutual information between the sensor output and the underlying Gauss-Markov process) and the distortion (the mean-square estimation error) is formulated as an optimal control problem. A necessary optimality condition for a scheduled sensor gain is derived based on Pontryagin's minimum principle. For a scalar problem, we show that an optimal sensor gain control is of bang-bang type, except the possibility of taking an intermediate value when there exists a stationary point on the switching surface in the phase space of canonical dynamics. Furthermore, we show that the number of switches is at most two and the time instants at which the optimal gain must be switched can be computed from the analytical solutions to the canonical equations."}}

In general, the Koopman operator is a linear infinite dimensional operator, which means that the derived linear state space model of the rigid body dynamics will be infinite-dimensional, which is not suitable for modeling and control design purposes. Recently, finite approximations of the operator computed by means of methods like the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) have shown promising results for different classes of problems. However, without using an appropriate set of observables in the EDMD approach, there can be no guarantees that the computed approximation of the nonlinear dynamics is sufficiently accurate. The major challenge in using the Koopman operator for constructing a linear state space model is the choice of observables. State-of-the-art methods in the field compute the approximations of the observables by using neural networks, standard radial basis functions (RBFs), polynomials or heuristic approximations of these functions. However, these observables might not providea sufficiently accurate approximation or representation of the dynamics. In contrast, we first show the pointwise convergence of the derived observable functions to zero, thereby allowing us to choose a finite set of these observables. Next, we use the derived observables in EDMD to compute the lifted linear state and input matrices for the rigid body dynamics. Finally, we show that an LQR type (linear) controller, which is designed based on the truncated linear state space model, can steer the rigid body to a desired state while its performance is commensurate with that of a nonlinear controller. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations."}}

When the distance between the active and the target spacecraft is significantly greater than the distance between the target spacecraft and the center of gravity of the planet, linearization-based approximations of the nonlinear rendezvous dynamics may not be sufficiently accurate. For this reason, control methods that rely on such linearizations may not be appropriate for far-field rendezvous. In this paper, we address the control design problem based on a nonlinear state space model. To overcome the well-known challenges of nonlinear control design, we utilize a Koopman operator based approach in which the nonlinear spacecraft rendezvous dynamics is lifted into a higher dimensional space over which the nonlinear dynamics can be approximated by a linear system which is more suitable for control design purposes than the original nonlinear model. An Iteratively Recursive Least Squares (IRLS) algorithm from compressive sensing is then used to solve the minimum fuel control problem based on the lifted linear system.

A recently-proposed sampling-based motion planning algorithm, termed 'Generalized Shape Expansion' (GSE), has been shown to possess significant improvement in computational time over several existing well-established algorithms. The GSE has also been shown to be probabilistically complete. However, asymptotic optimality of the GSE is yet to be studied. To this end, in this paper we show that the GSE algorithm is not asymptotically optimal by studying its behaviour for the promenade problem. In order to obtain a probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal generalized shape-based algorithm, a modified version of the GSE, namely 'GSE*' algorithm, is subsequently presented. The forementioned desired mathematical properties of the GSE* algorithm are justified by its detailed analysis. Numerical simulations are found to be in line with the theoretical results on the GSE* algorithm."}}
