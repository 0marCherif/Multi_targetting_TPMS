It focuses on the episodic linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) setting where the transition kernels and the reward functions are assumed to be linear. With the knowledge of an existing safe baseline policy, two algorithms based on Least-Squares Value Iteration (LSVI) (Bradtke and Barto, 1996; Osband et al., 2016), coined StepMix-LSVI and EpsMix-LSVI, are proposed to balance the exploitation and exploration while ensuring that the conservative constraint is never violated in each episode with high probability. Theoretical analysis shows that both algorithms achieve the same regret order as LSVI-UCB, their constraint-free counterpart from Jin et al. (2020), indicating that obeying the stringent episode-wise conservative constraint does not compromise the learning performance of these algorithms. We further extend the analysis to the setting where the baseline policy is not given a priori but must be learned from an offline dataset, and prove that similar safety guarantee and regret can be achieved if the offline dataset is sufficiently large. Experiment results corroborate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed conservative exploration strategies."}}

While the primary goal of the exploration phase in RF-RL is to reduce the uncertainty in the estimated model with minimum number of trajectories, in practice, the agent often needs to abide by certain safety constraint at the same time. It remains unclear how such safe exploration requirement would affect the corresponding sample complexity in order to achieve the desired optimality of the obtained policy in planning. In this work, we make a first attempt to answer this question. In particular, we consider the scenario where a safe baseline policy is known beforehand, and propose a unified Safe reWard-frEe ExploraTion (SWEET) framework. We then particularize the SWEET framework to the tabular and the low-rank MDP settings, and develop algorithms coined Tabular-SWEET and Low-rank-SWEET, respectively. Both algorithms leverage the concavity and continuity of the newly introduced truncated value functions, and are guaranteed to achieve zero constraint violation during exploration with high probability. Furthermore, both algorithms can provably find a near-optimal policy subject to any constraint in the planning phase. Remarkably, the sample complexities under both algorithms match or even outperform the state of the art in their constraint-free counterparts up to some constant factors, proving that safety constraint hardly increases the sample complexity for RF-RL."}}

In this paper we focus on reward-free RL under low-rank MDP models, in which both the representation and linear weight vectors are unknown. Although various algorithms have been proposed for reward-free low-rank MDPs, the corresponding sample complexity is still far from being satisfactory. In this work, we first provide the first known sample complexity lower bound that holds for any algorithm under low-rank MDPs. This lower bound implies it is strictly harder to find a near-optimal policy under low-rank MDPs than under linear MDPs. We then propose a novel model-based algorithm, coined RAFFLE, and show it can both find an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy and achieve an $\\epsilon$-accurate system identification via reward-free exploration, with a sample complexity significantly improving the previous results. Such a sample complexity matches our lower bound in the dependence on $\\epsilon$, as well as on $K$ {in the large $d$ regime}, where $d$ and $K$ respectively denote the representation dimension and action space cardinality. Finally, we provide a planning algorithm (without further interaction with true environment) for RAFFLE to learn a near-accurate representation, which is the first known representation learning guarantee under the same setting.\n "}}

By leveraging the geometric structure of the linear rewards, a collaborative algorithm called Fed-PE is proposed to cope with the heterogeneity across clients without exchanging local feature vectors or raw data. Fed-PE relies on a novel multi-client G-optimal design, and achieves near-optimal regrets for both disjoint and shared parameter cases with logarithmic communication costs. In addition, a new concept called collinearly-dependent policies is introduced, based on which a tight minimax regret lower bound for the disjoint parameter case is derived. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets. "}}
