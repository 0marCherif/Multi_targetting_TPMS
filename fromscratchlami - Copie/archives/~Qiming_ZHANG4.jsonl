However, large-scale models in remote sensing (RS) have not yet been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we resort to plain vision transformers with about 100 million parameters and make the first attempt to propose large vision models tailored to RS tasks and investigate how such large models perform. To handle the large sizes and objects of arbitrary orientations in RS images, we propose a new rotated varied-size window attention to replace the original full attention in transformers, which can significantly reduce the computational cost and memory footprint while learning better object representation by extracting rich context from the generated diverse windows. Experiments on detection tasks show the superiority of our model over all state-of-the-art models, achieving 81.24% mAP on the DOTA-V1.0 dataset. The results of our models on downstream classification and segmentation tasks also show competitive performance compared to existing advanced methods. Further experiments show the advantages of our models in terms of computational complexity and data efficiency in transferring."}}

However, customized algorithms should be carefully designed for the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., GreenMIM, instead of using the vanilla and simple MAE for the plain ViT. More importantly, since these hierarchical ViTs cannot reuse the off-the-shelf pre-trained weights of the plain ViTs, the requirement of pre-training them leads to a massive amount of computational cost, thereby incurring both algorithmic and computational complexity. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel idea of disentangling the hierarchical architecture design from the self-supervised pre-training. We transform the plain ViT into a hierarchical one with minimal changes. Technically, we change the stride of linear embedding layer from 16 to 4 and add convolution (or simple average) pooling layers between the transformer blocks, thereby reducing the feature size from 1/4 to 1/32 sequentially. Despite its simplicity, it outperforms the plain ViT baseline in classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on ImageNet, MS COCO, Cityscapes, and ADE20K benchmarks, respectively. We hope this preliminary study could draw more attention from the community on developing effective (hierarchical) ViTs while avoiding the pre-training cost by leveraging the off-the-shelf checkpoints.

Cropped regions are widely used to construct positive pairs, while the remained regions after cropping have rarely been explored in existing methods, although they together constitute the same image instance and both contribute to the description of the category. In this paper, we make the first attempt to demonstrate the importance of both regions in cropping from a complete perspective and the effectiveness of using both regions via designing a simple yet effective pretext task called Region Contrastive Learning (RegionCL). Technically, to construct the two kinds of regions, we randomly crop a region (called the paste view) from each input image with the same size and swap them between different images to compose new images together with the remained regions (called the canvas view). Then, instead of taking the new images as a whole for positive or negative samples, contrastive pairs are efficiently constructed from the regional perspective based on the following simple criteria, i.e., each view is (1) positive with views augmented from the same original image and (2) negative with views augmented from other images. With minor modifications to popular SSL methods, RegionCL exploits those abundant pairs and helps the model distinguish the regions features from both canvas and paste views, therefore learning better visual representations. Experiments on ImageNet, MS COCO, and Cityscapes demonstrate that RegionCL improves MoCov2, DenseCL, and SimSiam by large margins and achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

Nevertheless, they treat an image as a 1D sequence of visual tokens, lacking an intrinsic inductive bias (IB) in modeling local visual structures and dealing with scale variance, which is instead learned implicitly from large-scale training data with longer training schedules. In this paper, we propose a Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring intrinsic IB from convolutions, i.e., ViTAE. Technically, ViTAE has several spatial pyramid reduction modules to downsample and embed the input image into tokens with rich multi-scale context using multiple convolutions with different dilation rates. In this way, it acquires an intrinsic scale invariance IB and can learn robust feature representation for objects at various scales. Moreover, in each transformer layer, ViTAE has a convolution block parallel to the multi-head self-attention module, whose features are fused and fed into the feed-forward network. Consequently, it has the intrinsic locality IB and is able to learn local features and global dependencies collaboratively. The proposed two kinds of cells are stacked in both isotropic and multi-stage manners to formulate two families of ViTAE models, i.e., the vanilla ViTAE and ViTAEv2. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset as well as downstream tasks on the MS COCO, ADE20K, and AP10K datasets validate the superiority of our models over the baseline transformer models and concurrent works. Besides, we scale up our ViTAE model to 644M parameters and obtain the state-of-the-art classification performance, i.e., 88.5% Top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet validation set and the best 91.2% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet real validation set, without using extra private data."}}

However, current models adopt a hand-crafted fixed-size window design, which restricts their capacity of modeling long-term dependencies and adapting to objects of different sizes. To address this drawback, we propose Varied-Size Window Attention (VSA) to learn adaptive window configurations from data. Specifically, based on the tokens within each default window, VSA employs a window regression module to predict the size and location of the target window, i.e., the attention area where the key and value tokens are sampled. By adopting VSA independently for each attention head, it can model long-term dependencies, capture rich context from diverse windows, and promote information exchange among overlapped windows. VSA is an easy-to-implement module that can replace the window attention in state-of-the-art representative models with minor modifications and negligible extra computational cost while improving their performance by a large margin, e.g., 1.1% for Swin-T on ImageNet classification. In addition, the performance gain increases when using larger images for training and test. Experimental results on more downstream tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation, further demonstrate the superiority of VSA over the vanilla window attention in dealing with objects of different sizes.

Due to the difficulty in obtaining real-world rainy/clean image pairs, previous real datasets suffer from low-resolution images, homogeneous rain streaks, limited background variation, and even misalignment of image pairs, resulting in incomprehensive evaluation of SID methods. To address these issues, we establish a new high-quality dataset named RealRain-1k, consisting of $1,120$ high-resolution paired clean and rainy images with low- and high-density rain streaks, respectively. Images in RealRain-1k are automatically generated from a large number of real-world rainy video clips through a simple yet effective rain density-controllable filtering method, and have good properties of high image resolution, background diversity, rain streaks variety, and strict spatial alignment. RealRain-1k also provides abundant rain streak layers as a byproduct, enabling us to build a large-scale synthetic dataset named SynRain-13k by pasting the rain streak layers on abundant natural images. Based on them and existing datasets, we benchmark more than 10 representative SID methods on three tracks: (1) fully supervised learning on RealRain-1k, (2) domain generalization to real datasets, and (3) syn-to-real transfer learning. The experimental results (1) show the difference of representative methods in image restoration performance and model complexity, (2) validate the significance of the proposed datasets for model generalization, and (3) provide useful insights on the superiority of learning from diverse domains and shed lights on the future research on real-world SID.
