Traditional approaches to quantization aim to minimize the reconstruction error of the database points. Based on the observation that for a given query, the database points that have the largest inner products are more relevant, we develop a family of anisotropic quantization loss functions. Under natural statistical assumptions, we show that quantization with these loss functions leads to a new variant of vector quantization that more greatly penalizes the parallel component of a datapoint\u2019s residual relative to its orthogonal component. The proposed approach, whose implementation is open-source, achieves state-of-theart results on the public benchmarks available at ann-benchmarks.com."}}

By activation map we refer to the intermediate output of the multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) after a ReLU activation function, and by \"sparse\" we mean that on average very few entries (e.g., 3.0% for T5-Base and 6.3% for ViT-B16) are nonzero for each input to MLP. Moreover, larger Transformers with more layers and wider MLP hidden dimensions are sparser as measured by the percentage of nonzero entries. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that the emergence of sparsity is a prevalent phenomenon that occurs for both natural language processing and vision tasks, on both training and evaluation data, for Transformers of various configurations, at layers of all depth levels. We discuss how sparsity immediately implies a way to significantly reduce the FLOP count and improve efficiency for Transformers. Moreover, we demonstrate perhaps surprisingly that enforcing an even sparser activation via Top-k thresholding with a small k brings a collection of desired properties, namely less sensitivity to noisy training data, more robustness to input corruptions, and better calibration for their prediction confidence."}}

The design of the proposed algorithm is motivated by an accurate accelerator performance model that takes into account both the  memory and instruction bottlenecks. Our algorithm comes with an analytical guarantee of recall in expectation and does not require maintaining sophisticated index data structure or tuning, making it suitable for applications with frequent updates. Our work is available in the open-source package of Jax and Tensorflow on TPU."}}

However, in most traditional quantization works, the objective is to minimize the reconstruction error for datapoints to be searched. In this work, we focus directly on minimizing error in inner product approximation and derive a new class of quantization loss functions. One key aspect of the new loss functions is that we weight the error term based on the value of the inner product, giving more importance to pairs of queries and datapoints whose inner products are high. We provide theoretical grounding to the new quantization loss function, which is simple, intuitive and able to work with a variety of quantization techniques, including binary quantization and product quantization. We conduct experiments on public benchmarking datasets \\url{http://ann-benchmarks.com} to demonstrate that our method using the new objective outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. We are committed to release our source code."}}
