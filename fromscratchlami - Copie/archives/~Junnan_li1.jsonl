However, the methods used by existing multimodal pre-training frameworks to gather multimodal data for 3D applications lack scalability and comprehensiveness, potentially constraining the full potential of multimodal learning. The main bottleneck lies in the language modality's scalability and comprehensiveness. To address this, we introduce ULIP-2, a tri-modal pre-training framework that leverages state-of-the-art large multimodal models to automatically generate holistic language counterparts for 3D objects. It does not require any 3D annotations, and is therefore scalable to large datasets. We conduct experiments on two large-scale 3D datasets, Objaverse and ShapeNet, and augment them with tri-modal datasets of 3D point clouds, images, and language for training ULIP-2. ULIP-2 achieves significant improvements on downstream zero-shot classification on ModelNet40 (74.0% in top-1 accuracy); on the real-world ScanObjectNN benchmark, it obtains 91.5% in overall accuracy with only 1.4 million parameters, signifying a breakthrough in scalable multimodal 3D representation learning without human 3D annotations. The code, along with the generated tri-modal datasets, can be found at https://github.com/salesforce/ULIP"}}

This paper proposes BLIP-2, a generic and efficient pre-training strategy that bootstraps vision-language pre-training from off-the-shelf frozen pre-trained image encoders and frozen large language models. BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying Transformer, which is pre-trained in two stages. The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters. We also demonstrate the model's emerging capabilities of zero-shot image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions."}}

Despite their success, they either adopt specific types of network architectures (encoder-only or decoder-only) for different downstream tasks or rely on a single architecture (encoder-decoder or UniLM-style encoder) for all tasks. The latter approach usually results in a sub-optimal performance on a subset of tasks. To address these limitations, we propose \u201cCodeT5Mix\u201d, a  mixture of encoder-decoder Transformers for code where its components can be flexibly combined based on the target  tasks during finetuning, while still enjoying the mutual benefits from the joint pretraining. To endow the model with both code understanding and generation capabilities, we pretrain CodeT5Mix  using a mixture of denoising, contrastive learning, matching, and Causal Language Modeling (CLM) tasks  on  large-scale multilingual code corpora in nine programming languages. Additionally, we design a weight sharing strategy in  decoders except the feedforward layers, which act as task-specific experts to reduce the  interference across tasks of various types. We extensively evaluate CodeT5Mix on seven tasks in four different modes and achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on most tasks such as text-to-code retrieval,  code completion and generation, and math programming. Particularly, we demonstrate that CodeT5Mix can be used as a unified semi-parametric retrieval-augmented generator with SoTA code generation performance. "}}

To address this issue, we propose \\emph{Img2Prompt}, a plug-and-play module that provides the prompts that can bridge the aforementioned modality and task disconnections, so that LLMs can perform VQA tasks without end-to-end training. In order to provide such prompts, we further employ LLM-agnostic models to provide prompts that can describe image content and self-constructed question-answer pairs, which can effectively guide LLM to perform VQA tasks. Img2Prompt offers the following benefits: 1) It is LLM-agnostic and can work with any LLM to perform VQA. 2) It renders end-to-end training unnecessary and significantly reduces the cost of deploying LLM for VQA tasks. 3) It achieves comparable or better performance than methods relying on end-to-end training.

In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score).

Most previous methods capture cross-modal interactions with a standard transformer-based multimodal encoder, not fully addressing the misalignment between unimodal video and text features. Besides, learning finegrained visual-language alignment usually requires off-the-shelf object detectors to provide object information, which is bottlenecked by the detector's limited vocabulary and expensive computation cost. In this paper, we propose Align and Prompt: a new video-and-language pre-training framework (AlPro), which operates on sparsely-sampled video frames and achieves more effective cross-modal alignment without explicit object detectors. First, we introduce a video-text contrastive (VTC) loss to align unimodal video-text features at the instance level, which eases the modeling of cross-modal interactions. Then, we propose a novel visually-grounded pre-training task, prompting entity modeling (PEM), which learns finegrained alignment between visual region and text entity via an entity prompter module in a self-supervised way. Finally, we pretrain the video-and-language transformer models on large webly-source video-text pairs using the proposed VTC and PEM losses as well as two standard losses of masked language modeling (MLM) and video-text matching (VTM). The resulting pre-trained model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both text-video retrieval and videoQA, outperforming prior work by a substantial margin.
