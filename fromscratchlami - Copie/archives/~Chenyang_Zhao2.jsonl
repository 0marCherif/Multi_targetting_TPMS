Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs can assist an embodied agent in solving complex sequential decision making tasks by providing high-level instructions. However, interactions with LLMs can be time-consuming. In many practical scenarios, they require a significant amount of storage space that can only be deployed on remote cloud server nodes. Additionally, using commercial LLMs can be costly since they may charge based on usage frequency. In this paper, we explore how to enable intelligent cost-effective interactions between the agent and an LLM. We propose When2Ask, a reinforcement learning based approach that learns when it is necessary to query LLMs for high-level instructions to accomplish a target task. Experiments on MiniGrid and Habitat environments that entail planning sub-goals demonstrate that When2Ask learns to solve target tasks with only a few necessary interactions with an LLM, and significantly reduces interaction costs in testing environments compared with baseline methods. Experiment results also suggest that by learning a mediator model to interact with the LLM, the agent's performance becomes more robust against partial observability of the environment.

However, naively aggregating information from randomised domains may lead to high variance in gradient estimation and unstable learning process. To address this issue, we present a peer-to-peer online distillation strategy for RL termed P2PDRL, where multiple workers are each assigned to a different environment, and exchange knowledge through mutual regularisation based on Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our experiments on continuous control tasks show that P2PDRL enables robust learning across a wider randomisation distribution than baselines, and more robust generalisation to new environments at testing."}}

However, it is unclear how close we are to the vision of putting Deep RL into practice to solve real world problems. In particular, common practice in the field is to train policies on largely deterministic simulators and to evaluate algorithms through training performance alone, without a train/test distinction to ensure models generalise and are not overfitted. Moreover, it is not standard practice to check for generalisation under domain shift, although robustness to such system change between training and testing would be necessary for real-world Deep RL control, for example, in robotics. In this paper we study these issues by first characterising the sources of uncertainty that provide generalisation challenges in Deep RL. We then provide a new benchmark and thorough empirical evaluation of generalisation challenges for state of the art Deep RL methods. In particular, we show that, if generalisation is the goal, then common practice of evaluating algorithms based on their training performance leads to the wrong conclusions about algorithm choice. Finally, we evaluate several techniques for improving generalisation and draw conclusions about the most robust techniques to date."}}

These skills typically require a prohibitive amount of exploration for reinforcement learning, and so are commonly achieved by imitation learning from manual demonstration. The costly non-scalable nature of manual demonstration has motivated work into skill generalisation, e.g., through contextual policies and options. Despite good results, existing work along these lines is limited to generalising across variants of one skill such as throwing an object to different locations. In this paper we go significantly further and investigate generalisation across qualitatively different classes of control skills. In particular, we introduce a class of neural network controllers that can realise four distinct skill classes: reaching, object throwing, casting, and ball-in-cup. By factorising the weights of the neural network, we are able to extract transferrable latent skills, that enable dramatic acceleration of learning in cross-task transfer. With a suitable curriculum, this allows us to learn challenging dextrous control tasks like ball-in-cup from scratch with pure reinforcement learning."}}
