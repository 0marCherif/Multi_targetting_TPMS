In particular, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) achieves state-of-the-art asymptotic training performance on the MuJoCo benchmark with a distributional representation of critics; and Randomized Ensemble Double Q-Learning (REDQ) achieves high sample efficiency that is competitive with state-of-the-art model-based methods using a high update-to-data ratio and target randomization. In this paper, we propose a novel model-free algorithm, Aggressive Q-Learning with Ensembles (AQE), which improves the sample-efficiency performance of REDQ and the asymptotic performance of TQC, thereby providing overall state-of-the-art performance during all stages of training. Moreover, AQE is very simple, requiring neither distributional representation of critics nor target randomization. The effectiveness of AQE is further supported by our extensive experiments, ablations, and theoretical results."}}

We first consider bounding the difference of the long-term average reward for two policies. We show that previous work based on the discounted return (Schulman et al., 2015; Achiam et al., 2017) results in a non-meaningful bound in the average-reward setting. By addressing the average-reward criterion directly, we then derive a novel bound which depends on the average divergence between the two policies and Kemeny's constant. Based on this bound, we develop an iterative procedure which produces a sequence of monotonically improved policies for the average reward criterion. This iterative procedure can then be combined with classic DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning) methods, resulting in practical DRL algorithms that target the long-run average reward criterion. In particular, we demonstrate that Average-Reward TRPO (ATRPO), which adapts the on-policy TRPO algorithm to the average-reward criterion, significantly outperforms TRPO in the most challenging MuJuCo environments."}}

We derive a novel lower bound on the difference of the long-term average reward for two policies.  The lower bound depends on the average divergence between the policies and on the so-called Kemeny constant, which measures to what degree the unichain Markov chains associated with the policies are well-connected. We also show that previous work based on the discounted return (Schulman et al., 2015; Achiam et al., 2017) results in a non-meaningful lower bound in the average reward setting. Based on our lower bound, we develop an iterative procedure which produces a sequence of monotonically improved policies for the average reward criterion. When combined with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods, the procedure leads to scalable and efficient algorithms for maximizing the agent\u2019s average reward performance.Empirically we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on continuing control tasks and show how discounting can lead to unsatisfactory performance."}}

However some aspects of behavior\u2014such as ones which are deemed unsafe and to be avoided\u2014are best captured through constraints. We propose a novel approach called First Order Constrained Optimization in Policy Space (FOCOPS) which maximizes an agent's overall reward while ensuring the agent satisfies a set of cost constraints. Using data generated from the current policy, FOCOPS first finds the optimal update policy by solving a constrained optimization problem in the nonparameterized policy space. FOCOPS then projects the update policy back into the parametric policy space. Our approach has an approximate upper bound for worst-case constraint violation throughout training and is first-order in nature therefore simple to implement. We provide empirical evidence that our simple approach achieves better performance on a set of constrained robotics locomotive tasks."}}

Starting with data generated by the current policy, SPU formulates and solves a constrained optimization problem in the non-parameterized proximal policy space. Using supervised regression, it then converts the optimal non-parameterized policy to a parameterized policy, from which it draws new samples. The methodology is general in that it applies to both discrete and continuous action spaces, and can handle a wide variety of proximity constraints for the non-parameterized optimization problem. We show how the Natural Policy Gradient and Trust Region Policy Optimization (NPG/TRPO) problems, and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) problem can be addressed by this methodology. The SPU implementation is much simpler than TRPO. In terms of sample efficiency, our extensive experiments show SPU outperforms TRPO in Mujoco simulated robotic tasks and outperforms PPO in Atari video game tasks."}}

Many reinforcement learning problems, however, involve high-dimensional discrete action spaces as well as high-dimensional state spaces. In this paper, we develop a novel policy gradient methodology for the case of large multidimensional discrete action spaces. We propose two approaches for creating parameterized policies: LSTM parameterization and a Modified MDP (MMDP) giving rise to Feed-Forward Network (FFN) parameterization. Both of these approaches provide expressive models to which backpropagation can be applied for training. We then consider entropy bonus, which is typically added to the reward function to enhance exploration. In the case of high-dimensional action spaces, calculating the entropy and the gradient of the entropy requires enumerating all the actions in the action space and running forward and backpropagation for each action, which may be computationally infeasible. We develop several novel unbiased estimators for the entropy bonus and its gradient. Finally, we test our algorithms on two environments: a multi-hunter multi-rabbit grid game and a multi-agent multi-arm bandit problem."}}
