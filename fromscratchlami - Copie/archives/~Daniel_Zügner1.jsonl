Differentially private stochastic gradient descent is the de facto standard for training neural networks without leaking sensitive information about the training data. However, applying it to models for graph-structured data poses a novel challenge: unlike with i.i.d.\\ data, sensitive information about a node in a graph cannot only leak through its gradients, but also through the gradients of all nodes within a larger neighborhood. In practice, this limits privacy-preserving deep learning on graphs to very shallow graph neural networks. We propose to solve this issue by training graph neural networks on disjoint subgraphs of a given training graph. We develop three random-walk-based methods for generating such disjoint subgraphs and perform a careful analysis of the data-generating distributions to provide strong privacy guarantees. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline on three large graphs, and matches or outperforms it on four smaller ones."}}

In this work, we propose to optimize expected scores under a probabilistic model over hierarchies.

(2) We propose Expected Probabilistic Hierarchies (EPH), a probabilistic model to learn hierarchies in data by optimizing expected scores. EPH uses differentiable hierarchy sampling enabling end-to-end gradient-descent based optimizations, and an unbiased subgraph sampling approach to scale to large datasets. (3) We evaluate EPH on synthetic and real-world datasets including vector and graph datasets. EPH outperforms all other approaches on quantitative results and provides meaningful hierarchies in qualitative evaluations."}}

In this work, we propose the Natural Posterior Network (NatPN) for fast and high-quality uncertainty estimation for any task where the target distribution belongs to the exponential family. Thus, NatPN finds application for both classification and general regression settings. Unlike many previous approaches, NatPN does not require out-of-distribution (OOD) data at training time. Instead, it leverages Normalizing Flows to fit a single density on a learned low-dimensional and task-dependent latent space. For any input sample, NatPN uses the predicted likelihood to perform a Bayesian update over the target distribution. Theoretically, NatPN assigns high uncertainty far away from training data. Empirically, our extensive experiments on calibration and OOD detection show that NatPN delivers highly competitive performance for classification, regression and count prediction tasks."}}

Yet, existing studies of their vulnerability to adversarial attacks rely on relatively small graphs. We address this gap and study how to attack and defend GNNs at scale. We propose two sparsity-aware first-order optimization attacks that maintain an efficient representation despite optimizing over a number of parameters which is quadratic in the number of nodes. We show that common surrogate losses are not well-suited for global attacks on GNNs. Our alternatives can double the attack strength. Moreover, to improve GNNs' reliability we design a robust aggregation function, Soft Median, resulting in an effective defense at all scales. We evaluate our attacks and defense with standard GNNs on graphs more than 100 times larger compared to previous work. We even scale one order of magnitude further by extending our techniques to a scalable GNN."}}

Traditionally, designers of machine learning models have relied predominantly either on Structure or Context. We propose a new model, which jointly learns on Context and Structure of source code. In contrast to previous approaches, our model uses only language-agnostic features, i.e., source code and features that can be computed directly from the AST. Besides obtaining state-of-the-art on monolingual code summarization on all five programming languages considered in this work, we propose the first multilingual code summarization model. We show that jointly training on non-parallel data from multiple programming languages improves results on all individual languages, where the strongest gains are on low-resource languages. Remarkably, multilingual training only from Context does not lead to the same improvements, highlighting the benefits of combining Structure and Context for representation learning on code."}}

Dirichlet-based uncertainty (DBU) models are a family of models that predict the parameters of a Dirichlet distribution (instead of a categorical one) and promise to signal when not to trust their predictions. Untrustworthy predictions are obtained on unknown or ambiguous samples and marked with a high uncertainty by the models.\n\nIn this work, we show that DBU models with standard training are not robust w.r.t. three important tasks in the field of uncertainty estimation. First, we evaluate how useful the uncertainty estimates are to (1) indicate correctly classified samples. Our results show that while they are a good indicator on unperturbed data, performance on perturbed data decreases dramatically. (2) We evaluate if uncertainty estimates are able to detect adversarial examples that try to fool classification. It turns out that uncertainty estimates are able to detect FGSM attacks but not able to detect PGD attacks. We further evaluate the reliability of DBU models on the task of (3) distinguishing between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To this end, we present the first study of certifiable robustness for DBU models. Furthermore, we propose novel uncertainty attacks that fool models into assigning high confidence to OOD data and low confidence to ID data, respectively. \nBoth approaches show that detecting OOD samples and distinguishing between ID-data and OOD-data is not robust.\n\nBased on our results, we explore the first approaches to make DBU models more robust. We use adversarial training procedures based on label attacks, uncertainty attacks, or random noise and demonstrate how they affect robustness of DBU models on ID data and OOD data."}}

This work is motivated by the observation that adversarially injected edges effectively can be viewed as additional samples to a node's neighborhood aggregation function, which results in distorted aggregations accumulating over the layers. Conventional GNN aggregation functions, such as a sum or mean, can be distorted arbitrarily by a single outlier. We propose a robust aggregation function motivated by the field of robust statistics. Our approach exhibits the largest possible breakdown point of 0.5, which means that the bias of the aggregation is bounded as long as the fraction of adversarial edges of a node is less than 50\\%. Our novel aggregation function, Soft Medoid, is a fully differentiable generalization of the Medoid and therefore lends itself well for end-to-end deep learning. Equipping a GNN with our aggregation improves the robustness with respect to structure perturbations on Cora ML by a factor of 3 (and 5.5 on Citeseer) and by a factor of 8 for low-degree nodes."}}

Traditional approaches, such as dropout and ensemble methods, estimate uncertainty by sampling probability predictions from different submodels, which leads to slow uncertainty estimation at inference time. Recent works address this drawback by directly predicting parameters of prior distributions over the probability predictions with a neural network. While this approach has demonstrated accurate uncertainty estimation, it requires defining arbitrary target parameters for in-distribution data and makes the unrealistic assumption that out-of-distribution (OOD) data is known at training time. In this work we propose the Posterior Network (PostNet), which uses Normalizing Flows to predict an individual closed-form posterior distribution over predicted probabilites for any input sample. The posterior distributions learned by PostNet accurately reflect uncertainty for in- and out-of-distribution data -- without requiring access to OOD data at training time. PostNet achieves state-of-the art results in OOD detection and in uncertainty calibration under dataset shifts."}}
