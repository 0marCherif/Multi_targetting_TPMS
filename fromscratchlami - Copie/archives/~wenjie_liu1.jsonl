However, the complexity of \\textsf{WDRO} can be prohibitive in practice since solving its ``minimax'' formulation requires a great amount of computation. Recently, several fast \\textsf{WDRO} training algorithms for some specific machine learning tasks (e.g., logistic regression) have been developed. However, the research on designing efficient algorithms for general large-scale \\textsf{WDRO}s is still quite limited, to the best of our knowledge. \\textit{Coreset} is an important  tool for compressing large dataset, and thus it has been widely applied to  reduce the computational complexities for many optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework to construct the $\\epsilon$-coreset for the general \\textsf{WDRO} problems. Though it is challenging to obtain a conventional coreset for \\textsf{WDRO}  due to the uncertainty issue of ambiguous data, we show that we can compute a ``dual coreset'' by using the strong duality property of \\textsf{WDRO}. Also, the error introduced by the dual coreset can be theoretically guaranteed for the original \\textsf{WDRO} objective. To construct the dual coreset, we propose a novel  grid sampling approach that is particularly suitable for the dual formulation of \\textsf{WDRO}. Finally, we implement our coreset approach and illustrate its effectiveness for several \\textsf{WDRO} problems in the experiments.
