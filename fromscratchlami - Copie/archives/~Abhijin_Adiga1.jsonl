We investigate the problem assuming an active form of interaction with the system through queries. We consider two classes of local functions (namely, symmetric and threshold functions) and two interaction modes, namely batch mode (where all the queries must be submitted together) and adaptive mode (where the set of queries submitted at a stage may rely on the answers received to previous queries). We develop complexity results and efficient heuristics that produce query sets under both query modes. We demonstrate the performance of our heuristics through experiments on over 20 well-known networks."}}

Most of the work on vaccination games has focused on decisions at the start of an epidemic. However, a lot of people defer their vaccination decisions, in practice. For example, in the case of the seasonal flu, vaccination rates gradually increase, as the epidemic rate increases. This motivates the study of temporal vaccination games, in which vaccination decisions can be made more than once. An important issue in the context of temporal decisions is that of resource limitations, which may arise due to production and distribution constraints. While there has been some work on temporal vaccination games, resource constraints have not been considered.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we study temporal vaccination games for epidemics in the SI (susceptible-infectious) model, with resource constraints in the form of a repeated game in complex social networks, with budgets on the number of vaccines that can be taken at any time. We find that the resource constraints and the vaccination and infection costs have a significant impact on the structure of Nash equilibria (NE). In general, the budget constraints can cause NE to become very inefficient, and finding efficient NE as well as the social optimum are NP-hard problems. We develop algorithms for finding NE and approximating the social optimum. We evaluate our results using simulations on different kinds of networks."}}

Protective interventions such as vaccinations or installing anti-virus software are used to contain their spread. Typically, each node in the network has to decide its own strategy of securing itself, and its benefit depends on which other nodes are secure, making this a natural game-theoretic setting. There has been a lot of work on network security game models, but most of the focus has been either on simplified epidemic models or homogeneous network structure.\r\n\r\nWe develop a new formulation for an epidemic containment game, which relies on the characterization of the SIS model in terms of the spectral radius of the network. We show in this model that pure Nash equilibria (NE) always exist, and can be found by a best response strategy. We analyze the complexity of finding NE, and derive rigorous bounds on their costs and the Price of Anarchy or PoA (the ratio of the cost of the worst NE to the optimum social cost) in general graphs as well as in random graph models. In particular, for arbitrary power-law graphs with exponent \u03b2 > 2, we show that the PoA is bounded by O(T2(\u03b2 -1))), where T = \u03b3/\u03b1 is the ratio of the recovery rate to the transmission rate in the SIS model. We prove that this bound is tight up to a constant factor for the Chung-Lu random power-law graph model. We study the characteristics of Nash equilibria empirically in different real communication and infrastructure networks, and find that our analytical results can help explain some of the empirical observations."}}

More often than not, the underlying network data is noisy and sampled. This prompts the following natural question: how sensitive are the diffusion dynamics and subsequent conclusions to uncertainty in the network structure?\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we consider two popular diffusion models: Independent cascade (IC) model and Linear threshold (LT) model. We study how the expected number of vertices that are influenced/infected, for particular initial conditions, are affected by network perturbations. Through rigorous analysis under the assumption of a reasonable perturbation model we establish the following main results. (1) For the IC model, we characterize the sensitivity to network perturbation in terms of the critical probability for phase transition of the network. We find that the expected number of infections is quite stable, unless the transmission probability is close to the critical probability. (2) We show that the standard LT model with uniform edge weights is relatively stable under network perturbations. (3) We study these sensitivity questions using extensive simulations on diverse real world networks and find that our theoretical predictions for both models match the observations quite closely. (4) Experimentally, the transient behavior, i.e., the time series of the number of infections, in both models appears to be more sensitive to network perturbations."}}
