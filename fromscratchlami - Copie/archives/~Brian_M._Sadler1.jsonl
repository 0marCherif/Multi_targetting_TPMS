In particular, spectral image or color stereo data are often processed using octonion algebra. Recently, the eight-band multispectral image phase recovery has gained salience, wherein it is desired to recover the eight bands from the phaseless measurements. In this paper, we tackle this hitherto unaddressed hypercomplex variant of the popular phase retrieval (PR) problem. We propose octonion Wirtinger flow (OWF) to recover an octonion signal from its intensity-only observation. However, contrary to the complex-valued Wirtinger flow, the non-associative nature of octonion algebra and the consequent lack of octonion derivatives make the extension to OWF non-trivial. We resolve this using the pseudo-real-matrix representation of octonion to perform the derivatives in each OWF update. We demonstrate that our approach recovers the octonion signal up to a right-octonion phase factor. Numerical experiments validate OWF-based PR with high accuracy under both noiseless and noisy measurements."}}

This sample inefficiency comes in part from not suitably balancing the explore-exploit dilemma, especially in the presence of non-stationarity, during policy optimization. To incorporate a balance of exploration-exploitation for sample efficiency, we propose Ada-NAV, an adaptive trajectory length scheme where the length grows as a policy's randomness, represented by its Shannon or differential entropy, decreases. Our adaptive trajectory length scheme emphasizes exploration at the beginning of training due to more frequent gradient updates and emphasizes exploitation later on with longer trajectories. In gridworld, simulated robotic environments, and real-world robotic experiments, we demonstrate the merits of the approach over constant and randomly sampled trajectory lengths in terms of performance and sample efficiency. For a fixed sample budget, Ada-NAV results in an 18% increase in navigation success rate, a 20-38% decrease in the navigation path length, and 9.32% decrease in the elevation cost compared to the policies obtained by the other methods. We also demonstrate that Ada-NAV can be transferred and integrated into a Clearpath Husky robot without significant performance degradation."}}

In this work, we develop a novel MBRL method (i) which relaxes the assumptions on the target transition model to belong to a generic family of mixture models; (ii) is applicable to large-scale training by incorporating a compression step such that the posterior estimate consists of a Bayesian coreset of only statistically significant past state-action pairs; and (iii) exhibits a sublinear Bayesian regret. To achieve these results, we adopt an approach based upon Stein's method, which, under a smoothness condition on the constructed posterior and target, allows distributional distance to be evaluated in closed form as the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD). The aforementioned compression step is then computed in terms of greedily retaining only those samples which are more than a certain KSD away from the previous model estimate. Experimentally, we observe that this approach is competitive with several state-of-the-art RL methodologies, and can achieve up-to 50 percent reduction in wall clock time in some continuous control environments."}}

In JRC applications such as secure military receivers, often the radar and communications signals are overlaid in the received signal. In these passive listening outposts, the signals and channels of both radar and communications are unknown to the receiver. The ill-posed problem of recovering all signal and channel parameters from the overlaid signal is terms as dual-blind deconvolution (DBD). In this work, we investigate a more challenging version of DBD with a multi-antenna receiver. We model the radar and communications channels with a few (sparse) continuous-valued parameters such as time delays, Doppler velocities, and directions-of-arrival (DoAs). To solve this highly ill-posed DBD, we propose to minimize the sum of multivariate atomic norms (SoMAN) that depends on the unknown parameters. To this end, we devise an exact semidefinite program using theories of positive hyperoctant trigonometric polynomials (PhTP). Our theoretical analyses show that the minimum number of samples and antennas required for perfect recovery is logarithmically dependent on the maximum of the number of radar targets and communications paths rather than their sum. We show that our approach is easily generalized to include several practical issues such as gain/phase errors and additive noise. Numerical experiments show the exact parameter recovery for different JRC"}}

If the target can intercept noisy radar emissions, how can it detect coordination in the network? By \u2018coordination\u2019 we mean that the radar emissions satisfy Pareto optimality with respect to multi-objective optimization over the objective functions of each radar and a constraint on total network power output. This paper provides a novel inverse multi-objective optimization approach for statistically detecting Pareto optimal (\u2019coordinating\u2019) behavior, from a finite dataset of noisy radar emissions. Specifically, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for radar network emissions to be consistent with multi-objective optimization (coordination), and we provide a statistical detector with theoretical guarantees for determining this consistency when radar emissions are observed in noise. We also provide numerical simulations which validate our approach. Note that while we make use of the specific framework of a radar network coordination problem, our results apply more generally to the field of inverse multi-objective optimization."}}
