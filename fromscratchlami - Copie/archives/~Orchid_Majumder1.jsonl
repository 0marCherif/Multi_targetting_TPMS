This information is present both in the domain and the class labels. In this work we investigate the complementary roles of these two sources of information by combining instance-discriminative contrastive learning and supervised learning in a single framework called Supervised Momentum Contrastive learning (SUPMOCO). Our approach avoids a problem observed in supervised learning where information in images not relevant to the task is discarded, which hampers their generalization to novel tasks. We show that (self-supervised) contrastive learning and supervised learning are mutually beneficial, leading to a new state-of-the-art on the META-DATASET - a recently introduced benchmark for few-shot learning. Our method is based on a simple modification of MOCO and scales better than prior work on combining supervised and self-supervised learning. This allows us to easily combine data from multiple domains leading to further improvements."}}

To the best of our knowledge, all such meta-learning methods use a single base dataset for meta-training to sample tasks from and do not adapt the algorithm after meta-training. This strategy may not scale to real-world use-cases where the meta-learner does not potentially have access to the full meta-training dataset from the very beginning and we need to update the meta-learner in an incremental fashion when additional training data becomes available. Through our experimental setup, we develop a notion of incremental learning during the meta-training phase of meta-learning and propose a method which can be used with multiple existing metric-based meta-learning algorithms. Experimental results on benchmark dataset show that our approach performs favorably at test time as compared to training a model with the full meta-training set and incurs negligible amount of catastrophic forgetting"}}

This amounts to combining meta-learning with incremental learning. Different tasks can have disjoint classes, so one cannot directly align different classifiers as done in model distillation. On the other hand, simply aligning features shared by all classes does not allow the base model sufficient flexibility to evolve to solve new tasks. We therefore indirectly align features relative to a minimal set of \u201canchor classes\u201d. Such indirect discriminant alignment (IDA) adapts a new model to old classes without the need to re-process old data, while leaving maximum flexibility for the model to adapt to new tasks. This process enables incrementally improving the model by processing multiple learning episodes, each representing a different learning task, even with few training examples. Experiments on few-shot learning benchmarks show that this incremental approach performs favorably compared to training the model with the entire dataset at once."}}

In this paper, we aim to develop an effective transfer learning algorithm by fine-tuning a pre-trained language model. The goal is to provide expressive and convenient-to-use feature extractors for downstream NLP tasks, and achieve improvement in terms of accuracy, data efficiency, and generalization to new domains. Therefore, we propose an attention-based fine-tuning algorithm that automatically selects relevant contextualized features from the pre-trained language model and uses those features on downstream text classification tasks. We test our methods on six widely-used benchmarking datasets, and achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all of them. Moreover, we then introduce an alternative multi-task learning approach, which is an end-to-end algorithm given the pre-trained model. By doing multi-task learning, one can largely reduce the total training time by trading off some classification accuracy."}}
