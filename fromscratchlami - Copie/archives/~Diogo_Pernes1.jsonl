At the same time, automatic evaluation metrics such as CTC scores have been recently proposed that exhibit a higher correlation with human judgments than traditional lexical-overlap metrics such as ROUGE. In this work, we intend to close the loop by leveraging the recent advances in summarization metrics to create quality-aware abstractive summarizers. Namely, we propose an energy-based model that learns to re-rank summaries according to one or a combination of these metrics. We experiment using several metrics to train our energy-based re-ranker and show that it consistently improves the scores achieved by the predicted summaries. Nonetheless, human evaluation results show that the re-ranking approach should be used with care for highly abstractive summaries, as the available metrics are not yet sufficiently reliable for this purpose."}}

Although important steps have been made towards the development of real-world SLR systems, signer-independent SLR is still one of the bottleneck problems of this research field. In this regard, we propose a deep neural network along with an adversarial training objective, specifically designed to address the signer-independent problem. Specifically, the proposed model consists of an encoder, mapping from input images to latent representations, and two classifiers operating on these underlying representations: (i) the sign-classifier, for predicting the class/sign labels, and (ii) the signer-classifier, for predicting their signer identities. During the learning stage, the encoder is simultaneously trained to help the sign-classifier as much as possible while trying to fool the signer-classifier. This adversarial training procedure allows learning signer-invariant latent representations that are in fact highly discriminative for sign recognition. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and its capability of dealing with the large inter-signer variations."}}

These values are usually represented as real values restricted to a given range (e.g., [0,2\u03c0) ), hiding the real nature of this information. In order to handle these variables properly in supervised classification tasks, alternatives to the naive Bayes classifier and logistic regression were proposed in the past. In this work, we propose directional-aware support vector machines. We address several realizations of the proposed models, studying their kernelized counterparts and their expressiveness. Finally, we validate the performance of the proposed Support Vector Machines (SVMs) against the directional naive Bayes and directional logistic regression with real data, obtaining competitive results."}}

Moreover, most existing work on this topic focuses only on minimizing the error on the source domains and achieving domain-invariant representations, which is insufficient to ensure low error on the target domain. In this work, we present a novel framework that addresses both problems and beats the current state of the art by using a mildly optimistic objective function and consistency regularization on the target samples."}}
