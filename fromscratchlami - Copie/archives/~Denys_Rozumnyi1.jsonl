The key idea is to tackle the inverse problem of image deblurring by modeling the forward problem with a 3D human model, a texture map, and a sequence of poses to describe human motion. The blurring process is then modeled by a temporal image aggregation step. Using a differentiable renderer, we can solve the inverse problem by backpropagating the pixel-wise reprojection error to recover the best human motion representation that explains a single or multiple input images. Since the image reconstruction loss alone is insufficient, we present additional regularization terms. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first method to tackle this problem. Our method consistently outperforms other methods on significantly blurry inputs since they lack one or multiple key functionalities that our method unifies, i.e. image deblurring with sub-frame accuracy and explicit 3D modeling of non-rigid human motion."}}

To this end, we model the blurred appearance of a fast moving object in a generative fashion by parametrizing its 3D position, rotation, velocity, acceleration, bounces, shape, and texture over the duration of a predefined time window spanning multiple frames. Using differentiable rendering, we are able to estimate all parameters by minimizing the pixel-wise reprojection error to the input video via backpropagating through a rendering pipeline that accounts for motion blur by averaging the graphics output over short time intervals. For that purpose, we also estimate the camera exposure gap time within the same optimization. To account for abrupt motion changes like bounces, we model the motion trajectory as a piece-wise polynomial, and we are able to estimate the specific time of the bounce at sub-frame accuracy. Experiments on established benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods for fast moving object deblurring and 3D reconstruction."}}

Such objects are highly blurred and move over large distances within one video frame. Fast moving objects are associated with a deblurring and matting problem, also called deblatting. We show that the separation of deblatting into consecutive matting and deblurring allows achieving real-time performance, i.e. an order of magnitude speed-up, and thus enabling new classes of application. The proposed method detects fast moving objects as a truncated distance function to the trajectory by learning from synthetic data. For the sharp appearance estimation and accurate trajectory estimation, we propose a matting and fitting network that estimates the blurred appearance without background, followed by an energy minimization based deblurring. The state-of-the-art methods are outperformed in terms of recall, precision, trajectory estimation, and sharp appearance reconstruction. Compared to other methods, such as deblatting, the inference is of several orders of magnitude faster and allows applications such as real-time fast moving object detection and retrieval in large video collections."}}

Such objects travel a considerable distance during exposure time of a single frame, and therefore, their position in the frame is not well defined. They appear as semi-transparent streaks due to the motion blur and cannot be reliably tracked by general trackers. We propose a novel approach called Tracking by Deblatting based on the observation that motion blur is directly related to the intra-frame trajectory of an object. Blur is estimated by solving two intertwined inverse problems, blind deblurring and image matting, which we call deblatting. By postprocessing, non-causal Tracking by Deblatting estimates continuous, complete, and accurate object trajectories for the whole sequence. Tracked objects are precisely localized with higher temporal resolution than by conventional trackers. Energy minimization by dynamic programming is used to detect abrupt changes of motion, called bounces. High-order polynomials are then fitted to smooth trajectory segments between bounces. The output is a continuous trajectory function that assigns location for every real-valued time stamp from zero to the number of frames. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on a newly created dataset of videos from a high-speed camera using a novel Trajectory-IoU metric that generalizes the traditional Intersection over Union and measures the accuracy of the intra-frame trajectory. The proposed method outperforms the baselines both in recall and trajectory accuracy. Additionally, we show that from the trajectory function precise physical calculations are possible, such as radius, gravity, and sub-frame object velocity. Velocity estimation is compared to the high-speed camera measurements and radars. Results show high performance of the proposed method in terms of Trajectory-IoU, recall, and velocity estimation."}}

The problem is formalized as finding dominant model instances progressively without forming crisp point-to-model assignments. Dominant instances are found via RANSAC-like sampling and a consolidation process driven by a model quality function considering previously proposed instances. New ones are found by clustering in the consensus space. This new formulation leads to a simple iterative algorithm with state-of-the-art accuracy while running in real-time on a number of vision problems. Also, we propose a sampler reflecting the fact that real-world data tend to form spatially coherent structures. The sampler returns connected components in a progressively growing neighborhood-graph. We present a number of applications where the use of multiple geometric models improves accuracy. These include using multiple homographies to estimate relative poses for global SfM; pose estimation from generalized homographies; and trajectory estimation of fast-moving objects."}}

The blurry appearance is especially ambiguous when the object has complex shape or texture. In such cases, classical methods, or even humans, are unable to recover the object's appearance and motion. We propose a method that, given a single image with its estimated background, outputs the object's appearance and position in a series of sub-frames as if captured by a high-speed camera (i.e. temporal super-resolution). The proposed generative model embeds an image of the blurred object into a latent space representation, disentangles the background, and renders the sharp appearance. Inspired by the image formation model, we design novel self-supervised loss function terms that boost performance and show good generalization capabilities. The proposed DeFMO method is trained on a complex synthetic dataset, yet it performs well on real-world data from several datasets. DeFMO outperforms the state of the art and generates high-quality temporal super-resolution frames."}}
