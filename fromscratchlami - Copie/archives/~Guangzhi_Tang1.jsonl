Yet, with the growing complexity of SNN algorithms, it isn't easy to properly benchmark and optimize their computational cost without hardware in the loop. Although digital neuromorphic processors have been widely adopted to benchmark SNN algorithms, their black-box nature is problematic for algorithm-hardware co-optimization. In this work, we open the black box of the digital neuromorphic processor for algorithm designers by presenting the neuron processing instruction set and detailed energy consumption of the SENeCA neuromorphic architecture. For convenient benchmarking and optimization, we provide the energy cost of the essential neuromorphic components in SENeCA, including neuron models and learning rules. Moreover, we exploit the SENeCA's hierarchical memory and exhibit an advantage over existing neuromorphic processors. We show the energy efficiency of SNN algorithms for video processing and online learning, and demonstrate the potential of our work for optimizing algorithm designs. Overall, we present a practical approach to enable algorithm designers to accurately benchmark SNN algorithms and pave the way towards effective algorithm-hardware co-design."}}

To harness these computational benefits, SNN need to be trained by learning algorithms that adhere to brain-inspired neuromorphic principles, namely event-based, local, and online computations. Yet, the state-of-the-art SNN training algorithms are based on backprop that does not follow the above principles. Due to its limited biological plausibility, the application of backprop to SNN requires non-local feedback pathways for transmitting continuous-valued errors, and relies on gradients from future timesteps. The introduction of biologically plausible modifications to backprop has helped overcome several of its limitations, but limits the degree to which backprop is approximated, which hinders its performance. We propose a biologically plausible gradient-based learning algorithm for SNN that is functionally equivalent to backprop, while adhering to all three neuromorphic principles. We introduced multi-compartment spiking neurons with local eligibility traces to compute the gradients required for learning, and a periodic \"sleep\" phase to further improve the approximation to backprop during which a local Hebbian rule aligns the feedback and feedforward weights. Our method achieved the same level of performance as backprop with multi-layer fully connected SNN on MNIST (98.13%) and the event-based N-MNIST (97.59%) datasets. We deployed our learning algorithm on Intel's Loihi to train a 1-hidden-layer network for MNIST, and obtained 93.32% test accuracy while consuming 400 times less energy per training sample than BioGrad on GPU. Our work shows that optimal learning is feasible in neuromorphic computing, and further pursuing its biological plausibility can better capture the benefits of this emerging computing paradigm."}}

An emerging non-Von Neumann model of intelligence, where spiking neural networks (SNNs) are run on neuromorphic processors, is regarded as an energy-efficient and robust alternative to the state-of-the-art real-time robotic controllers for low dimensional control tasks. The challenge now for this new computing paradigm is to scale so that it can keep up with real-world tasks. To do so, SNNs need to overcome the inherent limitations of their training, namely the limited ability of their spiking neurons to represent information and the lack of effective learning algorithms. Here, we propose a population-coded spiking actor network (PopSAN) trained in conjunction with a deep critic network using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The population coding scheme dramatically increased the representation capacity of the network and the hybrid learning combined the training advantages of deep networks with the energy-efficient inference of spiking networks. To show the general applicability of our approach, we integrated it with a spectrum of both on-policy and off-policy DRL algorithms. We deployed the trained PopSAN on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic chip and benchmarked our method against the mainstream DRL algorithms for continuous control. To allow for a fair comparison among all methods, we validated them on OpenAI gym tasks. Our Loihi-run PopSAN consumed 140 times less energy per inference when compared against the deep actor network on Jetson TX2, and had the same level of performance. Our results support the efficiency of neuromorphic controllers and suggest our hybrid RL as an alternative to deep learning, when both energy-efficiency and robustness are important."}}

The basis of the Loihi module is an end-to-end biophysically plausible compartmental model of an astrocyte that simulates the intracellular activity in response to the synaptic activity in space and time. To demonstrate the functional role of astrocytes in SNAN, we describe how an astrocyte may sense and induce activity-dependent neuronal synchronization, switch on and off spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) to introduce single-shot learning, and monitor the transition between ordered and chaotic activity at the synaptic space. Our module may serve as an extension for neuromorphic hardware, by either replicating or exploring the distinct computational roles that astrocytes have in forming biological intelligence."}}
