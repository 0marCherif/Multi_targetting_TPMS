To bridge the heterogeneous gap between the two modalities, current approaches achieve inter-modal alignment and intra-modal semantic relationship modeling through complex weighted combinations between items. In the intra-modal association and inter-modal interaction processes, the higher-weight items have a higher contribution to the global semantics. However, the same item always produces different contributions in the two processes, since most traditional approaches only focus on the alignment. This usually results in semantic changes and misalignment. To address this issue, this paper proposes Cross-modal Semantic Importance Consistency (CSIC) which achieves invariance in the semantic of items during aligning. The proposed technique measures the semantic importance of items obtained from intra-modal and inter-modal self-attention and learns a more reasonable representation vector by inter-calibrating the importance distribution to improve performance. We conducted extensive experiments on the Flickr30K and MS COCO datasets. The results show that our approach can significantly improve retrieval performance, proving the proposed approach\u2019s superiority and rationality."}}

Detecting pedestrians with substantial appearance diversities such as different pedestrian silhouettes, different viewpoints or different dressing, remains a crucial challenge. Instead of learning each of these diverse pedestrian appearance features individually as most existing methods do, we propose to perform contrastive learning to guide the feature learning in such a way that the semantic distance between pedestrians with different appearances in the learned feature space is minimized to eliminate the appearance diversities, whilst the distance between pedestrians and background is maximized. To facilitate the efficiency and effectiveness of contrastive learning, we construct an exemplar dictionary with representative pedestrian appearances as prior knowledge to construct effective contrastive training pairs and thus guide contrastive learning. Besides, the constructed exemplar dictionary is further leveraged to evaluate the quality of pedestrian proposals during inference by measuring the semantic distance between the proposal and the exemplar dictionary. Extensive experiments on both daytime and nighttime pedestrian detection validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

As a result, extracting features from the source image is repeated in each interaction, resulting in substantial computational redundancy. In this work, we propose the Feature Decoupling-Recycling Network (FDRN), which decouples the modeling components based on their intrinsic discrepancies and then recycles components for each user interaction. Thus, the efficiency of the whole interactive process can be significantly improved. To be specific, we apply the Decoupling-Recycling strategy from three perspectives to address three types of discrepancies, respectively. First, our model decouples the learning of source image semantics from the encoding of user guidance to process two types of input domains separately. Second, FDRN decouples high-level and low-level features from stratified semantic representations to enhance feature learning. Third, during the encoding of user guidance, current user guidance is decoupled from historical guidance to highlight the effect of current user guidance. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 datasets from different domains and modalities, which demonstrate the following merits of our model: 1) superior efficiency than other methods, particularly advantageous in challenging scenarios requiring long-term interactions (up to 4.25x faster), while achieving favorable segmentation performance; 2) strong applicability to various methods serving as a universal enhancement technique; 3) well cross-task generalizability, e.g., to medical image segmentation, and robustness against misleading user guidance."}}

In this work, we present a novel method for automatic corruption detection, which allows for blind corruption restoration without known corruption masks. Specifically, we develop a hierarchical contrastive learning framework to detect corrupted regions by capturing the intrinsic semantic distinctions between corrupted and uncorrupted regions. In particular, our model detects the corrupted mask in a coarse-to-fine manner by first predicting a coarse mask by contrastive learning in low-resolution feature space and then refines the uncertain area of the mask by high-resolution contrastive learning. A specialized hierarchical interaction mechanism is designed to facilitate the knowledge propagation of contrastive learning in different scales, boosting the modeling performance substantially. The detected multi-scale corruption masks are then leveraged to guide the corruption restoration. Detecting corrupted regions by learning the contrastive distinctions rather than the semantic patterns of corruptions, our model has well generalization ability across different corruption patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate following merits of our model: 1) the superior performance over other methods on both corruption detection and various image restoration tasks including blind inpainting and watermark removal, and 2) strong generalization across different corruption patterns such as graffiti, random noise or other image content.

In this work we make the first attempt at Scene-Generalizable Interactive Segmentation in Radiance Fields (SGISRF) and propose a novel SGISRF method, which can perform 3D object segmentation for novel (unseen) scenes represented by radiance fields, guided by only a few interactive user clicks in a given set of multi-view 2D images. In particular, the proposed SGISRF focuses on addressing three crucial challenges with three specially designed techniques. First, we devise the Cross-Dimension Guidance Propagation to encode the scarce 2D user clicks into informative 3D guidance representations. Second, the Uncertainty-Eliminated 3D Segmentation module is designed to achieve efficient yet effective 3D segmentation. Third, Concealment-Revealed Supervised Learning scheme is proposed to reveal and correct the concealed 3D segmentation errors resulted from the supervision in 2D space with only 2D mask annotations. Extensive experiments on two real-world challenging benchmarks covering diverse scenes demonstrate 1) effectiveness and scene-generalizability of the proposed method, 2) favorable performance compared to classical method requiring scene-specific optimization."}}

This paper proposes a novel approach to improve point cloud few-shot segmentation (PC-FSS) models. Unlike existing PC-FSS methods that directly utilize categorical information from support prototypes to recognize novel classes in query samples, our method identifies two critical aspects that substantially enhance model performance by reducing contextual gaps between support prototypes and query features. Specifically, we (1) adapt support background prototypes to match query context while removing extraneous cues that may obscure foreground and background in query samples, and (2) holistically rectify support prototypes under the guidance of query features to emulate the latter having no semantic gap to the query targets. Our proposed designs are agnostic to the feature extractor, rendering them readily applicable to any prototype-based methods. The experimental results on S3DIS and ScanNet demonstrate notable practical benefits, as our approach achieves significant improvements while still maintaining high efficiency.

Discrete hashing methods are thus beneficial because they map high dimensional data to compact binary codes that are efficient to store and process, while preserving semantic similarity. To optimize powerful deep learning methods for image hashing, gradient-based methods are required. Binary codes, however, are discrete and thus have no continuous derivatives. Relaxing the problem by solving it in a continuous space and then quantizing the solution is not guaranteed to yield separable binary codes. The quantization needs to be included in the optimization. In this paper we push for quantization: We optimize maximum class separability in the binary space. We introduce a margin on distances between dissimilar image pairs as measured in the binary space. In addition to pair-wise distances, we draw inspiration from Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (Fisher LDA) to maximize the binary distances between classes and at the same time minimize the binary distance of images within the same class. Experiments on CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and ImageNet100 demonstrate compact codes comparing favorably to the current state of the art."}}

But they still heavily suffer from the limited coverage of intra-class variations from the few-shot supports provided. Motivated by the simple Gestalt principle that pixels belonging to the same object are more similar than those to different objects of same class, we propose a novel self-support matching strategy to alleviate this problem, which uses query prototypes to match query features, where the query prototypes are collected from high-confidence query predictions. This strategy can effectively capture the consistent underlying characteristics of the query objects, and thus fittingly match query features. We also propose an adaptive self-support background prototype generation module and self-support loss to further facilitate the self-support matching procedure. Our self-support network substantially improves the prototype quality, benefits more improvement from stronger backbones and more supports, and achieves SOTA on multiple datasets.
