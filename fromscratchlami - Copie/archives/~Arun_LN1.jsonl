In this work, we consider the use of digital textbooks for programming classes. Generally, students struggle with utilizing textbooks on programming to the maximum, with a possible reason being that the example programs provided as illustration of concepts in these textbooks don't offer sufficient interactivity for students, and thereby not sufficiently motivating to explore or understand these programming examples better. In our work, we explore the idea of enhancing the navigability of intelligent textbooks with the use of ``counterfactual'' questions, to make students think critically about these programs and enhance possible program comprehension. Inspired from previous works on nudging students on counter factual thinking, we present the possibility to enhance digital textbooks with questions generated using GPT. "}}

Additionally, training data used in the development of these automated question generation systems is typically sourced without attention to demographics, but people with different cultural backgrounds may ask different questions. As a part of a broader project to design an intelligent reading support app for Latinx children, we crowdsourced questions from Latinx caregivers and noncaregivers as well as caregivers and noncaregivers from other demographics. We examine variations in question--asking within this dataset mediated by individual, cultural, and contextual factors. We then design a system that automatically extracts templates from this data to generate open--ended questions that are representative of those asked by Latinx caregivers. "}}

Chatbots have recently been used as a persuasive technology to help support behavioral change, making them an intriguing design space for students' study habits and skills. This paper investigated the feasibility of using chatbots for promoting behavioral change of college students majoring in Computer Science (CS). We conducted semi-structured interviews with CS peer-tutors and surveyed university freshmen to understand students' study habits and identify technical intervention opportunities. Inspired by the findings, we designed StudyBuddy, a chatbot prototype deployed in Slack that periodically sends tips, provides assessments of students' study habits via surveys, helps the students break down assignments, recommends academic resources, and sends reminders. We evaluated the usability of the prototype in-depth with 8 students (both first-year and senior students) and 5 course instructors followed by a large scale evaluative survey (n=117) using video of the prototype. Our research identified important design challenges such as building trust and preserving privacy, limiting interaction costs, and supporting both immediate and long-term sustainable support. Likewise, we proposed design recommendations that demonstrate context awareness, personalize the experience based on user preferences, and adapt over time as students mature and grow."}}

These dialogues are often initiated by parent questioning behaviors, but parents do not always engage in this behavior spontaneously. In this paper, we describe an adaptive intervention for dialogic reading, Parent-EMBRACE, built into an iPad application that uses an embodied cognition approach and is designed specifically for Latino dual language learners in the US. The intervention: 1) Models parent question asking, 2) Provides parents with on-demand hints on questions that can be asked at particular moments during the story, 3) Prompts parents to ask questions at appropriate times, 4) Includes a dashboard that presents parents with data on their question-asking behaviors, 5) Provides all support in both English and Spanish. We discuss the implications of this intervention as an intelligent tutoring system for parent-child interactions, plans to extend and evaluate the system."}}
