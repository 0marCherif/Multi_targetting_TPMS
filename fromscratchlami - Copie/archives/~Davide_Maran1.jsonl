Specifically, we study the interaction between a learner (referred to as the configurator) and an agent with a fixed, unknown policy, when the learner aims to minimize her losses by choosing transition functions in online fashion. The losses may be unrelated to the agent's rewards. This problem applies to many real-world scenarios where the learner seeks to manipulate the Markov decision process to her advantage. We study both deterministic and stochastic settings, where the losses are either fixed or sampled from an unknown probability distribution. We design two algorithms whose peculiarity is to rely on occupancy measures to explore with optimism the continuous space of transition functions, achieving constant regret in deterministic settings and $\\mathcal {\\tilde O}(\\sqrt T)$\n regret in stochastic settings, respectively. Moreover, we prove that the regret bound is tight with respect to any constant factor in deterministic settings. Finally, we compare the empiric performance of our algorithms with a baseline in synthetic experiments."}}

When facing a sequential decision-making problem in such a context, the temporal dependence between consecutive observations should be properly accounted for guaranteeing convergence to the optimal policy. In this work, we propose a novel online learning setting, namely, Autoregressive Bandits (ARBs), in which the observed reward is governed by an autoregressive process of order $k$, whose parameters depend on the chosen action. We show that, under mild assumptions on the reward process, the optimal policy can be conveniently computed. Then, we devise a new optimistic regret minimization algorithm, namely, AutoRegressive Upper Confidence Bound (AR-UCB), that suffers sublinear regret of order $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} \\left( \\frac{(k+1)^{3/2}\\sqrt{nT}}{(1-\\Gamma)^2}\\right)$, where $T$ is the optimization horizon, $n$ is the number of actions, and $\\Gamma < 1$ is a stability index of the process. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm in both synthetic and real-world domains, illustrating its advantages w.r.t. relevant bandit baselines."}}
