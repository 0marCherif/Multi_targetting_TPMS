However, it poses a challenging multi-task reinforcement learning problem, as the optimal policy may be quite different across robots and critically depend on the morphology. Existing methods utilize graph neural networks or transformers to handle heterogeneous state and action spaces across different morphologies, but pay little attention to the dependency of a robot's control policy on its morphology context. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical architecture to better model this dependency via contextual modulation, which includes two key submodules: (1) Instead of enforcing hard parameter sharing across robots, we use hypernetworks to generate morphology-dependent control parameters; (2) We propose a fixed attention mechanism that solely depends on the morphology to modulate the interactions between different limbs in a robot. Experimental results show that our method not only improves learning performance on a diverse set of training robots, but also generalizes better to unseen morphologies in a zero-shot fashion."}}

A promising approach for alleviating these limitations is to cast the development of better RL algorithms as a machine learning problem itself in a process called meta-RL. Meta-RL is most commonly studied in a problem setting where, given a distribution of tasks, the goal is to learn a policy that is capable of adapting to any new task from the task distribution with as little data as possible. In this survey, we describe the meta-RL problem setting in detail as well as its major variations. We discuss how, at a high level, meta-RL research can be clustered based on the presence of a task distribution and the learning budget available for each individual task. Using these clusters, we then survey meta-RL algorithms and applications. We conclude by presenting the open problems on the path to making meta-RL part of the standard toolbox for a deep RL practitioner."}}

Estimation of meta-gradients is central to the performance of these meta-algorithms, and has been studied in the setting of MAML-style short-horizon meta-RL problems. In this context, prior work has investigated the estimation of the Hessian of the RL objective, as well as tackling the problem of credit assignment to pre-adaptation behavior by making a sampling correction. However, we show that Hessian estimation, implemented for example by DiCE and its variants, always adds bias and can also add variance to meta-gradient estimation. Meanwhile, meta-gradient estimation has been studied less in the important long-horizon setting, where backpropagation through the full inner optimization trajectories is not feasible. We study the bias and variance tradeoff arising from truncated backpropagation and sampling correction, and additionally compare to evolution strategies, which is a recently popular alternative strategy to long-horizon meta-learning. While prior work implicitly chooses points in this bias-variance space, we disentangle the sources of bias and variance and present an empirical study that relates existing estimators to each other."}}

This new analysis provides a theoretical understanding of the strong performance of two recent actor-critic methods for MARL, i.e., Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO), which both rely on independent ratios, i.e., computing probability ratios separately for each agent's policy. We show that, despite the non-stationarity that independent ratios cause, a monotonic improvement guarantee still arises as a result of enforcing the trust region constraint over joint policies. We also show this trust region constraint can be effectively enforced in a principled way by bounding independent ratios based on the number of agents in training, providing a theoretical foundation for proximal ratio clipping. Moreover, we show that the surrogate objectives optimized in IPPO and MAPPO are essentially equivalent when their critics converge to a fixed point. Finally, our empirical results support the hypothesis that the strong performance of IPPO and MAPPO is a direct result of enforcing such a trust region constraint via clipping in centralized training, and the good values of the hyperparameters for this enforcement are highly sensitive to the number of agents, as predicted by our theoretical analysis.
