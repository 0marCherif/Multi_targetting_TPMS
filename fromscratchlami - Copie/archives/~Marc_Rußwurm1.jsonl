We aim to adapt dynamically to unseen data distributions with model-agnostic meta-learning, where data sampled from each distribution is seen as a task with only a few annotated samples. Transductive batch normalization layers are often employed in meta-learning models, as they reach the highest numerical accuracy on the class-balanced target tasks used as meta-learning benchmarks. In this work, we demonstrate empirically that transductive batch normalization collapses when deployed on a real class-imbalanced land cover classification problem. We propose a solution to replace batch normalization with instance normalization. This modification consistently outperformed all other normalization alternatives across different meta-learning algorithms in our class-imbalanced land cover classification test tasks."}}

For this purpose, we propose a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network TransGrow that combines convolutions for spatial modeling and a transformer for temporal modeling, enabling time-dependent image generation of above-ground plant phenotypes. Thereby, we achieve the following advantages over comparable data imputation approaches: (1) The model is conditioned by an incomplete image sequence of arbitrary length, the input time points, and the requested output time point, allowing multiple growth stages to be generated in a targeted manner; (2) By considering a stochastic component and generating a distribution for each point in time, the uncertainty in plant growth is considered and can be visualized; (3) Besides interpolation, also test-extrapolation can be performed to generate future plant growth stages. Experiments based on two datasets of different complexity levels are presented: Laboratory single plant sequences with Arabidopsis\u00a0thaliana and agricultural drone image sequences showing crop mixtures. When comparing TransGrow to interpolation in image space, variational, and adversarial autoencoder, it demonstrates significant improvements in image quality, measured by multi-scale structural similarity, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and Fr\u00e9chet inception distance. To our knowledge, TransGrow is the first approach for time- and image-dependent, high-quality generation of plant images based on incomplete sequences."}}

On natural images, human vision typically outperforms deep learning approaches on few-shot learning. However, we hypothesize that aerial and satellite images are more challenging to the human eye. This applies particularly when the image resolution is comparatively low, as with the 10m ground sampling distance of Sentinel-2. In this study, we benchmark model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithms against human participants on few-shot land cover classification with Sentinel-2 imagery on the Sen12MS dataset. We find that categorization of land cover from globally distributed regions is a difficult task for the participants, who classified the given images less accurately than the MAML-trained model and with a highly variable success rate. This suggest that hand-labeling land cover directly on Sentinel-2 imagery is not optimal when tackling a new land cover classification problem. Labeling only a few images and employing a trained meta-learning model to this task may lead to more accurate and consistent solutions compared to hand labeling by multiple individuals."}}

Machine Learning provides a framework for the efficient mining of such big data. Here, we focus on unsupervised mining of the data via clustering the similar temporal patterns and data-driven displacement signal reconstruction from the InSAR time series. We propose a deep Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder model which can exploit temporal relations in contrast to the commonly used shallow learning methods, such as Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). We also modify the loss function to allow the quantification of uncertainties in the time series data. The two approaches are applied to the Lazufre Volcanic Complex located at the central volcanic zone of the Andes and thereby compared."}}

Equipping existing deep learning models with an (general) notion of uncertainty can help mitigate both these issues. The Bayesian deep learning community has developed model-agnostic methodology to estimate both data and model uncertainty that can be implemented on top of existing deep learning models. In this work, we test this methodology for deep recurrent satellite time series forecasting and test its assumptions on data and model uncertainty. We tested its effectiveness on an application on climate change where the activity of seasonal vegetation decreased over multiple years."}}

For instance, the appearance of urban areas differs between continents, and seasonality influences the appearance of vegetation. To capture the diversity within a single category, such as urban or vegetation, requires a large model capacity and, consequently, large datasets. In this work, we propose a different perspective and view this diversity as an inductive transfer learning problem where few data samples from one region allow a model to adapt to an unseen region. We evaluate the modelagnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm on classification and segmentation tasks using globally and regionally distributed datasets. We find that few-shot model adaptation outperforms pre-training with regular gradient descent and fine-tuning on the (1) Sen12MS dataset and (2) DeepGlobe dataset when the source domain and target domain differ. This indicates that model optimization with meta-learning may benefit tasks in the Earth sciences whose data show a high degree of diversity from region to region, while traditional gradient-based supervised learning remains suitable in the absence of a feature or label shift."}}
