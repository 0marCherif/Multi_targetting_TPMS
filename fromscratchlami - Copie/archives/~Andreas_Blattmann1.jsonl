Compared to previous versions of Stable Diffusion, SDXL leverages a three times larger UNet backbone: The increase of model parameters is mainly due to more attention blocks and a larger cross-attention context as SDXL uses a second text encoder. We design multiple novel conditioning schemes and train SDXL on multiple aspect ratios. We also introduce a refinement model which is used to improve the visual fidelity of samples generated by SDXL using a post-hoc image-to-image technique. We demonstrate that SDXL shows drastically improved performance compared the previous versions of Stable Diffusion and achieves results competitive with those of black-box state-of-the-art image generators. In the spirit of promoting open research and fostering transparency in large model training and evaluation, we provide access to code and model weights at https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models"}}

Here, we apply the LDM paradigm to high-resolution video generation, a particularly resource-intensive task. We first pre-train an LDM on images only; then, we turn the image generator into a video generator by introducing a temporal dimension to the latent space diffusion model and fine-tuning on encoded image sequences, i.e., videos. Similarly, we temporally align diffusion model upsamplers, turning them into temporally consistent video super resolution models. We focus on two relevant real-world applications: Simulation of in-the-wild driving data and creative content creation with text-to-video modeling. In particular, we validate our Video LDM on real driving videos of resolution 512 x 1024, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, our approach can easily leverage off-the-shelf pre-trained image LDMs, as we only need to train a temporal alignment model in that case. Doing so, we turn the publicly available, state-of-the-art text-to-image LDM Stable Diffusion into an efficient and expressive text-to-video model with resolution up to 1280 x 2048. We show that the temporal layers trained in this way generalize to different fine-tuned text-to-image LDMs. Utilizing this property, we show the first results for personalized text-to-video generation, opening exciting directions for future content creation.

Much of this success is due to the scalability of these architectures and hence caused by a dramatic increase in model complexity and in the computational resources invested in training these models. Our work questions the underlying paradigm of compressing large training data into ever growing parametric representations. We rather present an orthogonal, semi-parametric approach. We complement comparably small diffusion or autoregressive models with a separate image database and a retrieval strategy. During training we retrieve a set of nearest neighbors from this external database for each training instance and condition the generative model on these informative samples. While the retrieval approach is providing the (local) content, the model is focusing on learning the composition of scenes based on this content. As demonstrated by our experiments, simply swapping the database for one with different contents transfers a trained model post-hoc to a novel domain. The evaluation shows competitive performance on tasks which the generative model has not been trained on, such as class-conditional synthesis, zero-shot stylization or text-to-image synthesis without requiring paired text-image data. With negligible memory and computational overhead for the external database and retrieval we can significantly reduce the parameter count of the generative model and still outperform the state-of-the-art."}}

Much of this success is due to a dramatic increase in the computational capacity invested in training these models. This work presents an alternative approach: inspired by its successful application in natural language processing, we propose to complement the diffusion model with a retrieval-based approach and to introduce an explicit memory in the form of an external database. During training, our diffusion model is trained with similar visual features retrieved via CLIP and from the neighborhood of each training instance. By leveraging CLIP's joint image-text embedding space, our model achieves highly competitive performance on tasks for which it has not been explicitly trained, such as class-conditional or text-image synthesis, and can be conditioned on both text and image embeddings. Moreover, we can apply our approach to unconditional generation, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our approach incurs low computational and memory overheads and is easy to implement. We discuss its relationship to concurrent work and will publish code and pretrained models soon."}}

Of particular note is the field of ``AI-Art'', which has seen unprecedented growth with the emergence of powerful multimodal models such as CLIP. By combining speech and image synthesis models, so-called ``prompt-engineering'' has become established, in which carefully selected and composed sentences are used to achieve a certain visual style in the synthesized image. In this note, we present an alternative approach based on retrieval-augmented diffusion models (RDMs). In RDMs, a set of nearest neighbors is retrieved from an external database during training for each training instance, and the diffusion model is conditioned on these informative samples. During inference (sampling), we replace the retrieval database with a more specialized database that contains, for example, only images of a particular visual style. This provides a novel way to prompt a general trained model after training and thereby specify a particular visual style. As shown by our experiments, this approach is superior to specifying the visual style within the text prompt. We open-source code and model weights at https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion ."}}

This naturally suggests a bijective mapping between the video domain and the static content as well as residual information. In contrast to common stochastic image-to-video synthesis, such a model does not merely generate arbitrary videos progressing the initial image. Given this image, it rather provides a one-to-one mapping between the residual vectors and the video with stochastic outcomes when sampling. The approach is naturally implemented using a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) that can explain videos by independently modelling static and other video characteristics, thus laying the basis for controlled video synthesis. Experiments on diverse video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both the quality and diversity of the synthesized results.
