We evaluate an algorithm by its robustness $R$, which is its performance relative to that of the optimal offline matching, and its consistency $C$, which is its performance when the advice or the prediction given is correct.  We characterize for this problem the Pareto-efficient frontier between robustness and consistency, which is rare in the literature on advice-augmented algorithms, yet necessary for quantifying such an algorithm to be optimal. Specifically, we propose an algorithm that is $R$-robust and $C$-consistent for any $(R,C)$ with $0 \\leq R \\leq \\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\sqrt{1-R} + \\sqrt{1-C} = 1$, and prove that no other algorithm can achieve a better tradeoff."}}

We present a new framework in which  historical samples   are generated from unknown and different distributions, which we dub  \\textit{heterogeneous environments}.  These distributions are assumed to lie in a heterogeneity ball with known radius and centered around the (also) unknown future (out-of-sample) distribution on which the performance of a decision will be evaluated. We quantify the asymptotic worst-case regret that is achievable by central data-driven policies such as Sample Average Approximation, but also by rate-optimal ones,   as a function of the radius of the heterogeneity ball. Our work shows that the type of achievable performance varies considerably across different combinations of problem classes and notions of heterogeneity. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework by comparing achievable guarantees for the heterogeneous version of widely studied  data-driven problems such as  pricing, ski-rental, and newsvendor. \nEn route, we establish a new connection between data-driven decision-making and distributionally robust optimization."}}
