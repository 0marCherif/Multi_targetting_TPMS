We show that for a large class of objective functions, the convex approximation obtained from the Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT) admits optimal solutions that exhibit a sparsity pattern. This characteristic of the optimal solutions allows us to conclude that (i) a linear matrix inequality constraint, which is often added to tighten the relaxation, is vacuously satisfied and can thus be omitted, and (ii) the number of decision variables in the RLT relaxation can be reduced from $${\\mathcal {O}} (n^2)$$ O ( n 2 ) to $${\\mathcal {O}} (n)$$ O ( n ) . Taken together, both observations allow us to reduce computation times by up to several orders of magnitude. Our results can be specialized to indefinite quadratic optimization problems over simplices and extended to non-convex optimization problems over the Cartesian product of two simplices as well as specific classes of polyhedral and non-convex feasible regions. Our numerical experiments illustrate the promising performance of the proposed framework."}}

While the resulting classification scheme displays a promising performance in numerical experiments, it is inherently limited to numerical features. In this paper, we show that distributionally robust logistic regression with mixed (\\emph{i.e.}, numerical and categorical) features, despite amounting to an optimization problem of exponential size, admits a polynomial-time solution scheme. We subsequently develop a practically efficient cutting plane approach that solves the problem as a sequence of polynomial-time solvable exponential conic programs. Our method retains many of the desirable theoretical features of previous works, but---in contrast to the literature---it does not admit an equivalent representation as a regularized logistic regression, that is, it represents a genuinely novel variant of the logistic regression problem. We show that our method outperforms both the unregularized and the regularized logistic regression on categorical as well as mixed-feature benchmark instances."}}
