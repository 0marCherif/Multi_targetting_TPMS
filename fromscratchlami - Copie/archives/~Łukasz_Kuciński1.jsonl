Although there has been a significant push to introduce similar approaches in reinforcement learning, these have not yet succeeded on a comparable scale. In this paper, we take a step towards understanding and closing this gap by highlighting one of the problems specific to foundation RL models, namely the data shift occurring during fine-tuning. We show that fine-tuning on compositional tasks, where parts of the environment might only be available after a long training period, is inherently prone to catastrophic forgetting. In such a scenario, a pre-trained model might forget useful knowledge before even seeing parts of the state space it can solve. We provide examples of both a grid world and realistic robotic scenarios where catastrophic forgetting occurs. Finally, we show how this problem can be mitigated by using tools from continual learning. We discuss the potential impact of this finding and propose further research directions."}}

Previous works often use intricate symbolic methods, rely on domain knowledge, and require significant engineering effort to solve this task. In this work, we show that Magnushammer, a neural transformer-based approach, can outperform traditional symbolic systems by a large margin. Tested on the PISA benchmark, Magnushammer achieves $59.5\\%$ proof rate compared to a $38.3\\%$ proof rate of Sledgehammer, the most mature and popular symbolic-based solver. Furthermore, by combining Magnushammer with a neural formal prover based on a language model, we significantly improve the previous state-of-the-art proof rate from $57.0\\%$ to $71.0\\%$."}}

A verification mechanism is employed to filter out unreachable subgoals swiftly, allowing to focus on feasible further subgoals. In this way, AdaSubS benefits from the efficiency of planning with longer subgoals and the fine control with the shorter ones, and thus scales well to difficult planning problems. We show that AdaSubS significantly surpasses hierarchical planning algorithms on three complex reasoning tasks: Sokoban, the Rubik's Cube, and inequality proving benchmark INT."}}

Consequently, this study aims to broaden our understanding of transfer and its driving forces in the specific case of continual reinforcement learning. We adopt SAC as the underlying RL algorithm and Continual World as a suite of continuous control tasks. We systematically study how different components of SAC (the actor and the critic, exploration, and data) affect transfer efficacy, and we provide recommendations regarding various modeling options. The best set of choices, dubbed ClonEx-SAC, is evaluated on the recent Continual World benchmark. ClonEx-SAC achieves 87% final success rate compared to 80% of PackNet, the best method in the benchmark. Moreover, the transfer grows from 0.18 to 0.54 according to the metric provided by Continual World."}}
