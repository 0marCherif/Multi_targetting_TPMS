In turn, this enables to sequentially select functions to explore by maximizing an expected improvement acquisition functional while keeping the typical computational tractability of standard BO settings. We introduce graphical criteria that establish when considering functional interventions allows attaining better target effects, and conditions under which selected interventions are also optimal for conditional target effects. We demonstrate the benefits of the method in a synthetic and in a real-world causal graph."}}

In the context of representation learning, there is an extensive literature relating model architectures with regularization techniques to solve this problem using observational data. However, theoretically motivated loss functions and bounds on generalization errors only exist in select circumstances, such as in the presence of binary treatments. In this paper, we introduce new bounds on the counterfactual generalization error in the context of multiple treatments and continuous dosage parameters, which subsume existing results. This result, in a principled manner, guides the definition of new learning objectives that can be used to train representation learning algorithms. We show empirically new state-of-the-art performance results across several benchmark datasets for this problem, including in comparison to doubly-robust estimation methods."}}

There exists a growing literature that argues for learning invariant associations using data from multiple source domains. However, whether invariant predictors generalize to a given target domain depends crucially on the assumed structural changes between domains. Using the perspective of transportability theory, we show that invariance learning, and the settings in which invariant predictors are optimal in terms of worst-case losses, is a special case of a more general partial transportability task. Specifically, the partial transportability task seeks to identify / bound a conditional expectation $\\mathbb E_{P_{\\pi^*}}[y\\mid\\mathbf x]$ in an unseen domain $\\pi^*$ using knowledge of qualitative changes across domains in the form of causal graphs and data from source domains $\\pi^1,\\dots,\\pi^k$. We show that solutions to this problem have a much wider generalization guarantee that subsumes those of invariance learning and other robust optimization methods that are inspired by causality. For computations in practice, we develop an algorithm that provably provides tight bounds asymptotically in the number of data samples from source domains for any partial transportability problem with discrete observables and illustrate its use on synthetic datasets.

Most identifiability results and learning algorithms assume the underlying dynamics to be discrete in time. Comparatively few, in contrast, explicitly define dependencies in infinitesimal intervals of time, independently of the scale of observation and of the regularity of sampling. In this paper, we consider score-based structure learning for the study of dynamical systems. We prove that for vector fields parameterized in a large class of neural networks, least squares optimization with adaptive regularization schemes consistently recovers directed graphs of local independencies in systems of stochastic differential equations. Using this insight, we propose a score-based learning algorithm based on penalized Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (modelling the mean process) that we show to be applicable to the general setting of irregularly-sampled multivariate time series and to outperform the state of the art across a range of dynamical systems."}}

Starting from the premise that imputation methods should preserve the causal structure of the data, we develop a regularization scheme that encourages any baseline imputation method to be causally consistent with the underlying data generating mechanism. Our proposal is a causally-aware imputation algorithm (MIRACLE). MIRACLE iteratively refines the imputation of a baseline by simultaneously modeling the missingness generating mechanism, encouraging imputation to be consistent with the causal structure of the data. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and a variety of publicly available datasets to show that MIRACLE is able to consistently improve imputation over a variety of benchmark methods across all three missingness scenarios: at random, completely at random, and not at random."}}

In some cases, the reason lies in a misappreciation of the causal structure that governs the data, and in particular as a consequence of the influence of unobserved confounders that drive changes in observed distributions and distort correlations. In this paper, we argue for defining generalization with respect to a broader class of distribution shifts (defined as arising from interventions in the underlying causal model), including changes in observed, unobserved and target variable distributions. We propose a new robust learning principle that may be paired with any gradient-based learning algorithm. This learning principle has explicit generalization guarantees, and relates robustness with certain invariances in the causal model, clarifying why, in some cases, test performance lags training performance. We demonstrate the empirical performance of our approach on healthcare data from different modalities, including image and speech data."}}

Our contribution is a new test statistic based on samples from a generative adversarial network designed to approximate directly a conditional distribution that encodes the null hypothesis, in a manner that maximizes power (the rate of true negatives). We show that such an approach requires only that density approximation be viable in order to ensure that we control type I error (the rate of false positives); in particular, no assumptions need to be made on the form of the distributions or feature dependencies. Using synthetic simulations with high-dimensional data we demonstrate significant gains in power over competing methods. In addition, we illustrate the use of our test to discover causal markers of disease in genetic data."}}

Learning to predict time-to-event probabilities for these patients is a challenging problem because the risks of events are correlated (there are competing risks) with often only few patients experiencing individual events of interest, and of those only a fraction are actually observed in the data. We introduce in this paper a survival model with the flexibility to leverage a common representation of related events that is designed to correct for the strong imbalance in observed outcomes. The procedure is sequential: outcome-specific survival distributions form the components of nonparametric multivariate estimators which we combine into an ensemble in such a way as to ensure accurate predictions on all outcome types simultaneously. Our algorithm is general and represents the first boosting-like method for time-to-event data with multiple outcomes. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on synthetic and real data."}}
