We propose a dataset with paired visual and tactile data called Touch and Go, in which human data collectors probe objects in natural environments using tactile sensors, while simultaneously recording egocentric video. In contrast to previous efforts, which have largely been confined to lab settings or simulated environments, our dataset spans a large number of \u201cin the wild\u201d objects and scenes. We successfully apply our dataset to a variety of multimodal learning tasks: 1) self-supervised visuo-tactile feature learning, 2) tactile-driven image stylization, i.e., making the visual appearance of an object more consistent with a given tactile signal, and 3) predicting future frames of a tactile signal from visuo-tactile inputs."}}

In practice, new images are usually made available in a consecutive manner, leading to a problem called Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS). Typically, CSS faces the forgetting problem since previous training images are unavailable, and the semantic shift problem of the background class. Considering the semantic segmentation as a context-dependent pixel-level classification task, we explore CSS from a new perspective of context analysis in this paper. We observe that the context of old-class pixels in the new images is much more biased on new classes than that in the old images, which can sharply aggravate the old-class forgetting and new-class overfitting. To tackle the obstacle, we propose a biased-context-rectified CSS framework with a context-rectified image-duplet learning scheme and a biased-context-insensitive consistency loss. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive re-weighting class-balanced learning strategy for the biased class distribution. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in existing CSS scenarios. Code is available in https://github.com/sntc129/RBC ."}}

First, foreground objects are tiny in the remote sensing images and are represented by only a few pixels, which leads to large foreground intra-class variance and undermines the discrimination between foreground classes (issue firstly considered in this work). Second, background class contains complex context, which results in false alarms due to large background intra-class variance. To alleviate these two issues, we construct a sparse and complete latent structure via prototypes. In particular, to enhance the sparsity of the latent space, we design a prototypical contrastive learning to have prototypes of the same category clustering together and prototypes of different categories to be far away from each other. Also, we strengthen the completeness of the latent space by modeling all foreground categories and hardest (nearest) background objects. We further design a patch shuffle augmentation for remote sensing images with complicated contexts. Our augmentation encourages the semantic information of an object to be correlated only to the limited context within the patch that is specific to its category, which further reduces large intra-class variance. We conduct extensive evaluations on a large scale remote sensing dataset, showing our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin."}}
