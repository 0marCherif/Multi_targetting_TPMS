Drawing upon the explainable artificial intelligence literature and elaboration likelihood model, we investigate the interaction effects of explanation specificity of AIs and issue involvement of users. We used a 3x2 experiment design with 456 participants to verify the proposed research model. We found that for individuals of low issue involvement, AI with global explanation is more effective, while AI feature-based explanation is more\neffective in influencing high issues involved individuals on their fairness perceptions of AI decisions, consequently leading to their trusting intentions towards AI decision-making systems. This study significantly contributes to the theoretical landscape of AI fairness and human-AI interaction, and provide important practical contributions for AI designers."}}

A well-trained model will be outdated if concept drift occurs. Once concept drift is detected, it is necessary to understand where the drift occurs to support the drift adaptation strategy and effectively update the outdated models. This process, called drift understanding, has rarely been studied in this area. To fill this gap, this article develops a drift region-based data sample filtering method to update the obsolete model and track the new data pattern accurately. The proposed method can effectively identify the drift region and utilize information on the drift region to filter the data sample for training models. The theoretical proof guarantees the identified drift region converges uniformly to the real drift region as the sample size increases. Experimental evaluations based on four synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets demonstrate our method improves the learning accuracy when dealing with data streams involving concept drift."}}

However, existing informed drift adaptation methods need to wait for an entire batch of data to detect drift and then update the predictor (if drift is detected), which causes adaptation delay. To overcome the adaptation delay, we propose a sequentially updated statistic, called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">drift-gradient</i> to quantify the increase of distributional discrepancy when every new instance arrives. Based on drift-gradient, a segment-based drift adaptation (SEGA) method is developed to online update our best predictor. Drift-gradient is defined on a segment in the training set. It can precisely quantify the increase of distributional discrepancy between the old segment and the newest segment when <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">only one</i> new instance is available at each time point.

Based on the drift-gradient, SEGA retrains our best predictors with the segments that have the minimum drift-gradient when every new instance arrives. SEGA has been validated by extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world, classification and regression data streams. The experimental results show that SEGA outperforms competitive blind and informed drift adaptation methods."}}

Using concept drift adaptation techniques to predict the target variable(s) of real-time data streams has gained the ever-increasing attention of researchers in recent years. This research aims to develop a set of concept drift adaptation methods for predicting the target variable of real-time data streams. The literature review reveals two issues in the area of concept drift: i) how the concept drift problem limits the learning capability; ii) how to make adaptation in more realistic scenarios that data streams have uncertainties other than concept drift. To address the issue i), this research discovers three root causes of limited learning capability when concept drift occurs. It is found that when concept drift occurs in a data stream, the prediction accuracy is decreased because 1) the training set contains more than one patterns so that the predictor cannot be well-learned; 2) a newly arrived data instance may present old patterns but an old instance presents the new pattern; and 3) few data instances are available when a new concept is identified at its early stage. Three concept drift adaptation methods are designed to address the three situations separately. Situation 1) is solved by developing a \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude3b\ud835\ude3b\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude28-\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f (FUZZ-CARE) approach. FUZZ-CARE can learn how many patterns exist in the training set and the membership degree of each instance belonging to each pattern; To learn the predictor with the most relevant data rather than the newest arrived data, a \ud835\ude34\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35-\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude25\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude27\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f (SEGA) method to sequentially pick out the best segments in the training data to update the predictors.

To address the issue ii), this research discusses the concept drift phenomenon under two scenarios that are more realistic. One is to solve the concept drift problem when data is noisy. A \ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude26-\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude25\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude27\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f (NoA) method is designed for handling concept drift when the data stream contains signal noise; the other is to solve the concept drift problem when data also contains temporal dependency. A theoretical study is conducted for the regression of data streams with concept drift and temporal dependency, and based on this study, a \ud835\ude25\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude27\ud835\ude35-\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f (DAR) framework is established. To conclude, this thesis not only provides a set of effective drift adaptation methods for real-time prediction, but also contributes to the development of concept drift area."}}

Once concept drift occurs, a stationary machine learning predictor will probably be invalid because the testing data have a different data distribution from that of the training data. Recent studies in data streams aim to address this issue by concept drift adaptation techniques. Concept drift adaptation methods update the predictor by time and have been validated to provide accurate real-time prediction for a single data stream. However, handling multiple relevant data streams is still an unsolved challenge in this area, considering many real-world applications generate multiple data streams that are simultaneously evolving. To fill this gap, we here present a predicting network for multiple data streams, named MuNet. MuNet leverages the dependency between data streams to efficiently lower down the computational cost of real-time predictions for multiple data streams. In MuNet, an online-learned Bayesian neural network (BNN) is designed as a connector between streams. The BNN-connector can continuously use the real-time information from only one base stream to correct the stationary predictor for the other streams, which avoids the high cost caused by repeated adaptation."}}

Once the data pattern changes, a well-trained model built on the previous, now obsolete data cannot provide an accurate prediction for future data. To obtain reliable prediction, it is important to understand the existing patterns in the data stream and to know which pattern the current examples belong to during the modeling process. However, it is ambiguous to classify an example to a certain pattern in many real-world cases. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive regression approach, called FUZZ-CARE, to dynamically recognize, train, and store patterns, and assign the membership degree of the upcoming examples belonging to these patterns. Membership degrees are presented by the membership matrix obtained from a kernel fuzzy c-means clustering, which is synchronously trained and adapted with regression parameters. Rather than designing a complicated procedure to continuously chase the newest pattern, which is a common approach in the literature, FUZZ-CARE abstracts useful past information to help predict newly arrived examples. It thus effectively avoids the risk of insufficient training due to the lack of new data and improves prediction accuracy. Experiments on six synthetic datasets and 21 real-world datasets validate the high accuracy and robustness of our approach."}}

Currently, techniques related to the concept drift problem focus on single data stream. However, it normally needs to handle multiple relevant data streams in the real-world application. Current concept drift methods can not be directly used in the multistream setting. They can only be limitedly applied on each stream separately, which omits the drift correlation between streams. In the multi-stream scenario, when drift occurs in a stream, other streams may face or have faced a similar drift problem as well. This pattern of simultaneous or delayed occurrence of drift is critical to analyze and predict multiple streams as a whole dynamic system. To fill the gap in the multi-stream scenario, this paper proposes a fuzzy drift variance (FDV) to measure the correlated drift patterns among streams. FDA is able to present how the pattern of drift occurrence for any two streams correlates and how delayed this correlation is. Seven synthetic streams are designed to validate FDA. The experimental results show a good presentation ability of FDA for drift-correlated multiple streams."}}

Current drift detection and adaptation methods focus on how to immediately detect the distribution changes once the concept drift occurs and swiftly update the model to be applicable to the newly arrived data instances. Most of those methods assume the data does not have noise or the noise is too weak to affect the modeling procedure. However, realworld data are normally contaminated, and denoise techniques are highly preferred as a necessary preprocess. This issue is more complex for a data stream with concept drift because the noise is very likely to be confused with drift. Motivated by that, this paper proposes a Noise-tolerant Fuzzy c-means based drift Adaptation method (NFA) which can adapt to the changing distributions and is suitable for noisy data streams. The concept drift problem is solved by using a fuzzy c-means based regression model to continuously include the most relevant data instances to the latest pattern in the training set. In addition, a denoise technique is designed in NFA to remove noise, and the ability of incremental updating enables it to be embedded in the incremental drift adaptation process, and therefore NFA can solve concept drift and noise problems at the same time. Experimental evaluation results also show good performance of our method on handling data streams with concept drift and noise."}}
