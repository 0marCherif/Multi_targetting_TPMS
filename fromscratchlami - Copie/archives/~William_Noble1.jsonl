In particular, the organization of chromatin into A and B compartments segregates its active regions from inactive regions. Therefore, these compartments can shed light on cell type-specific activities of the genome. However, obtaining Hi-C data for all cell and tissue types of interest is prohibitively expensive, which has limited the widespread consideration of compartment status. We present a  prediction tool called Compartment prediction using Recurrent Neural Network (CoRNN) that models the relationship between the compartmental organization of the genome and histone modification enrichment. Our model predicts A/B compartments, in a cross-cell type setting, with an average area under the ROC curve of 90.9%. Our cell type-specific compartment predictions show high overlap with known functional elements. We investigate our predictions by systematically removing combinations of histone marks and find that H3K27ac and H3K36me3 are the most predictive marks. We perform a detailed analysis of loci where compartment status cannot be accurately predicted from these marks. These regions represent chromatin with ambiguous compartmental status, likely due to variations in status within the population of cells. These ambiguous loci also show highly variable compartmental status between biological replicates in the same GM12878 cell type. Finally, we demonstrate the generalizability of our model by predicting compartments in independent tissue samples. Available at: https://github.com/rsinghlab/CoRNN"}}

Existing approaches most often rely on a two-step algorithm: first, convert the contact counts into distances, then optimize an objective function akin to multidimensional scaling (MDS) to infer a 3D model. Other approaches use a maximum likelihood approach, modeling the contact counts between two loci as a Poisson random variable whose intensity is a decreasing function of the distance between them. However, a Poisson model of contact counts implies that the variance of the data is equal to the mean, a relationship that is often too restrictive to properly model count data."}}

Single-cell alignment using optimal transport (SCOT) is an unsupervised algorithm that addresses this limitation by using optimal transport to align single-cell multiomics data. First, it preserves the local geometry by constructing a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graph for each data set (or domain) to capture the intra-domain distances. SCOT then finds a probabilistic coupling matrix that minimizes the discrepancy between the intra-domain distance matrices. Finally, it uses the coupling matrix to project one single-cell data set onto another through barycentric projection, thus aligning them. SCOT requires tuning only two hyperparameters and is robust to the choice of one. Furthermore, the Gromov-Wasserstein distance in the algorithm can guide SCOT's hyperparameter tuning in a fully unsupervised setting when no orthogonal alignment information is available. Thus, SCOT is a fast and accurate alignment method that provides a heuristic for hyperparameter selection in a real-world unsupervised single-cell data alignment scenario. We provide a tutorial for SCOT and make its source code publicly available on GitHub."}}

However, with the exception of a few of co-assaying technologies, it is not possible to simultaneously apply different sequencing assays on the same single cell. In this scenario, computational integration of multi-omic measurements is crucial to enable joint analyses. This integration task is particularly challenging due to the lack of sample-wise or feature-wise correspondences. We present single-cell alignment with optimal transport (SCOT), an unsupervised algorithm that uses the Gromov\u2013Wasserstein optimal transport to align single-cell multi-omics data sets. SCOT performs on par with the current state-of-the-art unsupervised alignment methods, is faster, and requires tuning of fewer hyperparameters. More importantly, SCOT uses a self-tuning heuristic to guide hyperparameter selection based on the Gromov\u2013Wasserstein distance. Thus, in the fully unsupervised setting, SCOT aligns single-cell data sets better than the existing methods without requiring any orthogonal correspondence information."}}

However, the sparsity of single-cell measurements and the limited number of cells measured in typical co-assay datasets impedes the power of cross-modality translation. Here, we propose Polarbear, a semi-supervised translation framework to predict cross-modality profiles that is trained using a combination of co-assay data and traditional \u201csingle-assay\u201d data. Polarbear uses single-assay and co-assay data to train an autoencoder for each modality and then uses just the co-assay data to train a translator between the embedded representations learned by the autoencoders. With this approach, Polarbear is able to translate between modalities with improved accuracy relative to state-of-the-art translation techniques. As an added benefit of the training procedure, we show that Polarbear also produces a matching of cells across modalities."}}

A standard formulation is the sparsest flow decomposition problem, which is known to be NP-hard. In this work, we consider a multi-sample variant of this problem, motivated by the problem of identifying and quantifying proteoforms from mass spectrometry data, where multiple views of the graph can be obtained from multiple biological samples. We derive necessary conditions for the set of samples to unambiguously determine the ground truth set of paths, and we design an algorithm with matching sufficient conditions for a large class of problem instances, making our algorithm information optimal for this class of problem instances. The necessary conditions, combined with a probabilistic model for sample generation, yield a characterization of the number of samples needed for unambiguous recovery of the underlying paths. We analyze the algorithm\u2019s performance on flow data simulated on peptide graphs from real mass spectrometry data."}}

Polarbear learns to translate between modalities by using data from co-assay measurements coupled with the large quantity of single-assay data available in public databases. This semi-supervised scheme mitigates issues related to low cell quantities and high sparsity in co-assay data. Polarbear first pre-trains a beta-variational autoencoder for each modality using both co-assay and single-assay profiles to learn robust representations of individual cells, and it then uses the co-assay labels to train a translator between these cell representations. This semi-supervised framework enables us to predict missing modality profiles and match single cells across modalities with improved accuracy compared with fully supervised methods, thus facilitating multimodal data integration."}}
