There has been no systematic study of the complexity of diagnosing real-world problems, and few good benchmarks exist to test this. Real-world-graphs, a mathematical framework that has been proposed as a model for complex systems, have empirically been shown to capture several topological properties of real-world systems. We describe the adequacy with which a real-world-graph can characterise the complexity of model-based diagnostic inference on real-world systems. We empirically compare the inference complexity of diagnosing models automatically generated using the real-world graph framework with comparable models from well-known ISCAS circuit benchmarks. We identify parameters necessary for the real-world graph framework to generate benchmark diagnosis circuit models with realistic properties."}}

However, no real-time solutions currently exist for novel faults: e.g., isolating the underlying fault and implementing an appropriate control may be too time-consuming or require a priori fault information. For such circumstances, we propose a novel approach that uses fast randomized control switching to stabilize a system, without any state estimation. We first show theoretically that, for a properly tuned controller, a randomized approach guarantees mean-square stability and is guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution. We then empirically demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on trajectory following in a quadcopter UAV."}}

Consequently, a method of controlling autonomous systems (ASs) that integrates control inputs from humans and machines is critical. We describe a framework for blended autonomy, in which humans and ASs interact with varying degrees of control to safely achieve a task. We empirically compare collaborative control tasks in which the human and AS have identical or conflicting objectives, under three main control frameworks: (1) leader-follower control (based on Stackelberg games); (2) blended control; and (3) switching control. We validate our results on a car steering control model, given communication delays, noise and different collaboration levels."}}

We characterize this application domain using a class of discrete-event systems, max-plus linear discrete-event systems, which captures synchronization without concurrency or selection. The model framework of these hybrid systems is non-linear in a conventional algebra, but linear in the max-plus algebra, thereby enabling linear-time inference. We use an observer-based framework for monitoring and diagnosing max-plus diagnostics models, and further improve computational efficiency by searching over only the most-likely space of behaviours. We illustrate our approach using a chemical process-control example.

We introduce a novel state filter algorithm to further improve the performance of state-of-the-art approaches based on Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models. The proposed algorithm merges two techniques, which are typically used separately: linear correction, as seen in the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), and resampling, as used in the Particle Filter (PF). We compare the inferential accuracy of our approach against the EnKF and the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF), using algorithms employing both an uncentered covariance matrix (UCM) and the standard column-centered covariance matrix (CCM). Our algorithm requires O(DN) more time than EnKF does, where D is the ensemble dimension and N denotes the ensemble size. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm with UCM achieves the lowest root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and the highest correlation coefficient (CORR) amongst the selected methods, in 11 out of 14 major real-world scenarios. We show that the EnKF with UCM outperforms the EnKF with CCM, while the EAKF gains better accuracy with CCM in most scenarios."}}
