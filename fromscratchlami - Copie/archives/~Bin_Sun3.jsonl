One promising approach to obtaining a high-performance and lightweight model is knowledge distillation, which relies heavily on the pre-trained powerful teacher. Collaborative learning, also known as online knowledge distillation, is an effective way to conduct one-stage group distillation in the absence of a well-trained large teacher model. However, previous work has a severe branch homogeneity problem due to the same training objective and the independent identical training sets. To alleviate this problem, we consider the dialogue attributes in the training of network branches. Each branch learns the attribute-related features based on the selected subset. Furthermore, we propose a dual group-based knowledge distillation method, consisting of positive distillation and negative distillation, to further diversify the features of different branches in a steadily and interpretable way. The proposed approach significantly improves branch heterogeneity and outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative learning methods on two widely used open-domain dialogue datasets."}}

To alleviate these problems, methods like introducing external information, reconstructing the optimization function, and manipulating data samples are proposed, while they primarily focus on avoiding training with CDM, inevitably weakening the model's ability of understanding CDM in human conversations and limiting further improvements in model performance. This paper proposes a Sentence Semantic \\textbf{Seg}mentation guided \\textbf{C}onditional \\textbf{V}ariational \\textbf{A}uto-\\textbf{E}ncoder (SegCVAE) method which can model and take advantages of the CDM data. Specifically, to tackle the incoherent problem caused by one-to-many, SegCVAE uses response-related prominent semantics to constrained the latent variable. To mitigate the non-diverse problem brought by many-to-one, SegCVAE segments multiple prominent semantics to enrich the latent variables. Three novel components, Internal Separation, External Guidance, and Semantic Norms, are proposed to achieve SegCVAE. On dialogue generation tasks, both the automatic and human evaluation results show that SegCVAE achieves new state-of-the-art performance."}}

Previous filtering strategies usually rely on a scoring method to assess and discard samples from one perspective, enabling the model to enhance the corresponding dialogue attributes (e.g., consistency) more easily. However, the discarded samples may obtain high scores in other perspectives and can provide regularization effects on the model learning, which causes the performance improvement to be sensitive to the filtering ratio. In this work, we propose a multi-view attribute-enhanced dialogue learning framework that strengthens the attribute-related features more robustly and comprehensively. Instead of filtering the raw dataset to train the model, our framework first pre-trains the model on the raw dataset and then fine-tunes it through adapters on the selected sub-sets, which also enhances certain attributes of responses but without suffering from the problems mentioned above. Considering the variety of the dialogue attribute, we further design a multi-view enhancement mechanism, including multi-view selection and inter-view fusion. It groups the high-quality samples from multiple perspectives, respectively, and enhances different attributes of responses with the corresponding sample sets and adapters, keeping knowledge independent and allowing flexible integration. Empirical results and analysis show that our framework can improve the performance significantly in terms of enhancing dialogue attributes and fusing view-specific knowledge."}}

However, previous works show that continuous latent variables tend to reduce the coherence of generated responses. In this paper, we also found that discrete latent variables have difficulty capturing more diverse expressions. To tackle these problems, we combine the merits of both continuous and discrete latent variables and propose a Hybrid Latent Variable (HLV) method. Specifically, HLV constrains the global semantics of responses through discrete latent variables and enriches responses with continuous latent variables. Thus, we diversify the generated responses while maintaining relevance and coherence. In addition, we propose Conditional Hybrid Variational Transformer (CHVT) to construct and to utilize HLV with transformers for dialogue generation. Through fine-grained symbolic-level semantic information and additive Gaussian mixing, we construct the distribution of continuous variables, prompting the generation of diverse expressions. Meanwhile, to maintain the relevance and coherence, the discrete latent variable is optimized by self-separation training. Experimental results on two dialogue generation datasets (DailyDialog and Opensubtitles) show that CHVT is superior to traditional transformer-based variational mechanism w.r.t. diversity, relevance and coherence metrics. Moreover, we also demonstrate the benefit of applying HLV to fine-tuning two pre-trained dialogue models (PLATO and BART-base)."}}

Recently, an interesting approach, namely negative training, has been proposed to alleviate this problem by reminding the model not to generate high-frequency responses during training. However, its performance is hindered by two issues, ignoring low-frequency but generic responses and bringing low-frequency but meaningless responses. In this paper, we propose a novel negative training paradigm, called negative distillation, to keep the model away from the undesirable generic responses while avoiding the above problems. First, we introduce a negative teacher model that can produce query-wise generic responses, and then the student model is required to maximize the distance with multi-level negative knowledge. Empirical results show that our method outperforms previous negative training methods significantly."}}

However, due to the inherent one-to-many and many-to-one phenomena in human dialogues, the sampled latent variables may not correctly reflect the contexts' semantics, leading to irrelevant and incoherent generated responses. To resolve this problem, we propose Self-separated Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (abbreviated as SepaCVAE) that introduces group information to regularize the latent variables, which enhances CVAE by improving the responses' relevance and coherence while maintaining their diversity and informativeness. SepaCVAE actively divides the input data into groups, and then widens the absolute difference between data pairs from distinct groups, while narrowing the relative distance between data pairs in the same group. Empirical results from automatic evaluation and detailed analysis demonstrate that SepaCVAE can significantly boost responses in well-established open-domain dialogue datasets."}}

However, these approaches face two problems. First, the decoder is too simple to effectively utilize the previously generated information and tends to generate duplicated and self-contradicting responses. Second, the complex encoder tends to generate diverse but incoherent responses because the complex context vectors may deviate from the original semantics of context. In this work, we proposed a conversation model named \"THINK\" (Teamwork generation Hover around Impressive Noticeable Keywords) to make the decoder more complicated and avoid generating duplicated and self-contradicting responses. The model simplifies the context vectors and increases the coherence of generated responses in a reasonable way. For this model, we propose Teamwork generation framework and Semantics Extractor.
