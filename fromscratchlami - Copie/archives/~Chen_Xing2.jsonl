A text encoder is typically used to map captions to a latent space, and it has been shown to be critical for model's performance. However, replacing or upgrading the text encoder in a T2I model is challenging due to the tight bond between the current encoder and the image decoder. It requires training the model from scratch, which can be prohibitively expensive. To address this problem, we introduce a more efficient approach to align a pre-trained language model with the latent space of an existing T2I model. We propose a Model Translation Network (MTN) and a new training objective to align the representation spaces of the two text encoders using only a corpus of unlabeled text. We empirically find that MTN can be trained efficiently and can boost the performance of existing T2I models by upgrading their text encoder. Moreover, we find that MTN can align multilingual language models such as XLM-Roberta, thus allowing existing T2I models to generate high-quality images from captions beyond English. "}}

With large language models and sufficient training data, prompt tuning performs comparably to full-model tuning. However, with limited training samples in few-shot settings, prompt tuning fails to match the performance of full-model fine-tuning. In this work, we focus on improving the few-shot performance of prompt tuning by transferring knowledge from soft prompts of source tasks with abundant training samples. Recognizing the good generalization capabilities of ensemble methods in low-data regime, we first experiment and show that a simple ensemble of model predictions based on different source prompts, outperforms existing multi-prompt knowledge transfer approaches such as source prompt fusion in the few-shot setting. Motivated by this observation, we further investigate model ensembles and  propose Sample-specific Ensemble of Source Models (SESoM). SESoM learns to adjust the contribution of each source model for each target sample separately when ensembling source model outputs. Through this way, SESoM inherits the superior generalization of ensemble methods and simultaneously captures the sample-specific competence of each source prompt.  We conduct experiments across a diverse set of eight NLP tasks using models of different scales (T5-\\{base, large, XL\\}) and find that SESoM consistently outperforms the existing models of the same as well as larger parametric scale by a large margin."}}

However, given the limited size of the gender-neutral data and its potential distributional mismatch with the original pre-training data, catastrophic forgetting would occur during the second-phase pre-training. Forgetting on the original training data may damage the model\u2019s downstream performance to a large margin. In this work, we first empirically show that even if the gender-neutral data for second-phase pre-training comes from the original training data, catastrophic forgetting still occurs if the size of gender-neutral data is smaller than that of original training data. Then, we propose a new method, GEnder Equality Prompt (GEEP), to improve gender fairness of pre-trained models without forgetting. GEEP learns gender-related prompts to reduce gender bias, conditioned on frozen language models. Since all pre-trained parameters are frozen,  forgetting on information from the original training data can be alleviated to the most extent. Then GEEP trains new embeddings of profession names as gender equality prompts conditioned on the frozen model. This makes GEEP more effective at debiasing as well. Because gender bias from previous data embedded in profession embeddings is already removed when they are re-intialized in GEEP before second-phase pre-training starts. Empirical results show that GEEP not only achieves state-of-the-art performances on gender debiasing in various applications such as pronoun predicting and coreference resolution, but also achieves comparable results on general downstream tasks such as GLUE with original pre-trained models without much forgetting."}}

In this paper, we focus on improving the efficiency of language pre-training methods through providing better data utilization. It is well-known that in language data corpus, words follow a heavy-tail distribution. A large proportion of words appear only very few times and the embeddings of rare words are usually poorly optimized. We argue that such embeddings carry inadequate semantic signals, which could make the data utilization inefficient and slow down the pre-training of the entire model. To mitigate this problem, we propose Taking Notes on the Fly (TNF), which takes notes for rare words on the fly during pre-training to help the model understand them when they occur next time. Specifically, TNF maintains a note dictionary and saves a rare word's contextual information in it as notes when the rare word occurs in a sentence. When the same rare word occurs again during training, the note information saved beforehand can be employed to enhance the semantics of the current sentence. By doing so, TNF provides a better data utilization since cross-sentence information is employed to cover the inadequate semantics caused by rare words in the sentences. We implement TNF on both BERT and ELECTRA to check its efficiency and effectiveness.  Experimental results show that TNF's training time is 60% less than its backbone pre-training models when reaching the same performance.  When trained with same number of iterations, TNF outperforms its backbone methods on most of downstream tasks and the average GLUE score. Code is attached in the supplementary material."}}

To improve confidence calibration of DNNs, we propose a novel training method, distance-based learning from errors (DBLE). DBLE bases its confidence estimation on distances in the representation space. In DBLE, we first adapt prototypical learning to train classification models. It yields a representation space where the distance between a test sample and its ground truth class center can calibrate the model's classification performance. At inference, however, these distances are not available due to the lack of ground truth labels. To circumvent this by inferring the distance for every test sample, we propose to train a confidence model jointly with the classification model. We integrate this into training by merely learning from mis-classified training samples, which we show to be highly beneficial for effective learning. On multiple datasets and DNN architectures, we demonstrate that DBLE outperforms alternative single-model confidence calibration approaches. DBLE also achieves comparable performance with computationally-expensive ensemble approaches with lower computational cost and lower number of parameters."}}

In this paper, we propose to leverage cross-modal information to enhance metric-based few-shot learning methods. Visual and semantic feature spaces have different structures by definition. For certain concepts, visual features might be richer and more discriminative than text ones. While for others, the inverse might be true. Moreover, when the support from visual information is limited in image classification, semantic representations (learned from unsupervised text corpora) can provide strong prior knowledge and context to help learning. Based on these two intuitions, we propose a mechanism that can adaptively combine information from both modalities according to new image categories to be learned. Through a series of experiments, we show that by this adaptive combination of the two modalities, our model outperforms current uni-modality few-shot learning methods and modality-alignment methods by a large margin on all benchmarks and few-shot scenarios tested. Experiments also show that our model can effectively adjust its focus on the two modalities.  The improvement in performance is particularly large when the number of shots is very small."}}

But is this really the case? This question couples the geometry of the DNN loss landscape with how stochastic optimization algorithms like SGD interact with it during training. Answering this question may help us qualitatively understand the dynamics of deep neural network optimization. We show evidence through qualitative and quantitative experiments that mini-batch SGD rarely crosses barriers during DNN optimization. As we show, the mini-batch induced noise helps SGD explore different regions of the loss surface using a seemingly different mechanism. To complement this finding, we also investigate the qualitative reason behind the slowing down of this exploration when using larger batch-sizes. We show this happens because gradients from larger batch-sizes align more with the top eigenvectors of the Hessian, which makes SGD oscillate in the proximity of the parameter initialization, thus preventing exploration."}}
