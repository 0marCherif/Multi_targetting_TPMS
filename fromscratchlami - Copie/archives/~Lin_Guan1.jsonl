Human knowledge of how to solve these tasks can be incorporated using imitation learning, where the agent learns to imitate human demonstrated decisions. However, human guidance is not limited to the demonstrations. Other types of guidance could be more suitable for certain tasks and require less human effort. This survey provides a high-level overview of five recent learning frameworks that primarily rely on human guidance other than conventional, step-by-step action demonstrations. We review the motivation, assumption, and implementation of each framework. We then discuss possible future research directions."}}

While previous works have looked at the possibility of using symbolic models along with RL approaches, they tend to assume that the high-level action models are executable at low level and the fluents can exclusively characterize all desirable MDP states. Symbolic models of real world tasks are however often incomplete. To this end, we introduce Approximate Symbolic-Model Guided Reinforcement Learning, wherein we will formalize the relationship between the symbolic model and the underlying MDP that will allow us to characterize the incompleteness of the symbolic model. We will use these models to extract high-level landmarks that will be used to decompose the task. At the low level, we learn a set of diverse policies for each possible task subgoal identified by the landmark, which are then stitched together. We evaluate our system by testing on three different benchmark domains and show how even with incomplete symbolic model information, our approach is able to discover the task structure and efficiently guide the RL agent towards the goal."}}

Interactive reward learning from trajectory comparisons (a.k.a. RLHF) is one way to allow non-expert users to convey complex objectives by expressing preferences over short clips of agent behaviors. Even though this parametric method can encode complex tacit knowledge present in the underlying tasks, it implicitly assumes that the human is unable to provide richer feedback than binary preference labels, leading to intolerably high feedback complexity and poor user experience. While providing a detailed symbolic closed-form specification of the objectives might be tempting, it is not always feasible even for an expert user. However, in most cases, humans are aware of how the agent should change its behavior along meaningful axes to fulfill their underlying purpose, even if they are not able to fully specify task objectives symbolically. Using this as motivation, we introduce the notion of Relative Behavioral Attributes, which allows the users to tweak the agent behavior through symbolic concepts (e.g., increasing the softness or speed of agents' movement). We propose two practical methods that can learn to model any kind of behavioral attributes from ordered behavior clips. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on four tasks with nine different behavioral attributes, showing that once the attributes are learned, end users can produce desirable agent behaviors relatively effortlessly, by providing feedback just around ten times. This is over an order of magnitude less than that required by the popular learning-from-human-preferences baselines.

Under this setting, human trainers provide not only the ground truth but also some form of explanation. However, this kind of human guidance was only investigated in supervised learning tasks, and it remains unclear how to best incorporate this type of human knowledge into deep reinforcement learning. In this paper, we present the first study of using human visual explanations in human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (HIRL). We focus on the task of learning from feedback, in which the human trainer not only gives binary evaluative \"good\" or \"bad\" feedback for queried state-action pairs, but also provides a visual explanation by annotating relevant features in images. We propose EXPAND (EXPlanation AugmeNted feeDback) to encourage the model to encode task-relevant features through a context-aware data augmentation that only perturbs irrelevant features in human salient information. We choose five tasks, namely Pixel-Taxi and four Atari games, to evaluate the performance and sample efficiency of this approach. We show that our method significantly outperforms methods leveraging human explanation that are adapted from supervised learning, and Human-in-the-loop RL baselines that only utilize evaluative feedback."}}
