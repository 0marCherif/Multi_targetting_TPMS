For example, in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task, the training data consists of pairs of audio (input sequence) and text (output label),without temporal alignment information. Standard CTC computes a loss by aggregating over all possible alignment paths, that map the entire sequence to the entire label (full alignment). However, in practice, there are often cases where the label is incomplete. Specifically, we solve the partial alignment problem where the label only matches a middle part of the sequence. This paper proposes the wild-card CTC (W-CTC) to address this issue, by padding wild-cards at both ends of the labels. Consequently, the proposed W-CTC improves the standard CTC via aggregating  over even more alignment paths. Evaluations on a number of tasks in speech and vision domains, show that the proposed W-CTC consistently outperforms the standard CTC by a large margin when label is incomplete. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further confirmed in an ablation study."}}

Investigations on the contextual embeddings demonstrate a strong anisotropic space such that most of the vectors fall within a narrow cone, leading to high cosine similarities.  It is surprising that these LMs are as successful as they are, given that most of their embedding vectors are as similar to one another as they are. In this paper, we argue that the isotropy indeed exists in the space, from a different but more constructive perspective. We identify isolated clusters and low dimensional manifolds in the contextual embedding space, and introduce tools to both qualitatively and quantitatively analyze them. We hope the study in this paper could provide insights towards a better understanding of the deep language models."}}

Despite the previous success, existing multi-graph clustering methods mostly use shallow models, which are incapable to capture the highly non-linear structures and the complex cluster associations in multi-graph, thus result in sub-optimal results. Inspired by the powerful representation learning capability of neural networks, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model to simultaneously infer cluster assignments and cluster associations in multi-graph. Specifically, we use autoencoding networks to learn node embeddings. Meanwhile, we propose a minimum-entropy based clustering strategy to cluster nodes in the embedding space for each graph. We introduce two regularizers to leverage both within-graph and cross-graph dependencies. An attentive mechanism is further developed to learn cross-graph cluster associations. Through extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, we observe that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin."}}

The query nodes play essential roles in the detection effectiveness. Existing methods perform well when a query node is from the target community core region. However, they struggle with the query-bias issue and especially perform unsatisfactorily when the query nodes come from different communities or when certain query nodes are from communities overlapping region or community boundary region. To address above issues, we consider from a new angle, to replace these original \u201cintractable\u201d query nodes with new detection-friendly query nodes. In this paper, we propose an effective ATP (Amplified Topology Potential) algorithm to detect core nodes of the target communities w.r.t. original query nodes. For one query node, ATP first builds a query-oriented topology potential field around the query node by aggregating random walk with restart scores. Then it amplifies the topology potential value to make core nodes of target communities easily distinguished. Graph-size-independent fast approximation strategies are also proposed together with sound theoretical foundations. Extensive experiments on four real networks using ten state-of-the-art local community detection methods verify the improvement in detection effectiveness and efficiency by the replacing strategy for the tough query cases."}}

Most existing local community detection methods are designed for a single network. However, a single network can be noisy and incomplete. Multiple networks are more informative in real-world applications. There are multiple types of nodes and multiple types of node proximities. Complementary information from different networks helps to improve detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel RWM (Random Walk in Multiple networks) model to find relevant local communities in all networks for a given query node set from one network. RWM sends a random walker in each network to obtain the local proximity w.r.t. the query nodes (i.e., node visiting probabilities).\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                        Walkers with similar visiting probabilities reinforce each other. They restrict the probability propagation around the query nodes to identify relevant subgraphs in each network and disregard irrelevant parts. We provide rigorous theoretical foundations for RWM and develop two speeding-up strategies with performance guarantees. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of RWM."}}

However, user/item diversities in social recommendations are not well utilized in the literature. Especially, inter-factor (social and rating factors) relations and distinct rating values need taking into more consideration. In this paper, we propose an attentive social recommendation system (ASR) to address this issue from two aspects. First, in ASR, Rec-conv graph network layers are proposed to extract the social factor, user-rating and item-rated factors and then automatically assign contribution weights to aggregate these factors into the user/item embedding vectors. Second, a disentangling strategy is applied for diverse rating values. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our ASR."}}

The existing local community detection methods usually assume all query nodes are from the same community and only find a single target community. This is a strict requirement and does not allow much flexibility. In many real-world applications, however, we may not have any prior knowledge about the community memberships of the query nodes, and different query nodes may be from different communities. To address this limitation of the existing methods, we propose a novel memory-based random walk method, MRW, that can simultaneously identify multiple target local communities to which the query nodes belong. In MRW, each query node is associated with a random walker. Different from commonly used memoryless random walk models, MRW records the entire visiting history of each walker. The visiting histories of walkers can help unravel whether they are from the same community or not. Intuitively, walkers with similar visiting histories are more likely to be in the same community. Moreover, MRW allows walkers with similar visiting histories to reinforce each other so that they can better capture the community structure instead of being biased to the query nodes. We provide rigorous theoretical foundations for the proposed method and develop efficient algorithms to identify multiple target local communities simultaneously. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."}}
