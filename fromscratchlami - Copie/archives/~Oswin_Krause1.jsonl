A recurring challenge is the alignment of domains whose topology is not the same; a problem that is routinely ignored, potentially introducing bias in downstream analysis. As a first step towards solving such alignment problems, we propose an unsupervised algorithm for the detection of changes in image topology. The model is based on a conditional variational auto-encoder and detects topological changes between two images during the registration step. We account for both topological changes in the image under spatial variation and unexpected transformations. Our approach is validated on two tasks and datasets: detection of topological changes in microscopy images of cells, and unsupervised anomaly detection brain imaging."}}

Existing metrics like euclidean distance or normalized cross-correlation focus on aligning intensity values, giving difficulties with low intensity contrast or noise. Our approach learns dataset-specific features that drive the optimization of a learning-based registration model. We train both an unsupervised approach using an auto-encoder, and a semi-supervised approach using supplemental segmentation data to extract semantic features for image registration. Comparing to existing methods across multiple image modalities and applications, we achieve consistently high registration accuracy. A learned invariance to noise gives smoother transformations on low-quality images."}}

While different probabilistic segmentation models are designed to capture different aspects of segmentation uncertainty and ambiguity, these modelling differences are rarely discussed in the context of applications of uncertainty. We consider two common use cases of segmentation uncertainty, namely assessment of segmentation quality and active learning. We consider four established strategies for probabilistic segmentation, discuss their modelling capabilities, and investigate their performance in these two tasks. We find that for all models and both tasks, returned uncertainty correlates positively with segmentation error, but does not prove to be useful for active learning."}}

Many applications also require the ability to accurately sample modalities conditioned on observations of a subset of the modalities. Often not all modalities may be observed for all training data points, so  semi-supervised learning should be possible.\nIn this study, we evaluate a family of product-of-experts (PoE) based variational autoencoders that have these desired properties. We include a novel PoE based architecture and training procedure. An empirical evaluation shows that the PoE based models can outperform an additive mixture-of-experts (MoE) approach.\nOur experiments support the intuition that PoE models are more suited for a conjunctive combination of modalities while MoEs are more suited for a disjunctive fusion.

We devised a unifying theoretical framework for algorithms for estimating the partition function, including Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) and Bennett's Acceptance Ratio method (BAR). The unification reveals conceptual similarities of and differences between different approaches and suggests new algorithms. The framework is based on a generalized form of Crooks' equality, which links the expectation over a distribution of samples generated by a transition operator to the expectation over the distribution induced by the reversed operator. Different ways of sampling, such as parallel tempering and path sampling, are covered by the framework. We performed experiments in which we estimated the partition function of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and Ising models. We found that BAR using parallel tempering worked well with a small number of bridging distributions, while path sampling based AIS performed best with many bridging distributions. The normalization constant is measured w.r.t.~a reference distribution, and the choice of this distribution turned out to be very important in our experiments. Overall, BAR gave the best empirical results, outperforming AIS."}}

Several algorithms for estimating the partition function (in relation to a reference distribution) have been introduced, including Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) and Bennett's Acceptance Ratio method (BAR). However, their conceptual similarities and differences have not been worked out so far and systematic comparisons of their behavior in practice have been missing. We devise a unifying theoretical framework for these algorithms, which comprises existing variants and suggests new approaches. It is based on a generalized form of Crooks' equality linking the expectation over a distribution of samples generated by a transition operator to the expectation over the distribution induced by the reversed operator.

An empirical comparison revealed the differences between the methods when estimating the partition function of restricted Boltzmann machines and Ising models. In our experiments, BAR using parallel tempering worked well with a small number of bridging distributions, while path sampling based AIS performed best when many bridging distributions were available. Because BAR gave the overall best results, we favor it over AIS. Furthermore, the experiments showed the importance of choosing a proper reference distribution."}}

The algorithm updates the covariance matrix of its sampling distribution by directly estimating the curvature of the objective function.

We demonstrate that our approach to covariance matrix adaptation is efficient by evaluating it on the BBOB/COCO testbed. We also show that the algorithm is surprisingly robust when its core assumption of a twice continuously differentiable objective function is violated. The approach yields a new evolution strategy with competitive performance, and at the same time it also offers an interesting alternative to the usual covariance matrix update mechanism."}}

In this paper, we investigate whether a Bayesian approach to the classification problem can provide assumptions under which one is guaranteed to perform at least as good as random sampling. For a logistic regression model, we show that maximal expected information gain on model parameters is a promising criterion for selecting samples, assuming that our classification model is well-matched to the data. Our derived criterion is closely related to the maximum model change. We experiment with data sets which satisfy this assumption to varying degrees to see how sensitive our performance is to the violation of our assumption in practice."}}
