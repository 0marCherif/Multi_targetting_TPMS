Existing published work on robustness either does not scale to large-scale dataset, or does not deal with multiple modalities. This work aims to study several key questions related to multi-modal learning through the lens of robustness: 1) Are multi-modal models necessarily more robust than uni-modal models? 2) How to efficiently measure the robustness of multi-modal learning? 3) How to fuse different modalities to achieve a more robust multi-modal model? To understand the robustness of the multi-modal model in a large-scale setting, we propose a density-based metric, and a convexity metric to efficiently measure the distribution of each modality in high-dimensional latent space. Our work provides a theoretical intuition together with empirical evidence showing how multi-modal fusion affects adversarial robustness through these metrics. We further devise a mix-up strategy based on our metrics to improve the robustness of the trained model. Our experiments on AudioSet [1] and Kinetics-Sounds [2] verify our hypothesis that multi-modal models are not necessarily more robust than their uni-modal counterparts in the face of adversarial examples. We also observe our mix-up trained method could achieve as much protection as traditional adversarial training, offering a computationally cheap alternative."}}

Differently from weakly-supervised object detection, we do not assume image-level class labels. Instead, we extract a supervisory signal from audio-visual data, using the audio component to \u201cteach\u201d the object detector. While this problem is related to sound source localisation, it is considerably harder because the detector must classify the objects by type, enumerate each instance of the object, and do so even when the object is silent. We tackle this problem by first designing a self-supervised framework with a contrastive objective that jointly learns to classify and localise objects. Then, without using any supervision, we simply use these self-supervised labels and boxes to train an image-based object detector. With this, we outperform previous unsupervised and weakly-supervised detectors for the task of object detection and sound source localization. We also show that we can align this detector to ground-truth classes with as little as one label per pseudo-class, and show how our method can learn to detect generic objects that go beyond instruments, such as airplanes and cats."}}

End-to-end modeling of speech summarization models is challenging due to memory and compute constraints arising from long input audio sequences. Recent work in document summarization has inspired methods to reduce the complexity of self-attentions, which enables transformer models to handle long sequences. In this work, we introduce a single model optimized end-to-end for speech summarization. We apply the restricted self-attention technique from text-based models to speech models to address the memory and compute constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed model learns to directly summarize speech for the How-2 corpus of instructional videos. The proposed end-to-end model outperforms the previously proposed cascaded model by 3 points absolute on ROUGE. Further, we consider the spoken language understanding task of predicting concepts from speech inputs and show that the proposed end-to-end model outperforms the cascade model by 4 points absolute F-1."}}

However, existing quantization methods suffer from accuracy degradation compared to full-precision (FP) models due to the errors introduced by coarse gradient estimation through non-differentiable quantization layers. The existence of sharp local minima in the loss landscapes of overparameterized models (e.g., Transformers) tends to aggravate such performance penalty in low-bit (2, 4 bits) settings. In this work, we propose sharpness- and quantization-aware training (SQuAT), which would encourage the model to converge to flatter minima while performing quantization-aware training. Our proposed method alternates training between sharpness objective and step-size objective, which could potentially let the model learn the most suitable parameter update magnitude to reach convergence near-flat minima. Extensive experiments show that our method can consistently outperform state-of-the-art quantized BERT models under 2, 3, and 4-bit settings on GLUE benchmarks by 1%, and can sometimes even outperform full precision (32-bit) models. Our experiments on empirical measurement of sharpness also suggest that our method would lead to flatter minima compared to other quantization methods."}}

However, it is not guaranteed that noise will not cascade into downstream pipelines. To understand the actual influence of noise on the entire audio pipeline, in this paper, we directly investigate the impact of noise on a different types of neural models without the preprocessing step. We measure the recognition performances of 4 different neural network models on the task of environment sound classification under the 3 types of noises: \\emph{occlusion} (to emulate intermittent noise), \\emph{Gaussian} noise (models continuous noise), and \\emph{adversarial perturbations} (worst case scenario). Our intuition is that the different ways in which these models process their input (i.e. CNNs have strong locality inductive biases, which Transformers do not have) should lead to observable differences in performance and/ or robustness, an understanding of which will enable further improvements. We perform extensive experiments on AudioSet which is the largest weakly-labeled sound event dataset available. We also seek to explain the behaviors of different models through output distribution change and weight visualization."}}
