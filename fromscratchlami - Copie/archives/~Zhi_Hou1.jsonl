Recently, a new Transformer module, applying on batch dimension rather than spatial/channel dimension, i.e., BatchFormer [18], has been introduced to explore sample relationships for overcoming data scarcity challenges. However, it only works with image-level representations for classification. In this paper, we devise a more general batch Transformer module, BatchFormerV2, which further enables exploring sample relationships for dense representation learning. Specifically, when applying the proposed module, it employs a two-stream pipeline during training, i.e., either with or without a BatchFormerV2 module, where the batchformer stream can be removed for testing. Therefore, the proposed method is a plug-and-play module and can be easily integrated into different vision Transformers without any extra inference cost. Without bells and whistles, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method for a variety of popular visual recognition tasks, including image classification and two important dense prediction tasks: object detection and panoptic segmentation. Particularly, BatchFormerV2 consistently improves current DETR-based detection methods (e.g., DETR, Deformable-DETR, Conditional DETR, and SMCA) by over 1.3%. Code will be made publicly available."}}

To address the above-mentioned issues, a variety of methods have been devised to explore the sample relationships in a vanilla way (i.e., from the perspectives of either the input or the loss function), failing to explore the internal structure of deep neural networks for learning with sample relationships. Inspired by this, we propose to enable deep neural networks themselves with the ability to learn the sample relationships from each mini-batch. Specifically, we introduce a batch transformer module or BatchFormer, which is then applied into the batch dimension of each mini-batch to implicitly explore sample relationships during training. By doing this, the proposed method enables the collaboration of different samples, e.g., the head-class samples can also contribute to the learning of the tail classes for long-tailed recognition. Furthermore, to mitigate the gap between training and testing, we share the classifier between with or without the BatchFormer during training, which can thus be removed during testing. We perform extensive experiments on over ten datasets and the proposed method achieves significant improvements on different data scarcity applications without any bells and whistles, including the tasks of long-tailed recognition, compositional zero-shot learning, domain generalization, and contrastive learning.

In this paper, 1) we introduce a novel and challenging task for a comprehensive HOI understanding, which is termed as HOI Concept Discovery; and 2) we devise a self-compositional learning framework (or SCL) for HOI concept discovery. Specifically, we maintain an online updated concept confidence matrix during training: 1) we assign pseudo labels for all composite HOI instances according to the concept confidence matrix for self-training; and 2) we update the concept confidence matrix using the predictions of all composite HOI instances. Therefore, the proposed method enables the learning on both known and unknown HOI concepts. We perform extensive experiments on several popular HOI datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for HOI concept discovery, object affordance recognition and HOI detection. For example, the proposed self-compositional learning framework significantly improves the performance of 1) HOI concept discovery by over 10% on HICO-DET and over 3% on V-COCO, respectively; 2) object affordance recognition by over 9% mAP on MS-COCO and HICO-DET; and 3) rare-first and non-rare-first unknown HOI detection relatively over 30% and 20%, respectively.

Inspired by this, we introduce an affordance transfer learning approach to jointly detect HOIs with novel object and recognize affordances. Specifically, HOI representations can be decoupled into a combination of affordance and object representations, making it possible to compose novel interactions by combining affordance representations and novel object representations from additional images, i.e. transferring the affordance to novel objects. With the proposed affordance transfer learning, the model is also capable of inferring the affordances of novel objects from known affordance representations. The proposed method can thus be used to 1) improve the performance of HOI detection, especially for the HOIs with unseen objects; and 2) infer the affordances of novel objects. Experimental results on two datasets, HICO-DET and HOI-COCO (from V-COCO), demonstrate significant improvements over recent state-of-the-art methods for HOI detection and object affordance detection.

However, HOI detection usually suffers from the open long-tailed nature of interactions with objects, while human has extremely powerful compositional perception ability to cognize rare or unseen HOI samples. Inspired by this, we devise a novel HOI compositional learning framework, termed as Fabricated Compositional Learning (FCL), to address the problem of open long-tailed HOI detection. Specifically, we introduce an object fabricator to generate effective object representations, and then combine verbs and fabricated objects to compose new HOI samples. With the proposed object fabricator, we are able to generate large-scale HOI samples for rare and unseen categories to alleviate the open long-tailed issues in HOI detection. Extensive experiments on the most popular HOI detection dataset, HICO-DET, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for imbalanced HOI detection and significantly improve the state-of-the-art performance on rare and unseen HOI categories."}}

It is challenging because an enormous number of possible combinations of objects and verbs types forms a long-tail distribution. We devise a deep Visual Compositional Learning (VCL) framework, which is a simple yet efficient framework to effectively address this problem. VCL first decomposes an HOI representation into object and verb specific features, and then composes new interaction samples in the feature space via stitching the decomposed features. The integration of decomposition and composition enables VCL to share object and verb features among different HOI samples and images, and to generate new interaction samples and new types of HOI, and thus largely alleviates the long-tail distribution problem and benefits low-shot or zero-shot HOI detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed VCL can effectively improve the generalization of HOI detection on HICO-DET and V-COCO and outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on HICO-DET.
