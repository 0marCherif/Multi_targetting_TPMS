State-of-the-art approaches for designing calibrated models rely on inflating the Gaussian process posterior variance, which yields confidence intervals that are potentially too coarse. To remedy this, we present a calibration approach that generates predictive quantiles using a computation inspired by the vanilla Gaussian process posterior variance, but using a different set of hyperparameters, chosen to satisfy an empirical calibration constraint. This results in a calibration approach that is considerably more flexible than existing approaches. Our approach is shown to yield a calibrated model under reasonable assumptions. Furthermore, it outperforms existing approaches not only when employed for calibrated regression, but also to inform the design of Bayesian optimization algorithms."}}

We employ Gaussian processes to learn the unknown system model using measurement data collected online, while the proposed control law is active. Our approach uses an efficient event-triggered online learning scheme that exclusively collects informative data to update the estimated model used for control. The resulting control law guarantees that the tracking error is globally uniformly ultimately bounded. The inter-event time is shown to be lower-bounded by a positive constant. Moreover, we also discuss how to obtain a trade-off between the cardinality of the collected training data and the size of the ultimate tracking error bound. In a simulation example, our approach is shown to outperform a state-of-the-art offline learning-based approach both in terms of tracking performance and data efficiency."}}

However, achieving human-like manipulation capabilities with sophisticated robotic hands is challenging because of the problem's high dimensionality. Although remedies such as reward shaping or expert demonstrations can be employed to overcome this issue, they often lead to oversimplified and biased policies. We present Dext-Gen, a reinforcement learning framework for Dexterous Grasping in sparse reward ENvironments that is applicable to a variety of grippers and learns unbiased and intricate policies. Full orientation control of the gripper and object is achieved through smooth orientation representation. Our approach has reasonable training durations and provides the option to include desired prior knowledge. The effectiveness and adaptability of the framework to different scenarios is demonstrated in simulated experiments."}}

As these models are employed in learning-based control, the quality of the data plays a crucial role for the performance of the resulting control law. Nevertheless, there hardly exist measures for assessing training data sets, and the impact of the spatial distribution of the data on the closed-loop system properties is largely unknown. This letter derives - based on Gaussian process models - an analytical relationship between the density of the training data and the control performance. We formulate a quality measure for the data set, which we refer to as \u03c1-gap, and derive the ultimate bound for the tracking error under consideration of the model uncertainty. We show how the \u03c1-gap can be applied to a feedback linearizing control law and provide numerical illustrations for our approach."}}

However, state-of-the-art techniques for safety-critical settings hinge on the assumption that the kernel hyperparameters are known, which does not apply in general. To mitigate this, we introduce robust Gaussian process uniform error bounds in settings with unknown hyperparameters. Our approach computes a confidence region in the space of hyperparameters, which enables us to obtain a probabilistic upper bound for the model error of a Gaussian process with arbitrary hyperparameters. We do not require to know any bounds for the hyperparameters a priori, which is an assumption commonly found in related work. Instead, we are able to derive bounds from data in an intuitive fashion. We additionally employ the proposed technique to derive performance guarantees for a class of learning-based control problems. Experiments show that the bound performs significantly better than vanilla and fully Bayesian Gaussian processes."}}

In particular, the implicit quantification of the uncertainty of the learned model makes it a promising approach for safety-critical applications. When using Gaussian process regression to learn unknown systems, a commonly considered approach consists of learning the residual dynamics after applying some generic discretization technique, which might however disregard properties of the underlying physical system. Variational integrators are a less common yet promising approach to discretization, as they retain physical properties of the underlying system, such as energy conservation and satisfaction of explicit kinematic constraints. In this work, we present a novel structure-preserving learning-based modelling approach that combines a variational integrator for the nominal dynamics of a mechanical system and learning residual dynamics with Gaussian process regression. We extend our approach to systems with known kinematic constraints and provide formal bounds on the prediction uncertainty. The simulative evaluation of the proposed method shows desirable energy conservation properties in accordance with general theoretical results and demonstrates exact constraint satisfaction for constrained dynamical systems."}}

The proposed method is tested in a simple simulation scenario."}}
