To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel off-policy meta-RL method, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">embedding learning and uncertainty evaluation</i> (ELUE). An ELUE agent is characterized by the learning of what we call a task embedding space, an embedding space for representing the features of tasks. The agent learns a belief model over the task embedding space and trains a belief-conditional policy and Q-function. The belief model is designed to be agnostic to the order in which task information is obtained, thereby reducing the difficulty of task embedding learning. For a new task, the ELUE agent collects data by the pretrained policy, and updates its belief on the basis of the belief model. Thanks to the belief update, the performance of the agent improves with a small amount of data. In addition, the agent updates the parameters of its policy and Q-function so that it can adjust the pretrained relationships when there are enough data. We demonstrate that ELUE outperforms state-of-the-art meta RL methods through experiments on meta-RL benchmarks."}}
