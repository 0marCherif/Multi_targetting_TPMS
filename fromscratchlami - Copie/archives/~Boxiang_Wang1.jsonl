Our consolidated CV algorithm utilizes a recently proposed exact leave-one-out formula for the SVM and accelerates the SVM computation via a data reduction strategy. In addition, to compute the SVM with the bias term (intercept), which is not handled by the existing data reduction methods, we propose a novel two-stage consolidated CV algorithm. With numerical studies, we demonstrate that our algorithm is about an order of magnitude faster than the two mainstream SVM solvers, kernlab and LIBSVM, with almost the same accuracy. "}}

In this paper, we consider the sparse penalized DWD for high-dimensional classification. The state-of-the-art algorithm for solving the standard DWD is based on second-order cone programming, however such an algorithm does not work well for the sparse penalized DWD with high-dimensional data. In order to overcome the challenging computation difficulty, we develop a very efficient algorithm to compute the solution path of the sparse DWD at a given fine grid of regularization parameters. We implement the algorithm in a publicly available R package sdwd. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the computational efficiency and classification performance of our method."}}
