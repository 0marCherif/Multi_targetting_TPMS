It implies that the discriminator around equilibrium can approximate optimal transport (OT) from $p_G$ to $p$. Based on some experiments and a bit of OT theory, we propose a discriminator optimal transport (DOT) scheme to improve generated images. We show that it improves inception score and FID of samples generated by un-conditional GAN trained by CIFAR-10, STL-10 and a public pre-trained model of conditional GAN by ImageNet."}}

Many studies have reported that the solution set of an M-objective optimization problem often forms an (M \u2212 1)-dimensional topological simplex (a curved line for M = 2, a curved triangle for M = 3, a curved tetrahedron for M = 4, etc.). Since the dimensionality of the solution set increases as the number of objectives grows, an exponentially large sample size is needed to cover the solution set. To reduce the required sample size, this paper proposes a B\u00e9zier simplex model and its fitting algorithm. These techniques can exploit the simplex structure of the solution set and decompose a high-dimensional surface fitting task into a sequence of low-dimensional ones. An approximation theorem of B\u00e9zier simplices is proven. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real-world optimization problems demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accurate approximation of high-dimensional solution sets with small samples. In practice, such an approximation will be conducted in the postoptimization process and enable a better trade-off analysis."}}
