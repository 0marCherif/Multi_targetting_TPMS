This aspect is of particular relevance when dealing with real-world data, mixing generative processes characterized by radically different distributions and sampling. This brief discusses a neural point process approach for health and behavioral data, comprising both sparse events coming from user subjective declarations as well as fast-flowing time series from wearable sensors. We propose and empirically validate different neural architectures and we assess the effect of including input sources of different nature. The empirical analysis is built on the top of a challenging original dataset, never published before, and collected as part of a real-world experiment in an uncontrolled setting. Results show the potential of neural point processes both in terms of predicting the next event type as well as in predicting the time to next user interaction."}}

Therefore, the availability of effective and flexible methodologies to speed up and prioritize the repurposing process is fundamental to tackle present and future challenges to worldwide health. This work addresses the problem of drug repurposing through the lens of deep learning for graphs, by designing an architecture that exploits both structural and biological information to propose a reduced set of drugs that may be effective against an unknown disease. Our main contribution is a method to repurpose a drug against multiple proteins, rather than the most common single-drug/single-protein setting. The method leverages graph embeddings to encode the relevant proteins' and drugs' information based on gene ontology data and structural similarities. Finally, we publicly release a comprehensive and unified data repository for graph-based analysis to foster further studies on COVID-19 and drug repurposing. We empirically validate the proposed approach in a general drug repurposing setting, showing that it generalizes better than single protein repurposing schemes. We conclude the manuscript with an exemplified application of our method to the COVID-19 use case. All source code is publicly available."}}

How do we achieve forward transfer at zero cost for the single SCDs? We formalize this problem as a Distributed Continual Learning scenario, where SCD adapt to local tasks and a CL model consolidates the knowledge from the resulting stream of models without looking at the SCD's private data. Unfortunately, current CL methods are not directly applicable to this scenario. We propose Data-Agnostic Consolidation (DAC), a novel double knowledge distillation method that consolidates the stream of SC models without using the original data. DAC performs distillation in the latent space via a novel Projected Latent Distillation loss. Experimental results show that DAC enables forward transfer between SCDs and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on Split CIFAR100, CORe50 and Split TinyImageNet, both in reharsal-free and distributed CL scenarios. Somewhat surprisingly, even a single out-of-distribution image is sufficient as the only source of data during consolidation."}}

The long-term objective is to outperform hand-designed heuristics for NP-hard/complete problems by learning to generate superior solutions solely from training data. The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a prominent combinatorial optimisation problem often targeted by such approaches. However, current neural-based methods for solving TSP often overlook the inherent \"algorithmic\" nature of the problem. In contrast, heuristics designed for TSP frequently leverage well-established algorithms, such as those for finding the minimum spanning tree. In this paper, we propose leveraging recent advancements in neural algorithmic reasoning to improve the learning of TSP problems. Specifically, we suggest pre-training our neural model on relevant algorithms before training it on TSP instances. Our results demonstrate that, using this learning setup, we achieve superior performance compared to non-algorithmically informed deep learning models."}}

Nonetheless, there is a lack of works that consider graph representations in the context of deep learning systems for music generation. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel graph representation for music and a deep Variational Autoencoder that generates the structure and the content of musical graphs separately, one after the other, with a hierarchical architecture that matches the structural priors of music. By separating the structure and content of musical graphs, it is possible to condition generation by specifying which instruments are played at certain times. This opens the door to a new form of human-computer interaction in the context of music co-creation. After training the model on existing MIDI datasets, the experiments show that the model is able to generate appealing short and long musical sequences and to realistically interpolate between them, producing music that is tonally and rhythmically consistent. Finally, the visualization of the embeddings shows that the model is able to organize its latent space in accordance with known musical concepts."}}

In this paper, we proposed an open-source microservices-based architecture for decentralised machine intelligence which aims at bringing R&D and deployment functionalities closer following a low-code approach. Such an approach would guarantee flexible integration of cutting-edge functionalities while preserving complete control over the deployed solutions at negligible costs and maintenance efforts."}}

Unfortunately, due to their lack of a regular structure, there is still no consensus on how downsampling should apply to graphs and linked data. Indeed reductions in graph data are still needed for the goals described above, but reduction mechanisms do not have the same focus on preserving topological structures and properties, while allowing for resolution-tuning, as is the case in regular data downsampling. In this paper, we take a step in this direction, introducing a unifying interpretation of downsampling in regular and graph data. In particular, we define a graph coarsening mechanism which is a graph-structured counterpart of controllable equispaced coarsening mechanisms in regular data. We prove theoretical guarantees for distortion bounds on path lengths, as well as the ability to preserve key topological properties in the coarsened graphs. We leverage these concepts to define a graph pooling mechanism that we empirically assess in graph classification tasks, providing a greedy algorithm that allows efficient parallel implementation on GPUs, and showing that it compares favorably against pooling methods in literature."}}
