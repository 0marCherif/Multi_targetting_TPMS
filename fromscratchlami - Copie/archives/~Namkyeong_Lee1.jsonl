To this end, identifying cell types of cells with clustering techniques becomes an important task for downstream analysis. However, challenges of scRNA-seq data such as pervasive dropout phenomena hinder obtaining robust clustering outputs. Although existing studies try to alleviate these problems, they fall short of fully leveraging the relationship information and mainly rely on reconstruction-based losses that highly depend on the data quality, which is sometimes noisy. This work proposes a graph-based prototypical contrastive learning method, named scGPCL. Specifically, scGPCL encodes the cell representations using Graph Neural Networks on cell\u2013gene graph that captures the relational information inherent in scRNA-seq data and introduces prototypical contrastive learning to learn cell representations by pushing apart semantically dissimilar pairs and pulling together similar ones. Through extensive experiments on both simulated and real scRNA-seq data, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of scGPCL."}}

In this work, we propose CMRL that is robust to the distributional shift in molecular relational learning by detecting the core substructure that is causally related to chemical reactions. To do so, we first assume a causal relationship based on the domain knowledge of molecular sciences and construct a structural causal model (SCM) that reveals the relationship between variables. Based on the SCM, we introduce a novel conditional intervention framework whose intervention is conditioned on the paired molecule. With the conditional intervention framework, our model successfully learns from the causal substructure and alleviates the confounding effect of shortcut substructures that are spuriously correlated to chemical reactions. Extensive experiments on various tasks with real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMRL over state-of-the-art baseline models.

Recently, graph neural networks have recently shown great success in molecular relational learning by modeling a molecule as a graph structure, and considering atom-level interactions between two molecules. Despite their success, existing molecular relational learning methods tend to overlook the nature of chemistry, i.e., a chemical compound is composed of multiple substructures such as functional groups that cause distinctive chemical reactions. In this work, we propose a novel relational learning framework, called CGIB, that predicts the interaction behavior between a pair of graphs by detecting core subgraphs therein. The main idea is, given a pair of graphs, to find a subgraph from a graph that contains the minimal sufficient information regarding the task at hand conditioned on the paired graph based on the principle of conditional graph information bottleneck. We argue that our proposed method mimics the nature of chemical reactions, i.e., the core substructure of a molecule varies depending on which other molecule it interacts with. Extensive experiments on various tasks with real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of CGIB over state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Namkyeong/CGIB."}}

Such heterogeneous modalities offer different and complementary perspectives on the same patient, resulting in more accurate clinical decisions when they are properly combined. However, despite its significance, how to effectively fuse the multi-modal medical data into a unified framework has received relatively little attention. In this paper, we propose an effective graph-based framework called HetMed (Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Multi-modal Medical Data Analysis) for fusing the multi-modal medical data. Specifically, we construct a multiplex network that incorporates multiple types of non-image features of patients to capture the complex relationship between patients in a systematic way, which leads to more accurate clinical decisions.

Previous efforts in user modeling mainly focus on learning a task-specific user representation that is designed for a single task. However, since learning task-specific user representations for every task is infeasible, recent studies introduce the concept of universal user representation, which is a more generalized representation of a user that is relevant to a variety of tasks. Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches for learning universal user representations are impractical in real-world applications due to the data requirement, catastrophic forgetting and the limited learning capability for continually added tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel continual user representation learning method, called TERACON, whose learning capability is not limited as the number of learned tasks increases while capturing the relationship between the tasks. The main idea is to introduce an embedding for each task, i.e., task embedding, which is utilized to generate task-specific soft masks that not only allow the entire model parameters to be updated until the end of training sequence, but also facilitate the relationship between the tasks to be captured. Moreover, we introduce a novel knowledge retention module with pseudo-labeling strategy that successfully alleviates the long-standing problem of continual learning, i.e., catastrophic forgetting.

In real-world situations, not all classes have many labeled nodes and there may be instances where the model needs to classify new classes, making manual labeling difficult. To solve this problem, it is important for GNNs to be able to classify nodes with a limited number of labeled nodes, known as few-shot node classification. Previous episodic meta-learning based methods have demonstrated success in few-shot node classification, but our findings suggest that optimal performance can only be achieved with a substantial amount of diverse training meta-tasks. To address this challenge of meta-learning based few-shot learning (FSL), we propose a new approach, the Task-Equivariant Graph few-shot learning (TEG) framework. Our TEG framework enables the model to learn transferable task-adaptation strategies using a limited number of training meta-tasks, allowing it to acquire meta-knowledge for a wide range of meta-tasks. By incorporating equivariant neural networks, TEG can utilize their strong generalization abilities to learn highly adaptable task-specific strategies. As a result, TEG achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training meta-tasks. Our experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate TEG's superiority in terms of accuracy and generalization ability, even when using minimal meta-training data, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed approach in addressing the challenges of meta-learning based few-shot node classification.

On the other hand, recent self-supervised learning paradigm aims to train GNNs by solving pretext tasks that do not require any labeled nodes, and it has shown to even outperform GNNs trained with few labeled nodes. However, a major drawback of self-supervised methods is that they fall short of learning class discriminative node representations since no labeled information is utilized during training. To this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised method for graphs, GraFN, that leverages few labeled nodes to ensure nodes that belong to the same class to be grouped together, thereby achieving the best of both worlds of semi-supervised and self-supervised methods. Specifically, GraFN randomly samples support nodes from labeled nodes and anchor nodes from the entire graph. Then, it minimizes the difference between two predicted class distributions that are non-parametrically assigned by anchor-supports similarity from two differently augmented graphs. We experimentally show that GraFN surpasses both the semi-supervised and self-supervised methods in terms of node classification on real-world graphs."}}
