At each step, the agent chooses an arm and observes a random reward but is unaware of which MAB he is currently pulling. As typical in Latent Bandits, we assume to know the reward distribution of the arms of all the Bandit instances. Within this setting, our goal is to learn the transition matrix determined by the Markov process, so as to minimize the cumulative regret. We propose a technique to solve this estimation problem that exploits the properties of Markov Chains and results in solving a system of linear equations. We present an offline method that chooses the best subset of possible arms that can be used for matrix estimation, and we ultimately introduce the SL-EC learning algorithm based on an Explore Then Commit strategy that builds a belief representation of the current state and optimizes the instantaneous regret at each step. This algorithm achieves a regret of the order $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ with $T$ being the interaction horizon. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the approach and compare it with state-of-the-art algorithms for non-stationary bandits."}}

However, empirical and theoretical studies have progressively shown that vanilla IS leads to poor estimations whenever the behavioral and target policies are too dissimilar. In this paper, we analyze the theoretical properties of the IS estimator by deriving a novel anticoncentration bound that formalizes the intuition behind its undesired behavior. Then, we propose a new class of IS transformations, based on the notion of power mean. To the best of our knowledge, the resulting estimator is the first to achieve, under certain conditions, two key properties: (i) it displays a subgaussian concentration rate; (ii) it preserves the differentiability in the target distribution. Finally, we provide numerical simulations on both synthetic examples and contextual bandits, in comparison with off-policy evaluation and learning baselines."}}
