One major reason is that a higher compression rate induces more loss of visual signals on the higher frequency spectrum which reflect the details on pixel space. In this paper, a Frequency Complement Module (FCM) architecture is proposed to capture the missing frequency information for enhancing reconstruction quality. The FCM can be easily incorporated into the VQ-VAE structure, and we refer to the new model as Frequency Augmented VAE (FA-VAE). In addition, a Dynamic Spectrum Loss (DSL) is introduced to guide the FCMs to balance between various frequencies dynamically for optimal reconstruction. FA-VAE is further extended to the text-to-image synthesis task, and a Cross-attention Autoregressive Transformer (CAT) is proposed to obtain more precise semantic attributes in texts. Extensive reconstruction experiments with different compression rates are conducted on several benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed FA-VAE is able to restore more faithfully the details compared to SOTA methods. CAT also shows improved generation quality with better image-text semantic alignment."}}

It is challenging because hierarchically structured side information is distorted when features are embedded in the Euclidean space in existing literature, which incurs the difficulty of identifying the unseen samples. In this paper, we introduce a side information learning algorithm for generalized open set recognition based on the hyperbolic space to alleviate the distortion and accurately identify the unknown samples. Specifically, we propose a hyperbolic side information learning framework to identify the unseen samples and an ancestor search algorithm to search the most similar ancestor from the taxonomy of selected known classes. Experiments on CUB-200 and AWA 2 datasets show that our method improves the performance of generalized open set recognition by a large margin."}}

A major challenge is that the model does not have access to the future and has to solely rely on the history, i.e., the frames observed so far, to make predictions. It is therefore important to accentuate parts of the history that are more informative to the prediction of the current frame. We present GateHUB, Gated History Unit with Background Suppression, that comprises a novel position-guided gated cross-attention mechanism to enhance or suppress parts of the history as per how informative they are for current frame prediction. GateHUB further proposes Future-augmented History (FaH) to make history features more informative by using subsequently observed frames when available. In a single unified framework, GateHUB integrates the transformer's ability of long-range temporal modeling and the recurrent model's capacity to selectively encode relevant information. GateHUB also introduces a background suppression objective to further mitigate false positive background frames that closely resemble the action frames. Extensive validation on three benchmark datasets, THUMOS, TVSeries, and HDD, demonstrates that GateHUB significantly outperforms all existing methods and is also more efficient than the existing best work. Furthermore, a flow-free version of GateHUB is able to achieve higher or close accuracy at 2.8x higher frame rate compared to all existing methods that require both RGB and optical flow information for prediction."}}

To date, there are only a few adversarial perturbations proposed to deviate the DNN models in video recognition systems by simply injecting 2D perturbations into video frames. However, such attacks may overly perturb the videos without learning the spatio-temporal features (across temporal frames), which are commonly extracted by DNN models for video recognition. To our best knowledge, we propose the first black-box attack framework that generates universal 3-dimensional (U3D) perturbations to subvert a variety of video recognition systems. U3D has many advantages, such as (1) as the transfer-based attack, U3D can universally attack multiple DNN models for video recognition without accessing to the target DNN model; (2) the high transferability of U3D makes such universal black-box attack easy-to-launch, which can be further enhanced by integrating queries over the target model when necessary; (3) U3D ensures human-imperceptibility; (4) U3D can bypass the existing state-of-the-art defense schemes; (5) U3D can be efficiently generated with a few pre-learned parameters, and then immediately injected to attack real-time DNN-based video recognition systems. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate U3D on multiple DNN models and three large-scale video datasets. The experimental results demonstrate its superiority and practicality."}}

Making effective recommendations to these time-sensitive cold-start users is critical to maintain the user base of a recommender system. Due to the sparse recent interactions, it is challenging to capture these users' current preferences precisely. Solely relying on their historical interactions may also lead to outdated recommendations misaligned with their recent interests. The proposed model leverages historical and current user-item interactions and dynamically factorizes a user's (latent) preference into time-specific and time-evolving representations that jointly affect user behaviors. These latent factors further interact with an optimized item embedding to achieve accurate and timely recommendations. Experiments over real-world data help demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed time-sensitive cold-start recommendation model."}}

In particular, gradient-based attacks have demonstrated high success rates recently. The gradient measures how each image pixel affects the model output, which contains critical information for generating malicious perturbations. In this paper, we show that the gradients can also be exploited as a powerful weapon to defend against adversarial attacks. By using both gradient maps and adversarial images as inputs, we propose a Two-stream Restoration Network (TRN) to restore the adversarial images. To optimally restore the perturbed images with two streams of inputs, a Gradient Map Estimation Mechanism is proposed to estimate the gradients of adversarial images, and a Fusion Block is designed in TRN to explore and fuse the information in two streams. Once trained, our TRN can defend against a wide range of attack methods without significantly degrading the performance of benign inputs. Also, our method is generalizable, scalable, and hard to bypass. Experimental results on CIFAR10, SVHN, and Fashion MNIST demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods."}}

Vision-based action recognition and prediction from videos are such tasks, where action recognition is to infer human actions (present state) based upon complete action executions, and action prediction to predict human actions (future state) based upon incomplete action executions. These two tasks have become particularly prevalent topics recently because of their explosively emerging real-world applications, such as visual surveillance, autonomous driving vehicle, entertainment, and video retrieval, etc. Many attempts have been devoted in the last a few decades in order to build a robust and effective framework for action recognition and prediction. In this paper, we survey the complete state-of-the-art techniques in action recognition and prediction. Existing models, popular algorithms, technical difficulties, popular action databases, evaluation protocols, and promising future directions are also provided with systematic discussions."}}

Given its computationally tractable inference, the success of MCF tracking largely relies on the learned cost function of underlying linear program. Most previous studies focus on learning the cost function by only taking into account two frames during training, therefore the learned cost function is sub-optimal for MCF where a multi-frame data association must be considered during inference. In order to address this problem, in this paper we propose a novel differentiable framework that ties training and inference to-gether during learning by solving a bi-level optimization problem, where the lower-level solves a linear program and the upper-level contains a loss function that incorpo-rates global tracking result. By back-propagating the loss through differentiable layers via gradient descent, the glob-ally parameterized cost function is explicitly learned and regularized. With this approach, we are able to learn a better objective for global MCF tracking. As a result, we achieve competitive performances compared to the current state-of-the-art methods on the popular multi-object tracking benchmarks such as MOT16, MOT17 and MOT20."}}

However, existing TAL methods are rooted in the closed set assumption, which cannot handle the inevitable unknown actions in open-world scenarios. In this paper, we, for the first time, step toward the Open Set TAL (OSTAL) problem and propose a general framework Open TAL based on Evidential Deep Learning (EDL). Specifically, the OpenTAL consists of uncertainty-aware action classification, actionness prediction, and temporal location regression. With the proposed importance-balanced EDL method, classification uncertainty is learned by collecting categorical evidence majorly from important samples. To distinguish the unknown actions from background video frames, the actionness is learned by the positive-unlabeled learning. The classification uncertainty is further calibrated by leveraging the guidance from the temporal localization quality. The OpenTAL is general to enable existing TAL models for open set scenarios, and experimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method. The code and pre-trained models are released at https://www.rit.edu/actionlab/opental."}}
