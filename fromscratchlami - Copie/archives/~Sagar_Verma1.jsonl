The proposed estimation method is comprised of a neural speed\u2013torque estimator and a neural signal denoiser. A new training strategy is introduced that combines large amount of simulated data and a small amount of real-world data. The proposed denoiser does not require nonnoisy ground-truth data for training, and instead uses classification labels that are easily generated from real-world data. This approach improves upon existing noise removal techniques by learning to denoise as well as classify noisy signals into static and dynamic parts. The proposed NN-based denoiser generates clean estimates of currents and voltages that are then used as inputs to the NN estimator of speed and torque. Extensive experiments show that the proposed joint denoising-estimation strategy performs very well on real data benchmarks. The proposed denoising method is shown to outperform several widely used denoising methods and a proper ablation study of the proposed method is conducted."}}

Existing Lipschitz bounding methods train from scratch and are limited to moderately sized networks (< 6M parameters). They require a fair amount of hyper-parameter tuning and are computationally prohibitive for large networks like Vision Transformers (5M to 660M parameters). Obtaining certified robustness of transformers is not feasible due to the non-scalability and inflexibility of the current methods. This work presents CertViT, a two-step proximal-projection method to achieve certified robustness from pre-trained weights. The proximal step tries to lower the Lipschitz bound and the projection step tries to maintain the clean accuracy of pre-trained weights. We show that CertViT networks have better certified accuracy than state-of-the-art Lipschitz trained networks. We apply CertViT on several variants of pre-trained vision transformers and show adversarial robustness using standard attacks. Code : https://github.com/sagarverma/transformer-lipschitz"}}

The growing increase of neural networks in safety-critical systems requires an in-depth analysis of their robustness and stability. This paper studies the robustness of neural networks used in time-series tasks like system modeling, signal denoising, speed-torque estimation, temperature estimation, and fault detection. The dataset collected for these problems has all types of noise from the operating environment, sensors, and the system itself. This affects the performance of different network architectures during training and inference. We train and analyze under perturbations several different architectures that range from simple linear, convolutional and sequential networks to complex networks like 1D ResNet and Transformers.

Recent advances in neural network-based estimators and fault detection techniques rely heavily on accurate sensor information. Due to the extreme operating conditions of electrical motors, there is always a chance of sensor failure which might lead to poor performance in downstream tasks using neural networks. This paper introduces the problem of identifying and recovering sensor faults using generative adversarial networks. We consider sensors monitoring various quantities like currents, voltages, speed, torque, temperature, and vibrations. We introduce fault model for these sensors to simulate training datasets. We use existing GAN based data imputation methods as baseline solutions.\nProject Page: https://sagarverma.github.io/sensors.html"}}

Despite recent advancements in remote sensing realized through deep learning, novel methods for accurate multi-image change detection remain unrealized. Recently, several promising methods have been proposed to address this topic, but a paucity of publicly available data limits the methods that can be assessed. In particular, there exists limited work on categorizing the nature and status of change across an observation period. This paper introduces the first labeled dataset available for such a task. We present an open-source change detection dataset, termed QFabric, with 450,000 change polygons annotated across 504 locations in 100 different cities covering a wide range of geographies and urban fabrics. QFabric is a temporal multi-task dataset with 6 change types and 9 change status classes. The geography and environment metadata around each polygon provides context that can be leveraged to build robust deep neural networks. We apply multiple benchmarks on our dataset for change detection, change type and status classification tasks. Project page: https://sagarverma.github.io/qfabric"}}
