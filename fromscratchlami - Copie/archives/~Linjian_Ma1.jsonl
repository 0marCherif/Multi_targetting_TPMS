These embeddings have been used to perform dimensionality reduction of tensor network structured inputs $x$ and accelerate applications such as tensor decomposition and kernel regression. Existing works have designed embeddings for inputs $x$ with specific structures, such as the Kronecker product or Khatri-Rao product, such that the computational cost for calculating $Sx$ is efficient. We provide a systematic way to design tensor network embeddings consisting of Gaussian random tensors, such that for inputs with more general tensor network structures, both the sketch size (row size of $S$) and the sketching computational cost are low.\nWe analyze general tensor network embeddings that can be reduced to a sequence of sketching matrices. We provide a sufficient condition to quantify the accuracy of such embeddings and derive sketching asymptotic cost lower bounds using embeddings that satisfy this condition and have a sketch size lower than any input dimension. We then provide an algorithm to efficiently sketch input data using such embeddings. The sketch size of the embedding used in the algorithm has a linear dependence on the number of sketching dimensions of the input. Assuming tensor contractions are performed with classical dense matrix multiplication algorithms, this algorithm achieves asymptotic cost within a factor of $O(\\sqrt{m})$ of our cost lower bound, where $m$ is the sketch size. Further, when each tensor in the input has a dimension that needs to be sketched, this algorithm yields the optimal sketching asymptotic cost. We apply our sketching analysis to inexact tensor decomposition optimization algorithms. We provide a sketching algorithm for CP decomposition that is asymptotically faster than existing work in multiple regimes, and show the optimality of an existing algorithm for tensor train rounding.\n"}}

Abstract Simulating quantum algorithms on classical computers is challenging when the system size, i.e., the number of qubits used in the quantum algorithm, is moderately large. However, some quantum algorithms and the corresponding quantum circuits can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer if the input quantum state is a low rank tensor and all intermediate states of the quantum algorithm can be represented or approximated by low rank tensors. In this paper, we examine the possibility of simulating a few quantum algorithms by using low-rank canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition to represent the input and all intermediate states of these algorithms. Two rank reduction algorithms are used to enable efficient simulation. We show that some of the algorithms preserve the low rank structure of the input state and can thus be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. However, the rank of the intermediate states in other quantum algorithms can increase rapidly, making efficient simulation more difficult. To some extent, such difficulty reflects the advantage or superiority of a quantum computer over a classical computer.

However, alternating least squares may exhibit slow or no convergence, especially when high accuracy is required. An alternative approach is to regard CP decomposition as a nonlinear least squares problem and employ Newton-like methods. Direct solution of linear systems involving an approximated Hessian is generally expensive. However, recent advancements have shown that use of an implicit representation of the linear system makes these methods competitive with alternating least squares (ALS). We provide the first parallel implementation of a Gauss--Newton method for CP decomposition, which iteratively solves linear least squares problems at each Gauss--Newton step. In particular, we leverage a formulation that employs tensor contractions for implicit matrix-vector products within the conjugate gradient method. The use of tensor contractions enables us to employ the Cyclops library for distributed-memory tensor computations to parallelize the Gauss--Newton approach with a high-level Python implementation. In addition, we propose a regularization scheme for the Gauss--Newton method to improve convergence properties without any additional cost. We study the convergence of variants of the Gauss--Newton method relative to ALS for finding exact CP decompositions as well as approximate decompositions of real-world tensors. We evaluate the performance of sequential and parallel versions of both approaches, and study the parallel scalability on the Stampede2 supercomputer."}}

This kernel is necessary to set up the quadratic optimization subproblems. State-of-the-art parallel ALS implementations use dimension trees to avoid redundant computations across MTTKRPs within each ALS sweep. In this paper, we propose two new parallel algorithms to accelerate CP-ALS. We introduce the multi-sweep dimension tree (MSDT) algorithm, which requires the contraction between an order N input tensor and the first-contracted input matrix once every (N-1)/N sweeps. This algorithm reduces the leading order computational cost by a factor of 2(N-1)/N relative to the best previously known approach. In addition, we introduce a more communication-efficient approach to parallelizing an approximate CP-ALS algorithm, pairwise perturbation. This technique uses perturbative corrections to the subproblems rather than recomputing the contractions, and asymptotically accelerates ALS. Our benchmark results on 1024 processors on the Stampede2 supercomputer show that CP decomposition obtains a 1.25X speed-up from MSDT and a 1.94X speedup from pairwise perturbation compared to the state-of-the-art dimension-tree based CP-ALS implementations."}}

However, current pruning algorithms either only focus on one pruning category, e.g., structured pruning and unstructured, or need extensive hyperparameter tuning in order to get reasonable accuracy performance. To address these challenges, we propose LEArnable Pruning (LEAP), an effective method to gradually prune the model based on thresholds learned by gradient descent. Different than previous learnable pruning methods, which utilize $L_0$ or $L_1$ penalty to indirectly affect the final pruning ratio, LEAP introduces a novel regularization function, that directly interacts with the preset target pruning ratio. Moreover, in order to reduce hyperparameter tuning, a novel adaptive regularization coefficient is deployed to control the regularization penalty adaptively. With the new regularization term and its associated adaptive regularization coefficient, LEAP is able to be applied for different pruning granularity, including unstructured pruning, structured pruning, and hybrid pruning, with minimal hyperparameter tuning. We apply LEAP for BERT models on QQP/MNLI/SQuAD for different pruning settings. Our result shows that for all datasets, pruning granularity, and pruning ratios, LEAP achieves on-par or better results as compared to previous heavily hand-tuned methods."}}

In particular, the BERT based models achieved significant accuracy gain for GLUE tasks, CoNLL-03 and SQuAD. However, BERT based models have a prohibitive memory footprint and latency. As a result, deploying BERT based models in resource constrained environments has become a challenging task. In this work, we perform an extensive analysis of fine-tuned BERT models using second order Hessian information, and we use our results to propose a novel method for quantizing BERT models to ultra low precision. In particular, we propose a new group-wise quantization scheme, and we use Hessian-based mix-precision method to compress the model further. We extensively test our proposed method on BERT downstream tasks of SST-2, MNLI, CoNLL-03, and SQuAD. We can achieve comparable performance to baseline with at most 2.3% performance degradation, even with ultra-low precision quantization down to 2 bits, corresponding up to 13\u00d7 compression of the model parameters, and up to 4\u00d7 compression of the embedding table as well as activations. Among all tasks, we observed the highest performance loss for BERT fine-tuned on SQuAD. By probing into the Hessian based analysis as well as visualization, we show that this is related to the fact that current training/fine-tuning strategy of BERT does not converge for SQuAD."}}
