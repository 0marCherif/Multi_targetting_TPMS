Knowledge graph embeddings map nodes into a vector space to predict new links, scoring them according to geometric criteria. Relations in the graph may follow patterns that can be learned, e.g., some relations might be symmetric and others might be hierarchical. However, the learning capability of different embedding models varies for each pattern and, so far, no single model can learn all patterns equally well. In this paper, we combine the query representations from several models in a unified one to incorporate patterns that are independently captured by each model. Our combination uses attention to select the most suitable model to answer each query. The models are also mapped onto a non-Euclidean manifold, the Poincar\u00e9 ball, to capture structural patterns, such as hierarchies, besides relational patterns, such as symmetry. We prove that our combination provides a higher expressiveness and inference power than each model on its own. As a result, the combined model can learn relational and structural patterns. We conduct extensive experimental analysis with various link prediction benchmarks showing that the combined model outperforms individual models, including state-of-the-art approaches."}}

In the past, predictive performance was considered the key indicator to monitor. However, explanation aspects have come to attention within the last years. In this work, we investigate how model predictive performance and model explanation characteristics are affected under distribution shifts and how these key indicators are related to each other for tabular data.\nWe find that the modeling of explanation shifts can be a better indicator for the detection of predictive performance changes than state-of-the-art techniques based on representations of distribution shifts. We provide a mathematical analysis of different types of distribution shifts as well as synthetic experimental examples."}}

A major concern is to produce predictions that are logically consistent with these constraints. To do so, we formulate this problem as an embedding inference problem where the constraints are imposed onto the embeddings of labels by geometric construction. Particularly, we consider a hyperbolic Poincar\u00e9 ball model in which we encode labels as Poincar\u00e9 hyperplanes that work as linear decision boundaries. The hyperplanes are interpreted as convex regions such that the logical relationships (implication and exclusion) are geometrically encoded using the insideness and disjointedness of these regions, respectively. We show theoretical groundings of the method for preserving logical relationships in the embedding space. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets show 1) significant improvements in mean average precision; 2) lower number of constraint violations;  3) an order of magnitude fewer dimensions than baselines."}}

GCNs are traditionally studied through the lens of Euclidean geometry. Recent works find that non-Euclidean Riemannian manifolds provide specific inductive biases for embedding hierarchical or spherical data. However, they cannot align well with data of mixed graph topologies. We consider a larger class of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds that generalize hyperboloid and sphere. We develop new geodesic tools that allow for extending neural network operations into geodesically disconnected pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. As a consequence, we derive a pseudo-Riemannian GCN that models data in pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of constant nonzero curvature in the context of graph neural networks. Our method provides a geometric inductive bias that is sufficiently flexible to model mixed heterogeneous topologies like hierarchical graphs with cycles. We demonstrate the representational capabilities of this method by applying it to the tasks of graph reconstruction, node classification, and link prediction on a series of standard graphs with mixed topologies. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms Riemannian counterparts when embedding graphs of complex topologies. "}}

While existing methods suffer from model selection, parallelism, or sample efficiency, this paper presents a new HPO method, MOdular FActorial Design (MOFA), to address these issues simultaneously. The major idea is to use techniques from Experimental Designs to improve sample efficiency of model-free methods. Particularly, MOFA runs with four modules in each iteration: (1) an Orthogonal Latin Hypercube (OLH)-based sampler preserving both univariate projection uniformity and orthogonality; (2) a highly parallelized evaluator; (3) a transformer to collapse the OLH performance table into a specified Fractional Factorial Design--Orthogonal Array (OA); (4) an analyzer including Factorial Performance Analysis and Factorial Importance Analysis to narrow down the search space. We theoretically and empirically show that MOFA has great advantages over existing model-based and model-free methods. "}}

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is one of the fields which are actively benefiting from this availability. Unlike most of the approaches addressing HAR by considering predefined activity classes, this paper proposes a novel approach to discover the latent HAR patterns in sequential data. To this end, we employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which is initially a topic modelling approach used in text analysis. To make the data suitable for LDA, we extract the so-called \"sensory words\" from the sequential data. We carried out experiments on a challenging HAR dataset, demonstrating that LDA is capable of uncovering underlying structures in sequential data, which provide a human-understandable representation of the data. The extrinsic evaluations reveal that LDA is capable of accurately clustering HAR data sequences compared to the labelled activities."}}

We discuss the roles of schema, identity, and context in knowledge graphs. We explain how knowledge can be represented and extracted using a combination of deductive and inductive techniques. We summarise methods for the creation, enrichment, quality assessment, refinement, and publication of knowledge graphs. We provide an overview of prominent open knowledge graphs and enterprise knowledge graphs, their applications, and how they use the aforementioned techniques.

We present PubMedSection, a novel topic classification dataset focussed on the biomedical domain. Our comprehensive analysis covers 11 tasks and combinations of six embeddings. We report that combined embeddings outperform state of the art universal embeddings without any embedding fine-tuning. We observe that adding topic model based embeddings helps for most tasks and that differing pre-training tasks encode complementary features.

A shape groups a set of constraints that may be fulfilled by nodes in the RDF graph. We investigate the problem of containment between SHACL shapes. One shape is contained in a second shape if every graph node meeting the constraints of the first shape also meets the constraints of the second. To decide shape containment, we map SHACL shape graphs into description logic axioms such that shape containment can be answered by description logic reasoning. We identify several, increasingly tight syntactic restrictions of SHACL for which this approach becomes sound and complete."}}

MOFA pursues several rounds of HPO, where each round alternates between exploration of hyperparameter space by factorial design and exploitation of evaluation results by factorial analysis. Each round first explores the configuration space by constructing a low-discrepancy set of hyperparameters that cover this space well while de-correlating hyperparameters, and then exploits evaluation results through factorial analysis that determines which hyperparameters should be further explored and which should become fixed in the next round. We prove that the inference of MOFA achieves higher confidence than other sampling schemes. Each individual round is highly parallelizable and hence offers major improvements of efficiency compared to model-based methods. Empirical results show that MOFA achieves better effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods."}}
