However, existing SA networks still suffer from distance insensitivity and low-rank bottleneck. In this paper, we aim to optimize SA in terms of two aspects, thereby addressing the above issues. First, we introduce a Distance-sensitive Self-Attention (DSA), which considers the raw geometric distances between query-key pairs in the 2D images during SA modeling. Second, we present a simple yet effective approach, named Multi-branch Self-Attention (MSA) to compensate for the low-rank bottleneck. MSA treats a multi-head self-attention layer as a branch and duplicates it multiple times to increase the expressive power of SA. To validate the effectiveness of the two designs, we apply them to the standard self-attention network, and conduct extensive experiments on the highly competitive MS-COCO dataset. We achieve new state-of-the-art performance on both the local and online test sets, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e</i> ., 135.1% CIDEr on the Karpathy split and 135.4% CIDEr on the official online split."}}

However, existing methods simply transfer 2D alignment strategies, aligning 3D representations with single-view 2D images and coarse-grained parent category text. These approaches introduce information degradation and insufficient synergy issues, leading to performance loss. Information degradation arises from overlooking the fact that a 3D representation should be equivalent to a series of multi-view images and more fine-grained subcategory text. Insufficient synergy neglects the idea that a robust 3D representation should align with the joint vision-language space, rather than independently aligning with each modality. In this paper, we propose a multi-view joint modality modeling approach, termed JM3D, to obtain a unified representation for point cloud, text, and image. Specifically, a novel Structured Multimodal Organizer (SMO) is proposed to address the information degradation issue, which introduces contiguous multi-view images and hierarchical text to enrich the representation of vision and language modalities. A Joint Multi-modal Alignment (JMA) is designed to tackle the insufficient synergy problem, which models the joint modality by incorporating language knowledge into the visual modality. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, JM3D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot 3D classification. JM3D outperforms ULIP by approximately 4.3% on PointMLP and achieves an improvement of up to 6.5% accuracy on PointNet++ in top-1 accuracy for zero-shot 3D classification on ModelNet40.

However, this conventional paradigm encounters significant challenges, most notably in terms of the generation of lackluster initial proposals and a pronounced deceleration in inference speed. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an innovative end-to-end Superpoint-Text Matching Network (3D-STMN) that is enriched by dependency-driven insights. One of the keystones of our model is the Superpoint-Text Matching (STM) mechanism. Unlike traditional methods that navigate through instance proposals, STM directly correlates linguistic indications with their respective superpoints, clusters of semantically related points. This architectural decision empowers our model to efficiently harness cross-modal semantic relationships, primarily leveraging densely annotated superpoint-text pairs, as opposed to the more sparse instance-text pairs. In pursuit of enhancing the role of text in guiding the segmentation process, we further incorporate the Dependency-Driven Interaction (DDI) module to deepen the network's semantic comprehension of referring expressions. Using the dependency trees as a beacon, this module discerns the intricate relationships between primary terms and their associated descriptors in expressions, thereby elevating both the localization and segmentation capacities of our model. Comprehensive experiments on the ScanRefer benchmark reveal that our model not only set new performance standards, registering an mIoU gain of 11.7 points but also achieve a staggering enhancement in inference speed, surpassing traditional methods by 95.7 times.

Prior methods adopt text-independent multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to predict the attributes of the target mesh with the supervision of CLIP loss. However, such text-independent architecture lacks textual guidance during predicting attributes, thus leading to unsatisfactory stylization and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we present X-Mesh, an innovative text-driven 3D stylization framework that incorporates a novel Text-guided Dynamic Attention Module (TDAM). The TDAM dynamically integrates the guidance of the target text by utilizing text-relevant spatial and channel-wise attentions during vertex feature extraction, resulting in more accurate attribute prediction and faster convergence speed. Furthermore, existing works lack standard benchmarks and automated metrics for evaluation, often relying on subjective and non-reproducible user studies to assess the quality of stylized 3D assets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new standard text-mesh benchmark, namely MIT-30, and two automated metrics, which will enable future research to achieve fair and objective comparisons. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that X-Mesh outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods."}}

Existing MMPS methods have achieved promising performance. Nevertheless, there still exist several problems: 1) lack end-to-end product summarization, 2) lack multi-grained multi-modal modeling, and 3) lack multi-modal attribute modeling. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end multi-grained multi-modal attribute-aware product summarization method (M3PS) for generating high-quality product summaries in e-commerce. M3PS jointly models product attributes and generates product summaries. Meanwhile, we design several multi-grained multi-modal tasks to better guide the multi-modal learning of M3PS. Furthermore, we model product attributes based on both text and image modalities so that multi-modal product characteristics can be manifested in the generated summaries. Extensive experiments on a real large-scale Chinese e-commence dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art product summarization methods w.r.t. several summarization metrics."}}

LSA is deployed for the intra-layer interaction in Transformer via modeling the relationship between each grid and its neighbors.
