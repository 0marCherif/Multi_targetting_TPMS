In this work, we study an alternative finetuning method, where instead of finetuning all the weights of the network, we only train a carefully chosen subset of layers, keeping the rest of the weights frozen at their initial (pretrained) values. We demonstrate that \\emph{subset finetuning} (or SubTuning) often achieves accuracy comparable to full finetuning of the model, and even surpasses the performance of full finetuning when training data is scarce. Therefore, SubTuning allows deploying new tasks at minimal computational cost, while enjoying the benefits of finetuning the entire model. This yields a simple and effective method for multi-task learning, where different tasks do not interfere with one another, and yet share most of the resources at inference time. We demonstrate the efficiency of SubTuning across multiple tasks, using different network architectures and pretraining methods."}}

At each given time, one process is probed, and the random observations follow two different distributions, depending on whether the process is normal or abnormal. Each anomalous process incurs a cost until its anomaly is identified and fixed, and the cost is a nonlinear (specifically, polynomial with degree d) function of the duration of the anomalous state. The objective is a sequential search strategy that minimizes the total expected cost incurred by all the processes during the detection process under reliability constraints. We propose a search algorithm that consists of exploration, exploitation, and sequential testing phases. We establish its asymptotic optimality and analyze the approximation ratio and the regret under computational constraints."}}
