Currently, the majority of HMP algorithms are trained by massive pre-collected data. As the training data only contains a few pre-defined motion patterns, these methods cannot handle the unfamiliar motion patterns. Moreover, the pre-collected data are usually non-interactive, which does not consider the real-time responses of collaborators. As a result, these methods usually perform unsatisfactorily in real HRI scenarios. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Continual Learning (CL) approach for probabilistic HMP which makes the robot continually learns during its interaction with collaborators. The proposed approach consists of two steps. First, we leverage a Bayesian Neural Network to model diverse uncertainties of observed human motions for collecting online interactive data safely. Then we take Experience Replay and Knowledge Distillation to elevate the model with new experiences while maintaining the knowledge learned before. We first evaluate our approach on a large-scale benchmark dataset Human3.6m. The experimental results show that our approach achieves a lower prediction error compared with the baselines methods. Moreover, our approach could continually learn new motion patterns without forgetting the learned knowledge. We further conduct real-scene experiments using Kinect DK. The results show that our approach can learn the human kinematic model from scratch, which effectively secures the interaction."}}

Currently, the majority of the human motion prediction algorithms are based on deterministic models, which may lead to risky decisions for robots. To solve this problem, we propose a probabilistic model for human motion prediction in this paper. The key idea of our approach is to extend the conventional deterministic motion prediction neural network to a Bayesian one. On one hand, our model could generate several future motions when given an observed motion sequence. On the other hand, by calculating the Epistemic Uncertainty and the Heteroscedastic Aleatoric Uncertainty, our model could tell the robot if the observation has been seen before and also give the optimal result among all possible predictions. We extensively validate our approach on a large scale benchmark dataset Human3.6m. The experiments show that our approach performs better than deterministic methods. We further evaluate our approach in a Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) scenario. The experimental results show that our approach makes the interaction more efficient and safer."}}
