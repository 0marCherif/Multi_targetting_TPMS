To solve this problem, we propose to apply optimal transport to match the vision and text modalities. Specifically, we first model images and the categories with visual and textual feature sets.

In the inner loop, we optimize the optimal transport distance to align visual features and prompts by the Sinkhorn algorithm, while in the outer loop, we learn the prompts by this distance from the supervised data.

The major challenge is to capture authentic and complete user preferences in the entire session. Recent work utilizes graph structure to represent the entire session and adopts Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode session information. This modeling choice has been proved to be effective and achieved remarkable results. However, most of the existing studies only consider each item within the session independently and do not capture session semantics from a high-level perspective. Such limitation often leads to severe information loss and increases the difficulty of capturing long-range dependencies within a session. Intuitively, compared with individual items, a session snippet, i.e., a group of locally consecutive items, is able to provide supplemental user intents which are hardly captured by existing methods. In this work, we propose to learn multi-granularity consecutive user intent unit to improve the recommendation performance. Specifically, we creatively propose Multi-granularity Intent Heterogeneous Session Graph (MIHSG) which captures the interactions between different granularity intent units and relieves the burden of long-dependency. Moreover, we propose the Intent Fusion Ranking (IFR) module to compose the recommendation results from various granularity user intents. Compared with current methods that only leverage intents from individual items, IFR benefits from different granularity user intents to generate more accurate and comprehensive session representation, thus eventually boosting recommendation performance. We conduct extensive experiments on five session-based recommendation datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to current state-of-the-art methods, we achieve as large as 10.21% gain on [email\u00a0protected] and 15.53% gain on [email\u00a0protected]"}}

However, simply integrating KGs in current KG-based RS models is not necessarily a guarantee to improve the recommendation performance, which may even weaken the holistic model capability. This is because the construction of these KGs is independent of the collection of historical user-item interactions; hence, information in these KGs may not always be helpful for recommendation to all users. In this paper, we propose attentive Knowledge-aware Graph convolutional networks with Collaborative Guidance for personalized Recommendation (CG-KGR). CG-KGR is a novel knowledge-aware recommendation model that enables ample and coherent learning of KGs and user-item interactions, via our proposed Collaborative Guidance Mechanism. Specifically, CG-KGR first encapsulates historical interactions to interactive information summarization. Then CG-KGR utilizes it as guidance to extract information out of KGs, which eventually provides more precise personalized recommendation. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets over two recommendation tasks, i.e., Top-K recommendation and Click-Through rate (CTR) prediction. The experimental results show that the CG-KGR model significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art models by 1.4-27.0% in terms of Recall metric on Top-K recommendation."}}

Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have been adopted for fMRI analysis with superior performance. Unfortunately, traditional functional brain networks are mainly constructed based on similarities among region of interests (ROI), which are noisy and agnostic to the downstream prediction tasks and can lead to inferior results for GNN-based models. To better adapt GNNs for fMRI analysis, we propose TBDS, an end-to-end framework based on \\underline{T}ask-aware \\underline{B}rain connectivity \\underline{D}AG (short for Directed Acyclic Graph) \\underline{S}tructure generation for fMRI analysis. The key component of TBDS is the brain network generator which adopts a DAG learning approach to transform the raw time-series into task-aware brain connectivities. Besides, we design an additional contrastive regularization to inject task-specific knowledge during the brain network generation process. Comprehensive experiments on two fMRI datasets, namely Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and Philadelphia Neuroimaging Cohort (PNC) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of TBDS. In addition, the generated brain networks also highlight the prediction-related brain regions and thus provide unique interpretations of the prediction results. Our implementation will be published to https://github.com/yueyu1030/TBDS upon acceptance."}}

To deal with the increasing volume of new concepts needed to be organized as taxonomies, researchers turn to automatically completion of an existing taxonomy with new concepts. In this paper, we propose TaxoEnrich, a new taxonomy completion framework, which effectively leverages both semantic features and structural information in the existing taxonomy and offers a better representation of candidate position to boost the performance of taxonomy completion. Specifically, TaxoEnrichconsists of four components: (1) taxonomy-contextualized embedding which incorporates both semantic meanings of concept and taxonomic relations based on powerful pretrained language models; (2) a taxonomy-aware sequential encoder which learns candidate position representations by encoding the structural information of taxonomy; (3) a query-aware sibling encoder which adaptively aggregates candidate siblings to augment candidate position representations based on their importance to the query-position matching; (4) a query-position matching model which extends existing work with our new candidate position representations. Extensive experiments on four large real-world datasets from different domains show that TaxoEnrichachieves the best performance among all evaluation metrics and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin."}}

However, a fundamental weakness of GCNs, that is, topological limitations, including over-smoothing and local homophily of topology, limits their ability to represent networks. Existing studies for solving these topological limitations typically focus only on the convolution of features on network topology, which inevitably relies heavily on network structure. Moreover, most networks are text-rich, so it is important to integrate not only document-level information, but also the local text information which is particularly significant while often ignored by the existing methods. To solve these limitations, we propose BiTe-GCN, a novel GCN architecture modeling via bidirectional convolution of topology and features on text-rich networks. Specifically, we first transform the original text-rich network into an augmented bi-typed heterogeneous network, capturing both the global document-level information and the local text-sequence information from texts. We then introduce discriminative convolution mechanisms, which performs convolution on this augmented bi-typed network, realizing the convolutions of topology and features altogether in the same system, and learning different contributions of these two parts (i.e., network part and text part), automatically for the given learning objectives. Extensive experiments on text-rich networks demonstrate that our new architecture outperforms the state-of-the-arts by a breakout improvement. Moreover, this architecture can also be applied to several e-commerce search scenes such as JD searching, and experiments on JD dataset show the superiority of the proposed architecture over the related methods."}}
