However, most existing end-to-end pre-training approaches either only aim to tackle VL tasks such as image-text retrieval, visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning that test high-level understanding of images, or only target region-level understanding for tasks such as phrase grounding and object detection. We present FIBER (Fusion-In-the-Backbone-based transformER), a new VL model architecture that can seamlessly handle both these types of tasks. Instead of having dedicated transformer layers for fusion after the uni-modal backbones, FIBER pushes multimodal fusion deep into the model by inserting cross-attention into the image and text backbones to better capture multimodal interactions. In addition, unlike previous work that is either only pre-trained on image-text data or on fine-grained data with box-level annotations, we present a two-stage pre-training strategy that uses both these kinds of data efficiently: (i) coarse-grained pre-training based on image-text data; followed by (ii) fine-grained pre-training based on image-text-box data. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of VL tasks, ranging from VQA, image captioning, and retrieval, to phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension, and object detection. Using deep multimodal fusion coupled with the two-stage pre-training, FIBER provides consistent performance improvements over strong baselines across all tasks, often outperforming methods using magnitudes more data.

While recent work has shown that fully transformer-based VL models can be more efficient than previous region-feature-based methods, their performance on downstream tasks often degrades significantly. In this paper, we present Meter, a Multimodal End-to-end TransformER framework, through which we investigate how to design and pre-train a fully transformer-based VL model in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we dissect the model designs along multiple dimensions: vision encoders (e.g., CLIP-ViT, Swin transformer), text encoders (e.g., RoBERTa, De-BERTa), multimodal fusion module (e.g., merged attention vs. co-attention), architectural design (e.g., encoder-only vs. encoder-decoder), and pre-training objectives (e.g., masked image modeling). We conduct comprehensive experiments and provide insights on how to train a performant VL transformer. Meterachieves an accuracy of 77.64% on the VQAv2 test-std set using only 4M images for pre-training, surpassing the state-of-the-art region-feature-based model by 1.04%, and outperforming the previous best fully transformer-based model by 1.6%. Notably, when further scaled up, our best VQA model achieves an accuracy of 80.54%. Code and pre-trained models are released at https://github.com/zdou0830/METER."}}

Prior works that incorporate external knowledge bases have shown promising results, but knowledge bases are expensive to construct and are often limited to a fixed set of relations. In this paper, we instead focus on better utilizing the implicit knowledge stored in pre-trained language models. While researchers have found that the knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models can be extracted by having them fill in the blanks of carefully designed prompts for relation extraction and text classification, it remains unclear if we can adopt this paradigm in CQA where the inputs and outputs take much more flexible forms. To this end, we investigate four translation methods that can translate natural questions into cloze-style sentences to better solicit commonsense knowledge from language models, including a syntactic-based model, an unsupervised neural model, and two supervised neural models. In addition, to combine the different translation methods, we propose to encourage consistency among model predictions on different translated questions with unlabeled data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on three CQA datasets in zero-shot settings. We show that our methods are complementary to a knowledge base improved model, and combining them can lead to state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Analyses also reveal distinct characteristics of the different cloze translation methods and provide insights on why combining them can lead to great improvements.

However, in many of the previous methods, the generated instructions are not directly trained to optimize the performance of the follower. In this paper, we present \\textsc{foam}, a \\textsc{Fo}llower-\\textsc{a}ware speaker \\textsc{M}odel that is constantly updated given the follower feedback, so that the generated instructions can be more suitable to the current learning state of the follower. Specifically, we optimize the speaker using a bi-level optimization framework and obtain its training signals by evaluating the follower on labeled data. Experimental results on the Room-to-Room and Room-across-Room datasets demonstrate that our methods can outperform strong baseline models across settings. Analyses also reveal that our generated instructions are of higher quality than the baselines."}}
