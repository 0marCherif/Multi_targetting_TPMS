We present a method that mitigates these issues by converting NNs from weight space to function space, via a dual parameterization. Importantly, the dual parameterization enables us to formulate a sparse representation that captures information from the entire data set. This offers a compact and principled way of capturing uncertainty and enables us to incorporate new data without retraining whilst retaining predictive performance. We provide proof-of-concept demonstrations with the proposed approach for quantifying uncertainty in supervised learning on UCI benchmark tasks."}}

We present a model-based RL algorithm that constrains training to a single dynamic mode with high probability. This is a difficult problem because the mode constraint is a hidden variable associated with the environment\u2019s dynamics. As such, it is 1) unknown a priori and 2) we do not observe its output from the environment, so cannot learn it with supervised learning. We present a nonparametric dynamic model which learns the mode constraint alongside the dynamic modes. Importantly, it learns latent structure that our planning scheme leverages to 1) enforce the mode constraint with high probability, and 2) escape local optima induced by the mode constraint. We validate our method by showing that it can solve a simulated quadcopter navigation task whilst providing a level of constraint satisfaction both during and after training."}}

The method finds trajectories that remain in a preferred dynamics mode where possible and in regions of the transition dynamics model that have been observed and can be predicted confidently. The first stage leverages a Mixture of Gaussian Process Experts method to learn a predictive dynamics model from historical data. Importantly, this model learns a gating function that indicates the probability of being in a particular dynamics mode at a given state location. This gating function acts as a coordinate map for a latent Riemannian manifold on which shortest trajectories are solutions to our trajectory optimisation problem. Based on this intuition, the second stage formulates a geometric cost function, which it then implicitly minimises by projecting the trajectory optimisation onto the second-order geodesic ODE; a classic result of Riemannian geometry. A set of collocation constraints are derived that ensure trajectories\nare solutions to this ODE, implicitly solving the trajectory optimisation problem."}}
