This is relevant to many real-world settings like auctions or taxation, where the principal may not know the learning behavior nor the rewards of real people. Moreover, the principal should be few-shot adaptable and minimize the number of interventions, because interventions are often costly. We introduce MERMAIDE, a model-based meta-learning framework to train a principal that can quickly adapt to out-of-distribution agents with different learning strategies and reward functions. We validate this approach step-by-step. First, in a Stackelberg setting with a best-response agent, we show that meta-learning enables quick convergence to the theoretically known Stackelberg equilibrium at test time, although noisy observations severely increase the sample complexity. We then show that our model-based meta-learning approach is cost-effective in intervening on bandit agents with unseen explore-exploit strategies. Finally, we outperform baselines that use either meta-learning or agent behavior modeling, in both $0$-shot and $K=1$-shot settings with partial agent information."}}

Simulations with AI agents are powerful tools for MD, but real-world agents may behave and learn differently than simulated agents under a given mechanism. Also, the mechanism designer may not fully observe an agent's learning strategy or rewards, and executing a mechanism may be costly, e.g., enforcing a tax might require extra labor. Hence, it is key to design robust adaptive mechanisms that generalize well to agents  with unseen (learning) behavior, are few-shot adaptable, and are cost-efficient. Here, we introduce MERMADE, a model-based meta-learning framework to learn mechanisms that can quickly adapt when facing out-of-distribution agents with different learning strategies and reward functions. First, we show that meta-learning allows adapting to the theoretically known and appropriate Stackelberg equilibrium in a simple matrix game at meta-test time, with few interactions with the agent. Second, with bandit agents, we show empirically that our approach yields strong meta-test time performance against agents with various unseen explore-exploit behaviors. Finally, we outperform baselines that separately use either meta-learning or agent behavior modeling to learn a cost-effective mechanism that is $K$-shot adaptable with only partial information about the agents."}}

It has important applications in search and rescue missions, wildlife patrolling and environment monitoring. Active search algorithms must contend with two types of uncertainty: detection uncertainty and location uncertainty. Prior work has typically focused on one of these while ignoring or engineering away the other. The more common approach in robotics is to focus on location uncertainty and remove detection uncertainty by thresholding the detection probability to zero or one. On the other hand, it is common in the sparse signal processing literature to assume the target location is accurate and focus on the uncertainty of its detection. In this work, we propose an inference method to jointly handle both target detection and location uncertainty. We then build a decision making algorithm on this inference method that uses Thompson sampling to enable efficient active search in both the single agent and multi-agent settings. We perform experiments in simulation over varying number of agents and targets to show that our inference and decision making algorithms outperform competing baselines that only account for either target detection or location uncertainty."}}

In this paper, we propose two distinct active search algorithms that allow for multiple robots to independently make data-collection decisions without a central coordinator. Throughout we consider that targets are sparsely located around the environment in keeping with compressive sensing assumptions and its applicability in real world scenarios. Additionally, while most common sensing algorithms assume that agents can sense the entire environment (e.g. compressive sensing) or sense point-wise (e.g. Bayesian Optimization) at a time, we make a realistic assumption that each agent can only sense a contiguous region of space at each time step.
