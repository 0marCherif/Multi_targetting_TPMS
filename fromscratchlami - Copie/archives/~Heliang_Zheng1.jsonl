Inspired by the way human brains acquire knowledge in new domains, we present an innovative generator structure called Domain Re-Modulation (DoRM). DoRM not only meets the criteria of high quality, large synthesis diversity, and cross-domain consistency, which were achieved by previous research in GDA, but also incorporates memory and domain association, akin to how human brains operate. Specifically, DoRM freezes the source generator and introduces new mapping and affine modules (M&A modules) to capture the attributes of the target domain during GDA. This process resembles the formation of new synapses in human brains. Consequently, a linearly combinable domain shift occurs in the style space. By incorporating multiple new M&A modules, the generator gains the capability to perform high-fidelity multi-domain and hybrid-domain generation. Moreover, to maintain cross-domain consistency more effectively, we introduce a similarity-based structure loss. This loss aligns the auto-correlation map of the target image with its corresponding auto-correlation map of the source image during training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our DoRM and similarity-based structure loss in few-shot GDA, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

While few explorations have been conducted on ensembling such models to combine their strengths. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method called Saliency-aware Noise Blending (SNB) that can empower the fused text-guided diffusion models to achieve more controllable generation. Specifically, we experimentally find that the responses of classifier-free guidance are highly related to the saliency of generated images. Thus we propose to trust different models in their areas of expertise by blending the predicted noises of two diffusion models in a saliency-aware manner. SNB is training-free and can be completed within a DDIM sampling process. Additionally, it can automatically align the semantics of two noise spaces without requiring additional annotations such as masks. Extensive experiments show the impressive effectiveness of SNB in various applications. Project page is available at https://magicfusion.github.io/."}}

Limited by the local structure perception of CNN, CAM usually cannot identify the integral object regions. Though the recent Vision Transformer (ViT) can remedy this flaw, we observe it also brings the over-smoothing issue, \\ie, the final patch tokens incline to be uniform. In this work, we propose Token Contrast (ToCo) to address this issue and further explore the virtue of ViT for WSSS. Firstly, motivated by the observation that intermediate layers in ViT can still retain semantic diversity, we designed a Patch Token Contrast module (PTC). PTC supervises the final patch tokens with the pseudo token relations derived from intermediate layers, allowing them to align the semantic regions and thus yield more accurate CAM. Secondly, to further differentiate the low-confidence regions in CAM, we devised a Class Token Contrast module (CTC) inspired by the fact that class tokens in ViT can capture high-level semantics. CTC facilitates the representation consistency between uncertain local regions and global objects by contrasting their class tokens. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show the proposed ToCo can remarkably surpass other single-stage competitors and achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art multi-stage methods.

For example, the cross-modal embedding methods usually suffer from either slow query speed caused by the time-consuming modality interaction or the tremendous memory cost of dense vector storage. While the cross-modal hashing methods are typically unsatisfied in accuracy due to the lossy discrete quantization for vector compression. In this paper, we tackle the retrieval trilemma with a new paradigm named Cross-Modal Indexing (CMI) that directly maps queries into identifiers of the final retrieved candidates. Specifically, we firstly pre-define sequential identifiers (SIDs) for all candidates into a hierarchical tree that maintains data semantically structures. Then we train an encoder-decoder network that maps queries into SIDs with the supervision of the constructed SIDs. Finally, we directly sample SIDs of relevant candidates for queries with O(1) time complexity. By evading the unfavorable modality interaction, dense vector storage, and vector compression, the proposed CMI reaches a satisfactory balance in the retrieval trilemma. For example, experiments demonstrate that CMI achieves comparable accuracy with about 1000x storage reduction and 120x speedup compared to the state-of-the-art methods on several popular image-text retrieval benchmarks."}}

However, unlike words in NLP, the lack of semantic decomposition of images still makes masked autoencoding (MAE) different between vision and language. In this paper, we explore a potential visual analogue of words, i.e., semantic parts, and we integrate semantic information into the training process of MAE by proposing a Semantic-Guided Masking strategy. Compared to widely adopted random masking, our masking strategy can gradually guide the network to learn various information, i.e., from intra-part patterns to inter-part relations. In particular, we achieve this in two steps. 1) Semantic part learning: we design a self-supervised part learning method to obtain semantic parts by leveraging and refining the multi-head attention of a ViT-based encoder. 2) Semantic-guided MAE (SemMAE) training: we design a masking strategy that varies from masking a portion of patches in each part to masking a portion of (whole) parts in an image. Extensive experiments on various vision tasks show that SemMAE can learn better image representation by integrating semantic information. In particular, SemMAE achieves 84.5% fine-tuning accuracy on ImageNet-1k, which outperforms the vanilla MAE by 1.4%. In the semantic segmentation and fine-grained recognition tasks, SemMAE also brings significant improvements and yields the state-of-the-art performance."}}

While few explorations have been performed in 3D scenarios. In this paper, we discuss three fundamental and interesting problems on this topic. First, we equip text-guided diffusion models to achieve $\\textbf{3D-consistent generation}$. Specifically, we integrate a NeRF-like neural field to generate low-resolution coarse results for a given camera view. Such results can provide 3D priors as condition information for the following diffusion process. During denoising diffusion, we further enhance the 3D consistency by modeling cross-view correspondences with a novel two-stream (corresponding to two different views) asynchronous diffusion process. Second, we study $\\textbf{3D local editing}$ and propose a two-step solution that can generate 360$^{\\circ}$ manipulated results by editing an object from a single view. Step 1, we propose to perform 2D local editing by blending the predicted noises. Step 2, we conduct a noise-to-text inversion process that maps 2D blended noises into the view-independent text embedding space. Once the corresponding text embedding is obtained, 360$^{\\circ}$ images can be generated. Last but not least, we extend our model to perform \\textbf{one-shot novel view synthesis} by fine-tuning on a single image, firstly showing the potential of leveraging text guidance for novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments and various applications show the prowess of our 3DDesigner. The project page is available at https://3ddesigner-diffusion.github.io/."}}
