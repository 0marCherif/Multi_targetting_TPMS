However, the majority of existing methods are weight-oriented, and their pruning results may be unsatisfactory when the original model is trained poorly. That is, a fully-trained model is required to provide useful weight information. This may be time-consuming, and the pruning results are sensitive to the updating process of model parameters. In this paper, we propose a metric named Average Filter Information Entropy (AFIE) to measure the importance of each filter. It is calculated by three major steps, i.e., low-rank decomposition of the \"input-output\" matrix of each convolutional layer, normalization of the obtained eigenvalues, and calculation of filter importance based on information entropy. By leveraging the proposed AFIE, the proposed framework is able to yield a stable importance evaluation of each filter no matter whether the original model is trained fully. We implement our AFIE based on AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-50, and test them on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet, respectively. The experimental results are encouraging. We surprisingly observe that for our methods, even when the original model is only trained with one epoch, the importance evaluation of each filter keeps identical to the results when the model is fully-trained. This indicates that the proposed pruning strategy can perform effectively at the beginning stage of the training process for the original model."}}

However, these studies only utilize the aggregation of disjoint structural information to measure the quality and ignore the reliability of the communities in a continuous time interval. To fill this research gap, we propose a novel $(\\theta,k)$-$core$ reliable community (CRC) model in the weighted dynamic networks, and define the problem of \\textit{most reliable community search} that couples the desirable properties of connection strength, cohesive structure continuity, and the maximal member engagement. To solve this problem, we first develop a novel edge filtering based online CRC search algorithm that can effectively filter out the trivial edge information from the networks while searching for a \\textit{reliable} community. Further, we propose an index structure, Weighted Core Forest-Index (WCF-index), and devise an index-based dynamic programming CRC search algorithm, that can prune a large number of insignificant intermediate results and support efficient query processing. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments systematically to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms on eight real datasets under various experimental settings."}}

They were widely used for GPRS encryption in the late 1990s and during the 2000s, and are surprisingly still supported in a range of current mobile phones. In this paper, new key recovery attacks on GEA-1 and GEA-2 are proposed by combining with the time-memory trade-off technique. The new attacks significantly reduce the time and memory costs of the previous attacks on GEA-1, and show that GEA-1 only offers 32-bit (out of 64) security. Furthermore, the slide properties of GEA-1 and GEA-2 are first found and used to explore practical related key attacks. The results show that GEA-1 and GEA-2 can be broken on a common PC within about 0.81 and 6.2 seconds in the multiple related key setting, respectively. Finally, an improved variant of GEA-2 called GEA-2a is proposed. The reasons for making the changes from GEA-2 are explained in detail, which indicates that GEA-2a has significantly better resistance than GEA-2 against all known attacks and can offer 64-bit security."}}

The benefits are two-fold: (1) we could obtain abundant training data for deep hashing models; (2) tagging data possesses richer semantic information which could help better characterize similarity relationships between images. However, tagging data suffers from noises, vagueness and incompleteness. Different from previous unsupervised or supervised hashing learning, we propose a novel weakly-supervised deep hashing framework which consists of two stages: weakly-supervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. The second stage is as usual. In the first stage, we propose two formulations Tag-basEd weakLy-supErvised Modally COoperative hashing Network (TelecomNet) and Generalized TelecomNet (GTelecomNet). Rather than performing supervision on tags, TelecomNet first learns an observed semantic embedding vector for each image from attached tags and then uses it to guide hashing learning. GTelecomNet introduces a novel semantic network to exploit more precise semantic information. By carefully designing the optimization problem, they can well leverage tagging information and image content for hashing learning. The framework is general and does not depend on specific deep hashing methods. Empirical results on real world datasets show that they significantly increase the performance of state-of-the-art deep hashing methods."}}

To convict a person/unit of a charge, the case description must contain matching instances of the constitutive elements (CEs) of that charge. This knowledge of CEs is a valuable guide for the judge in making final decisions. However, it is far from fully exploited for charge prediction in the literature. In this paper we propose a novel method named Constitutive Elements-guided Charge Prediction (CECP). CECP mimics human's charge identification process to extract potential instances of CEs and generate predictions accordingly. It avoids laborious labeling of matching instances of CEs by a novel reinforcement learning module which progressively selects potentially matching sentences for CEs and evaluates their relevance. The final prediction is generated based on the selected sentences and their relevant CEs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show the superiority of CECP over competitive baselines."}}
