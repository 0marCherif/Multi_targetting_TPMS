Reusing old data is critical for policy evaluation, but existing estimators that reuse old data introduce large bias such that we can not obtain a valid confidence interval. Inspired from a related field called survey sampling, we introduce a variant of the doubly robust (DR) estimator, called the regression-assisted DR estimator, that can incorporate the past data without introducing a large bias. The estimator unifies several existing off-policy policy evaluation methods and improves on them with the use of auxiliary information and a regression approach. We prove that the new estimator is asymptotically unbiased, and provide a consistent variance estimator to a construct a large sample confidence interval. Finally, we empirically show that the new estimator improves estimation for the current and future policy values, and provides a tight and valid interval estimation in several nonstationary recommendation environments."}}

However, hyperparameter selection prior to deployment requires selecting policies offline without online execution, which is a significant challenge known as offline policy selection. As yet, there is little understanding about the fundamental limitations of the offline policy selection problem. To contribute to our understanding of this problem, in this paper, we investigate when sample efficient offline policy selection is possible. As off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) is a natural approach for policy selection, the sample complexity of offline policy selection is therefore upper-bounded by the number of samples needed to perform OPE. In addition, we prove that the sample complexity of offline policy selection is also lower-bounded by the sample complexity of OPE. These results imply not only that offline policy selection is effective when OPE is effective, but also that sample efficient policy selection is not possible without additional assumptions that make OPE effective. Moreover, we theoretically study the conditions under which offline policy selection using Fitted Q evaluation (FQE) and the Bellman error is sample efficient. We conclude with an empirical study comparing FQE and Bellman errors for offline policy selection."}}

Much of the early work on representations for reinforcement learning focused on designing fixed-basis architectures to achieve properties thought to be desirable, such as orthogonality and sparsity. In contrast, the idea behind deep reinforcement learning methods is that the agent designer should not encode representational properties, but rather that the data stream should determine the properties of the representation -- good representations emerge under appropriate training schemes. In this paper we bring these two perspectives together, empirically investigating the properties of representations that support transfer in reinforcement learning. We introduce and measure six representational properties over more than 25 thousand agent-task settings. We consider Deep Q-learning agents with different auxiliary losses in a pixel-based navigation environment, with source and transfer tasks corresponding to different goal locations. We develop a method to better understand why some representations work better for transfer, through a systematic approach varying task similarity and measuring and correlating representation properties with transfer performance. We demonstrate the generality of the methodology by investigating representations learned by a Rainbow agent that successfully transfer across games modes in Atari 2600."}}

These results motivate the need to look at specific classes of MDPs where offline reinforcement learning might be feasible. In this work, we explore a restricted class of MDPs to obtain guarantees for offline reinforcement learning. The key property, which we call Action Impact Regularity (AIR), is that actions primarily impact a part of the state (an endogenous component) and have limited impact on the remaining part of the state (an exogenous component). AIR is a strong assumption, but it nonetheless holds in a number of real-world domains including financial markets. We discuss algorithms that exploit the AIR property, and provide a theoretical analysis for an algorithm based on Fitted-Q Iteration. Finally, we demonstrate that the algorithm outperforms existing offline reinforcement learning algorithms across different data collection policies in simulated and real world environments where the regularity holds."}}

But, before we overcome interference we must understand it better. In this work, we first provide a definition and novel measure of interference for value-based control methods such as Fitted Q Iteration and DQN. We systematically evaluate our measure of interference, showing that it correlates with forgetting, across a variety of network architectures. Our new interference measure allows us to ask novel scientific questions about commonly used deep learning architectures and develop new learning algorithms. In particular we show that updates on the last layer result in significantly higher interference than updates internal to the network. Lastly, we introduce a novel online-aware representation learning algorithm to minimize interference, and we empirically demonstrate that it improves stability and has lower interference."}}

Standard value functions correspond to the expected value of a sum of discounted returns. While this formulation is often sufficient for many purposes, it would often be useful to be able to represent functions of the return as well. Unfortunately, most such functions cannot be estimated directly using TD methods. We propose a means of estimating functions of the return using its moments, which can be learned online using a modified TD algorithm. The moments of the return are then used as part of a Taylor expansion to approximate analytic functions of the return."}}

While these representations are widely used in computer vision, their prevalence in reinforcement learning is limited to sparse coding where extracting representations for new data can be computationally intensive. Here, we begin by demonstrating that learning a control policy incrementally with a representation from a standard neural network fails in classic control domains, whereas learning with a representation obtained from a neural network that has sparsity properties enforced is effective. We provide evidence that the reason for this is that the sparse representation provides locality, and so avoids catastrophic interference, and particularly keeps consistent, stable values for bootstrapping. We then discuss how to learn such sparse representations. We explore the idea of Distributional Regularizers, where the activation of hidden nodes is encouraged to match a particular distribution that results in sparse activation across time. We identify a simple but effective way to obtain sparse representations, not afforded by previously proposed strategies, making it more practical for further investigation into sparse representations for reinforcement learning."}}
