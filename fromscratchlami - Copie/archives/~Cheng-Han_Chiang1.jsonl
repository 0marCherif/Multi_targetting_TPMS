However, human evaluation is very difficult to reproduce and its quality is notoriously unstable, hindering fair comparisons among different natural language processing (NLP) models and algorithms. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on unseen tasks when only the task instructions are provided. In this paper, we explore if such an ability of the LLMs can be used as an alternative to human evaluation. We present the LLMs with the exact same instructions, samples to be evaluated, and questions used to conduct human evaluation, and then ask the LLMs to generate responses to those questions; we dub this LLM evaluation. We use human evaluation and LLM evaluation to evaluate the texts in two NLP tasks: open-ended story generation and adversarial attacks. We show that the result of LLM evaluation is consistent with the results obtained by expert human evaluation: the texts rated higher by human experts are also rated higher by the LLMs. We also find that the results of LLM evaluation are stable over different formatting of the task instructions and the sampling algorithm used to generate the answer. We are the first to show the potential of using LLMs to assess the quality of texts and discuss the limitations and ethical considerations of LLM evaluation."}}

We approach this question by examining how SSAs replace words in the original sentence and show that there are still unresolved obstacles that make current SSAs generate invalid adversarial samples. We reveal that four widely used word substitution methods generate a large fraction of invalid substitution words that are ungrammatical or do not preserve the original sentence's semantics. Next, we show that the semantic and grammatical constraints used in SSAs for detecting invalid word replacements are highly insufficient in detecting invalid adversarial samples."}}

Benchmark datasets for rationales have been released to evaluate how good the rationale is. The ground truth rationales in these datasets are often human annotations obtained via crowd-sourced websites. Valuable as these datasets are, the details on how those human annotations are obtained are often not clearly specified. We conduct comprehensive controlled experiments using crowd-sourced websites on two widely used datasets in Interpretable NLP to understand how those unsaid details can affect the annotation results. Specifically, we compare the annotation results obtained from recruiting workers satisfying different levels of qualification. We also provide high-quality workers with different instructions for completing the same underlying tasks. Our results reveal that the annotation quality is highly subject to the workers' qualification, and workers can be guided to provide certain annotations by the instructions. We further show that specific explanation methods perform better when evaluated using the ground truth rationales obtained by particular instructions. Based on these observations, we highlight the importance of providing complete details of the annotation process and call for careful interpretation of any experiment results obtained using those annotations."}}

We conduct analyses to compare the two types of anomalies (OOD and Adv samples) with the in-distribution (ID) ones from three aspects: the input features, the hidden representations in each layer of the model, and the output probability distributions of the classifier. We find that OOD samples expose their aberration starting from the first layer, while the abnormalities of Adv samples do not emerge until the deeper layers of the model. We also illustrate that the models' output probabilities for Adv samples tend to be more unconfident. Based on our observations, we propose a simple method to separate ID, OOD, and Adv samples using the hidden representations and output probabilities of the model. On multiple combinations of ID, OOD datasets, and Adv attacks, our proposed method shows exceptional results on distinguishing ID, OOD, and Adv samples."}}

In this work, we study what specific traits in the pre-training data, other than the semantics, make a pre-trained LM superior to their counterparts trained from scratch on downstream tasks. We propose to use artificially constructed datasets as the pre-training data to exclude the effect of semantics, and further control what characteristics the pre-training corpora have. By fine-tuning the pre-trained models on GLUE benchmark, we can learn how beneficial it is to transfer the knowledge from the model trained on the dataset possessing that specific trait. We define and discuss three different characteristics in the artificial dataset: 1) matching the token's uni-gram or bi-gram distribution between pre-training and downstream fine-tuning, 2) the presence of the explicit dependencies among the tokens in a sequence, 3) the length of the implicit dependencies among the tokens in a sequence. Our experiments show that the explicit dependencies in the sequences of the pre-training data are critical to the downstream performance. Our results also reveal that models achieve better downstream performance when pre-trained on a dataset with a longer range of implicit dependencies. Based on our analysis, we find that models pre-trained with artificial datasets are prone to learn spurious correlation in downstream tasks. Our work reveals that even if the LMs are not pre-trained on natural language, they still gain transferability on certain human language downstream tasks once the LMs learn to model the token dependencies in the sequences. This result helps us understand the exceptional transferability of pre-trained LMs."}}

To this end, we pre-train different transformer-based masked language models on several corpora with certain features, and we fine-tune those language models on GLUE benchmarks. We find that models pre-trained on unstructured data beat those trained directly from scratch on downstream tasks. Our results also show that pre-training on structured data does not always make the model acquire ability that can be transferred to natural language downstream tasks. To our great astonishment, we uncover that pre-training on certain non-human language data gives GLUE performance close to performance pre-trained on another non-English language."}}
