Deep learning methods, which are developing rapidly in the field of semantic segmentation, have been widely applied to remote sensing imagery segmentation. In this work, a novel deep learning network\u2014Dual Encoder with Attention Network (DEANet) is proposed. In this network, a dual-branch encoder structure, whose first branch is used to generate a rough guidance feature map as area attention to help re-encode feature maps in the next branch, is proposed to improve the encoding ability of the network, and an improved pyramid partial decoder (PPD) based on the parallel partial decoder is put forward to make fuller use of the features form the encoder along with the receptive filed block (RFB). In addition, an edge attention module using the transfer learning method is introduced to explicitly advance the segmentation performance in edge areas. Except for structure, a loss function composed with the weighted Cross Entropy (CE) loss and weighted Union subtract Intersection (UsI) loss is designed for training, where UsI loss represents a new region-based aware loss which replaces the IoU loss to adapt to multi-classification tasks. Furthermore, a detailed training strategy for the network is introduced as well. Extensive experiments on three public datasets verify the effectiveness of each proposed module in our framework and demonstrate that our method achieves more excellent performance over some state-of-the-art methods."}}
