It has been shown that the expressive power of standard GNNs is bounded by the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph isomorphism test, from which they inherit proven limitations such as the inability to detect and count graph substructures. On the other hand, there is significant empirical evidence, e.g. in network science and bioinformatics, that substructures are often intimately related to downstream tasks. To this end, we propose \u201dGraph Substructure Networks\u201d (GSN), a topologically-aware message passing scheme based on substructure encoding. We theoretically analyse the expressive power of our architecture, showing that it is strictly more expressive than the WL test, and provide sufficient conditions for universality. Importantly, we do not attempt to adhere to the WL hierarchy; this allows us to retain multiple attractive properties of standard GNNs such as locality and linear network complexity, while being able to disambiguate even hard instances of graph isomorphism. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation on graph classification and regression tasks and obtain state-of-the-art results in diverse real-world settings including molecular graphs and social networks."}}

In an attempt to alleviate this computational burden, we propose a fast point cloud simplification method by learning to sample salient points.

The success of DCNNs can be attributed to the careful selection of their building blocks (e.g., residual blocks, rectifiers, sophisticated normalization schemes, to mention but a few). In this paper, we propose <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Pi$</tex-math></inline-formula> -Nets, a new class of function approximators based on polynomial expansions. <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Pi$</tex-math></inline-formula> -Nets are polynomial neural networks, i.e., the output is a high-order polynomial of the input. The unknown parameters, which are naturally represented by high-order tensors, are estimated through a collective tensor factorization with factors sharing. We introduce three tensor decompositions that significantly reduce the number of parameters and show how they can be efficiently implemented by hierarchical neural networks. We empirically demonstrate that <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Pi$</tex-math></inline-formula> -Nets are very expressive and they even produce good results without the use of non-linear activation functions in a large battery of tasks and signals, i.e., images, graphs, and audio.

The goal of this study is to match the 3D face of an individual to a set of demographic properties (sex, age, BMI, and genomic background) that are extracted from unidentified genetic material. We introduce a triplet loss metric learner that compresses facial shape into a lower dimensional embedding while preserving information about the property of interest. The metric learner is trained for multiple facial segments to allow a global-to-local part-based analysis of the face. To learn directly from 3D mesh data, spiral convolutions are used along with a novel mesh-sampling scheme, which retains uniformly sampled points at different resolutions. The capacity of the model for establishing identity from facial shape against a list of probe demographics is evaluated by enrolling the embeddings for all properties into a support vector machine classifier or regressor and then combining them using a naive Bayes score fuser. Results obtained by a 10-fold cross-validation for biometric verification and identification show that part-based learning significantly improves the systems performance for both encoding with our geometric metric learner or with principal component analysis."}}

Deep learning (DL) frameworks for syndrome identification from 2D facial images are trained on large clinical datasets using standard convolutional neural networks for classification. In contrast, despite the increased availability of 3D scanners in clinical setups, similar frameworks remain absent for 3D facial photographs. The main challenges involve working with smaller datasets and the need for DL operations applicable to 3D geometric data. Therefore, to date, most 3D methods refrain from working across multiple syndromic groups and/or are solely based on traditional machine learning. The first contribution of this work is the use of geometric deep learning with spiral convolutions in a triplet-loss architecture. This geometric encoding (GE) learns a lower dimensional metric space from 3D facial data that is used as input to linear discriminant analysis (LDA) performing multiclass classification. Benchmarking is done against principal component analysis (PCA), a common technique in 3D facial shape analysis, and related work based on 65 distinct 3D facial landmarks as input to LDA. The second contribution of this work involves a part-based implementation to 3D facial shape analysis and multi-class syndrome classification, and this is applied to both GE and PCA. Based on 1,786 3D facial photographs of controls and individuals from 13 different syndrome classes, a five-fold cross-validation was used to investigate both contributions. Results indicate that GE performs better than PCA as input to LDA, and this especially so for more compact (lower dimensional) spaces. In addition, a part-based approach increases performance significantly for both GE and PCA, with a more significant improvement for the latter. I.e., this contribution enhances the power of the dataset. Finally, and interestingly, according to ablation studies within the part-based approach, the upper lip is the most distinguishing facial segment for classifying genetic syndromes in our dataset, which follows clinical expectation. This work stimulates an enhanced use of advanced part-based geometric deep learning methods for 3D facial imaging in clinical genetics."}}
