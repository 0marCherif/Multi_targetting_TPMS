Given a backdoored model, we observe that the feature representations of poisoned samples with trigger are more sensitive to transformations than those of clean samples. It inspires us to design a simple sensitivity metric, called feature consistency towards transformations (FCT), to distinguish poisoned samples from clean samples in the untrustworthy training set. Moreover, we propose two effective backdoor defense methods. Built upon a sample-distinguishment module utilizing the FCT metric, the first method trains a secure model from scratch using a two-stage secure training module. And the second method removes backdoor from a backdoored model with a backdoor removal module which alternatively unlearns the distinguished poisoned samples and relearns the distinguished clean samples. Extensive results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior defense performance against eight types of backdoor attacks, to state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

Among these algorithms, deep unfolding methods demonstrate promising performance but suffer from two issues. Firstly, they do not estimate the degradation patterns and ill-posedness degree from CASSI to guide the iterative learning. Secondly, they are mainly CNN-based, showing limitations in capturing long-range dependencies. In this paper, we propose a principled Degradation-Aware Unfolding Framework (DAUF) that estimates parameters from the compressed image and physical mask, and then uses these parameters to control each iteration. Moreover, we customize a novel Half-Shuffle Transformer (HST) that simultaneously captures local contents and non-local dependencies. By plugging HST into DAUF, we establish the first Transformer-based deep unfolding method, Degradation-Aware Unfolding Half-Shuffle Transformer (DAUHST), for HSI reconstruction. Experiments show that DAUHST surpasses state-of-the-art methods while requiring cheaper computational and memory costs.

Nonetheless, capturing a  real noisy-clean dataset is an unacceptable expensive and cumbersome procedure. To alleviate this problem, this work investigates how to generate realistic noisy images. Firstly, we formulate a simple yet reasonable noise model that treats each real noisy pixel as a random variable. This model splits the noisy image generation problem into two sub-problems: image domain alignment and noise domain alignment. Subsequently, we propose a novel framework, namely Pixel-level Noise-aware Generative Adversarial Network (PNGAN). PNGAN employs a pre-trained real denoiser to map the fake and real noisy images into a nearly noise-free solution space to perform image domain alignment. Simultaneously, PNGAN establishes a pixel-level adversarial training to conduct noise domain alignment. Additionally, for better noise fitting, we present an efficient architecture Simple Multi-scale Network (SMNet) as the generator. Qualitative validation shows that noise generated by PNGAN is highly similar to real noise in terms of intensity and distribution. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that a series of denoisers trained with the generated noisy images achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four real denoising benchmarks."}}
