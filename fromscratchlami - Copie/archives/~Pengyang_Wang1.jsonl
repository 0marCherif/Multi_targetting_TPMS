In order to capture the dynamic varying of user characteristics for generating effective user profiling, we propose an imitation-based mobile user profiling framework. Considering the objective of teaching an autonomous agent to imitate user mobility based on the user's profile, the user profile is the most accurate when the agent can perfectly mimic the user behavior patterns. The profiling framework is formulated into a reinforcement learning task, where an agent is a next-visit planner, an action is a POI that a user will visit next, and the state of the environment is a fused representation of a user and spatial entities. An event in which a user visits a POI will construct a new state, which helps the agent predict users' mobility more accurately. In the framework, we introduce a spatial Knowledge Graph (KG) to characterize the semantics of user visits over connected spatial entities. Additionally, we develop a mutual-updating strategy to quantify the state that evolves over time. Along these lines, we develop a reinforcement imitative graph learning framework for mobile user profiling. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our approach."}}

Interdisciplinary Topic Path Detection for Research Proposals", "abstract": "The peer merit review of research proposals has been the major mechanism to decide grant awards. Nowadays, research proposals have become increasingly interdisciplinary. It has been a longstanding challenge to assign proposals to appropriate reviewers. One of the critical steps in reviewer assignment is to generate accurate interdisciplinary topic labels for proposals. Existing systems mainly collect topic labels manually reported by discipline investigators. However, such human-reported labels can be non-accurate and incomplete. What role can AI play in developing a fair and precise proposal review system? In this evidential study, we collaborate with the National Science Foundation of China to address the task of automated interdisciplinary topic path detection. For this purpose, we develop a deep Hierarchical Interdisciplinary Research Proposal Classification Network (HIRPCN). We first propose a hierarchical transformer to extract the textual semantic information of proposals. We then design an interdisciplinary graph and leverage GNNs to learn representations of each discipline in order to extract interdisciplinary knowledge. After extracting the semantic and interdisciplinary knowledge, we design a level-wise prediction component to fuse the two types of knowledge representations and detect interdisciplinary topic paths for each proposal. We conduct extensive experiments and expert evaluations on three real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model."}}

To tackle these challenges, we propose a principled and generic generation-replay framework to solve SDSL. To achieve robust pseudo-labeling, we develop a novel pseudo-label classification model to leverage supervised knowledge of previously labeled data, unsupervised knowledge of new data, and, structure knowledge of invariant label semantics. To achieve adaptive anti-forgetting model replay, we propose to view the anti-forgetting adaptation task as a flat region search problem.

It can improve the quality of services and intelligence of academic engines. Most of the existing studies for researcher data mining focus on a single task for a particular application scenario and learning a task-specific model, which is usually unable to transfer to out-of-scope tasks. The pre-training technology provides a generalized and sharing model to capture valuable information from enormous unlabeled data. The model can accomplish multiple downstream tasks via a few fine-tuning steps. In this paper, we propose a multi-task self-supervised learning-based researcher data pre-training model named RPT. Specifically, we divide the researchers' data into semantic document sets and community graph. We design the hierarchical Transformer and the local community encoder to capture information from the two categories of data, respectively. Then, we propose three self-supervised learning objectives to train the whole model. Finally, we also propose two transfer modes of RPT for fine-tuning in different scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate RPT, results on three downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of pre-training for researcher data mining."}}

Human mobility is a sequential decision-making process dependent on the users' dynamic interests. With accurate user profiles, the predictive model can perfectly reproduce users' mobility trajectories. In the reverse direction, once the predictive model can imitate users' mobility patterns, the learned user profiles are also optimal. Such intuition motivates us to propose an imitation-based mobile user profiling framework by exploiting reinforcement learning, in which the agent is trained to precisely imitate users' mobility patterns for optimal user profiles. Specifically, the proposed framework includes two modules: (1) representation module, which produces state combining user profiles and spatio-temporal context in real-time; (2) imitation module, where Deep Q-network (DQN) imitates the user behavior (action) based on the state that is produced by the representation module. However, there are two challenges in running the framework effectively. First, epsilon-greedy strategy in DQN makes use of the exploration-exploitation trade-off by randomly pick actions with the epsilon probability. Such randomness feeds back to the representation module, causing the learned user profiles unstable. To solve the problem, we propose an adversarial training strategy to guarantee the robustness of the representation module. Second, the representation module updates users' profiles in an incremental manner, requiring integrating the temporal effects of user profiles. Inspired by Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), we introduce a gated mechanism to incorporate new and old user characteristics into the user profile."}}

As an emerging technique for characterization, Spatial Representation Learning (SRL) uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn non-linear embedded features of spatial data for characterization. However, SRL extracts features by internal layers of DNNs, and thus suffers from lacking semantic labels. Texts of spatial entities, on the other hand, provide semantic understanding of latent feature labels, but is insensible to deep SRL models. How can we teach a SRL model to discover appropriate topic labels in texts and pair learned features with the labels? This paper formulates a new problem: feature-topic pairing, and proposes a novel Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based deep learning framework. Specifically, we formulate the feature-topic pairing problem into an automated alignment task between 1) a latent embedding feature space and 2) a textual semantic topic space. We decompose the alignment of the two spaces into: 1) point-wise alignment, denoting the correlation between a topic distribution and an embedding vector; 2) pair-wise alignment, denoting the consistency between a feature-feature similarity matrix and a topic-topic similarity matrix. We design a PSO based solver to simultaneously select an optimal set of topics and learn corresponding features based on the selected topics. We develop a closed loop algorithm to iterate between 1) minimizing losses of representation reconstruction and feature-topic alignment and 2) searching the best topics. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate the enhanced performance of our method."}}
