Previous KD approaches usually aim to guide the student to mimic the teacher's behavior completely in the representation space. However, such one-to-one corresponding constraints may lead to inflexible knowledge transfer from the teacher to the student, especially those with low model capacities. Inspired by the ultimate goal of KD methods, we propose a novel Evaluation-oriented KD method (EKD) for deep face recognition to directly reduce the performance gap between the teacher and student models during training. Specifically, we adopt the commonly used evaluation metrics in face recognition, i.e., False Positive Rate (FPR) and True Positive Rate (TPR) as the performance indicator. According to the evaluation protocol, the critical pair relations that cause the TPR and FPR difference between the teacher and student models are selected. Then, the critical relations in the student are constrained to approximate the corresponding ones in the teacher by a novel rank-based loss function, giving more flexibility to the student with low capacity. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our EKD over state-of-the-art competitors."}}

This paper presents DuetFace, a novel privacy-preserving face recognition method that employs collaborative inference in the frequency domain. Starting from a counterintuitive discovery that face recognition can achieve surprisingly good performance with only visually indistinguishable high-frequency channels, this method designs a credible split of frequency channels by their cruciality for visualization and operates the server-side model on non-crucial channels. However, the model degrades in its attention to facial features due to the missing visual information. To compensate, the method introduces a plug-in interactive block to allow attention transfer from the client-side by producing a feature mask. The mask is further refined by deriving and overlaying a facial region of interest (ROI). Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in protecting face images from undesired visual inspection, reconstruction, and identification while maintaining high task availability and performance. Results show that the proposed method achieves a comparable recognition accuracy and computation cost to the unprotected ArcFace and outperforms the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving methods.

As the current high accuracy is guaranteed by very deep network structures, facial images often need to be transmitted to third-party servers with high computational power for inference. However, facial images visually reveal the user\u2019s identity information. In this process, both untrusted service providers and malicious users can significantly increase the risk of a personal privacy breach. Current privacy-preserving approaches to face recognition are often accompanied by many side effects, such as a significant increase in inference time or a noticeable decrease in recognition accuracy. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving face recognition method using differential privacy in the frequency domain. Due to the utilization of differential privacy, it offers a guarantee of privacy in theory. Meanwhile, the loss of accuracy is very slight. This method first converts the original image to the frequency domain and removes the direct component termed DC. Then a privacy budget allocation method can be learned based on the loss of the back-end face recognition network within the differential privacy framework. Finally, it adds the corresponding noise to the frequency domain features. Our method performs very well with several classical face recognition test sets according to the extensive experiments.

For this purpose, the FIQA method should consider both the intrinsic property and the recognizability of the face image. Most previous works aim to estimate the sample-wise embedding uncertainty or pair-wise similarity as the quality score, which only considers the partial information from the intra-class. However, these methods ignore the valuable information from the inter-class, which is for estimating the recognizability of face image. In this work, we argue that a high-quality face image should be similar to its intra-class samples and dissimilar to its inter-class samples. Thus, we propose a novel unsupervised FIQA method that incorporates Similarity Distribution Distance for Face Image Quality Assessment (SDD-FIQA). Our method generates quality pseudo-labels by calculating the Wasserstein Distance (WD) between the intra-class and inter-class similarity distributions. With these quality pseudo-labels, we are capable of training a regression network for quality prediction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SDD-FIQA surpasses the state-of-the-arts by an impressive margin. Meanwhile, our method shows good generalization across different recognition systems."}}

Several methods have been proposed to reduce the bias, which rely on accurate demographic annotations. However, such annotations are usually not available in real scenarios. Moreover, these methods are explicitly designed for a specific demographic group divided by a predefined attribute, which is typically not general across different demographic groups divided by various attributes, such as race, gender, and age. In this paper, we propose a false positive rate penalty loss, which mitigates face recognition bias by increasing the consistency of instance false positive rate (FPR). Specifically, we first define the instance FPR as the ratio between the number of the non-target similarities above a unified threshold and the total number of the non-target similarities. The unified threshold is estimated for a given total FPR. Then, we introduce an additional false positive penalty term into the softmaxbased losses to promote the consistency of instance FPRs. Compared with the previous debiasing methods, our method requires no demographic annotations and can mitigate the bias across demographic groups divided by various kinds of attribute which are no need to be predefined in training. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the art competitors."}}

To this end, previous variation-specific methods make full use of task-related prior to design special network losses, which are typically not general among different tasks and scenarios. In contrast, the existing generic methods focus on improving the feature discriminability to minimize the intra-class distance while maximizing the inter-class distance, which perform well on easy samples but fail on hard samples. To improve the performance on hard samples, we propose a novel Distribution Distillation Loss to narrow the performance gap between easy and hard samples, which is simple, effective and generic for various types of facial variations. Specifically, we first adopt state-of-the-art classifiers such as Arcface to construct two similarity distributions: a teacher distribution from easy samples and a student distribution from hard samples. Then, we propose a novel distribution-driven loss to constrain the student distribution to approximate the teacher distribution, which thus leads to smaller overlap between the positive and negative pairs in the student distribution. We have conducted extensive experiments on both generic large-scale face benchmarks and benchmarks with diverse variations on race, resolution and pose. The quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong baselines, e.g., Arcface and Cosface. Code will be available at https://github.com/HuangYG123/DDL ."}}

Surveillance FR is a challenging problem that has great values in law enforcement. Despite recent progress in conventional FR, less effort has been devoted to surveillance FR. To bridge this gap, we propose a Feature Adaptation Network (FAN) to jointly perform surveillance FR and normalization. Our face normalization mainly acts on the aspect of image resolution, closely related to face super-resolution. However, previous face super-resolution methods require paired training data with pixel-to-pixel correspondence, which is typically unavailable between real-world low-resolution and high-resolution faces. FAN can leverage both paired and unpaired data as we disentangle the features into identity and non-identity components and adapt the distribution of the identity features, which breaks the limit of current face super-resolution methods. We further propose a random scale augmentation scheme to learn resolution robust identity features, with advantages over previous fixed scale augmentation. Extensive experiments on LFW, WIDER FACE, QUML-SurvFace and SCface datasets have shown the effectiveness of our method on surveillance FR and normalization."}}
