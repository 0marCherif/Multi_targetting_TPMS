Based on a global prior distribution of label values, which could be obtained privately, we derive a label DP randomization mechanism that is optimal under a given regression loss function. We prove that the optimal mechanism takes the form of a \"randomized response on bins\", and propose an efficient algorithm for finding the optimal bin values. We carry out a thorough experimental evaluation on several datasets demonstrating the efficacy of our algorithm."}}

Our algorithm is very simple: it just post-processes the discrete Laplace-noised histogram!

For the most general problem of isotonic regression over a partially ordered set (poset)  $\\mathcal{X}$ and for any Lipschitz loss function, we obtain a pure-DP algorithm that, given $n$ input points, has an expected excess empirical risk of roughly $\\mathrm{width}(\\mathcal{X}) \\cdot \\log|\\mathcal{X}| / n$, where $\\mathrm{width}(\\mathcal{X})$ is the width of the poset.  In contrast, we also obtain a near-matching lower bound of roughly $(\\mathrm{width}(\\mathcal{X}) + \\log |\\mathcal{X}|) / n$, that holds even for approximate-DP algorithms. Moreover, we show that the above bounds are essentially the best that can be obtained without utilizing any further structure of the poset.\nIn the special case of a totally ordered set and for $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2^2$ losses, our algorithm can be implemented in near-linear running time; we also provide extensions of this algorithm to the problem of private isotonic regression with additional structural constraints on the output function."}}

In this work we introduce a new sketch for this task, based on an exponentially distributed counting Bloom filter. We combine this sketch with a communication-efficient multi-party protocol to solve the task in the multi-worker setting. Our protocol exhibits both differential privacy and security guarantees in the honest-but-curious model and in the presence of large subsets of colluding workers; furthermore, its reach and frequency histogram estimates have a provably small error. Finally, we show the practicality of the protocol by evaluating it on internet-scale audiences."}}
