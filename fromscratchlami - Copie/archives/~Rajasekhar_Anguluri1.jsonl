Examples of this phenomenon include the Kirchoff laws in electric networks and opinion consensus in social networks. Conservation laws in networked systems are modeled as balance equations of the form $X = B^\\ast Y$, where the sparsity pattern of $B^\\ast \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p\\times p}$ captures the connectivity of the network on $p$ nodes, and  $Y, X \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ are vectors of ''potentials'' and ''injected flows'' at the nodes respectively. The node potentials $Y$ cause flows across edges which aim to balance out the potential difference, and the flows $X$ injected at the nodes are extraneous to the network dynamics. In several practical systems, the network structure is often unknown and needs to be estimated from data to facilitate modeling, management, and control. To this end, one has access to samples of the node potentials $Y$, but only the statistics of the node injections $X$. Motivated by this important problem, we study the estimation of the sparsity structure of the matrix $B^\\ast$ from $n$ samples of $Y$ under the assumption that the node injections $X$ follow a Gaussian distribution with a known covariance $\\Sigma_X$. We propose a new $\\ell_{1}$-regularized maximum likelihood estimator for tackling this problem in the high-dimensional regime where the size of the network may be vastly larger than the number of samples $n$. We show that this optimization problem is convex in the objective and admits a unique solution. Under a new mutual incoherence condition, we establish sufficient conditions on the triple $(n,p,d)$ for which exact sparsity recovery of $B^\\ast$ is possible with high probability; $d$ is the degree of the underlying graph. We also establish guarantees for the recovery of $B^\\ast$ in the element-wise maximum, Frobenius, and operator norms. Finally, we complement these theoretical results with experimental validation of the performance of the proposed estimator on synthetic and real-world data."}}

In particular, we establish the power of learning community-based representations to understand the ability of a group of control nodes to steer the network to a target state. We are motivated by abundant real-world examples, ranging from power and water systems to brain networks, in which practitioners do not have access to fine-scale knowledge of the network.  Rather, knowledge is limited to coarse summaries of network structure. Existing work on \"model order reduction\" starts with full knowledge of fine-scale structure and derives a coarse-scale (lower-dimensional) model that well-approximates the fine-scale system.  In contrast, in this paper the controllability aspects of the coarse system are derived from coarse summaries {\\em without} knowledge of the fine-scale structure.  We study under what conditions measures of controllability for the (unobserved) fine-scale system can be well approximated by measures of controllability derived from the (observed) coarse-scale system. To accomplish this, we require knowledge of some inherent parametric structure of the fine-scale system that makes this type of inverse problem feasible. To this end, we assume that the underlying fine-scale network is generated by the stochastic block model (SBM) often studied in community detection. We quantify controllability using the ``average\ncontrollability'' metric and bound the difference between the controllability of the fine-scale system and that of the coarse-scale system.  Our analysis indicates the necessity of underlying structure to make possible the learning of community-based representations, and to be able to quantify  accurately the controllability of coarsely characterized  networked dynamical systems."}}
