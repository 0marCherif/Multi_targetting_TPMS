The evidences needed to recognize events may occur in short time periods with variable lengths and can happen anywhere in a video. This fact prevents conventional machine learning algorithms from effectively recognizing the events. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can automatically identify the key evidences in videos for detecting complex events. Both static instances (objects) and dynamic instances (actions) are considered by sampling frames and temporal segments respectively. To compare the characteristic power of heterogeneous instances, we embed static and dynamic instances into a multiple instance learning framework via instance similarity measures, and cast the problem as an Evidence Selective Ranking (ESR) process. We impose \u21131 norm to select key evidences while using the Infinite Push Loss Function to enforce positive videos to have higher detection scores than negative videos. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. Experiments on large-scale video datasets show that our method can improve the detection accuracy while providing the unique capability in discovering key evidences of each complex event."}}

Hashing methods map high-dimensional features to compact binary codes that are efficient to match and robust in preserving original similarity. However, most of the existing hashing methods treat videos as a simple aggregation of independent frames and index each video through combining the indexes of frames. The structure information of videos, e.g., discriminative local visual commonality and temporal consistency, is often neglected in the design of hash functions. In this paper, we propose a supervised method that explores the structure learning techniques to design efficient hash functions. The proposed video hashing method formulates a minimization problem over a structure-regularized empirical loss. In particular, the structure regularization exploits the common local visual patterns occurring in video frames that are associated with the same semantic class, and simultaneously preserves the temporal consistency over successive frames from the same video. We show that the minimization objective can be efficiently solved by an Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) method. Extensive experiments on two large video benchmark datasets (up to around 150K video clips with over 12 million frames) show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods."}}

However, the existing methods generally use a fixed fusion weight for all the scores of a classifier, and thus fail to optimally determine the fusion weight for the individual samples. In this paper, we propose a sample-specific late fusion method to address this issue. Specifically, we cast the problem into an information propagation process which propagates the fusion weights learned on the labeled samples to individual unlabeled samples, while enforcing that positive samples have higher fusion scores than negative samples. In this process, we identify the optimal fusion weights for each sample and push positive samples to top positions in the fusion score rank list. We formulate our problem as a L <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sub> norm constrained optimization problem and apply the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for the optimization.

The related image set may contain a mixture of annotated objects and candidate objects generated by automatic detectors. Co-detection differs from the conventional object detection paradigm in which detection over each test image is determined one-by-one independently without taking advantage of common patterns in the data pool. In this paper, we propose a novel, robust approach to dramatically enhance co-detection by extracting a shared low-rank representation of the object instances in multiple feature spaces. The idea is analogous to that of the well-known Robust PCA~\\cite{rpca}, but has not been explored in object co-detection so far. The representation is based on a linear reconstruction over the entire data set and the low-rank approach enables effective removal of noisy and outlier samples. The extracted low-rank representation can be used to detect the target objects by spectral clustering. Extensive experiments over diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art object co-detection method and the generic object detection methods without co-detection formulations."}}

However, Web images are often associated with text data which may carry substantial information regarding image semantics, and may be exploited for visual dictionary learning. This paper explores this idea by leveraging relational information between image descriptors and textual words via co-clustering, in addition to information of image descriptors. Existing co-clustering methods are not optimal for this problem because they ignore the structure of image descriptors in the continuous space, which is crucial for capturing visual characteristics of images. We propose a novel Bayesian co-clustering model to jointly estimate the underlying distributions of the continuous image descriptors as well as the relationship between such distributions and the textual words through a unified Bayesian inference. Extensive experiments on image categorization and retrieval have validated the substantial value of the proposed joint modeling in improving visual dictionary learning, where our model shows superior performance over several recent methods."}}

Specifically, we convert each confidence score vector obtained from one model into a pairwise relationship matrix, in which each entry characterizes the comparative relationship of scores of two test samples. Our hypothesis is that the relative score relations are consistent among component models up to certain sparse deviations, despite the large variations that may exist in the absolute values of the raw scores. Then we formulate the score fusion problem as seeking a shared rank-2 pairwise relationship matrix based on which each original score matrix from individual model can be decomposed into the common rank-2 matrix and sparse deviation errors. A robust score vector is then extracted to fit the recovered low rank score relation matrix. We formulate the problem as a nuclear norm and \u2113 <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub> norm optimization objective function and employ the Augmented Lagrange Multiplier (ALM) method for the optimization.

This paper proposes a social image ``retagging'' scheme that aims at assigning images with better content descriptors. The refining process is formulated as an optimization framework based on the consistency between ``visual similarity'' and ``semantic similarity'' in social images. An effective iterative bound optimization algorithm is applied to learn the optimal tag assignment. In addition, as many tags are intrinsically not closely-related to the visual content of the images, we employ a knowledge-based method to differentiate visual content related from unrelated tags and then constrain the tagging vocabulary of our automatic algorithm within the content related tags. Experimental results on a Flickr image collection demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach."}}

In this paper, we propose a tag ranking scheme, aiming to automatically rank the tags associated with a given image according to their relevance to the image content. We first estimate initial relevance scores for the tags based on probability density estimation, and then perform a random walk over a tag similarity graph to refine the relevance scores.
