The proposed model is an adaptation of two state-of-the-art approaches, but it requires less than 4% of parameters in comparison with these approaches. The proposed architecture generates thin edge maps and reaches the highest score (i.e., ODS) when compared with lightweight models (models with less than 1 million parameters), and reaches a similar performance when compare with heavy architectures (models with about 35 million parameters). Both quantitative and qualitative results and comparisons with state-of-the-art models, using different edge detection datasets, are provided. The proposed LDC does not use pre-trained weights and requires straightforward hyper-parameter settings.

The proposed approach generates thin edge-maps that are plausible for human eyes; it can be used in any edge detection task without previous training or fine tuning process. As a second contribution, a large dataset with carefully annotated edges, has been generated. This dataset has been used for training the proposed approach as well the state-of-the-art algorithms for comparisons. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations have been performed on different benchmarks showing improvements with the proposed method when F-measure of ODS and OIS are considered."}}

These sensors allow the visible and near-infrared spectral bands of a given scene to be captured at the same time. With such cameras, the acquired imagery has a compromised RGB color representation due to near-infrared bands (700&ndash;1100 nm) cross-talking with the visible bands (400&ndash;700 nm). This paper proposes two deep learning-based architectures to recover the full RGB color images, thus removing the NIR information from the visible bands. The proposed approaches directly restore the high-resolution RGB image by means of convolutional neural networks. They are evaluated with several outdoor images; both architectures reach a similar performance when evaluated in different scenarios and using different similarity metrics. Both of them improve the state of the art approaches."}}
