Moreover, large networks restrict the application of meta-learning models on low-power edge devices. While choosing smaller networks avoid these issues to a certain extent, it affects the overall generalization leading to reduced performance. Clearly, there is an approximately optimal choice of network architecture that is best suited for every meta-learning problem, however, identifying it beforehand is not straight-forward. In this paper, we present Metadock, a task-specific dynamic kernel selection strategy for designing compressed CNN models that generalize well on unseen tasks in meta-learning. Our method is based on the hypothesis that for a given set of similar tasks, not all kernels of the network are needed by each individual task. Rather, each task uses only a fraction of the kernels, and the selection of the kernels per task can be learnt dynamically as a part of the inner update steps. Metadockcompresses the meta-model as well as the task-specific inner models, thus providing significant reduction in model size for each task, and through constraining the number of active kernels for every task, it implicitly mitigates the issue of meta-overfitting. We show that for the same inference budget, pruned versions of large CNN models obtained using our approach consistently outperform the conventional choices of CNN models. Metadock couples well with popular meta-learning approaches such as iMAML [22]. The efficacy of our method is validated on CIFAR-fs [1] and mini-ImageNet [28] datasets, and we have observed that our approach can provide improvements in model accuracy of up to 2% on standard meta-learning benchmark, while reducing the model size by more than 75%.

It can search a sub-structure from the original model end-to-end across multiple dimensions, including the input tokens, MHSA and MLP modules with state-of-the-art performance. Our method is based on a learnable and unified \u2113 <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf> sparsity constraint with pre-defined factors to reflect the global importance in the continuous searching space of different dimensions. The searching process is highly efficient through a single-shot training scheme. For instance, on DeiT-S, ViT-Slim only takes ~43 GPU hours for the searching process, and the searched structure is flexible with diverse dimensionalities in different modules. Then, a budget threshold is employed according to the requirements of accuracy-FLOPs trade-off on running devices, and a retraining process is performed to obtain the final model. The extensive experiments show that our ViT-Slim can compress up to 40% of parameters and 40% FLOPs on various vision transformers while increasing the accuracy by ~0.6% on ImageNet. We also demonstrate the advantage of our searched models on several downstream datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/Arnav0400/ViT-Slim."}}

However, most such networks have poor performance gain per parameter increase. In this paper, we investigate whether the gain observed in deeper models is purely due to the addition of more optimization parameters or whether the physical size of the network as well plays a role. Further, we present a novel rescaling strategy for CNNs based on learnable repetition of its parameters. Based on this strategy, we rescale CNNs without changing their parameter count, and show that learnable sharing of weights itself can provide significant boost in the performance of any given model without changing its parameter count. We show that small base networks when rescaled, can provide performance comparable to deeper networks with as low as 6% of optimization parameters of the deeper one. The relevance of weight sharing is further highlighted through the example of group-equivariant CNNs. We show that the significant improvements obtained with group-equivariant CNNs over the regular CNNs on classification problems are only partly due to the added equivariance property, and part of it comes from the learnable repetition of network weights. For rot-MNIST dataset, we show that up to 40% of the relative gain reported by state-of-the-art methods for rotation equivariance could actually be due to just the learnt repetition of weights. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> Code is publicly available at https://github.com/transmuteAI/RepeatNet"}}
