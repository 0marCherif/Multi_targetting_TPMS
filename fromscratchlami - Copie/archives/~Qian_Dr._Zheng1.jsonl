Existing datasets are insufficient due to their limited scale and random distributions in shape and material. This paper presents a new real-world photometric stereo dataset with \"ground truth\" normal maps, which is 10 times larger than the widely adopted one. More importantly, we propose to control the shape and material variations by fabricating objects from CAD models with carefully selected materials, covering typical aspects of reflectance properties that are distinctive for evaluating photometric stereo methods. By benchmarking recent photometric stereo methods using these 100 sets of images, with a special focus on recent learning based solutions, a 10 x 10 shape-material error distribution matrix is visualized to depict a \"portrait\" for each evaluated method. From such comprehensive analysis, open problems in this field are discussed. To inspire future research, this dataset is available at https://photometricstereo.github.io."}}

Existing solutions alleviate this ambiguity by either building an explicit relationship between reflectance and lighting or resolving lighting information in a supervised manner before recovering surface normal, which suffers from poor generalization to unseen reflectance or data. In contrast, this paper builds the implicit relationship between general reflectance (specular, cast shadow) and lighting by representing the reflectance as several neural intrinsics fields, based on which we optimize the surface normal and lighting in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, the neural intrinsics fields include reflectance features (i.e., diffuse, specular, diffuse coefficient, specular coefficient, cast shadow) and shading features (i.e., surface normal, lighting information). The implicit relationship is achieved by feeding the lighting information to neural specular & shadow fields and optimizing all intrinsics through a rendering equation in an unsupervised manner, which facilitates the better generalization to unseen reflectance and data. Our method achieves a superior performance advantage over state-of-the-art uncalibrated photometric stereo methods on public datasets in terms of the surface normal & lighting estimation. "}}

We show that the absorption effect can be numerically approximated by the average of refractive amplitude coefficient map. We then reformulate the image formation model and propose a two-step solution that explicitly takes the absorption effect into account. The first step estimates the absorption effect from a reflection-contaminated image, while the second step recovers the transmission image by taking a reflection-contaminated image and the estimated absorption effect as the input. Experimental results on four public datasets show that our two-step solution not only successfully removes reflection artifact, but also faithfully restores the intensity distortion caused by the absorption effect. Our ablation studies further demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on the recovery of overall intensity and has good model generalization capacity.

Although a partial view of the reflection scene is included in the panoramic image, it cannot be utilized directly due to its misalignment with the reflection-contaminated image. We propose a two-step approach to solve this problem, by first accomplishing geometric and photometric alignment for the reflection scene via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and then restoring the transmission scene via a recovery network. The proposed method is trained with a synthetic dataset and verified quantitatively with a real panoramic image dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by the significant performance advantage over single image-based reflection removal methods and generalization capacity to limited-FoV scenarios captured by conventional camera or mobile phone users."}}

It is an ill-defined problem because the general reflectance properties of the surface are unknown. Methods This paper reviews existing data-driven methods, with a focus on their technical insights into the photometric stereo problem. We divide these methods into two categories, per-pixel and all-pixel, according to how they process an image. We discuss the differences and relationships between these methods from the perspective of inputs, networks, and data, which are key factors in designing a deep learning approach. Results We demonstrate the performance of the models using a popular benchmark dataset. Conclusions Data-driven photometric stereo methods have shown that they possess a superior performance advantage over traditional methods. However, these methods suffer from various limitations, such as limited generalization capability. Finally, this study suggests directions for future research."}}

We show how a reflective amplitude coefficient map can be used as a calibration cue. Different from existing methods, the proposed solution is free from image contents. To reduce the impact of a noisy calibration cue estimated from a reflection-contaminated image, we propose two strategies: an optimization-based method that imposes part of though reliable entries on the map and a learning-based method that fully exploits all entries. We collect a dataset containing 320 samples as well as their camera parameters for evaluation. We demonstrate that our method not only facilitates a general single image camera calibration method that leverages image contents but also contributes to improving the performance of single image reflection removal. Furthermore, we show our byproduct output helps alleviate the ill-posed problem of estimating the panorama from a single image."}}

The non-Lambertian effect can be explicitly addressed by physics modeling to the reflectance function, at the cost of introducing highly nonlinear optimization. This paper proposes a numerical compensation scheme that attempts to minimize the angular error to address the non-Lambertian photometric stereo problem. Due to the multifaceted influence in the modeling of non-Lambertian reflectance in photometric stereo, directly minimizing the angular errors of surface normal is a highly complex problem. We introduce an alternating strategy, in which the estimated reflectance can be temporarily regarded as a known variable, to simplify the formulation of angular error. To reduce the impact of inaccurately estimated reflectance in this simplification, we propose a numerical compensation scheme whose compensation weight is formulated to reflect the reliability of estimated reflectance. Finally, the solution for the proposed numerical compensation scheme is efficiently computed by using cosine difference to approximate the angular difference. The experimental results show that our method can significantly improve the performance of the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic data and real data with small additive costs. Moreover, our method initialized by results from the baseline method (least-square-based) achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic data and real data with significantly smaller overall computation, i.e., about eight times faster compared with the state-of-the-art methods."}}

Similar to several previous works, the proposed method first estimates a prior image and then uses it to guide the inference of noise-free image. The novelty of our approach is to jointly learn the gradient and noise-free image based on an adversarial scheme. More specifically, we use the gradient map as the prior image. The inferred noise-free image guided by an estimated gradient is regarded as a negative sample, while the noise-free image guided by the ground truth of a gradient is taken as a positive sample. With the anchor defined by the ground truth of noise-free image, we play a min-max game to jointly train two optimizers for the estimation of the gradient and the inference of noise-free images. We show that both prior image and noise-free image can be accurately obtained under this adversarial scheme. Our state-of-the-art performance achieved on two public benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach."}}
