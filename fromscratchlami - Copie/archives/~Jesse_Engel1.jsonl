Unlike Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), which typically focuses on the words of a single speaker, AMT often requires transcribing multiple instruments simultaneously, all while preserving fine-scale pitch and timing information. Further, many AMT datasets are ``low-resource'', as even expert musicians find music transcription difficult and time-consuming. Thus, prior work has focused on task-specific architectures, tailored to the individual instruments of each task. In this work, motivated by the promising results of sequence-to-sequence transfer learning for low-resource Natural Language Processing (NLP), we demonstrate that a general-purpose Transformer model can perform multi-task AMT, jointly transcribing arbitrary combinations of musical instruments across several transcription datasets. We show this unified training framework achieves high-quality transcription results across a range of datasets, dramatically improving performance for low-resource instruments (such as guitar), while preserving strong performance for abundant instruments (such as piano). Finally, by expanding the scope of AMT, we expose the need for more consistent evaluation metrics and better dataset alignment, and provide a strong baseline for this new direction of multi-task AMT."}}

Given a starting sequence, many continuations are possible, yet often only one is written down. With generative models, we can explore many. However, finding a continuation with specific combinations of features (such as rising pitches, with block chords played in syncopated rhythm) can take many trials.\nTo tackle the combinatorial nature of composing features, we propose a compositional approach to steering music transformers, building on lightweight fine-tuning methods such as prefix tuning and bias tuning. We introduce a novel contrastive loss function that enables us to steer compositional models over logical features using supervised learning. We examine the difficulty in steering based on whether features musically follow a prime or not, using existing music as a proxy. We show that with a relatively small number of extra parameters, our method allows bias tuning to perform successful fine-tuning in both the single-feature and compositional setting."}}

Conventional audio synthesizers provide detailed expressive controls, but at the cost of realism. Black-box neural audio synthesis and concatenative samplers can produce realistic audio, but have few mechanisms for control. In this work, we introduce MIDI-DDSP a hierarchical model of musical instruments that enables both realistic neural audio synthesis and detailed user control. Starting from interpretable Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) synthesis parameters, we infer musical notes and high-level properties of their expressive performance (such as timbre, vibrato, dynamics, and articulation). This creates a 3-level hierarchy (notes, performance, synthesis) that affords individuals the option to intervene at each level, or utilize trained priors (performance given notes, synthesis given performance) for creative assistance. Through quantitative experiments and listening tests, we demonstrate that this hierarchy can reconstruct high-fidelity audio, accurately predict performance attributes for a note sequence, independently manipulate the attributes of a given performance,  and as a complete system, generate realistic audio from a novel note sequence. By utilizing an interpretable hierarchy, with multiple levels of granularity, MIDI-DDSP opens the door to assistive tools to empower individuals across a diverse range of musical experience."}}

In speech signals for example, there are often many silences, and the speed of pronunciation can vary considerably. In this work, we propose slow autoencoders (SlowAEs) for unsupervised learning of high-level variable-rate discrete representations of sequences, and apply them to speech. We show that the resulting event-based representations automatically grow or shrink depending on the density of salient information in the input signals, while still allowing for faithful signal reconstruction. We develop run-length Transformers (RLTs) for event-based representation modelling and use them to construct language models in the speech domain, which are able to generate grammatical and semantically coherent utterances and continuations."}}

Sound is a particularly challenging domain due to its high dimensionality, sequential dependencies and hierarchical structure. Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) greatly simplifies the forward problem of generating audio by introducing differentiable synthesizer and effects modules that combine strong signal priors with end-to-end learning. Here, we focus on the inverse problem, inferring synthesis parameters to approximate an audio scene. We demonstrate that DDSP modules can enable a new approach to self-supervision, generating synthetic audio with differentiable synthesizers and training feature extractor networks to infer the synthesis parameters. By building a hierarchy from sinusoidal to harmonic representations, we show that it possible to use such an inverse modeling approach to disentangle pitch from timbre, an important task in audio scene understanding."}}

We show it is possible to combine this global embedding with other temporally distributed embeddings, enabling improved control over the separate aspects of performance style and  and melody. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of music generation tasks on the MAESTRO dataset and an internal, 10,000+ hour dataset of piano performances, where we achieve improvements in terms of log-likelihood and mean listening scores as compared to relevant baselines."}}

While sufficient to express any signal, these representations are inefficient, as they do not utilize existing knowledge of how sound is generated and perceived. A third approach (vocoders/synthesizers) successfully incorporates strong domain knowledge of signal processing and perception, but has been less actively researched due to limited expressivity and difficulty integrating with modern auto-differentiation-based machine learning methods. In this paper, we introduce the Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) library, which enables direct integration of classic signal processing elements with deep learning methods. Focusing on audio synthesis, we achieve high-fidelity generation without the need for large autoregressive models or adversarial losses, demonstrating that DDSP enables utilizing strong inductive biases without losing the expressive power of neural networks. Further, we show that combining interpretable modules permits manipulation of each separate model component, with applications such as independent control of pitch and loudness, realistic extrapolation to pitches not seen during training, blind dereverberation of room acoustics, transfer of extracted room acoustics to new environments, and transformation of timbre between disparate sources. In short, DDSP enables an interpretable and modular approach to generative modeling, without sacrificing the benefits of deep learning. The library will is available at https://github.com/magenta/ddsp and we encourage further contributions from the community and domain experts.\n"}}
