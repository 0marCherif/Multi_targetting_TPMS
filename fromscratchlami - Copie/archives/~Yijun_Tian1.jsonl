However, they still exhibit inherent limitations in precisely capturing and returning grounded knowledge. While existing work has explored utilizing knowledge graphs to enhance language modeling via joint training and customized model architectures, applying this to LLMs is problematic owing to their large number of parameters and high computational cost. In addition, how to leverage the pre-trained LLMs and avoid training a customized model from scratch remains an open question. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Prompting (GNP), a novel plug-and-play method to assist pre-trained LLMs in learning beneficial knowledge from KGs. GNP encompasses various designs, including a standard graph neural network encoder, a cross-modality pooling module, a domain projector, and a self-supervised link prediction objective. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of GNP on both commonsense and biomedical reasoning tasks across different LLM sizes and settings."}}

However, real-world data in web-based applications (e.g., recommendation and advertising) always contains bias, preventing GNNs from learning fair representations. Although many works were proposed to address the fairness issue, they suffer from the significant problem of insufficient learnable knowledge with limited attributes after debiasing. To address this problem, we develop Graph-Fairness Mixture of Experts (G-Fame), a novel plug-and-play method to assist any GNNs to learn distinguishable representations with unbiased attributes. Furthermore, based on G-Fame, we propose G-Fame++, which introduces three novel strategies to improve the representation fairness from node representations, model layer, and parameter redundancy perspectives. In particular, we first present the embedding diversified method to learn distinguishable node representations. Second, we design the layer diversified strategy to maximize the output difference of distinct model layers. Third, we introduce the expert diversified method to minimize expert parameter similarities to learn diverse and complementary representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of G-Fame and G-Fame++ in both accuracy and fairness, compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple graph datasets."}}

In recent years, significant progress has been made in CILG. Anticipating that such a trend will continue, this survey aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the current state-of-the-art in CILG and provide insights for future research directions. Concerning the former, we introduce the first taxonomy of existing work and its connection to existing imbalanced learning literature. Concerning the latter, we critically analyze recent work in CILG and discuss urgent lines of inquiry within the topic. Moreover, we provide a continuously maintained reading list of papers and code at https://github.com/yihongma/CILG-Papers."}}

Another natural property concomitantly with graph is class-imbalance which cannot be alleviated by the massive graph data while hindering GNNs' generalization. To fully tackle these unpleasant properties, (i) theoretically, we introduce a hypothesis about what extent a subset of the training data can approximate the full dataset's learning effectiveness. The effectiveness is further guaranteed and proved by the gradients' distance between the subset and the full set; (ii) empirically, we discover that during the learning process of a GNN, some samples in the training dataset are informative for providing gradients to update model parameters. Moreover, the informative subset is not fixed during training process. Samples that are informative in the current training epoch may not be so in the next one. We refer to this observation as dynamic data sparsity. We also notice that sparse subnets pruned from a well-trained GNN sometimes forget the information provided by the informative subset, reflected in their poor performances upon the subset. Based on these findings, we develop a unified data-model dynamic sparsity framework named Graph Decantation (GraphDec) to address challenges brought by training upon a massive class-imbalanced graph data. The key idea of GraphDec is to identify the informative subset dynamically during the training process by adopting sparse graph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphDec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for class-imbalanced graph classification and class-imbalanced node classification tasks, with respect to classification accuracy and data usage efficiency."}}

Existing methods attempt to address this scalability issue by training multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) exclusively on node content features using labels derived from trained GNNs. Even though the performance of MLPs can be significantly improved, two issues prevent MLPs from outperforming GNNs and being used in practice: the ignorance of graph structural information and the sensitivity to node feature noises. In this paper, we propose to learn NOise-robust Structure-aware MLPs On Graphs (NOSMOG) to overcome the challenges. Specifically, we first complement node content with position features to help MLPs capture graph structural information. We then design a novel representational similarity distillation strategy to inject structural node similarities into MLPs. Finally, we introduce the adversarial feature augmentation to ensure stable learning against feature noises and further improve performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NOSMOG outperforms GNNs and the state-of-the-art method in both transductive and inductive settings across 7 datasets, while maintaining a competitive inference efficiency."}}

Specifically, we first propose a plug-and- play GAME layer that can be easily incorporated into any GNNs and enhance their adversarial learning capabilities. Second, we design a decoupling-based graph adversarial training in which the component of the model used to generate adversarial graphs is separated from the component used to update weights. Third, we introduce a graph diversity regularization that enables the model to learn diverse representation and further improves model performance.

Existing methods attempt to address this scalability issue by training student multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) exclusively on node content features using labels derived from the teacher GNNs. However, the trained MLPs are neither effective nor robust. In this paper, we ascribe the lack of effectiveness and robustness to three significant challenges: 1) the misalignment between content feature and label spaces, 2) the strict hard matching to teacher's output, and 3) the sensitivity to node feature noises. To address the challenges, we propose NOSMOG, a novel method to learn NOise-robust Structure-aware MLPs On Graphs, with remarkable effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency.

Due to the recent success of graph neural networks (GNNs), a variety of GNN-based models were proposed to tackle the link prediction task. Specifically, GNNs leverage the message passing paradigm to obtain node representation, which relies on link connectivity. However, in a link prediction task, links in the training set are always present while ones in the testing set are not yet formed, resulting in a discrepancy of the connectivity pattern and bias of the learned representation. It leads to a problem of dataset shift which degrades the model performance. In this paper, we first identify the dataset shift problem in the link prediction task and provide theoretical analyses on how existing link prediction methods are vulnerable to it. We then propose FakeEdge, a model-agnostic technique, to address the problem by mitigating the graph topological gap between training and testing sets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the applicability and superiority of FakeEdge on multiple datasets across various domains."}}
