Pedestrian trajectories are not only influenced by the pedestrian itself but also by interaction with surrounding objects.

We propose the Social Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Social-STGCNN), which substitutes the need of aggregation methods by modeling the interactions as a graph. Our results show an improvement over the state of art by 20% on the Final Displacement Error (FDE) and an improvement on the Average Displacement Error (ADE) with 8.5 times less parameters and up to 48 times faster inference speed than previously reported methods. In addition, our model is data efficient, and exceeds previous state of the art on the ADE metric with only 20% of the training data. We propose a kernel function to embed the social interactions between pedestrians within the adjacency matrix. Through qualitative analysis, we show that our model inherited social behaviors that can be expected between pedestrians trajectories.

Yet, the BoN does not quantify the whole generated samples, resulting in an incomplete view of the model's prediction quality and performance. We propose a new metric, Average Mahalanobis Distance (AMD) to tackle this issue. AMD is a metric that quantifies how close the whole generated samples are to the ground truth. We also introduce the Average Maximum Eigenvalue (AMV) metric that quantifies the overall spread of the predictions. Our metrics are validated empirically by showing that the ADE/FDE is not sensitive to distribution shifts, giving a biased sense of accuracy, unlike the AMD/AMV metrics. We introduce the usage of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) as a replacement for traditional generative models to train our model, Social-Implicit. IMLE training mechanism aligns with AMD/AMV objective of predicting trajectories that are close to the ground truth with a tight spread. Social-Implicit is a memory efficient deep model with only 5.8K parameters that runs in real time of about 580Hz and achieves competitive results.

Recently, a new problem was introduced in the field to predict the 3D human poses from observed 2D poses. We propose Skeleton-Graph, a deep spatio-temporal graph CNN model that predicts the future 3D skeleton poses in a single pass from the 2D ones. Unlike prior works, Skeleton-Graph focuses on modeling the interaction between the skeleton joints by exploiting their spatial configuration. This is being achieved by formulating the problem as a graph structure while learning a suitable graph adjacency kernel. By the design, Skeleton-Graph predicts the future 3D poses without divergence in the long-term, unlike prior works. We also introduce a new metric that measures the divergence of predictions in the long term. Our results show an FDE improvement of at least 27% and an ADE of 4% on both the GTA-IM and PROX datasets respectively in comparison with prior works. Also, we are 88% and 93% less divergence on the long-term motion prediction in comparison with prior works on both GTA-IM and PROX datasets.

IENs utilize ensemble parameters during the training phase to reduce the network variance. While in the testing phase, these parameters are removed without a change in the enhanced performance. IENs reduce the variance of an ordinary deep model by a factor of $1/m^{L-1}$, where $m$ is the number of inner ensembles and $L$ is the depth of the model. Also, we show empirically and theoretically that IENs lead to a greater variance reduction in comparison with other similar approaches such as dropout and maxout. Our results show a decrease of error rates between 1.7\\% and 17.3\\% in comparison with an ordinary deep model. We also show that IEN was preferred by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods over prior approaches."}}

A visual and a similarity score analysis of the features generated from IEA explains why it boosts the model performance."}}
