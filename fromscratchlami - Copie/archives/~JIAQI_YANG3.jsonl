We treat the image as a stack of 2D images so that the topological computation can be carried only within 2D in order to achieve computational efficiency. To enforce the continuity between slices, we propose a compound multislice representation and a compound multi-slice topological loss that incorporates rich topological information from adjacent slices. The quantitative and qualitative results show that our proposed method outperforms various strong baselines, especially for structure-related evaluation metrics."}}

We propose a novel Topological-Attention\nConvLSTM Network (TACLNet) for 3D anisotropic image segmentation with high structural accuracy. We adopt ConvLSTM to leverage contextual information from adjacent slices while achieving high efficiency. We propose a Spatial Topological-Attention (STA) module to effectively transfer topologically critical information across slices. Furthermore, we propose an Iterative Topological-Attention (ITA) module that provides a more stable topologically critical map for segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our proposed method outperforms various baselines in terms of topology-aware evaluation metrics."}}
