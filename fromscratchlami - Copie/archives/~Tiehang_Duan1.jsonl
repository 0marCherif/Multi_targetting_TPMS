Most existing algorithms assume that the underlying task distribution is stationary. Here we consider a more realistic and challenging setting in that task distributions evolve over time. We name this problem as Semi-supervised meta-learning with Evolving Task diStributions, abbreviated as SETS. Two key challenges arise in this more realistic setting: (i) how to use unlabeled data in the presence of a large amount of unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) data; and (ii) how to prevent catastrophic forgetting on previously learned task distributions due to the task distribution shift. We propose an OOD Robust and knowleDge presErved semi-supeRvised meta-learning approach (ORDER) (we use ORDER to denote the task distributions sequentially arrive with some ORDER), to tackle these two major challenges. Specifically, our ORDER introduces a novel mutual information regularization to robustify the model with unlabeled OOD data and adopts an optimal transport regularization to remember previously learned knowledge in feature space. In addition, we test our method on a very challenging dataset: SETS on large-scale non-stationary semi-supervised task distributions consisting of (at least) 72K tasks. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate the proposed ORDER alleviates forgetting on evolving task distributions and is more robust to OOD data than related strong baselines."}}

The widely adopted memory replay approach could gradually become less effective for long data streams, as the model may memorize the stored examples and overfit the memory buffer. Second, existing methods overlook the high uncertainty in the memory data distribution since there is a big gap between the memory data distribution and the distribution of all the previous data examples. To address these problems, for the first time, we propose a principled memory evolution framework to dynamically evolve the memory data distribution by making the memory buffer gradually harder to be memorized with distributionally robust optimization (DRO). We then derive a family of methods to evolve the memory buffer data in the continuous probability measure space with Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF). The proposed DRO is wrt the worst-case evolved memory data distribution, thus guarantees the model performance and learns significantly more robust features than existing memory-replay-based methods. Extensive experiments on existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for alleviating forgetting.

The CF issue remains nearly unexplored and is more challenging when meta-learning on a sequence of domains (datasets), called sequential domain meta-learning (SDML). In this work, we propose a simple yet effective learning to learn approach, ie, meta optimizer, to mitigate the CF problem in SDML. We first apply the proposed meta optimizer to the simplified setting of SDML, domain-aware meta-learning, where the domain labels and boundaries are known during the learning process. We propose dynamically freezing the network and incorporating it with the proposed meta optimizer by considering the domain nature during meta training. In addition, we extend the meta optimizer to the more general setting of SDML, domain-agnostic meta-learning, where domain labels and boundaries are unknown during the learning process. We propose a domain shift detection technique to capture latent domain change and equip the meta optimizer with it to work in this setting. The proposed meta optimizer is versatile and can be easily integrated with several existing meta-learning algorithms. Finally, we construct a challenging and large-scale benchmark consisting of 10 heterogeneous domains with a super long task sequence consisting of 100K tasks. We perform extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark for both settings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, outperforming current strong baselines by a large margin."}}

A typical setting across current meta learning algorithms assumes a stationary task distribution during meta training. In this paper, we explore a more practical and challenging setting where task distribution changes over time with domain shift. Particularly, we consider realistic scenarios where task distribution is highly imbalanced with domain labels unavailable in nature. We propose a kernel-based method for domain change detection and a difficulty-aware memory management mechanism that jointly considers the imbalanced domain size and domain importance to learn across domains continuously. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient adaptive task sampling method during meta training, which significantly reduces task gradient variance with theoretical guarantees. Finally, we propose a challenging benchmark with imbalanced domain sequences and varied domain difficulty. We have performed extensive evaluations on the proposed benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method."}}

However, the most widely used memory-replay approach often suffers from memory overfitting. To mitigate the memory overfitting, we propose a continuous and reversible memory transformation method so that the memory data is hard to overfit, thus improving generalization. The transformation is achieved by optimizing a bi-level optimization objective that jointly learns the CL model and memory transformer. Specifically, we propose a deterministic continuous memory transformer (DCMT) modeled by an ordinary differential equation, allowing for infinite memory transformation and generating diverse and hard memory data. Furthermore, we inject uncertainty into the transformation function and propose a stochastic continuous memory transformer (SCMT) modeled by a stochastic differential equation, which substantially enhances the diversity of the transformed memory buffer. The proposed neural transformation approaches have significant advantages over existing ones: (1) we can obtain infinite many transformed data, thus significantly increasing the memory buffer diversity; (2) the proposed continuous transformations are reversible, i.e., the original raw memory data could be restored from the transformed memory data without the need to make a replica of the memory data. Extensive experiments on both task-aware and task-free CL show significant improvement with our approach compared to strong baselines.  "}}

Their predictions, however, can be unreliable given the significant variance and noise in EEG signals. Previous works on EEG analysis mainly focus on the exploration of noise pattern in the source signal, while the uncertainty during the decoding process is largely unexplored. Automatically detecting and reducing such decoding uncertainty is important for BCI motor imagery applications such as robotic arm control etc. In this work, we proposed an uncertainty estimation and reduction model (UNCER) to quantify and mitigate the uncertainty during the EEG decoding process. It utilized a combination of dropout oriented method and Bayesian neural network for uncertainty estimation to incorporate both the uncertainty in the input signal and the uncertainty in the model parameters. We further proposed a data augmentation based approach for uncertainty reduction. The model can be integrated into current widely used EEG neural decoders without change of architecture. We performed extensive experiments for uncertainty estimation and its reduction in both intra-subject EEG decoding and cross-subject EEG decoding on two public motor imagery datasets, where the proposed model achieves significant improvement both on the quality of estimated uncertainty and the effectiveness of uncertainty reduction."}}
