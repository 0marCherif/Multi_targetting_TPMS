However, most of the existing federated learning algorithms for VP data are limited to synchronous computation. To improve the efficiency when the unbalanced computation/communication resources are common among the parties in the federated learning system, it is essential to develop asynchronous training algorithms for VP data while keeping the data privacy. In this article, we propose an asynchronous federated stochastic gradient descent (AFSGD-VP) algorithm and its two variance reduction variants, including stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) and SAGA on the VP data. Moreover, we provide the convergence analyses of AFSGD-VP and its SVRG and SAGA variants under the condition of strong convexity and without any restrictions of staleness. We also discuss their model privacy, data privacy, computational complexities, and communication costs. To the best of our knowledge, AFSGD-VP and its SVRG and SAGA variants are the first asynchronous federated learning algorithms for VP data with theoretical guarantees. Extensive experimental results on a variety of VP datasets not only verify the theoretical results of AFSGD-VP and its SVRG and SAGA variants but also show that our algorithms have much higher efficiency than the corresponding synchronous algorithms."}}

A leading training algorithm in FL is local SGD, which updates the model parameter on each worker and averages model parameters across different workers only once in a while. Although it has fewer communication rounds than the classical parallel SGD, local SGD still has large communication overhead in each communication round for large machine learning models, such as deep neural networks. To address this issue, we propose a new communication-efficient distributed SGD method, which can significantly reduce the communication cost by the error-compensated double compression mechanism. Under the non-convex setting, our theoretical results show that our approach has better communication complexity than existing methods and enjoys the same linear speedup regarding the number of workers as the full-precision local SGD. Moreover, we propose a communication-efficient distributed SGD with momentum, which also has better communication complexity than existing methods and enjoys a linear speedup with respect to the number of workers. At last, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the performance of our proposed two methods.

To address this challenge, the gradient compression based communication-efficient distributed learning methods were designed to reduce the communication cost, and more recently the local error feedback was incorporated to compensate for the corresponding performance loss. However, in this paper, we will show that a new \"gradient mismatch\" problem is raised by the local error feedback in centralized distributed training and can lead to degraded performance compared with full-precision training. To solve this critical problem, we propose two novel techniques, 1) step ahead and 2) error averaging, with rigorous theoretical analysis. Both our theoretical and empirical results show that our new methods can handle the \"gradient mismatch\" problem. The experimental results show that we can even train faster with common gradient compression schemes than both the full-precision training and local error feedback regarding the training epochs and without performance loss."}}
