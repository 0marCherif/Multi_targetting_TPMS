Our approach leverages tensor decomposition, following the recent work TensoRF, to model the tensor grids. In contrast to TensoRF which uses a global tensor and focuses on their vector-matrix decomposition, we propose to utilize a cloud of local tensors and apply the classic CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition to factorize each tensor into triple vectors that express local feature distributions along spatial axes and compactly encode a local neural field. We also apply multi-scale tensor grids to discover the geometry and appearance commonalities and exploit spatial coherence with the tri-vector factorization at multiple local scales. The final radiance field properties are regressed by aggregating neural features from multiple local tensors across all scales. Our tri-vector tensors are sparsely distributed around the actual scene surface, discovered by a fast coarse reconstruction, leveraging the sparsity of a 3D scene. We demonstrate that our model can achieve better rendering quality while using significantly fewer parameters than previous methods, including TensoRF and Instant-NGP."}}

However, due to occlusion and signal miss, LiDAR point clouds are in practice 2.5D as they cover only partial underlying shapes, which poses a fundamental challenge to 3D perception. To tackle the challenge, we present a novel LiDAR-based 3D object detection model, dubbed Behind the Curtain Detector (BtcDet), which learns the object shape priors and estimates the complete object shapes that are partially occluded (curtained) in point clouds. BtcDet first identifies the regions that are affected by occlusion and signal miss. In these regions, our model predicts the probability of occupancy that indicates if a region contains object shapes and integrates this probability map with detection features and generates high-quality 3D proposals. Finally, the occupancy estimation is integrated into the proposal refinement module to generate accurate bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on the KITTI Dataset and the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of BtcDet. Particularly for the 3D detection of both cars and cyclists on the KITTI benchmark, BtcDet surpasses all of the published state-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins. Code is released."}}

Our synergy process leverages a representation cycle for 3DMM parameters and 3D landmarks. 3D landmarks can be extracted and refined from face meshes built by 3DMM parameters. We next reverse the representation direction and show that predicting 3DMM parameters from sparse 3D landmarks improves the information flow. Together we create a synergy process that utilizes the relation between 3D landmarks and 3DMM parameters, and they collaboratively contribute to better performance. We extensively validate our contribution on full tasks of facial geometry prediction and show our superior and robust performance on these tasks for various scenarios. Particularly, we adopt only simple and widely-used network operations to attain fast and accurate facial geometry prediction. Codes and data: https: //choyingw.github.io/works/SynergyNet/."}}

While recent 3D detection research focuses on improving performance within a single domain, our study reveals that the performance of modern detectors can drop drastically cross-domain. In this paper, we investigate unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. On the Waymo Domain Adaptation [49] dataset, we identify the deteriorating point cloud quality as the root cause of the performance drop. To address this issue, we present Semantic Point Generation (SPG), a general approach to enhance the reliability of LiDAR detectors against domain shifts. Specifically, SPG generates semantic points at the predicted fore-ground regions and faithfully recovers missing parts of the foreground objects, which are caused by phenomena such as occlusions, low reflectance, or weather interference. By merging the semantic points with the original points, we obtain an augmented point cloud, which can be directly consumed by modern LiDAR-based detectors. To validate the wide applicability of SPG, we experiment with two representative detectors, PointPillars [22] and PV-RCNN [45]. On the UDA task, SPG significantly improves both detectors across all object categories of interest and at all difficulty levels. SPG can also benefit object detection in the original domain. On the Waymo Open Dataset [49] and KITTI [17], SPG improves 3D detection results of these two methods across all categories. Combined with PV-RCNN [45], SPG achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection results on KITTI."}}

Among all point-based models, graph convolutional networks (GCN) lead to notable performance by fully preserving the data granularity and exploiting point interrelation. However, point-based networks spend a significant amount of time on data structuring (e.g., Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) and neighbor points querying), which limit the speed and scalability. In this paper, we present a method, named Grid-GCN, for fast and scalable point cloud learning. Grid-GCN uses a novel data structuring strategy, Coverage-Aware Grid Query (CAGQ). By leveraging the efficiency of grid space, CAGQ improves spatial coverage while reducing the theoretical time complexity. Compared with popular sampling methods such as Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) and Ball Query, CAGQ achieves up to 50 times speed-up. With a Grid Context Aggregation (GCA) module, Grid-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance on major point cloud classification and segmentation benchmarks with significantly faster runtime than previous studies. Remarkably, Grid-GCN achieves the inference speed of 50FPS on ScanNet using 81920 points as input.
