Traditional augmentation techniques such as noise injection and image transformations have been widely used. In addition, generative data augmentation (GDA) has been shown to produce more diverse and flexible data. While generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been frequently used for GDA, they lack diversity and controllability compared to text-to-image diffusion models. In this paper, we propose TTIDA (Text-to-Text-to-Image Data Augmentation) to leverage the capabilities of large-scale pre-trained Text-to-Text (T2T) and Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models for data augmentation. By conditioning the T2I model on detailed descriptions produced by T2T models, we are able to generate photo-realistic labeled images in a flexible and controllable manner. Experiments on in-domain classification, cross-domain classification, and image captioning tasks show consistent improvements over other data augmentation baselines. Analytical studies in varied settings, including few-shot, long-tail, and adversarial, further reinforce the effectiveness of TTIDA in enhancing performance and increasing robustness."}}

We observe that after constructing a dataset where we remove all conceivable sources of spurious correlation between interpretable factors, classifiers still fail to close the OOD-ID generalization gap."}}

This perspective enables us to reason about the effects of changes to this process (interventions) and what would have happened in hindsight (counterfactuals). We categorize work in CausalML into five groups according to the problems they address: (1) causal supervised learning, (2) causal generative modeling, (3) causal explanations, (4) causal fairness, and (5) causal reinforcement learning. We systematically compare the methods in each category and point out open problems. Further, we review data-modality-specific applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and graph representation learning. Finally, we provide an overview of causal benchmarks and a critical discussion of the state of this nascent field, including recommendations for future work.\n"}}

Our approach optimizes over the polytope of permutation vectors, the so-called Permutahedron, to learn a topological ordering. Edges can be optimized jointly, or learned conditional on the ordering via a non-differentiable subroutine. Compared to existing continuous optimization approaches our formulation has a number of advantages including: 1. validity: optimizes over exact DAGs as opposed to other relaxations optimizing approximate DAGs; 2. modularity: accommodates any edge-optimization procedure, edge structural parameterization, and optimization loss; 3. end-to-end: either alternately iterates between node-ordering and edge-optimization, or optimizes them jointly; We demonstrate, on real-world data problems in protein-signaling and transcriptional network discovery, that our approach lies on the Pareto frontier of two key metrics, the SID and SHD."}}

To address this problem, meta-learning algorithms use prior experience about tasks to learn new, related tasks efficiently. Typically, a set of training tasks is assumed given or randomly chosen. However, this setting does not take into account the sequential nature that naturally arises when training a model from scratch in real-life: how do we collect a set of training tasks in a data-efficient manner? In this work, we introduce task selection based on prior experience into a meta-learning algorithm by conceptualizing the learner and the active meta-learning setting using a probabilistic latent variable model. We provide empirical evidence that our approach improves data-efficiency when compared to strong baselines on simulated robotic experiments.\n"}}

We empirically show that: 1. Pre-trained models have better downstream performance compared to randomly-initialised models due to their improved the capability of capturing global topology and recognising substructures. 2.

Two methods have received significant attention due to their scalability: 1. Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA), and 2. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). However, there has been limited investigation into their properties and no systematic benchmarking of them across different domains. We fill this gap here by comparing the loss surfaces of the models trained with each method and through broad benchmarking across computer vision, natural language processing, and graph representation learning tasks. We discover several surprising findings from these results, which we hope will help researchers further improve deep learning optimizers, and practitioners identify the right optimizer for their problem."}}
