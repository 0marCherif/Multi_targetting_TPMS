We obtain Grassmannian Frame structure from the optimization and generalization of classification. This structure maximally separates features of every two classes on a sphere and does not require a larger feature dimension than the number of classes. Out of curiosity about the symmetry of Grassmannian Frame, we conduct experiments to explore if models with different Grassmannian Frames have different performance. As a result, we discover the Symmetric Generalization phenomenon. We provide a theorem to explain Symmetric Generalization of permutation. However, the question of why different directions of features can lead to such different generalization is still open for future investigation."}}

There are some studies aiming to solve long-tailed classification from the perspective of feature learning. Recent work proposes to learn the balanced representation by fixing the linear classifier as Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF), since they argue what matters in classification is the structure of the feature, instead of their directions. Holding a different view, in this paper, we show that features with fixed directions may be harmful to the generalization of models, even if it is completely symmetric. To avoid this issue, we propose Representation-Balanced Learning Framework (RBL), which introduces orthogonal matrices to learn directions while maintaining the geometric structure of ETF. Theoretically, our contributions are two-fold: 1). we point out that the feature learning of RBL is insensitive toward training set label distribution, it always learns a balanced representation space. 2). we provide a generalization analysis of proposed RBL through training stability. To analyze the stability of the parameter with orthogonal constraint, we propose a novel training stability analysis paradigm, Two-Parameter Model Stability. Practically, our method is extremely simple in implementation but shows great superiority on several benchmark datasets.\n"}}

As a well-known multiclass extension of AUC, Multiclass AUC (MAUC, a.k.a. M-metric) measures the average AUC of multiple binary classifiers. In this paper, we argue that simply optimizing MAUC is far from enough for imbalanced multi-classification. More precisely, MAUC only focuses on learning scoring functions via ranking optimization, while leaving the decision process unconsidered. Therefore, scoring functions being able to make good decisions might suffer from low performance in terms of MAUC. To overcome this issue, we turn to explore AUC\u00b5, another multiclass variant of AUC, which further takes the decision process into consideration. Motivated by this fact, we propose a surrogate risk optimization framework to improve model performance from the perspective of AUC\u00b5. Practically, we propose a two-stage training framework for multi-classification, where at the first stage a scoring function is learned maximizing AUC\u00b5, and at the second stage we seek for a decision function to improve the F1-metric via our proposed soft F1. Theoretically, we first provide sufficient conditions that optimizing the surrogate losses could lead to the Bayes optimal scoring function. Afterward, we show that the proposed surrogate risk enjoys a generalization bound in order of $\\mathcal{O}(1 / \\sqrt{N})$. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in both AUC\u00b5 and F1-metric."}}

This shows that AUTKC does not allow irrelevant labels to appear in the top list. Furthermore, we present an empirical surrogate risk minimization framework to optimize the proposed metric.

However, many practical scenarios require cooperation among entities, and existing paradigms fail to meet cost, privacy, or security requirements and so on. In this paper, we consider a generalized paradigm: different roles are granted multiple permissions to complete their corresponding jobs, called Confederated Learning. Systematic analysis shows that confederated learning generalizes traditional machine learning and the existing distributed paradigms like federation learning. Then, we study an application scenario of confederated learning which could inspire future research in the context of cooperation between different entities. Three methods are proposed as the first trial for the cooperated learning under restricted conditions. Empirical results on three datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."}}
