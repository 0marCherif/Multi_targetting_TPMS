SLIL is a two-stage optimization framework, where in stage one the expert state distribution is estimated via a new method for denoising continuous normalizing flow, and in stage two the learner policy is trained to match both the expert\u2019s policy and state distribution. Experimental evaluation of SLIL compared with several baselines in ten different physics-based control tasks reveals superior results in terms of learner policy performance, training stability, and mode distribution preservation."}}

Various software defined wide area network (SD-WAN) solutions have been developed with the primary aim of improving WAN link utilization. However, mechanisms used by existing SD-WAN solutions fail to provide high reliability and performance required by today's edge to cloud applications. In this article, we present WAN-aware MPTCP which seamlessly aggregates multiple WAN links into a \u201cbig pipe\u201d for better WAN resilience thus minimizing application performance degradation under WAN link failures. We leverage the congestion control of MPTCP to balance traffic across multiple WAN links. The key innovation is to combine LAN virtualization at end systems with WAN virtualization at SD-WAN gateways. Through evaluation in both emulated testbeds and real-world deployment, we demonstrate the performance gain of WAN-aware MPTCP in terms of resilience and throughput over existing SD-WAN solutions."}}

ECIoT gateways will: enable sites to direct IoT sensor data to the CSP of their choice for processing and storage and permit IoT sensor data to be easily and efficiently forwarded to multiple CSPs simultaneously, which can simplify these functions in multi-vendor IoT systems. Evaluation of a preliminary, proof-of-concept prototype suggests that the ECIoT gateway can achieve these multi-vendor objectives with minimal overhead."}}

These statistics, when viewed across the switches are likely to be inconsistent if a specific order is not enforced while collecting statistics. Collecting consistent statistics requires coordination among all the participating switches. A few approaches in the literature collect globally consistent statistics of a network in the SDN domain. However, these approaches are not time-efficient, robust, and synchronous for OpenFlow based networks. We propose, GlobeSnap, a time-efficient, robust, and synchronous method to collect globally consistent statistics for OpenFlow networks. GlobeSnap collects consistent statistics for all flows in a single round and is therefore, time-efficient. Moreover, GlobeSnap is robust since it resumes the statistics collection process from where it left in case of interruption. GlobeSnap also provides a near-synchronous snapshot of statistics of the switches traversed by a given flow. We also propose a mechanism to persistently store states in OpenFlow based networks using registers, multiple flow tables, and multiple pipelines. We find that GlobeSnap outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in consistency evaluation. Further we present two use-cases which are sensitive to inconsistent flow statistics, that is, computing packet loss and identifying bottleneck links, to show the time-efficiency, robustness, and synchronicity of GlobeSnap. GlobeSnap provides 100% consistency in OpenFlow based SDN networks. Whereas the existing methods achieve a maximum of 59.89% consistency."}}

On The Security Implications of Dynamic Virtual Private Servers", "abstract": "Many malicious activities require a large number of IP addresses for altering user identities. It is well known that a large number of IP addresses could be obtained through compromising numerous machines and building botnets. However, we recently found that a special type of off-the-shelf virtual private server (VPS), which we refer to as dynamic VPSs, can retrieve a huge number of IP addresses using just a single virtual machine. Although dynamic VPSs are intended for legitimate purposes, whether they are actually misused in malicious activities has never been investigated. In this article, we take the first step to study dynamic VPSs, with an emphasis on their security implications. We reveal that dynamic VPSs are surprisingly and extensively involved in malicious activities, explore their internal working mechanisms, and suggest that the linkage of dynamic VPSs to the security domain deserves adequate attention."}}

In these DCNs, the OpenFlow controller adaptively turns on/off links and OpenFlow switches to form a minimum-power subnet that satisfies the traffic demand. As the subnet changes, flows are dynamically routed and rerouted to the routes composed of active switches and links. However, existing flow scheduling schemes could cause undesired results: (1) power inefficiency: due to unbalanced traffic allocation on active routes, extra switches and links may be activated to cater to bursty traffic surges on congested routes, and (2) Quality of Service (QoS) fluctuation: because of the limited flow entry processing ability, switches may not be able to timely install/delete/update flow entries to properly route/reroute flows. In this paper, we propose AggreFlow, a dynamic flow scheduling scheme that achieves power efficiency and QoS improvement using three techniques: Flow-set Routing, Lazy Rerouting, and Adaptive Rerouting. Flow-set Routing achieves load balancing with a small number of flow entry operations by routing flows in a coarse-grained flow-set fashion. Lazy Rerouting spreads rerouting operations over a relatively long period of time, reducing the burstiness of entry operation on switches. Adaptive Rerouting selectively reroutes flow-sets to maintain load balancing. We built an NS3 based fat-tree network simulation platform to evaluate AggreFlow's performance. The simulation results show that AggreFlow reduces power consumption by about 18%, yet achieving load balancing and improved QoS (low packet loss rate and reducing the number of processing entries for flow scheduling by 98%), compared with baseline schemes."}}

Emerging demands for networks have led to growing traffic volume and complexity of modern networks, which heavily rely on a wide spectrum of specialized network functions (e.g., Firewall, Load Balancer) for diverse purposes. Although these (virtual) network functions (VNFs) are widely deployed, they are instantiated in an uncoordinated manner failing to meet growing demands of evolving networks. In this dissertation, we argue that networks equipped with VNFs can be designed in a fashion similar to how computer software is programmed today. By following the blueprint of modularization, networks can be made more efficient, secure, and manageable."}}

To address this problem, this paper proposes a software-defined solution, namely, MasQ, which is short for \"queue masquerade\". The core insight of MasQ is that all RDMA communications should associate with at least one queue pair (QP). Thus, the requirements of virtualization, such as network isolation and the application of security rules, can be easily fulfilled if QP's behavior is properly defined. In particular, MasQ exploits the virtio-based paravirtualization technique to realize the control path. Moreover, to avoid performance overhead, MasQ leaves all data path operations, such as sending and receiving, to the hardware. We have implemented MasQ in the OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution (OFED) framework and proved its scalability and performance efficiency by evaluating it against typical applications. The results demonstrate that MasQ achieves almost the same performance as bare-metal RDMA for data communication."}}

Such routing schemes rely on embedding the network into a geometric/topological space (e.g. a binary tree) to facilitate multi-path routing with reduced state maintenance and quick recovery in localized failure scenarios. In this work, we propose a systematic framework to embed the network topology into a hierarchical binary virtual-identity-space that is particularly amenable to multi-path routing. Our methodology firstly involves a relaxed form of the connected graph bi-partitioning problem that exploits a geometric embedding of the network in an n-dimensional Euclidean space (n being the number of hosts in the network) based on the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse of the Laplacian for the graph associated with the network. The edges of the network are mapped to a weight distribution that helps construct a spanning tree from the core of the network towards the periphery, thereby providing a point of symmetry in the network to facilitate balanced bi- partitions. This, in turn, yields a (nearly) full balanced binary tree embedding of the network and consequently a good virtual-id space. We also explore the binary identity assignment problem in another point of view by using bi-connected graph as the input graph to introduce a recursive bipartition algorithm. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and experimentation, we demonstrate that our methods perform well within reasonable bounds of computational complexity."}}
