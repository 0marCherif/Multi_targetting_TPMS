However, storing historical data is cheap in many real-world settings, yet replaying all historical data is often prohibited due to processing time constraints. In such settings, we propose that continual learning systems should learn the time to learn and schedule which tasks to replay at different time steps. We first demonstrate the benefits of our proposal by using Monte Carlo tree search to find a proper replay schedule, and show that the found replay schedules can outperform fixed scheduling policies when combined with multiple replay methods in various continual learning settings. Additionally, we propose a framework for learning replay scheduling policies with reinforcement learning. We show that the learned policies can generalize better in new continual learning scenarios compared to equally replaying all seen tasks, without added computational cost. Our study reveals the importance of learning the time to learn in continual learning, which brings current research closer to real-world needs."}}

Most previous works focus on increasing the sample quality in the commonly small replay memory. However, in many real-world applications, replay memories would be limited by constraints on processing time rather than storage capacity as most organizations do store all historical data in the cloud. Inspired by human learning, we illustrate that scheduling over which tasks to revisit is critical to the final performance with finite memory resources. To this end, we propose to learn the time to learn for a continual learning system, in which we learn schedules over which tasks to replay at different times using Monte Carlo tree search. We perform extensive evaluation and show that our method can learn replay schedules that significantly improve final performance across all tasks than baselines without considering the scheduling. Furthermore, our method can be combined with any other memory selection methods leading to consistently improved performance. Our results indicate that the learned schedules are also consistent with human learning insights."}}

We focus on an application of assistive technology for people with visual impairments, for daily activities such as shopping or cooking. In this paper, we provide a new benchmark dataset for a challenging task in this application - classification of fruits, vegetables, and refrigerated products, e.g. milk packages and juice cartons, in grocery stores. To enable the learning process to utilize multiple sources of structured information, this dataset not only contains a large volume of natural images but also includes the corresponding information of the product from an online shopping website. Such information encompasses the hierarchical structure of the object classes, as well as an iconic image of each type of object. This dataset can be used to train and evaluate image classification models for helping visually impaired people in natural environments. Additionally, we provide benchmark results evaluated on pretrained convolutional neural networks often used for image understanding purposes, and also a multi-view variational autoencoder, which is capable of utilizing the rich product information in the dataset."}}

Interpretable outputs from learning algorithms are desirable for decision making by health care personnel. In this work, we explore the possibility of utilizing causal relationships to refine diagnostic prediction. We focus on the task of diagnostic prediction using discomfort drawings, and explore two ways to employ causal identification to improve the diagnostic results. Firstly, we use causal identification to infer the causal relationships among diagnostic labels which, by itself, provides interpretable results to aid the decision making and training of health care personnel. Secondly, we suggest a post-processing approach where the inferred causal relationships are used to refine the prediction accuracy of a multi-view probabilistic model. Experimental results show firstly that causal identification is capable of detecting the causal relationships among diagnostic labels correctly, and secondly that there is potential for improving pain diagnostics prediction accuracy using the causal relationships."}}
