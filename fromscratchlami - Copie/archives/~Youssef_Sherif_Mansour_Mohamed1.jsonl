Following ArtEmis, a collection of 80k artworks from WikiArt with 0.45M emotion labels and English-only captions, ArtELingo adds another 0.79M annotations in Arabic and Chinese, plus 4.8K in Spanish to evaluate \u201ccultural-transfer\u201d performance. More than 51K artworks have 5 annotations or more in 3 languages. This diversity makes it possible to study similarities and differences across languages and cultures. Further, we investigate captioning tasks, and find diversity improves the performance of baseline models. ArtELingo is publicly available with standard splits and baseline models. We hope our work will help ease future research on multilinguality and culturally-aware AI."}}

As a step in this direction, the ArtEmis dataset was recently introduced as a large-scale dataset of emotional reactions to images along with language explanations of these chosen emotions. We observed a significant emotional bias towards instance-rich emotions, making trained neural speakers less accurate in describing under-represented emotions. We show that collecting new data, in the same way, is not effective in mitigating this emotional bias. To remedy this problem, we propose a contrastive data collection approach to balance ArtEmis with a new complementary dataset such that a pair of similar images have contrasting emotions (one positive and one negative). We collected 260,533 instances using the proposed method, we combine them with ArtEmis, creating a second iteration of the dataset. The new combined dataset, dubbed ArtEmis v2.0, has a balanced distribution of emotions with explanations revealing more fine details in the associated painting. Our experiments show that neural speakers trained on the new dataset improve CIDEr and METEOR evaluation metrics by 20% and 7%, respectively, compared to the biased dataset. Finally, we also show that the performance per emotion of neural speakers is improved across all the emotion categories, significantly on under-represented emotions. The collected dataset and code are available at https://artemisdataset-v2.org."}}

Healthcare systems are critical to maintain during pandemics, however, providing service to sick patients has posed a hazard to frontline healthcare workers (HCW) and particularly those caring for elderly patients. Various approaches are investigated to improve safety for HCW and patients. One promising avenue is the use of robots. Here, we model infectious spread based on real spatio-temporal precise personal interactions from a geriatric unit and test different scenarios of robotic integration. We find a significant mitigation of contamination rates when robots specifically replace a moderate fraction of high-risk healthcare workers, who have a high number of contacts with patients and other HCW. While the impact of robotic integration is significant across a range of reproductive number R0, the largest effect is seen when R0 is slightly above its critical value. Our analysis suggests that a moderate-sized robotic integration can represent an effective measure to significantly reduce the spread of pathogens with Covid-19 transmission characteristics in a small hospital unit."}}
