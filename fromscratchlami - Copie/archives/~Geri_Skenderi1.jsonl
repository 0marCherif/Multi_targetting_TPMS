We propose a novel scene representation to facilitate the geometric reasoning, Directed Spatial Commonsense Graph (D-SCG), a spatial scene graph that is enriched with additional concept nodes from a commonsense knowledge base. Specifically, the nodes of D-SCG represent the scene objects and the edges are their relative positions. Each object node is then connected via different commonsense relationships to a set of concept nodes. With the proposed graph-based scene representation, we estimate the unknown position of the target object using a Graph Neural Network that implements a sparse attentional message passing mechanism. The network first predicts the relative positions between the target object and each visible object by learning a rich representation of the objects via aggregating both the object nodes and the concept nodes in D-SCG. These relative positions then are merged to obtain the final position. We evaluate our method using Partial ScanNet, improving the state-of-the-art by 5.9% in terms of the localisation accuracy at a 8x faster training speed."}}

This idea is primarily inspired by the improved generalization capability induced by solving multiple tasks simultaneously, which leads to a more robust shared representation. Nevertheless, finding optimal auxiliary tasks that give rise to the desired improvement is a crucial problem that often requires hand-crafted solutions or expensive meta-learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, dubbed Detaux, whereby a weakly supervised disentanglement procedure is used to discover new unrelated classification tasks and the associated labels that can be exploited with the principal task in any Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model. The disentanglement procedure works at a representation level, isolating a subspace related to the principal task, plus an arbitrary number of orthogonal subspaces. In the most disentangled subspaces, through a clustering procedure, we generate the additional classification tasks, and the associated labels become their representatives. Subsequently, the original data, the labels associated with the principal task, and the newly discovered ones can be fed into any MTL framework. Extensive validation on both synthetic and real data, along with various ablation studies, demonstrate promising results, revealing the potential in what has been, so far, an unexplored connection between learning disentangled representations and MTL. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance."}}

They aim to learn an energy-based model by predicting the latent representation of a target signal $y$ from a context signal $x$. JEPAs bypass the need for data augmentation and negative samples, which are typically required by contrastive learning, while avoiding the overfitting issues associated with generative-based pretraining. In this paper, we show that graph-level representations can be effectively modeled using this paradigm and propose Graph-JEPA, the first JEPA for the graph domain. In particular, we employ masked modeling to learn embeddings for different subgraphs of the input graph. To endow the representations with the implicit hierarchy that is often present in graph-level concepts, we devise an alternative training objective that consists of predicting the coordinates of the encoded subgraphs on the unit hyperbola in the 2D plane. Extensive validation shows that Graph-JEPA can learn representations that are expressive and competitive in both graph classification and regression problems."}}

As these technologies become more interconnected and interdependent, Industry 4.0 systems become more complex, which brings the difficulty of identifying and stopping anomalies that may cause disturbances in the manufacturing process. This paper aims to propose a diffusion-based model for real-time anomaly prediction in Industry 4.0 processes. Using a neuro-symbolic approach, we integrate industrial ontologies in the model, thereby adding formal knowledge on smart manufacturing. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective way of distilling diffusion models through Random Fourier Features for deployment on an embedded system for direct integration into the manufacturing process. To the best of our knowledge, this approach has never been explored before."}}

The proposed solution is based on a novel scene graph model, the Spatial Commonsense Graph (SCG), where objects are the nodes and edges define pairwise distances between them, enriched by concept nodes and relationships from a commonsense knowledge base. This allows SCG to better generalise its spatial inference to unknown 3D scenes. The SCG is used to estimate the unknown position of the target object in two steps: first, we feed the SCG into a novel Proximity Prediction Network, a graph neural network that uses attention to perform distance prediction between the node representing the target object and the nodes representing the observed objects in the SCG; second, we propose a Localisation Module based on circular intersection to estimate the object position using all the predicted pairwise distances in order to be independent of any reference system. We create a new dataset of partially reconstructed scenes to benchmark our method and baselines for object localisation in partial scenes, where our proposed method achieves the best localisation performance.

Our pipeline manufactures the missing past starting from a single, available image of the clothing probe. It starts by expanding textual tags associated with the image, querying related fashionable or unfashionable images uploaded on the web at a specific time in the past. A binary classifier is robustly trained on these web images by confident learning, to learn what was fashionable in the past and how much the probe image conforms to this notion of fashionability. This compliance produces the POtential Performance (POP) time series, indicating how performing the probe could have been if it were available earlier. POP proves to be highly predictive for the probe\u2019s future performance, ameliorating the sales forecasts of all state-of-the-art models on the recent VISUELLE fast-fashion dataset. We also show that POP reflects the ground-truth popularity of new styles (ensembles of clothing items) on the Fashion Forward benchmark, demonstrating that our webly-learned signal is a truthful expression of popularity, accessible by everyone and generalizable to any time of analysis. Forecasting code, data and the POP time series are available at: https://github.com/HumaticsLAB/POP-Mining-POtential-Performance ."}}

In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of systematically probing exogenous knowledge in the form of Google Trends time series and combining it with multi-modal information related to a brand-new fashion item, in order to effectively forecast its sales despite the lack of past data. In particular, we propose a neural network-based approach, where an encoder learns a representation of the exogenous time series, while the decoder forecasts the sales based on the Google Trends encoding and the available visual and metadata information. Our model works in a non-autoregressive manner, avoiding the compounding effect of large first-step errors. As a second contribution, we present VISUELLE, a publicly available dataset for the task of new fashion product sales forecasting, containing multimodal information for 5577 real, new products sold between 2016-2019 from Nunalie, an Italian fast-fashion company. The dataset is equipped with images of products, metadata, related sales, and associated Google Trends. We use VISUELLE to compare our approach against state-of-the-art alternatives and several baselines, showing that our neural network-based approach is the most accurate in terms of both percentage and absolute error. It is worth noting that the addition of exogenous knowledge boosts the forecasting accuracy by 1.5% WAPE wise, revealing the importance of exploiting informative external information.
