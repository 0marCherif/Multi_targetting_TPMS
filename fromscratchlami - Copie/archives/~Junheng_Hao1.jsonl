Most existing XMTC approaches rely on massive human-annotated training data, which are often costly to obtain and suffer from a long-tailed label distribution (i.e., many labels occur only a few times in the training set). In this paper, we study XMTC under the zero-shot setting, which does not require any annotated documents with labels and only relies on label surface names and descriptions. To train a classifier that calculates the similarity score between a document and a label, we propose a novel metadata-induced contrastive learning (MICoL) method. Different from previous textbased contrastive learning techniques, MICoL exploits document metadata (e.g., authors, venue, and references between documents), which are widely available on the Web, to derive similar document\u2013document pairs. Experimental results on two large-scale datasets show that: (1) MICoL significantly outperforms strong zero-shot text classification and contrastive learning baselines by up to 6.0%; (2) MICoL is on par with the supervised metadata-aware XMTC method trained on 10K\u2013200K labeled documents; and (3) MICoL tends to predict more infrequent labels than supervised methods, thus alleviates the deteriorated performance on long-tailed labels."}}

These ontologies are often manually curated (e.g., UMLS, SNOMED CT, and MeSH) by medical experts. Medical databases, on the other hand, are often created by database administrators, using different terminology and structures. The discrepancies between medical ontologies and databases compromise interoperability between them. Data to ontology matching is the process of finding semantic correspondences between tables in databases to standard ontologies. Existing solutions such as ontology matching have mostly focused on engineering features from terminological, structural, and semantic model information extracted from the ontologies. However, this is often labor-intensive and the accuracy varies greatly across different ontologies. Worse yet, the ontology capturing a medical database is often not given in practice. In this paper, we propose MEDTO, a novel end-to-end framework that consists of three innovative techniques: (1) a lightweight yet effective method that bootstraps a semantically rich ontology from a given medical database, (2) a hyperbolic graph convolution layer that encodes hierarchical concepts in the hyperbolic space, and (3) a heterogeneous graph layer that encodes both local and global context information of a concept. Experiments on two real-world medical datasets matching against SNOMED CT show significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art methods. MEDTO also consistently achieves competitive results on a benchmark from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative."}}

Existing KG embedding models, however, merely focus on representing one of the two views alone. In this paper, we propose a novel two-view KG embedding model, JOIE, with the goal to produce better knowledge embedding and enable new applications that rely on multi-view knowledge. JOIE employs both cross-view and intra-view modeling that learn on multiple facets of the knowledge base. The cross-view association model is learned to bridge the embeddings of ontological concepts and their corresponding instance-view entities. The intra-view models are trained to capture the structured knowledge of instance and ontology views in separate embedding spaces, with a hierarchy-aware encoding technique enabled for ontologies with hierarchies. We explore multiple representation techniques for the two model components and investigate with nine variants of JOIE. Our model is trained on large-scale knowledge bases that consist of massive instances and their corresponding ontological concepts connected via a (small) set of cross-view links. Experimental results on public datasets show that the best variant of JOIE significantly outperforms previous models on instance-view triple prediction task as well as ontology population on ontology-view KG. In addition, our model successfully extends the use of KG embeddings to entity typing with promising performance."}}

Complementary product recommendation (CPR), aiming at providing product suggestions that are often bought together to serve a joint demand, forms a pivotal component of e-commerce service, however, existing methods are far from optimal. Given one product, how to recommend its complementary products of different types is the key problem we tackle in this work. We first conduct an extensive analysis to correct the inaccurate assumptions adopted by existing work to show that co-purchased products are not always complementary and further propose a new strategy to generate clean distant supervision labels for CPR modeling. Moreover, to bridge in the gap from existing work that CPR does not only need relevance modeling but also requires diversity to fulfill the whole purchase demand, we develop a deep learning framework, P-Companion to explicitly model both relevance and diversity. More specifically, given one product with its product type, P-Companion first uses an encoder-decoder network to predict multiple complementary product types, then a transfer metric learning network is developed to project the embedding of query product to each predicted complementary product type subspace and further learn the complementary relationship based on the distant supervision labels within each subspace. The whole framework can be trained from end-to-end and robust to cold-start products attributed to a novel pretrained product embedding module named Product2Vec, based on graph attention networks. Extensive offline experiments show that P-Companion outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 7.1% increase on the Hit@10 score with well-controlled diversity. Production-wise, we deploy P-Companion to provide online recommendations for over 200M products at Amazon and observe significant gains on product sales and profit."}}

Currently, the knowledge accumulated from different studies about this virus is very limited. Leveraging a wide range of biological knowledge, such as gene ontology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks from other closely related species presents a vital approach to infer the molecular impact of a new species. In this paper, we propose the transferred multi-relational embedding model Bio-JOIE to capture the knowledge of gene ontology and PPI networks, which demonstrates superb capability in modeling the SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions. Bio-JOIE jointly trains two model components. The knowledge model encodes the relational facts from the protein and GO domains into separated embedding spaces, using a hierarchy-aware encoding technique employed for the GO terms. On top of that, the transfer model learns a non-linear transformation to transfer the knowledge of PPIs and gene ontology annotations across their embedding spaces. By leveraging only structured knowledge, Bio-JOIE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in PPI type prediction on multiple species. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the potential of leveraging the learned representations on clustering proteins with enzymatic function into enzyme commission families. Finally, we show that Bio-JOIE can accurately identify PPIs between the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins, providing valuable insights for advancing research on this new disease."}}

In either case, information of how long an accident affects the traffic at nearby intersections is essential. Although there have been various approaches regarding prior-accident issues, only a few studies have been able to evaluate the impacts after an accident. With the emerging of new traffic sensor technologies, traffic data have exploded. This inspires us to rethink the accident impacts evaluation problem based more on intensive data. Accordingly, a practical data-driven method is proposed in this paper, whose functions are twofold: 1) to identify the flow characteristic of each intersection based on the processed data and then quantify the accident impacts through outlier detection and 2) to evaluate the duration of impacts by means of hazard-based model with heterogeneity. The procedure developed in this paper will be useful for capturing the accident impacts duration at or near urban intersections, as well as identifying the causal factors that affect these impacts, which includes the accident features, road environment and the temporal characteristics of nearby intersections. These findings could make some valuable conclusions for a better traffic management."}}
