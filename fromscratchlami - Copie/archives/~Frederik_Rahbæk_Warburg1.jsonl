These depth sensors, however, suffer from stereo artefacts and do not provide dense depth this http URL this work, we present the first self-supervised depth completion method for active stereo systems that predicts accurate dense depth maps. Our system leverages a feature-based visual inertial SLAM system to produce motion estimates and accurate (but sparse) 3D landmarks. The 3D landmarks are used both as model input and as supervision during training. The motion estimates are used in our novel reconstruction loss that relies on a combination of passive and active stereo frames, resulting in significant improvements in textureless areas that are common in indoor environments. Due to the nonexistence of publicly available active stereo datasets, we release a real dataset together with additional information for a publicly available synthetic dataset (TartanAir [42]) needed for active depth completion and prediction. Through rigorous evaluations we show that our method outperforms state of the art on both datasets. Additionally we show how our method obtains more complete, and therefore safer, 3D maps when used in a robotic platform.\n"}}

However, in the context of augmented reality, one may also wish to effect semantic manipulations or augmentations of objects within a scene. To this end, we propose a volumetric framework for (i) disentangling or separating, the volumetric representation of a given foreground object from the background, and (ii) semantically manipulating the foreground object, as well as the background.\nOur framework takes as input a set of 2D masks specifying the desired foreground object for training views, together with the associated 2D views and poses, and produces a foreground-background disentanglement that respects the surrounding illumination, reflections, and partial occlusions, which can be applied to both training and novel views. Unlike previous work, our method does not rely on 3D information in the form of 3D object bounding boxes or a scene voxel grid. It correctly captures reflective foreground objects, objects occluded by the background, and objects with noisy and inaccurate masks.\nOur method enables the separate control of pixel color and depth as well as 3D similarity transformations of both the foreground and background objects. We subsequently demonstrate our framework's applicability on several downstream manipulation tasks, going beyond the placement and movement of foreground objects. These tasks include object camouflage, non-negative 3D object inpainting, 3D object translation, 3D object inpainting, and 3D text-based object manipulation. "}}

However, STNs are hard to train and sensitive to mis-predictions of transformations. To circumvent these limitations, we propose a probabilistic extension that estimates a stochastic transformation rather than a deterministic one. Marginalizing transformations allows us to consider each image at multiple poses, which makes the localization task easier and the training more robust. As an additional benefit, the stochastic transformations act as a localized, learned data augmentation that improves the downstream tasks. We show across standard imaging benchmarks and on a challenging real-world dataset that these two properties lead to improved classification performance, robustness and model calibration. We further demonstrate that the approach generalizes to non-visual domains by improving model performance on time-series data.  "}}
