We develop a data fusion approach that adaptively leverages commonalities among a large number of objectives to improve sample efficiency while tackling their unknown heterogeneities. We provide sharp statistical guarantees for our approach. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate significant advantages of our approach over benchmarks."}}
