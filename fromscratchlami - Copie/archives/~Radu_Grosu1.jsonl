Here, we present a new filter-importance-scoring concept named pruning by active attention manipulation (PAAM), that sparsifies the CNN's set of filters through a particular attention mechanism, during-training. PAAM learns continuous filter scores from the filter weights by optimizing a cost function regularized by an additive term in the scores. As the filters are not independent, we use attention to dynamically learn their correlations. Moreover, by training the pruning scores of all layers simultaneously, PAAM can account for layer inter-dependencies, which is essential to finding a performant sparse sub-network. PAAM can also train and generate a pruned network from scratch in a straightforward, one-stage training process without requiring a pre-trained network. Finally, PAAM does not need layer-specific hyperparameters and pre-defined layer budgets, since it can implicitly determine the appropriate number of filters in each layer. Our experimental results on different network architectures suggest that PAAM outperforms state-of-the-art structured-pruning methods (SOTA). On CIFAR-10 dataset, without requiring a pre-trained baseline network, we obtain 1.02% and 1.19% accuracy gain and 52.3% and 54% parameters reduction, on ResNet56 and ResNet110, respectively. Similarly, on the ImageNet dataset, PAAM achieves 1.06% accuracy gain while pruning 51.1% of the parameters on ResNet50. For Cifar-10, this is better than the SOTA with a margin of 9.5% and 6.6%, respectively, and on ImageNet with a margin of 11%."}}

While learning world models for high-dimensional observations (e.g., pixel inputs) has become practicable on standard RL benchmarks and some games, their effectiveness in real-world robotics applications has not been explored. In this paper, we investigate how such agents generalize to real-world autonomous vehicle control tasks, where advanced model-free deep RL algorithms fail. In particular, we set up a series of time-lap tasks for an F1TENTH racing robot, equipped with a high-dimensional LiDAR sensor, on a set of test tracks with a gradual increase in their complexity. In this continuous-control setting, we show that model-based agents capable of learning in imagination substantially outperform model-free agents with respect to performance, sample efficiency, successful task completion, and generalization. Moreover, we show that the generalization ability of model-based agents strongly depends on the choice of their observation model. We provide extensive empirical evidence for the effectiveness of world models provided with long enough memory horizons in sim2real tasks."}}

Here, we combine brain-inspired neural computation principles and scalable deep learning architectures to design compact neural controllers for task-specific compartments of a full-stack autonomous vehicle control system. We discover that a single algorithm with 19 control neurons, connecting 32 encapsulated input features to outputs by 253 synapses, learns to map high-dimensional inputs into steering commands. This system shows superior generalizability, interpretability and robustness compared with orders-of-magnitude larger black-box learning systems. The obtained neural agents enable high-fidelity autonomy for task-specific parts of a complex autonomous system."}}

During a run-to-failure experiment, rich unsupervised features from vibration sensory data are extracted by a trained sparse autoencoder. Then, the correlation of the initial samples (presumably healthy), along with the successive samples, are calculated and passed through a moving-average filter. The normalized output which is referred to as the auto-encoder correlation based (AEC) rate, determines an informative attribute of the system, depicting its health status. AEC automatically identifies the degradation starting point in the machine component. We show that AEC rate well-generalizes in several run-tofailure tests. We demonstrate the superiority of the AEC over many other state-of-the-art approaches for the health monitoring of machine bearings."}}

In many applications, the edges of a dynamic network might not be observed, but one can observe the dynamics of stochastic cascading processes (e.g., information diffusion, virus propagation) occurring over the unobserved network. While there have been efforts to infer networks based on such data, providing a generative probabilistic model that is able to identify the underlying time-varying network remains an open question. Here we consider the problem of inferring generative dynamic network models based on network cascade diffusion data. We propose a novel framework for providing a non-parametric dynamic network model---based on a mixture of coupled hierarchical Dirichlet processes---based on data capturing cascade node infection times. Our approach allows us to infer the evolving community structure in networks and to obtain an explicit predictive distribution over the edges of the underlying network---including those that were not involved in transmission of any cascade, or are likely to appear in the future. We show the effectiveness of our approach using extensive experiments on synthetic as well as real-world networks."}}

Recommender systems automatically suggest items to users that might be interesting for them. Recent studies illustrate that incorporating social trust in Matrix Factorization methods demonstrably improves accuracy of rating prediction. Such approaches mainly use the trust scores explicitly expressed by users. However, it is often challenging to have users provide explicit trust scores of each other. There exist quite a few works, which propose Trust Metrics to compute and predict trust scores between users based on their interactions. In this paper, first we present how social relation can be extracted from users' ratings to items by describing Hellinger distance between users in recommender systems. Then, we propose to incorporate the predicted trust scores into social matrix factorization models. By analyzing social relation extraction from three well-known real-world datasets, which both: trust and recommendation data available, we conclude that using the implicit social relation in social recommendation techniques has almost the same performance compared to the actual trust scores explicitly expressed by users. Hence, we build our method, called Hell-TrustSVD, on top of the state-of-the-art social recommendation technique to incorporate both the extracted implicit social relations and ratings given by users on the prediction of items for an active user. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to extend TrustSVD with extracted social trust information. The experimental results support the idea of employing implicit trust into matrix factorization whenever explicit trust is not available, can perform much better than the state-of-the-art approaches in user rating prediction."}}

Understanding the principles of such mechanisms presumably leads to constructive inspirations for the design of efficient learning algorithms. In the present study, we postulate a novel approach on modeling single neurons and synapses to study the mechanisms underlying learning in the C. elegans nervous system. In this regard, we construct a precise mathematical model of sensory neurons where we include multi-scale details from genes, ion channels and ion pumps, together with a dynamic model of synapses comprised of neurotransmitters and receptors kinetics. We recapitulate mechanosensory habituation mechanism, a non-associative learning process, in which elements of the neural network tune their parameters as a result of repeated input stimuli. Accordingly, we quantitatively demonstrate the roots of such plasticity in the neuronal and synaptic-level representations. Our findings can potentially give rise to the development of new bio-inspired learning algorithms."}}
