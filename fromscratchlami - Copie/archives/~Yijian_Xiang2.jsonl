However, in practice, changes in the nonstationary environment can perturb the parameters of the clutter distribution, or even alter the clutter distribution family, which can greatly deteriorate the target detection capability. To avoid such potential performance degradation, cognitive radar systems are envisioned which are required to rapidly realize the nonstationarity, accurately learn the new characteristics of the environments, and adaptively update the detector. In this paper, aiming to develop a fully cognitive radar for target detection in nonstationary environments, we propose a unifying framework that integrates (i) change-point detection of clutter distributions by using a data-driven cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm and its extended version, (ii) learning/identification of clutter distribution by applying sparse theory and kernel density estimation methods, and (iii) adaptive target detection by automatically modifying the likelihood-ratio test and corresponding detection threshold. Further, with extensive numerical examples, we demonstrate the achieved improvements in detection performance due to the proposed framework in comparison with a nonadaptive case, an adaptive matched filter method, and the clairvoyant case. We also use Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to evaluate the statistical significance of the performance improvements."}}

Compared with the classic nuclear norm, the Schatten-p norm is stated to be a closer approximation to restrain the singular values for practical applications in the real world. However, Schatten-p norm minimization is a challenging non-convex, non-smooth, and non-Lipschitz problem. In this paper, inspired by the reweighted \u2113 <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub> and \u2113 <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> norm for compressive sensing, the generalized iterative reweighted nuclear norm (GIRNN) and the generalized iterative reweighted Frobenius norm (GIRFN) algorithms are proposed to approximate Schatten-p norm minimization. By involving the proposed algorithms, the problem becomes more tractable and the closed solutions are derived from the iteratively reweighted subproblems. In addition, we prove that both proposed algorithms converge at a linear rate to a bounded optimum. Numerical experiments for the practical matrix completion (MC), robust principal component analysis (RPCA), and image decomposition problems are illustrated to validate the superior performance of both algorithms over some common state-of-the-art methods."}}

Since the narrowband radio frequency interference (RFI) has a stable frequency in a snapshot sequence, it has a low-rank property that can be used to substract RFI from the received signal. The nuclear norm is a common convex relaxation to constrain the rank, but it is optimized by the singular value thresholding (SVT) algorithm, which uses a single threshold to treat all singular values and greatly over-punishes large singular values. Hence, in this paper, we propose two methods, the reweighted nuclear norm (RNN) algorithm and the reweighted Frobenius norm (RFN) algorithm, to separate the RFI and the useful signal. The RNN and RFN minimization problems are the approximations of the real rank function, which can protect large singular values and restrict the rank. As a result, the RFI is accurately extracted and the useful signal is successfully protected. Also, we strictly derive the closed-form solutions of the RNN and RFN minimization problems for complex radar signals, and we also employ downsampling to extract the mainband of the signal spectrum to speed up the convergence. Real SAR data is applied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for RFI suppression."}}

Abstract To cope with complicated environments and stealthier targets, incorporating intelligence and cognition cycles into target tracking is of great importance in modern sensor network management. With remarkable advances in sensor techniques and deployable platforms, a sensing system has freedom to select a subset of available radars, plan their trajectories, and transmit designed waveforms. In this paper, we propose a general framework for single target tracking in cognitive networks of radars, including consideration of waveform design, path planning, and radar selection, which are separately but not jointly taken into account in existing work. The tracking procedure, built on the theories of dynamic graphical models (DGM) and recursive Bayesian state estimation (RBSE), is formulated as two iterative steps: (i) solving a combinatorial optimization problem to select the optimal subset of radars, waveforms, and locations for the next tracking instant, and (ii) acquiring the recursive Bayesian state estimation to accurately track the target. Further, an illustrative example introduces a specific scenario in 2-D space. Simulation results based on the scenario demonstrate that the proposed framework can accurately track the target under the management of the network of radars."}}

Previous studies showed that narrowband radio frequency interference (RFI) is low rank and used the nuclear norm as a low-rank regularization to extract the RFI from the received signal. However, the nuclear norm is not an appropriate approximation of the true rank function. Hence, in this paper, the reweighted matrix-factorization (RMF) algorithm and the matrix-factorization decomposition (MFD) algorithm are proposed to suppress narrowband RFI for SAR systems, where the RMF algorithm uses the reweighted scheme to approximate the rank function, while the MFD algorithm restrains the upper bound of the rank as a prior condition. Moreover, the introduction of the MF scheme dramatically decreases the computational complexity and efficiently suppresses RFI. In addition, we further show that the sparse regularization of the useful signal (i.e., the useful SAR echo) not only protects the strong scatterers of the useful signal but also avoids low-rank overfitting. We employ the real SAR signals of both the sparse scene and the nonsparse scene with the measured RFI to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and the proposed methods outperform the other methods for RFI suppression."}}

Narrowband radio-frequency interference (RFI) has a special low-rank property in the received signal matrix, because it performs like a sinusoid with nearly invariant frequency as the slow time proceeds. Exploiting this special property, in this paper, we divide the received signal matrix into several small matrices, in each of which the RFI is also low rank. Without losing the connection between these small matrices, we stack them into a three-mode tensor to separate the low-rank RFI tensor and recover the informative signal tensor. Previous studies employed the nuclear norm to regularize the low-rank RFI, which is not a good choice. Hence, we propose two reweighted algorithms, the reweighted tensor nuclear norm (RTNN) and the reweighted tensor Frobenius norm (RTFN) algorithms, to approximate the rank function in a tensor and accurately extract the low-rank RFI tensor from the received signal tensor. As a result, the introduction of the tensor structure dramatically decreases the computational cost. Furthermore, the reweighted scheme helps suppressing the RFI and recovering the useful signal with excellent performance. Finally, real SAR data with measured RFI is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for RFI mitigation."}}
