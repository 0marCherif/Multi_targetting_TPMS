Here we consider a mixture model of sparse Gaussian graphical models and develop an exact EM algorithm that improves considerably on a previous approximation. We provide numerical examples to show its superior performance."}}

Due to experimental limitations, especially in biology, data can be sampled at low frequencies, leading to significant challenges in network inference. We introduce the concept of \u201csystem aliasing\u201d and characterize the minimal sampling frequency that allows reconstruction of CT systems from low sampled data. A test criterion is also proposed to detect the presence of system aliasing. With no system aliasing, this article provides an algorithm to reconstruct dynamic networks from full-state measurements in the presence of noise. With system aliasing, we add additional prior information such as sparsity to overcome the lack of identifiability. This article opens new directions in modeling of network systems where samples have significant costs. Such tools are essential to process available data in applications subject to experimental limitations."}}

Parametric models are derived for dynamical structure functions, which describe causal interactions between measured variables. Multiple datasets are integrated into one regression problem with additional demands on group sparsity to assure network sparsity and structure consistency. To acquire structured group sparsity, we propose a sampling-based method, together with extended versions of l 1 -methods and sparse Bayesian learning.

Almost all existing work applies to scalar networks i.e. where each node carries a scalar signal; and further, these signals are assumed to be white noises though they may be instantaneously cross correlated. We have previously developed frequency domain based distance measures to deal with scalar networks whose nodal signals are cross-autocorrelated. But in most applications networks are vector networks i.e. each node carries a vector of signals. Here we extend our scalar work to provide a frequency domain distance measure for vector networks. The new distance measure is illustrated with comparative simulations. They show that persistent homology based on static or white noise vector distance measures fails catastrophically; but when based on dynamic vector distance measures, performs very well."}}

The mixture AR model (MxAR) has already been developed for time series clustering, as has an associated EM algorithm. However, this EM clustering algorithm fails to perform satisfactorily in large-scale applications due to its high computational complexity. This paper proposes a new algorithm, k-ARs, which is a limiting version of the existing EM algorithm. It shows remarkably good computational performance when applied to large-scale clustering problems as illustrated on some benchmark simulations motivated by some real applications."}}

However in many, perhaps most, applications, each node may carry multivariate signals representing multi-attribute data, possibly of different dimensions. Modelling such multivariate (or vector) networks requires fitting block-sparse inverse covariance matrices. Here we achieve maximal block sparsity by maximizing a block-l <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> -sparse penalized likelihood. There is only one previous algorithm that already does this, but it does not scale. Here we address key computational bottlenecks and develop a new algorithm which is much faster and has massively reduced requirements on matrix conditioning. A benchmark study shows a computational speed-up by many orders of magnitude."}}

There have been several studies on methods/algorithms for reconstructing (Boolean) networks from time-series data. However, there are no methods currently available for random generation of DSF models with complex network structures for benchmarking. In particular, it may be desirable to generate \"stable\" DSF models or require the presence of feedback structures while keeping topology and dynamics random up to these constraints. This work provides procedures to obtain such models. On the path of doing so, we first study essential properties and concepts of DSF models, including realisation and stability. Then, the paper suggests model generation algorithms, whose implementations are now publicly available."}}

Systems in nature are inherently nonlinear. However, for nonlinear dynamical systems with hidden states, how to give a useful definition of dynamic networks is still an open question. This paper presents a useful definition of Boolean dynamic networks for a large class of nonlinear systems. Moreover, a robust inference method is provided. The well-known Millar-10 model in systems biology is used as a numerical example, which provides the ground truth of causal networks for key mRNAs involved in eukaryotic circadian clocks. In addition, as second contribution of this paper, we suggest definitions of linear network identifiability, which helps to unify the available work on network identifiability."}}
