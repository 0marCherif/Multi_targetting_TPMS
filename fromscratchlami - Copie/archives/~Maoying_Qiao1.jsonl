However, human understanding towards what knowledge is captured by deep neural networks is still elementary and this has a detrimental effect on human\u2019s trust in the decisions made by AI systems. Explainable AI (XAI) is a hot topic in both AI and HCI communities in order to open up the blackbox to elucidate the reasoning processes of AI algorithms in such a way that makes sense to humans. However, XAI is only half of human-AI interaction and research on the other half - human\u2019s feedback on AI explanations together with AI making sense of the feedback - is generally lacking. Human cognition is also a blackbox to AI and effective human-AI interaction requires unveiling both blackboxes to each other for mutual sensemaking. The main contribution of this paper is a conceptual framework for supporting effective human-AI interaction, referred to as interactive and continuous sensemaking (HAICS). We further implement this framework in an image classification application using deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers as a browser-based tool that displays network attention maps to the human for explainability and collects human\u2019s feedback in the form of scribble annotations overlaid onto the maps. Experimental results using a real-world dataset has shown significant improvement of classification accuracy (the AI performance) with the HAICS framework."}}

Community detection is a basic step for exploring and analysing these network data. Typically, homogenous network is a type of networks which consists of only one type of objects with one type of links connecting them. There has been a large body of developments in models and algorithms to detect communities over it. However, real-world networks naturally exhibit heterogeneous qualities appearing as multiple types of objects with multi-relational links connecting them. Those heterogeneous information could facilitate the community detection for its constituent homogeneous networks, but has not been fully explored. In this paper, we exploit heterogeneous multi-relational networks (HMRNet) and propose an efficient message passing based algorithm to simultaneously detect communities for all homogeneous networks. Specifically, an HMRNet is reorganized into a hierarchical structure with homogeneous networks as its layers and heterogeneous links connecting them. To detect communities in such an HMRNet, the problem is formulated as a maximum a posterior (MAP) over a factor graph. Finally a message passing based algorithm is derived to find a best solution of the MAP problem. Evaluation on both synthetic and real-world networks confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

For example, due to the linearity of EPCA's essential form, nonlinear cluster structures cannot be easily handled, but they are explicitly modeled by the mixing extensions. However, the traditional mixture of local EPCAs has the problem of model redundancy, i.e., overlaps among mixing components, which may cause ambiguity for data clustering. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, a repulsiveness-encouraging prior is introduced among mixing components and a diversified EPCA mixture (DEPCAM) model is developed in the Bayesian framework. Specifically, a determinantal point process (DPP) is exploited as a diversity-encouraging prior distribution over the joint local EPCAs. As required, a matrix-valued measure for L-ensemble kernel is designed, within which, $\\ell_1$ constraints are imposed to facilitate selecting effective PCs of local EPCAs, and angular based similarity measure are proposed. An efficient variational EM algorithm is derived to perform parameter learning and hidden variable inference. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of model parsimony and generalization ability on unseen test data."}}

Due to small pneumoconiosis incidence and restrictions on sharing of patient data, the number of available pneumoconiosis X-rays is insufficient, which introduces significant challenges for training deep learning models. In this paper, we use both real and synthetic pneumoconiosis radiographs to train a cascaded machine learning framework for the automated detection of pneumoconiosis, including a machine learning based pixel classifier for lung field segmentation, and Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) for generating abundant lung field images for training, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classier. Experiments are conducted to compare the classification results from several state-of-the-art machine learning models and ours. Our proposed model outperforms the others and achieves an overall classification accuracy of 90.24%, a specificity of 88.46% and an excellent sensitivity of 93.33% for detecting pneumoconiosis."}}

However, because of the non-convexity of its objective, the factorization is generally not unique and may inaccurately discover intrinsic \u201cparts\u201d from the data. In this paper, we approach this issue using a Bayesian framework. We propose to assign a diversity prior to the parts of the factorization to induce correctness based on the assumption that useful parts should be distinct and thus well-spread. A Bayesian framework including this diversity prior is then established. This framework aims at inducing factorizations embracing both good data fitness from maximizing likelihood and large separability from the diversity prior. Specifically, the diversity prior is formulated with determinantal point processes (DPP) and is seamlessly embedded into a Bayesian NMF framework. To carry out the inference, a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) based procedure is derived. Experiments conducted on a synthetic dataset and a real-world MULAN dataset for multi-label learning (MLL) task demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method."}}

While the first-order Hidden Markov Models (HMM) provides a fundamental approach for unsupervised sequential labeling, the basic model does not show satisfying performance when it is directly applied to real world problems, such as part-of-speech tagging (PoS tagging) and optical character recognition (OCR). Aiming at improving performance, important extensions of HMM have been proposed in the literatures. One of the common key features in these extensions is the incorporation of proper prior information. In this paper, we propose a new extension of HMM, termed diversified Hidden Markov Models (dHMM), which utilizes a diversity-encouraging prior over the state-transition probabilities and thus facilitates more dynamic sequential labellings. Specifically, the diversity is modeled by a continuous determinantal point process prior, which we apply to both unsupervised and supervised scenarios. Learning and inference algorithms for dHMM are derived. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets for unsupervised PoS tagging and supervised OCR confirmed the effectiveness of dHMM, with competitive performance to the state-of-the-art."}}
