Given the CL training data, generative models can be trained to generate synthetic data to supplement the real data. Using both synthetic and real data for CL training has the potential to improve the quality of learned representations. However, synthetic data usually has lower quality than real data, and using synthetic data may not improve CL compared with using real data. To tackle this problem, we propose a data generation framework with two methods to improve CL training by joint sample generation and contrastive learning. The first approach generates hard samples for the main model. The generator is jointly learned with the main model to dynamically customize hard samples based on the training state of the main model. Besides, a pair of data generators are proposed to generate similar but distinct samples as positive pairs. In joint learning, the hardness of a positive pair is progressively increased by decreasing their similarity. Experimental results on multiple datasets show superior accuracy and data efficiency of the proposed data generation methods applied to CL. For example, about 4.0%, 3.5%, and 2.6% accuracy improvements for linear classification are observed on ImageNet-100, CIFAR-100, and CIFAR-10, respectively. Besides, up to 2\u00d7 data efficiency for linear classification and up to 5\u00d7 data efficiency for transfer learning are achieved."}}

Specifically, TracIn is a gradient-based method that reveals the impact of a training sample on a test sample in supervised learning. We extend it to the self-supervised learning setting and propose an efficient batch-wise per-sample gradient computation method to estimate the pairwise TracIn to represent the similarity of samples in the mini-batch during training. For each image, we select the most similar sample from other images as the additional positive and pull their features together with BYOL loss.

Deep learning models deployed on edge devices are required to learn from these unlabeled data to continuously improve accuracy. Self-supervised representation learning has achieved promising performances using centralized unlabeled data. However, the increasing awareness of privacy protection limits centralizing the distributed unlabeled image data on edge devices. While federated learning has been widely adopted to enable distributed machine learning with privacy preservation, without a data selection method to efficiently select streaming data, the traditional federated learning framework fails to handle these huge amounts of decentralized unlabeled data with limited storage resources on edge. To address these challenges, we propose a Self-supervised On-device Federated learning framework with coreset selection, which we call SOFed, to automatically select a coreset that consists of the most representative samples into the replay buffer on each device. It preserves data privacy as each client does not share raw data while learning good visual representations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of the proposed method in visual representation learning."}}

However, in medical imaging analysis, each site may only have a limited amount of data and labels, which makes learning ineffective. Federated learning (FL) can learn a shared model from decentralized data. But traditional FL requires fully-labeled data for training, which is very expensive to obtain. Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) can learn from unlabeled data for pre-training, followed by fine-tuning with limited annotations. However, when adopting CL in FL, the limited data diversity on each site makes federated contrastive learning (FCL) ineffective. In this work, we propose two federated self-supervised learning frameworks for volumetric medical image segmentation with limited annotations. The first one features high accuracy and fits high-performance servers with high-speed connections. The second one features lower communication costs, suitable for mobile devices. In the first framework, features are exchanged during FCL to provide diverse contrastive data to each site for effective local CL while keeping raw data private. Global structural matching aligns local and remote features for a unified feature space among different sites. In the second framework, to reduce the communication cost for feature exchanging, we propose an optimized method FCLOpt that does not rely on negative samples. To reduce the communications of model download, we propose the predictive target network update (PTNU) that predicts the parameters of the target network. Based on PTNU, we propose the distance prediction (DP) to remove most of the uploads of the target network. Experiments on a cardiac MRI dataset show the proposed two frameworks substantially improve the segmentation and generalization performance compared with state-of-the-art techniques."}}

The first approach generates hard samples for the main model. The generator is jointly learned with the main model to dynamically customize hard samples based on the training state of the main model. With the progressively growing knowledge of the main model, the generated samples also become harder to constantly encourage the main model to learn better representations. Besides, a pair of data generators are proposed to generate similar but distinct samples as positive pairs. In joint learning, the hardness of a positive pair is progressively increased by decreasing their similarity. In this way, the main model learns to cluster hard positives by pulling the representations of similar yet distinct samples together, by which the representations of similar samples are well-clustered and better representations can be learned. Comprehensive experiments show superior accuracy and data efficiency of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art on multiple datasets. For example, about 5% accuracy improvement on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR-10, and more than 6% accuracy improvement on CIFAR-100 are achieved for linear classification. Besides, up to 2x data efficiency for linear classification and up to 5x data efficiency for transfer learning are achieved."}}

Federated learning (FL) can use decentralized data to train models while keeping data local. Existing FL methods assume all the data have labels. However, medical data often comes without full labels due to high labeling costs. Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, contrastive learning (CL) and masked autoencoders (MAE), can leverage the unlabeled data to pre-train models, followed by fine-tuning with limited labels. However, combining SSL and FL has unique challenges. For example, CL requires diverse data but each device only has limited data. For MAE, while Vision Transformer (ViT) based MAE has higher accuracy over CNNs in centralized learning, MAE's performance in FL with unlabeled data has not been investigated. Besides, the ViT synchronization between the server and clients is different from traditional CNNs. Therefore, special synchronization methods need to be designed. In this work, we propose two federated self-supervised learning frameworks for dermatological disease diagnosis with limited labels. The first one features lower computation costs, suitable for mobile devices. The second one features high accuracy and fits high-performance servers. Based on CL, we proposed federated contrastive learning with feature sharing (FedCLF). Features are shared for diverse contrastive information without sharing raw data for privacy. Based on MAE, we proposed FedMAE. Knowledge split separates the global and local knowledge learned from each client. Only global knowledge is aggregated for higher generalization performance. Experiments on dermatological disease datasets show superior accuracy of the proposed frameworks over state-of-the-arts."}}

Various studies have demonstrated that early diagnosis and intervention are often critical to prognosis and outcome. To this end, the past decade has witnessed the rapid evolvement of deep learning based smartphone apps, which allow users to conveniently and timely identify issues that have emerged around their skins. In order to collect sufficient data needed by deep learning and at the same time protect patient privacy, federated learning is often used, where individual clients aggregate a global model while keeping datasets local. However, existing federated learning frameworks are mostly designed to optimize the overall performance, while common dermatological datasets are heavily imbalanced. When applying federated learning to such datasets, significant disparities in diagnosis accuracy may occur. To address such a fairness issue, this paper proposes a fairness-aware federated learning framework for dermatological disease diagnosis. The framework is divided into two stages: In the first in-FL stage, clients with different skin types are trained in a federated learning process to construct a global model for all skin types. An automatic weight aggregator is used in this process to assign higher weights to the client with higher loss, and the intensity of the aggregator is determined by the level of difference between losses. In the latter post-FL stage, each client fine-tune its personalized model based on the global model in the in-FL stage. To achieve better fairness, models from different epochs are selected for each client to keep the accuracy difference of different skin types within 0.05. Experiments indicate that our proposed framework effectively improves both fairness and accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art."}}
