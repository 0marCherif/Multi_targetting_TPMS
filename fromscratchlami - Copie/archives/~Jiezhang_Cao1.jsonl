Even though previous works recognize the utility of asynchronous event information for this task, they ignore the fact that motion may or may not result in blur in the input video to be interpolated, depending on the length of the exposure time of the frames and the speed of the motion, and assume either that the input video is sharp, restricting themselves to frame interpolation, or that it is blurry, including an explicit, separate deblurring stage before interpolation in their pipeline. We instead propose a general method for event-based frame interpolation that performs deblurring ad-hoc and thus works both on sharp and blurry input videos. Our model consists in a bidirectional recurrent network that naturally incorporates the temporal dimension of interpolation and fuses information from the input frames and the events adaptively based on their temporal proximity. In addition, we introduce a novel real-world high-resolution dataset with events and color videos named HighREV, which provides a challenging evaluation setting for the examined task. Extensive experiments on the standard GoPro benchmark and on our dataset show that our network consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on frame interpolation, single image deblurring and the joint task of interpolation and deblurring.

Hyperspectral demosaicing is used to recover the non-measured components. While deep learning methods have shown promise in this area, they still suffer from several challenges, including limited modeling of non-local dependencies, lack of consideration of the periodic MSFA pattern that could be linked to periodic artifacts, and difficulty in recovering high-frequency details. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel de-mosaicing framework, the MSFA-frequency-aware Transformer network (FDM-Net). FDM-Net integrates a novel MSFA-frequency-aware multi-head self-attention mechanism (MaFormer) and a filter-based Fourier zero-padding method to reconstruct high pass components with greater difficulty and low pass components with relative ease, separately. The advantage of Maformer is that it can leverage the MSFA information and non-local dependencies present in the data. Additionally, we introduce a joint spatial and frequency loss to transfer MSFA information and enhance training on frequency components that are hard to recover. Our experimental results demonstrate that FDM-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 6dB PSNR, and reconstructs high-fidelity details successfully."}}

However, binning results in lower spatial resolution and non-Bayer CFA artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-head joint remosaicing and denoising network (DJRD), which enables the conversion of noisy Quad Bayer and standard noise-free Bayer pattern without any resolution loss. DJRD includes a newly designed Quad Bayer remosaicing (QB-Re) block, integrated denoising modules based on Swin-transformer and multi-scale wavelet transform. The QB-Re block constructs the convolution kernel based on the CFA pattern to achieve a periodic color distribution in the perceptual field, which is used to extract exact spectral information and reduce color misalignment. The integrated Swin-Transformer and multi-scale wavelet transform capture non-local dependencies, frequency and location information to effectively reduce practical noise. By identifying challenging patches utilizing Moire and zipper detection metrics, we enable our model to concentrate on difficult patches during the post-training phase, which enhances the model's performance in hard cases. Our proposed model outperforms competing models by approximately 3dB, without additional complexity in hardware or software."}}

However, hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often quite noisy because of narrow band spectral filtering. To reduce the noise in HSI data cubes, both model-driven and learning-based denoising algorithms have been proposed. However, model-based approaches rely on hand-crafted priors and hyperparameters, while learning-based methods are incapable of estimating the inherent degradation patterns and noise distributions in the imaging procedure, which could inform supervised learning. Secondly, learning-based algorithms predominantly rely on CNN and fail to capture long-range dependencies, resulting in limited interpretability. This paper proposes a Degradation-Noise-Aware Unfolding Network (DNA-Net) that addresses these issues. Firstly, DNA-Net models sparse noise, Gaussian noise, and explicitly represent image prior using transformer. Then the model is unfolded into an end-to-end network, the hyperparameters within the model are estimated from the noisy HSI and degradation model and utilizes them to control each iteration. Additionally, we introduce a novel U-Shaped Local-Non-local-Spectral Transformer (U-LNSA) that captures spectral correlation, local contents, and non-local dependencies simultaneously. By integrating U-LNSA into DNA-Net, we present the first Transformer-based deep unfolding HSI denoising method. Experimental results show that DNA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and the modeling of noise distributions helps in cases with heavy noise."}}

Recent work in image restoration has been focused on the design of deep neural networks. The datasets used to train these networks \u2018only\u2019 contain some thousands of images, which is still incomparable with the large scale datasets for other vision tasks such as visual recognition and object detection. The small training set limits the performance of image restoration networks. To solve this problem, we collect high-resolution (HR) images from Flickr for image restoration. To ensure the pixel-level quality of the collected dataset, annotators were invited to manually inspect each of the collected image and remove the low-quality ones. The final dataset contains 84,991 high-quality training images, 1,000 validation images, and 1,000 test images. In addition, we showed that the model capacity of large networks could be fully exploited by training on the large scale dataset with significantly increased patch size and prolonged training iterations. The experimental results on image super-resolution (SR), denoising, JPEG deblocking, deblurring, and demosaicking, and real-world SR show that image restoration networks benefit a lot from the large scale dataset."}}

However, deep models trained on such a degradation assumption will inevitably give rise to poor performance for real videos due to degradation mismatch. Although some studies attempt to train deep models on noisy and noise-free video pairs captured by cameras, such models can only work well for specific cameras and do not generalize well for other videos. In this paper, we propose to lift this limitation and focus on the problem of general real video denoising with the aim to generalize well on unseen real-world videos. We tackle this problem by firstly investigating the common behaviors of video noises and observing two important characteristics: 1) downscaling helps to reduce the noise level in spatial space and 2) the information from the adjacent frames help to remove the noise of the current frame in temporal space. Motivated by these two observations, we propose a multi-scale recurrent architecture by making full use of the above two characteristics. Secondly, we propose a synthetic real noise degradation model by randomly shuffling different noise types to train the denoising model. With a synthesized and enriched degradation space, our degradation model can help to bridge the distribution gap between training data and real-world data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance and better generalization ability than existing methods on both synthetic Gaussian denoising and practical real video denoising."}}
