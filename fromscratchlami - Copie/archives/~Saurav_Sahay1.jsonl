With this motivation, we implement a multimodal dialogue system to support play-based learning experiences at home, guiding kids to master basic math concepts. This work explores Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) pipeline within a task-oriented dialogue system developed for Kid Space, with cascading Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) components evaluated on our home deployment data with kids going through gamified math learning activities. We validate the advantages of a multi-task architecture for NLU and experiment with a diverse set of pretrained language representations for Intent Recognition and Entity Extraction tasks in the math learning domain. To recognize kids' speech in realistic home environments, we investigate several ASR systems, including the commercial Google Cloud and the latest open-source Whisper solutions with varying model sizes. We evaluate the SLU pipeline by testing our best-performing NLU models on noisy ASR output to inspect the challenges of understanding children for math learning in authentic homes."}}

Across many disciplines, enhancing the quality of mathematics education is crucial in building critical thinking and problem-solving skills at younger ages. Conversational AI systems have started maturing to a point where they could play a significant role in helping students learn fundamental math concepts. This work presents a task-oriented Spoken Dialogue System (SDS) built to support play-based learning of basic math concepts for early childhood education. The system has been evaluated via real-world deployments at school while the students are practicing early math concepts with multimodal interactions. We discuss our efforts to improve the SDS pipeline built for math learning, for which we explore utilizing MathBERT representations for potential enhancement to the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) module. We perform an end-to-end evaluation using real-world deployment outputs from the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Intent Recognition, and Dialogue Manager (DM) components to understand how error propagation affects the overall performance in real-world scenarios."}}

The assistive technology proposed in this work centers on a dialogue system built upon semantic frame extraction of process specifications detailing a given manufacturing process. The dialogue system interacts with the technician performing the task by capturing their actions and assisting them in performing relevant steps. Specifically, we develop components to parse expert-authored natural language documents called specs and utilize the parse for task guidance and continual learning. While still in the early stages, we believe that an interactive, assistive AI framework similar to the one we are exploring will become an important component of high-volume manufacturing in the future. Such a system could increase the quality and scalability of next-generation materials and materials-related products, such as batteries or fuel cells, produced by automated materials synthesis techniques and analyzed by automated materials characterization techniques."}}

Our goal is to build Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that can assist children in their learning process. Within such complex frameworks, Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) are crucial building blocks to handle efficient task-oriented communication with children in game-based learning settings. We are working towards a multimodal dialogue system for younger kids learning basic math concepts. Our focus is on improving the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) module of the task-oriented SDS pipeline with limited datasets. This work explores the potential benefits of data augmentation with paraphrase generation for the NLU models trained on small task-specific datasets. We also investigate the effects of extracting entities for conceivably further data expansion. We have shown that paraphrasing with model-in-the-loop (MITL) strategies using small seed data is a promising approach yielding improved performance results for the Intent Recognition task."}}

Recent works also exhibit the possibility of steering a chatbot's output by plugging in an appropriate prompt. Gradient-based methods are often used to perturb the prompts. However, some language models are not even available to the public. In this work, we first explored the combination of prompting and reinforcement learning (RL) to steer models' generation without accessing any of the models' parameters. Second, to reduce the training effort and enhance the generalizability to the unseen task, we apply multi-task learning to make the model learn to generalize to new tasks better. The experiment results show that our proposed method can successfully control several state-of-the-art (SOTA) dialogue models without accessing their parameters. Furthermore, the model demonstrates the strong ability to quickly adapt to an unseen task in fewer steps than the baseline model."}}

In this work, we contribute a novel modular dialogue system framework that seamlessly integrates factual information and social content into persuasive dialogue. Our framework is generalizable to any dialogue tasks that have mixed social and task contents. We conducted a study that compared user evaluations of our framework versus a baseline end-to-end generation model. We found our framework was evaluated more favorably in all dimensions including competence and friendliness, compared to the end-to-end model which does not explicitly handle social content or factual questions."}}
