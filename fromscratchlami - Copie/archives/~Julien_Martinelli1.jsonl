However, in many practical\nscenarios, the relevance of contextual variables is not necessarily known beforehand.\nMoreover, the contextual variables can sometimes be optimized themselves, a\nsetting that current CBO algorithms do not take into account. Optimizing contextual\nvariables may be costly, which raises the question of determining a minimal relevant\nsubset. In this paper, we frame this problem as a cost-aware model selection BO\ntask and address it using a novel method, Sensitivity-Analysis-Driven Contextual\nBO (SADCBO). We learn the relevance of context variables by sensitivity analysis\nof the posterior surrogate model at specific input points, whilst minimizing the\ncost of optimization by leveraging recent developments on early stopping for BO.\nWe empirically evaluate our proposed SADCBO against alternatives on synthetic\nexperiments together with extensive ablation studies, and demonstrate a consistent\nimprovement across examples."}}

Here, we address personalization of treatment timing using a novel mathematical model of irinotecan cellular pharmacokinetics and \u2013dynamics linked to a representation of the core clock and predict treatment toxicity in a colorectal cancer (CRC) cellular model. The mathematical model is fitted to three different scenarios: mouse liver, where the drug metabolism mainly occurs, and two human colorectal cancer cell lines representing an in vitro experimental system for human colorectal cancer progression. Our model successfully recapitulates quantitative circadian datasets of mRNA and protein expression together with timing-dependent irinotecan cytotoxicity data. The model also discriminates time-dependent toxicity between the different cells, suggesting that treatment can be optimized according to their cellular clock. Our results show that the time-dependent degradation of the protein mediating irinotecan activation, as well as an oscillation in the death rate may play an important role in the circadian variations of drug toxicity. In the future, this model can be used to support personalized treatment scheduling by predicting optimal drug timing based on the patient\u2019s gene expression profile."}}

This motivates the\ndesign of algorithms to infer the preponderant reactions between the molecular species observed in\na given biochemical process, and build CRN structure and kinetics models. Existing ODE-based\ninference methods such as SINDy resort to least square regression combined with sparsity-enforcing\npenalization, such as Lasso. However, we observe that these methods fail to learn sparse models\nwhen the input time series are only available in wild type conditions, i.e. without the possibility to\nplay with combinations of zeroes in the initial conditions. We present a CRN inference algorithm\nwhich enforces sparsity by inferring reactions in a sequential fashion within a search tree of bounded\ndepth, ranking the inferred reaction candidates according to the variance of their kinetics on their\nsupporting transitions, and re-optimizing the kinetic parameters of the CRN candidates on the whole\ntrace in a final pass. We show that Reactmine succeeds both on simulation data by retrieving\nhidden CRNs where SINDy fails, and on two real datasets, one of fluorescence videomicroscopy\nof cell cycle and circadian clock markers, the other one of biomedical measurements of systemic\ncircadian biomarkers possibly acting on clock gene expression in peripheral organs, by inferring\npreponderant regulations in agreement with previous model-based analyses. The code is available at\nhttps://gitlab.inria.fr/julmarti/crninf/ together with introductory notebooks."}}

These models allow to connect in a mechanistic framework species-level informations, such as the microbial genomes, with macro-scale features, such as species spatial distributions or metabolite gradients. Numerous models are built upon specieslevel metabolic models that predict the metabolic behaviour of a microbe by solving an optimization problem knowing its genome and its nutritional environment. However, screening the community dynamics with these metabolic models implies to solve such an optimization problem by species at each time step, leading to a significant computational load further increased by several orders of magnitude when spatial dimensions are added. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework based on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) metamodels that are used to provide fast approximations of the original metabolic model. The metamodel can replace the optimization step in the system dynamics, providing comparable outputs at a much lower computational cost. We will first build a system dynamics model of a simplified gut microbiota composed of a unique commensal bacterial strain in interaction with the host and challenged by a Salmonella infection. Then, the machine learning method will be introduced, and particularly the ANOVA-RKHS that will be exploited to achieve variable selection and model parsimony. A training dataset will be constructed with the original system dynamics model and hyper-parameters will be carefully chosen to provide fast and accurate approximations of the original model. Finally, the accuracy of the trained metamodels will be assessed, in particular by comparing the system dynamics outputs when the original model is replaced by its metamodel. The metamodel allows an overall relative error of 4.71% but reducing the computational load by a speed-up factor higher than 45, while correctly reproducing the complex behaviour occurring during Salmonella infection. These results provide a proof-of-concept of the potentiality of machine learning methods to give fast approximations of metabolic model outputs and pave the way towards PDEbased spatio-temporal models of microbial communities and host-microbiota-pathogen interactions."}}
