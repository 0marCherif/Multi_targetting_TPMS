A common issue is that the errors resulting from noisy utterances, semantic misunderstandings, or lack of knowledge make it hard for a real system to respond properly, possibly leading to an unsatisfactory user experience. To avoid such a case, we consider a proactive interaction mechanism where the system predicts the user satisfaction with the candidate response before giving it to the user. If the user is not likely to be satisfied according to the prediction, the system will ask the user a suitable question to determine the real intent of the user instead of providing the response directly. With such an interaction with the user, the system can give a better response to the user. Previous models that predict the user satisfaction are not applicable to DuerOS which is a large-scale commercial dialogue system. They are based on hand-crafted features and thus can hardly learn the complex patterns lying behind millions of conversations and temporal dependency in multiple turns of the conversation. Moreover, they are trained and evaluated on the benchmark datasets with adequate labels, which are expensive to obtain in a commercial dialogue system. To face these challenges, we propose a pipeline to predict the user satisfaction to help DuerOS decide whether to ask for clarification in each turn. Specifically, we propose to first generate a large number of weak labels and then train a transformer-based model to predict the user satisfaction with these weak labels. Moreover, we propose a metric, contextual user satisfaction, to evaluate the experience under the proactive interaction mechanism. At last, we deploy and evaluate our model on DuerOS, and observe a 19% relative improvement on the accuracy of user satisfaction prediction and 2.3% relative improvement on user experience."}}

But privacy concerns are one of the major obstacles to making use of public cloud platforms. Multidimensional anonymisation, a global-recoding generalisation scheme for privacy-preserving data publishing, has been a recent focus due to its capability of balancing data obfuscation and usability. Existing multidimensional anonymisation methods suffer from scalability problems when handling big data due to the impractical serial I/O cost. Given the recursive feature of multidimensional anonymisation, parallelisation is an ideal solution to scalability issues. However, it is still a challenge to use existing distributed and parallel paradigms directly for recursive computation. In this paper, we propose a scalable approach for big data multidimensional anonymisation based on MapReduce, a state-of-the-art data processing paradigm. Our basic idea is to partition a data set recursively into smaller partitions using MapReduce until all partitions can fit in the memory of a computing node. A tree indexing structure is proposed to achieve recursive computation. Moreover, we show the applicability of our approach to differential privacy. Experimental results on real-life data demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the scalability of multidimensional anonymisation over existing methods."}}

To address this challenge, we adopt the crowdsourcing paradigm to offer some incentive for guiding the movement of recruited crowdsourcing users and facilitate the optimization of the movement control decision. In this paper, based on a practical 4G (4th-Generation) network throughput measurement study, we formulate the movement control decision as a cost-constrained user recruitment optimization problem. Considering the intractable complexity of this problem, we focus first on a single crowdsourcing user case and propose a pseudo-polynomial time complexity optimal solution. Then, we apply this solution to solve the more general problem of multiple users and propose a graph-partition-based algorithm. Extensive experiments show that our solutions can improve the efficiency of real-time D2D communication for mobile videos."}}

Efficient detection of malicious network behavior is paid more and more attention. The current traffic detection work is still stuck on the analysis of high-dimensional data. It will restrict the improvement of threat monitoring and network governance when facing massive network flows. Characterization of network flows within simple domains is required to simplify the process of network analysis. Traffic characterization is a key task that allows service providers to detect and intercept anomalous traffic, such that high QoS (Quality of Service) and service availability are maintained and spread of malicious content is prevented. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of research on the concrete characterization of network data. Analogous to spectrum, in this paper, we proposed the concept of FlowSpectrum for the first time in order to represent the network flow, concretely. In the FlowSpectrum, network flow is represented as a spectral line rather than the raw data or a feature vector of the network flow. All flows are able to be mapped as spectral lines, and traffic identification is achieved by analyzing the positions of spectral lines. FlowSpectrum can significantly reduce the complexity of network traffic behavior analysis while enhancing the interpretability of detection and facilitating cyberspace behavior management. We designed a neural network structure based on semi-supervised AutoEncoder for decomposition and dimensionality reduction of network flows in FlowSpectrum. The characterization capability of FlowSpectrum is proved by thorough experiments. Moreover, we realized the correspondence between network behaviors and intervals of spectral lines, preliminarily. Generally speaking, FlowSpectrum can provide new ideas for the field of network traffic analysis."}}

Membership inference is a recently emerging technique to identify whether a data sample was used to train a target model, and seems to be a promising solution to this challenge.

In this paper, we propose a novel membership inference approach inspired by the backdoor technology to address the said challenge. Specifically, our approach of Membership Inference via Backdooring (MIB) leverages the key observation that a backdoored model behaves very differently from a clean model when predicting on deliberately marked samples created by a data owner. Appealingly, MIB requires data owners' marking a small number of samples for membership inference and only black-box access to the target model, with theoretical guarantees for inference results. We perform extensive experiments on various datasets and deep neural network architectures, and the results validate the efficacy of our approach, e.g., marking only 0.1% of the training dataset is practically sufficient for effective membership inference."}}

With cloud-edge computing, the computing tasks in IoV is able to be delivered to the edge servers (ESs) instead of the cloud and rely on the deployed services of ESs for a series of processing. Due to the storage and computing resource limits of ESs, how to dynamically deploy partial services to the edge is still a puzzle. Moreover, the decision of service deployment often requires the transmission of local service requests from ESs to the cloud, which increases the risk of privacy leakage. In this article, a method for privacy-aware IoV service deployment with federated learning in cloud-edge computing, named PSDF, is proposed. Technically, federated learning secures the distributed training of deployment decision network on each ES by the exchange and aggregation of model weights, avoiding the original data transmission. Meanwhile, homomorphic encryption is adopted for the uploaded weights before the model aggregation on the cloud. Besides, a service deployment scheme based on deep deterministic policy gradient is proposed. Eventually, the performance of PSDF is evaluated by massive experiments."}}

However, recent studies have shown that ML models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a data record was used to train a target model or not. MIAs on ML models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For example, via identifying the fact that a clinical record that has been used to train a model associated with a certain disease, an attacker can infer that the owner of the clinical record has the disease with a high chance. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on various ML models, e.g., classification models and generative models. Meanwhile, many defense methods have been proposed to mitigate MIAs. Although MIAs on ML models form a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this article, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on membership inference attacks and defenses. We provide the taxonomies for both attacks and defenses, based on their characterizations, and discuss their pros and cons. Based on the limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to follow this area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community but also provides a clear description for researchers outside this research domain. To further help the researchers, we have created an online resource repository, which we will keep updated with future relevant work.

Mining and exploiting the data would definitely bring huge advantages. However, there are two major issues exposed in the process. First, utilizing the data with high efficiency is challenging in edge computing environment. Second, data from multiple edge servers often contain sensitive information such as user preferences, which will give rise to privacy breach risks when using the data. Locality-Sensitive Hashing and amplified technology are utilized for dealing with two problems. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-protection approach named SR <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">chain\u2212LSH</inf> in edge computing environment which is based on amplified Locality-Sensitive Hashing technique. In order to verify high accuracy and efficiency of our proposal, large sets of experiments are conducted. According to experimental results, our proposal shows better performance than those of comparative methods in terms of MAE , RMSE and time costs. For our method, the best value of MAE is about 0.41 and time cost is about 0.1 seconds, which are more accurate and efficient than comparative methods."}}
