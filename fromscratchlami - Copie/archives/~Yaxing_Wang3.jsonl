Under the SF-UNDA setting, the model cannot access source data anymore during target adaptation, which aims to address data privacy concerns. We propose a novel training scheme to learn a (n+1)-way classifier to predict the n source classes and the unknown class, where samples of only known source categories are available for training. Furthermore, for target adaptation, we simply adopt a weighted entropy minimization to adapt the source pretrained model to the unlabeled target domain without source data. In experiments, we show: 1) After source training, the resulting source model can get excellent performance for open-set single domain generalization and also open-set recognition tasks; 2) After target adaptation, our method surpasses current UNDA approaches which demand source data during adaptation on several benchmarks. The versatility to several different tasks strongly proves the efficacy and generalization ability of our method. 3) When augmented with a closed-set domain adaptation approach during target adaptation, our source-free method further outperforms the current state-of-the-art UNDA method by 2.5%, 7.2% and 13% on Office-31, Office-Home and VisDA respectively.

While capable of synthesizing high-fidelity images, these models often generate unsatisfactory images which fall outside of the data manifold. A considerable research effort has investigated the data manifold, either by simply discarding images having a lower probability according to the discriminator output, or by filtering real images which are within the sparse regions of the data manifold. While effective, these methods fail to get access to either the fake distribution or the real distribution. In this paper, we propose a divide and conquer policy for GAN training. We first introduce a new local data-manifold detector (LDMD), which estimates whether the generated images are inside or outside of the data manifold. With the proposed LDMD, we further introduce a noise replay mode if it is outside the manifold, and a fake sample reuse mode if it is inside the manifold. Extensive experimental results on a number of GANs variants (e.g., SAGAN,SNGAN,BigGAN and StyleGAN) demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that our method improves the GAN\u2019s performance, resulting in more realistic images than previous methods as confirmed by a significant drop in the FID."}}
