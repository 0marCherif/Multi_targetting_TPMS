World models have previously been shown to improve sample-efficiency in simulated environments with few objects, but have not yet been applied successfully to environments with many objects. In environments with many objects, often only a small number of them are moving or interacting at the same time. In this paper, we investigate integrating this inductive bias of sparse interactions into the latent dynamics of world models trained from pixels. First, we introduce Variational Sparse Gating (VSG), a latent dynamics model that updates its feature dimensions sparsely through stochastic binary gates. Moreover, we propose a simplified architecture Simple Variational Sparse Gating (SVSG) that removes the deterministic pathway of previous models, resulting in a fully stochastic transition function that leverages the VSG mechanism. We evaluate the two model architectures in the BringBackShapes (BBS) environment that features a large number of moving objects and partial observability, demonstrating clear improvements over prior models."}}

Such models are at the core of recent advances in model-based reinforcement learning. For example, world models can imagine unseen trajectories, potentially improving data-efficiency. Planning in the real-world requires agents to understand long-term dependencies between actions and events, and account for varying degree of changes, e.g. due to a change in background or viewpoint. Moreover, in a typical scene, only a subset of objects change their state. These changes are often quite sparse which suggests incorporating such an inductive bias in a dynamics model. In this work, we introduce the variational sparse gating mechanism, which enables an agent to sparsely update a latent dynamics model's state. We also present a simplified version, which unlike prior models, has a single stochastic recurrent state. Finally, we introduce a new ShapeHerd environment, in which an agent needs to push shapes into a goal area. This environment is partially-observable and requires models to remember the previously observed objects and explore the environment to discover unseen objects. Our experiments show that the proposed methods significantly outperform leading model-based reinforcement learning methods on this environment, while also yielding competitive performance on tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite."}}

However, they are less capable of systematic generalization to data drawn from unseen but related distributions, a feat that is hypothesized to require compositional reasoning and reuse of knowledge. In this work, we present Neural Interpreters, an architecture that factorizes inference in a self-attention network as a system of modules, which we call _functions_. Inputs to the model are routed through a sequence of functions in a way that is end-to-end learned. The proposed architecture can flexibly compose computation along width and depth, and lends itself well to capacity extension after training. To demonstrate the versatility of Neural Interpreters, we evaluate it in two distinct settings: image classification and visual abstract reasoning on Raven Progressive Matrices. In the former, we show that Neural Interpreters perform on par with the vision transformer using fewer parameters, while being transferrable to a new task in a sample efficient manner. In the latter, we find that Neural Interpreters are competitive with respect to the state-of-the-art in terms of systematic generalization. "}}

Unlike typical few-shot learning algorithms, we propose a contrastive learning method which is not trained to solve a set of tasks, but rather attempts to find a good representation of the underlying data-generating processes (\\emph{functions}). This allows for finding representations which are useful for an entire series of tasks sharing the same function. In particular, our training scheme is driven by the self-supervision signal indicating whether two sets of samples stem from the same underlying function. Our experiments on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets show that the representations we obtain can outperform strong baselines in terms of downstream performance and noise robustness, even when these baselines are trained in an end-to-end manner."}}
