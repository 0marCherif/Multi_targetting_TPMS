However, if researchers wish to integrate the crowd with \"off-the-shelf\" machine classifiers, this deep integration is not always possible. This work explores two strategies to increase accuracy and decrease cost under this setting. First, we show that reordering tasks presented to the human can create a significant accuracy improvement. Further, we show that greedily choosing parameters to maximize machine accuracy is sub-optimal, and joint optimization of the combined system improves performance."}}
