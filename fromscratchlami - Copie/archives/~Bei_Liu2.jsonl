It requires a comprehensive understanding of both language and videos. We have seen a lot of work conducted for third-person view videos, while the task on ego-centric videos is still under-explored, which is critical for the understanding of increasing ego-centric videos and further facilitating embodied AI tasks. Directly adapting existing methods of NLL to ego-centric video datasets is challenging due to two reasons. Firstly, there is a temporal duration gap between different datasets. Secondly, queries in ego-centric videos usually require a better understanding of more complex and long-term temporal orders. For the above reason, we propose an anchor-based detection model for NLL in ego-centric videos."}}

In light of the well-learned visual features, there are works that transfer image representation to the video domain and achieve good results. However, adapting image-text pre-trained models to video-text pre-training (i.e., post-pretraining) has not demonstrated a significant advantage yet. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by raising and addressing two questions: 1) what are the factors hindering post-pretraining CLIP from improving performance on video-text tasks, and 2) how to mitigate the impact of these factors. Through a series of comparative experiments and analyses, we find that the data scale and domain gap between language sources have large impacts. By these observations, we propose an Omnisource Cross-modal Learning method equipped with a Video Proxy mechanism on the basis of CLIP, namely CLIP-ViP. Extensive results show that our approach improves the performance of CLIP on video-text retrieval by a large margin. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets, including MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and ActivityNet. We release our code and pre-trained CLIP-ViP models at \\url{https://github.com/microsoft/XPretrain/tree/main/CLIP-ViP}."}}

To effectively capture\nthe rich temporal dynamics and to better align video and language in an efficient end-to-end manner, we introduce two novel designs in our LF-VILA model.

To achieve this goal, we propose a framework for translating raw descriptions with complex semantics into semantically corresponding images. The main challenge lies in the complexity of the semantics of raw descriptions, which may be hard to be visualized (e.g., \"gloomy\" or \"Asian\"). It usually poses challenges for existing methods to handle such descriptions. To address this issue, we propose a Prompt-based Cross-Modal Generation Framework (PCM-Frame) to leverage two powerful pre-trained models, including CLIP and StyleGAN. Our framework consists of two components: a projection module from Text Embeddings to Image Embeddings based on prompts, and an adapted image generation module built on StyleGAN which takes Image Embeddings as inputs and is trained by combined semantic consistency losses. To bridge the gap between realistic images and illustration designs, we further adopt a stylization model as post-processing in our framework for better visual effects. Benefiting from the pre-trained models, our method can handle complex descriptions and does not require external paired data for training. Furthermore, we have built a benchmark that consists of 200 raw descriptions. We conduct a user study to demonstrate our superiority over the competing methods with complicated texts.

However, the other natural information, motions, in language is less explored. In this paper, we leverage the motion information and study a novel task, language-guided face animation, that aims to animate a static face image with the help of languages. To better utilize both semantics and motions from languages, we propose a simple yet effective framework. Specifically, we propose a recurrent motion generator to extract a series of semantic and motion information from the language and feed it along with visual information to a pre-trained StyleGAN to generate high-quality frames. To optimize the proposed framework, three carefully designed loss functions are proposed including a regularization loss to keep the face identity, a path length regularization loss to ensure motion smoothness, and a contrastive loss to enable video synthesis with various language guidance in one single model. Extensive experiments with both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on diverse domains (\\textit{e.g.,} human face, anime face, and dog face) demonstrate the superiority of our model in generating high-quality and realistic videos from one still image with the guidance of language.

To generate joint audio-video pairs, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Diffusion model (i.e., MM-Diffusion), with two-coupled denoising autoencoders. In contrast to existing single-modal diffusion models, MM-Diffusion consists of a sequential multi-modal U-Net for a joint denoising process by design. Two subnets for audio and video learn to gradually generate aligned audio-video pairs from Gaussian noises. To ensure semantic consistency across modalities, we propose a novel random-shift based attention block bridging over the two subnets, which enables efficient cross-modal alignment, and thus reinforces the audio-video fidelity for each other. Extensive experiments show superior results in unconditional audio-video generation, and zero-shot conditional tasks (e.g., video-to-audio). In particular, we achieve the best FVD and FAD on Landscape and AIST++ dancing datasets. Turing tests of 10k votes further demonstrate dominant preferences for our model.

Natural language query task is challenging due to the requirement of comprehensive understanding of video contents. Most previous works address this task based on third-person view datasets while few research interest has been placed in the ego-centric view by far. Great progress has been made though, we notice that previous works can not adapt well to ego-centric view datasets e.g., Ego4D mainly because of two reasons: 1) most queries in Ego4D have a excessively small temporal duration (e.g., less than 5 seconds); 2) queries in Ego4D are faced with much more complex video understanding of long-term temporal orders. Considering these, we propose our solution of this challenge to solve the above issues."}}

Existing works either extract low-quality video features or learn limited text embedding, while neglecting that high-resolution videos and diversified semantics can significantly improve cross-modality learning. In this paper, we propose a novel High-resolution and Diversified VIdeo-LAnguage pre-training model (HD-VILA) for many visual tasks. In particular, we collect a large dataset with two distinct properties: 1) the first high-resolution dataset including 371.5k hours of 720p videos, and 2) the most diversified dataset covering 15 popular YouTube categories. To enable VL pre-training, we jointly optimize the HD-VILA model by a hybrid Transformer that learns rich spatiotemporal features, and a multimodal Transformer that enforces interactions of the learned video features with diversified texts. Our pre-training model achieves new state-of-the-art results in 10 VL understanding tasks and 2 more novel text-to-visual generation tasks. For example, we outperform SOTA models with relative increases of 40.4% R@1 in zero-shot MSR-VTT text-to-video retrieval task, and 55.4% in high-resolution dataset LSMDC. The learned VL embedding is also effective in generating visually pleasing and semantically relevant results in text-to-visual editing and super-resolution tasks."}}
