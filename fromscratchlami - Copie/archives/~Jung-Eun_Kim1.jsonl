Such isolation needs to be enforced at two orthogonal levels. On the micro-architectural level, this mainly involves avoiding interference through micro-architectural states, such as cache lines. On the algorithmic level, this is usually achieved by adopting real-time partitions to reserve resources for each application. Implementations of such systems are often complex and require formal verification to guarantee proper isolation. In this paper, we focus on algorithmic isolation, which is mainly related to scheduling-induced interferences. We address earliest-deadline-first (EDF) partitions to achieve compositionality and utilization, while imposing constraints on tasks' periods and enforcing budgets on these periodic partitions to ensure isolation between each other. The formal verification of such a real-time OS kernel is challenging due to the inherent complexity of the dynamic priority assignment on the partition level. We tackle this problem by adopting a dynamically constructed abstraction to lift the reasoning of a concrete scheduler into an abstract domain. Using this framework, we verify a real-time operating system kernel with budget-enforcing EDF partitions and prove that it indeed ensures isolation between partitions. All the proofs are mechanized in Coq."}}

Real-time systems are particularly vulnerable to timing channels because real-time applications can easily have temporal locality due to limited uncertainty in schedules. In this paper, we show that real-time applications can create hidden information flow even when the temporal isolation among the time partitions is strictly enforced. We then introduce an online algorithm that randomizes time-partition schedules to reduce the temporal locality, while guaranteeing the schedulability of, and thus the temporal isolation among, time partitions. We also present an analysis of the cost of the randomization on the responsiveness of real-time tasks. From an implementation on a Linux-based real-time operating system, we validate the analysis and evaluate the scheduling overhead as well as the impact on an experimental real-time system."}}

These limitations hinder generative techniques from being incorporated in systems in resource-constrained environment, thus motivating methods that grant users control over the time-quality trade-offs for a reasonable \u201cpayoff\u201d of execution cost. Hence, as a new paradigm for adaptively organizing and employing recurrent networks, we propose an architectural design for generative modeling achieving flexible quality. We boost the overall efficiency by introducing non-recurrent layers into stacked recurrent architectures. Accordingly, we design the architecture with no redundant recurrent cells so we avoid unnecessary overhead."}}

We manage the tradeoff between processing time and solution quality by performing as much preprocessing of data as time will allow. This approach leads us to a design framework in which there are two separate learning networks: one for preprocessing and one for the core application functionality. We show how these networks can be trained together and how they can operate in an anytime fashion to optimize performance."}}

However, the challenge of incorporating learning modules into embedded systems is that computing resources are scarce. For such a resource-constrained environment, we have developed a framework for learning abstract information early and learning more concretely as time allows. The intermediate results can be utilized to prepare for early decisions/actions as needed. To apply this framework to a classification task, the datasets are categorized in an abstraction hierarchy. Then the framework classifies intermediate labels from the most abstract level to the most concrete. Our proposed method outperforms the existing approaches and reference baselines in terms of accuracy. We show our framework with different architectures and on various benchmark datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and GTSRB. We measure prediction times on GPUequipped embedded computing platforms as well."}}

Such properties require strong isolation between components and they rely on enforcement mechanisms provided by the underlying operating system (OS) kernel. In addition to spatial isolation which is commonly provided by OS kernels to various extents, it also requires temporal isolation, that is, properties on the schedule of one component (e.g., schedulability) are independent of behaviors of other components. The strict isolation between components relies critically on algorithmic properties of the concrete implementation of the scheduler, such as timely provision of time slots, obliviousness to preemption, etc. However, existing work either only reasons about an abstract model of the scheduler, or proves properties of the scheduler implementation that are not rich enough to establish the isolation between different components. In this paper, we present a novel compositional framework for reasoning about algorithmic properties of the concrete implementation of preemptive schedulers. In particular, we use virtual timeline, a variant of the supply bound function used in real-time scheduling analysis, to specify and reason about the scheduling of each component in isolation. We show that the properties proved on this abstraction carry down to the generated assembly code of the OS kernel. Using this framework, we successfully verify a real-time OS kernel, which extends mCertiKOS, a single-processor non-preemptive kernel, with user-level preemption, a verified timer interrupt handler, and a verified real-time scheduler. We prove that in the absence of microarchitectural-level timing channels, this new kernel enjoys temporal and spatial isolation on top of the functional correctness guarantee. All the proofs are implemented in the Coq proof assistant."}}
