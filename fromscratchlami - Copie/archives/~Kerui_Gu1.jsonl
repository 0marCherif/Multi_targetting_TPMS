Two popular methods to decode the heatmap into a final joint coordinate are via an argmax, as done in heatmap detection, or via softmax and expectation, as done in integral regression. Integral regression is learnable end-to-end, but has lower accuracy than detection. This paper uncovers an induced bias from integral regression that results from combining the softmax and the expectation operation. This bias often forces the network to learn degenerately localized heatmaps, obscuring the keypoint's true underlying distribution and leads to lower accuracies. Training-wise, by investigating the gradients of integral regression, we show that the implicit guidance of integral regression to update the heatmap makes it slower to converge than detection. To counter the above two limitations, we propose Bias Compensated Integral Regression (BCIR), an integral regression-based framework that compensates for the bias. BCIR also incorporates a Gaussian prior loss to speed up training and improve prediction accuracy. Experimental results on both the human body and hand benchmarks show that BCIR is faster to train and more accurate than the original integral regression, making it competitive with state-of-the-art detection methods."}}

Unlike detection-based heatmap methods, which decode final joint positions from the heatmap with a non-differentiable argmax operation, integral regression methods apply a differentiable expectation operation. This paper offers a deep dive into the inference and back-propagation of integral pose regression to better understand the differences in performance and training compared to detection-based methods. For inference, we give theoretical support as to why expectation should always be better than the argmax operation, i.e. integral regression should always outperform detection. Yet, in practice, this is observed only in hard cases because the heatmap activation for regression shrinks in easy cases. We then experimentally show that activation shrinkage is one of the leading causes for integral regression's inferior performance. For back-propagation, we theoretically and empirically analyze the gradients to explain the slow training speed of integral regression. Based on these findings, we incorporate the supervision of a spatial prior to speed up training and improve performance."}}

The introduction of the integral regression method, which, architecture-wise uses an implicit heatmap, brings the two approaches even closer together. This begs the question \u2013 does detection really outperform regression? In this paper, we investigate the difference in supervision between the heatmap-based detection and integral regression, as this is the key remaining difference between the two approaches. In the process, we discover an underlying bias behind integral pose regression that arises from taking the expectation after the softmax function. To counter the bias, we present a compensation method which we find to improve integral regression accuracy on all 2D pose estimation benchmarks. We further propose a simple combined detection and bias-compensated regression method that considerably outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with few added components."}}
