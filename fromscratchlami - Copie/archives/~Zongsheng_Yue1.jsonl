First, most of them deteriorate when facing complex degradations out of their training data. Second, these methods require multiple constraints, e.g., fidelity, perceptual, and adversarial losses, which requires laborious hyper-parameters tuning to stabilize and balance their influences. In this work, we propose a novel method named DifFace, being able to cope with unseen and complex degradations more gracefully without complicated loss designs. The key of our method is to establish a posterior distribution from the observed low-quality (LQ) image to its high-quality (HQ) counterpart. In particular, we design a transition distribution from the LQ image to the intermediate state of a pre-trained diffusion model and then gradually transmit from this intermediate state to the HQ target by recursively applying a pre-trained diffusion model. The transition distribution only relies on a restoration backbone that is trained with L2 loss on some synthetic data, which favorably avoids the cumbersome training process in existing methods. Moreover, the transition distribution is capable of contracting the error of the restoration backbone and thus makes our method more robust to unknown degradations. Comprehensive experiments show that DifFace is superior to current state-of-the-art methods, especially in cases with severe degradations. Code and model will be released."}}

Firstly, most of them do not sufficiently model the characteristics of rain layers of rainy videos. In fact, the rain layers exhibit strong physical properties (e.g., direction, scale and thickness) in spatial dimension and natural continuities in temporal dimension, and thus can be generally modelled by the spatial-temporal process in statistics. Secondly, current DL-based methods seriously depend on the labeled synthetic training data, whose rain types are always deviated from those in unlabeled real data. Such gap between synthetic and real data sets leads to poor performance when applying them in real scenarios. Against these issues, this paper proposes a new semi-supervised video deraining method, in which a dynamic rain generator is employed to fit the rain layer, expecting to better depict its insightful characteristics. Specifically, such dynamic generator consists of one emission model and one transition model to simultaneously encode the spatially physical structure and temporally continuous changes of rain streaks, respectively, which both are parameterized as deep neural networks (DNNs). Further more, different prior formats are designed for the labeled synthetic and unlabeled real data, so as to fully exploit the common knowledge underlying them. Last but not least, we also design a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to solve this model. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the superiorities of the proposed semi-supervised deraining model."}}

Most recent MSL approaches, however, only assume a simple independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian or Laplacian noise for all views of data, which largely underestimates the noise complexity in practical multiview data. Actually, in real cases, noises among different views generally have three specific characteristics. First, in each view, the data noise always has a complex configuration beyond a simple Gaussian or Laplacian distribution. Second, the noise distributions of different views of data are generally nonidentical and with evident distinctiveness. Third, noises among all views are nonindependent but obviously correlated. Based on such understandings, we elaborately construct a new MSL model by more faithfully and comprehensively considering all these noise characteristics. First, the noise in each view is modeled as a Dirichlet process (DP) Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM), which can fit a wider range of complex noise types than conventional Gaussian or Laplacian. Second, the DPGMM parameters in each view are different from one another, which encodes the \u201cnonidentical\u201d noise property. Third, the DPGMMs on all views share the same high-level priors by using the technique of hierarchical DP, which encodes the \u201cnonindependent\u201d noise property. All the aforementioned ideas are incorporated into an integrated graphics model which can be appropriately solved by the variational Bayes algorithm. The superiority of the proposed method is verified by experiments on 3-D reconstruction simulations, multiview face modeling, and background subtraction, as compared with the current state-of-the-art MSL methods."}}

Classical model-based methods and recent deep learning (DL)-based methods represent two different methodologies for this problem, each with their own merits and drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image restoration method, aiming to integrate both the advantages of them. Specifically, we construct a general Bayesian generative model for the blind IR, which explicitly depicts the degradation process. In this proposed model, a pixel-wise non-i.i.d. Gaussian distribution is employed to fit the image noise. It is with more flexibility than the simple i.i.d. Gaussian or Laplacian distributions as adopted in most of conventional methods, so as to handle more complicated noise types contained in the image degradation. To solve the model, we design a variational inference algorithm where all the expected posteriori distributions are parameterized as deep neural networks to increase their model capability. Notably, such an inference algorithm induces a unified framework to jointly deal with the tasks of degradation estimation and image restoration. Further, the degradation information estimated in the former task is utilized to guide the latter IR process. Experiments on two typical blind IR tasks, namely image denoising and super-resolution, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-arts."}}

Most of current state-of-the-art focus on constructing powerful deep models to obtain better deraining results. In this paper, to further improve the deraining performance, we novelly attempt to handle the SIRR task from the perspective of training datasets by exploring a more efficient way to synthesize rainy images. Specifically, we build a full Bayesian generative model for rainy image where the rain layer is parameterized as a generator with the input as some latent variables representing the physical structural rain factors, e.g., direction, scale, and thickness. To solve this model, we employ the variational inference framework to approximate the expected statistical distribution of rainy image in a data-driven manner. With the learned generator, we can automatically and sufficiently generate diverse and non-repetitive training pairs so as to efficiently enrich and augment the existing benchmark datasets. User study qualitatively and quantitatively evaluates the realism of generated rainy images. Comprehensive experiments substantiate that the proposed model can faithfully extract the complex rain distribution that not only helps significantly improve the deraining performance of current deep single image derainers, but also largely loosens the requirement of large training sample pre-collection for the SIRR task."}}

In this work we propose a new variational inference method, which integrates both noise estimation and image denoising into a unique Bayesian framework, for blind image denoising. Specifically, an approximate posterior, parameterized by deep neural networks, is presented by taking the intrinsic clean image and noise variances as latent variables conditioned on the input noisy image. This posterior provides explicit parametric forms for all its involved hyper-parameters, and thus can be easily implemented for blind image denoising with automatic noise estimation for the test noisy image. On one hand, as other data-driven deep learning methods, our method, namely variational denoising network (VDN), can perform denoising efficiently due to its explicit form of posterior expression. On the other hand, VDN inherits the advantages of traditional model-driven approaches, especially the good generalization capability of generative models. VDN has good interpretability and can be flexibly utilized to estimate and remove complicated non-i.i.d. noise collected in real scenarios. Comprehensive experiments are performed to substantiate the superiority of our method in blind image denoising."}}

Specifically, different bands of the practical HSIs generally contain different noises of evidently distinct type and extent. While current HSI restoration methods give less consideration to such band-noise-distinctness issues, this study elaborately constructs a new HSI restoration technique, aimed at more faithfully and comprehensively taking such noise characteristics into account. Particularly, through a two-level hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) to model the HSI noise structure, the noise of each band is depicted by a Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DP-GMM), in which its complexity can be flexibly adapted in an automatic manner. Besides, the DP-GMM of each band comes from a higher level DP-GMM that relates the noise of different bands. The variational Bayes algorithm is also designed to solve this model, and closed-form updating equations for all involved parameters are deduced. The experiment indicates that, in terms of the mean peak signal-to-noise ratio (MPSNR), the proposed method is on average 1 dB higher compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, as well as performing better in terms of the mean structural similarity index (MSSIM) and Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de Synth&egrave;se (ERGAS)."}}

Abstract Graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) attracts considerable attention in recent years. The performance of a general GSSL method relies on the quality of Laplacian weighted graph (LWR) composed of the similarity imposed on input examples. A key for constructing an effective LWR is on the proper selection of the neighborhood size K or \u03b5 on the construction of KNN graph or \u03b5-neighbor graph on training samples, which constitutes the fundamental elements in LWR. Specifically, too large K or \u03b5 will result in \u201cshortcut\u201d phenomenon while too small ones cannot guarantee to represent a complete manifold structure underlying data. To this issue, this study attempts to propose a method, called adaptive Laplacian graph trimming (ALGT), to make an automatic tuning to cut improper inter-cluster shortcut edges while enhance the connection between intra-cluster samples, so as to adaptively fit a proper LWR from data. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated by experimental results implemented on synthetic and UCI data sets."}}
