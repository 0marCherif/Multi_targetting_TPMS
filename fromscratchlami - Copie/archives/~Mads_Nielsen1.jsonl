A robust, yet accurate detection of WMH can help with the prevention of more lesions from forming. The task is still challenging as the lesions are often small and irregular. Hence, we propose a robust deep learning-based method for the automatic segmentation of WMH only using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans and MRI-specific data augmentation and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. The methods are tested on public and private data, and we show that our model is more robust to domain shift and achieves higher segmentation accuracy than the alternatives."}}

Recent studies on COVID-19 have shown an increase in CMBs of coronavirus cases. Automatic detection of CMBs is challenging due to the small size and amount of CMBs making the classes highly imbalanced, lack of publicly available annotated data, and similarity with CMB mimics such as calcifications, irons, and veins. Hence, the existing deep learning methods are mostly trained on very limited research data and fail to generalize to unseen data with high variability and cannot be used in clinical setups. To this end, we propose an efficient 3D deep learning framework that is actively trained on multi-domain data. Two public datasets assigned for normal aging, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease analysis as well as an in-house dataset for COVID-19 assessment are used to train and evaluate the models. The obtained results show that the proposed method is robust to low-resolution images and achieves 78% recall and 80% precision on the entire test set with an average false positive of 1.6 per scan."}}

Proximal hyperspectral imaging is also widely used in plant and agriculture science. It allows the remote capturing of leaf reflectance information in order to determine and classify plant health and disease. With the high information density in hyperspectral images, it becomes increasingly important to apply sophisticated feature extraction in order to reduce image dimensionality while retaining useful information. Autoencoders are one of the primary methods for deep learning-based feature extraction in hyperspectral images. We investigate different setups of autoencoders to encode the spatial and spectral dimensions in different orders and ways. To our surprise, the best turns out to be a 3D CNN, where the spectral dimension is treated in the same way as the spatial dimensions."}}

However, a typical spatial augmentation scheme is built upon ad hoc selections of spatial transformation parameters which are not determined by the data set and therefore may not capture spatial variations in the data. For segmentation networks trained in the low-data regime, these ad hoc transformation techniques often fail to encourage better generalization. To address this problem, we propose a variational autoencoder framework for spatial data augmentation. We show how this framework provides a natural, data-driven approach to probabilistic, instance-specific spatial augmentation. Further, we observe that U-Nets trained on data augmented using this framework compare favorably with U-Nets trained using standard spatial augmentation methods."}}

However, even the most advanced methods require a huge and diverse amount of data to generalize. Because in realistic clinical scenarios, data acquisition and annotation is expensive, deep learning models trained on small and unrepresentative data tend to outperform when deployed in data that differs from the one used for training (e.g data from different scanners). In this work, we proposed a domain adaptation methodology to alleviate this problem in segmentation models. Our approach takes advantage of the properties of adversarial domain adaptation and consistency training to achieve more robust adaptation. Using two datasets with white matter hyperintensities (WMH) annotations, we demonstrated that the proposed method improves model generalization even in corner cases where individual strategies tend to fail."}}

However, modern mammography-based risk models do not ensure adaptation across vendor-domains and rely on cancer precursors, associated with short-term risk, which might limit long-term risk assessment. We report a cross-vendor mammographic texture model for long-term risk. Approach: The texture model was robustly trained using two systematically designed case-control datasets. Textural features, indicative of future breast cancer, were learned by excluding samples with diagnosed/potential malignancies from training. An augmentation-based domain adaption technique, based on flavorization of mammographic views, ensured generalization across vendor-domains. The model was validated in 66,607 consecutively screened Danish women with flavorized Siemens views and 25,706 Dutch women with Hologic-processed views. Performances were evaluated for interval cancers (IC) within two years from screening and long-term cancers (LTC) from two years after screening. The texture model was combined with established risk factors to flag 10% of women with the highest risk. Results: In Danish women, the texture model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.71 and 0.65 for ICs and LTCs, respectively. In Dutch women with Hologic-processed views, the AUCs were not different from AUCs in Danish women with flavorized views. The AUC for texture combined with established risk factors increased to 0.68 for LTCs. The 10% of women flagged as high-risk accounted for 25.5% of ICs and 24.8% of LTCs. Conclusions: The texture model robustly estimated long-term breast cancer risk while adapting to an unseen processed vendor-domain and identified a clinically relevant high-risk subgroup."}}
