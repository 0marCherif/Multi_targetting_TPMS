In the presence of such automated decision making, there is incentive for strategic agents to modify their input to the algorithm in order to receive a more desirable outcome. While previous work on strategic classification attempts to capture this phenomenon, these models fail to take into account the multiple actions a decision maker usually has at their disposal, and the fact that they often have access only to bandit feedback. Indeed, in standard strategic classification, the decision maker's action is to either assign a positive or a negative prediction to the agent, and they are assumed to have access to the agent's true label after the fact. In contrast, we study a setting where the decision maker has access to multiple actions but only can see the outcome of the action they assign. We formalize this setting as a contextual bandit problem, in which a decision maker must take actions based on a sequence of strategically modified contexts. We provide an algorithm with no regret compared to the best fixed policy in hindsight if the agents' were truthful when revealing their contexts (i.e., no-strategic-regret) for the two action setting, and prove that sublinear strategic regret is generally not possible for settings in which the number of actions is greater than two. Along the way, we obtain impossibility results for multi-class strategic classification which may be of independent interest."}}

In many practical situations, the underlying assessment rule is deliberately kept secret to avoid gaming and maintain competitive advantage. The resulting opacity forces the decision subjects to rely on incomplete information when making strategic feature modifications. We capture such settings as a game of Bayesian persuasion, in which the decision maker offers a form of recourse to the decision subject by providing them with an action recommendation (or signal) to incentivize them to modify their features in desirable ways. We show that when using persuasion, the decision maker and decision subject are never worse off in expectation, while the decision maker can be significantly better off. While the decision maker\u2019s problem of finding the optimal Bayesian incentive compatible (BIC) signaling policy takes the form of optimization over infinitely many variables, we show that this optimization can be cast as a linear program over finitely-many regions of the space of possible assessment rules. While this reformulation simplifies the problem dramatically, solving the linear program requires reasoning about exponentially-many variables, even in relatively simple cases. Motivated by this observation, we provide a polynomial-time approximation scheme that recovers a near-optimal signaling policy. Finally, our numerical simulations on semi-synthetic data empirically demonstrate the benefits of using persuasion in the algorithmic recourse setting."}}

A recent line of research investigates how strategic agents may respond to such scoring tools to receive favorable assessments. While prior work has focused on the short-term strategic interactions between a decision-making institution (modeled as a principal) and individual decision-subjects (modeled as agents), we investigate interactions spanning multiple time-steps. In particular, we consider settings in which the agent's effort investment today can accumulate over time in the form of an internal state - impacting both his future rewards and that of the principal. We characterize the Stackelberg equilibrium of the resulting game and provide novel algorithms for computing it. Our analysis reveals several intriguing insights about the role of multiple interactions in shaping the game's outcome: First, we establish that in our stateful setting, the class of all linear assessment policies remains as powerful as the larger class of all monotonic assessment policies. While recovering the principal's optimal policy requires solving a non-convex optimization problem, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for recovering both the principal and agent's optimal policies under common assumptions about the process by which effort investments convert to observable features. Most importantly, we show that with multiple rounds of interaction at her disposal, the principal is more effective at incentivizing the agent to accumulate effort in her desired direction. Our work addresses several critical gaps in the growing literature on the societal impacts of automated decision-making - by focusing on longer time horizons and accounting for the compounding nature of decisions individuals receive over time.
