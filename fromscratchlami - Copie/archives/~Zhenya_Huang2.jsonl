Therefore, we argue that prior knowledge\nshould be locally shared by users with similar preferences who can be recognized by social relations.\nTo this end, in this paper, we propose a PreferenceAdaptive Meta-Learning approach (PAML) to improve existing meta-learning frameworks with better generalization capacity. Specifically, to address\ntwo challenges imposed by social relations, we first\nidentify reliable implicit friends to strengthen a\nuser\u2019s social relations based on our defined palindrome paths.

Although existing methods have achieved promising results, they still suffer from adopting the spurious correlations in data (aka., shortcuts) to compose rationales and make predictions. Inspired by the causal theory, in this paper, we develop an interventional rationalization (Inter-RAT) to discover the causal rationales. Specifically, we first analyse the causalities among the input, rationales and results with a structural causal model. Then, we discover spurious correlations between input and rationales, and between rationales and results, respectively, by identifying the confounder in the causalities. Next, based on the backdoor adjustment, we propose a causal intervention method to remove the spurious correlations in input and rationales. Further, we discuss reasons why spurious correlations between the selected rationales and results exist by analysing the limitations of the sparsity constraint in the rationalization, and employ the causal intervention method to remove these correlations. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n"}}

Since there exists learning dependency among knowledge attributes, it is crucial for cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) to incorporate attribute hierarchy when assessing students. The attribute hierarchy is only explored by a few CDMs such as Attribute Hierarchy Method, and there are still two significant limitations in these methods. First, the time complexity would be unbearable when the number of attributes is large. Second, the assumption used to model the attribute hierarchy is too strong so that it may lose some information of the hierarchy and is not flexible enough to fit all situations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Bayesian network-based Hierarchical Cognitive Diagnosis Framework (HierCDF), which enables many traditional diagnostic models to flexibly integrate the attribute hierarchy for better diagnosis. Specifically, we first use an efficient Bayesian network to model the influence of attribute hierarchy on students' cognitive states. Then we design a CDM adaptor to bridge the gap between students' cognitive states and the input features of existing diagnostic models. Finally, we analyze the generality and complexity of HierCDF to show its effectiveness in modeling hierarchy information. The performance of HierCDF is experimentally proved on real-world large-scale datasets."}}

Existing studies in this task attach more attention to the sequence modeling of sentences while largely ignoring the rich domain-invariant semantics embedded in graph structures (i.e., the part-of-speech tags and dependency relations). As an important aspect of exploring characteristics of language comprehension, adaptive graph representations have played an essential role in recent years. To this end, in the paper, we aim to explore the possibility of learning invariant semantic features from graph-like structures in CDSC. Specifically, we present Graph Adaptive Semantic Transfer (GAST) model, an adaptive syntactic graph embedding method that is able to learn domain-invariant semantics from both word sequences and syntactic graphs. More specifically, we first raise a POS-Transformer module to extract sequential semantic features from the word sequences as well as the part-of-speech tags. Then, we design a Hybrid Graph Attention (HGAT) module to generate syntax-based semantic features by considering the transferable dependency relations. Finally, we devise an Integrated aDaptive Strategy (IDS) to guide the joint learning process of both modules. Extensive experiments on four public datasets indicate that GAST achieves comparable effectiveness to a range of state-of-the-art models."}}

Although there are many sophisticated selection algorithms for improving CAT's effectiveness, they are restricted and perturbed by the accuracy of current proficiency estimate, thus lacking robustness. To this end, we investigate a general method to enhance the robustness of existing algorithms by leveraging student's \"multi-facet\" nature during tests. Specifically, we present a generic optimization criterion Robust Adaptive Testing (RAT) for proficiency estimation via fusing multiple estimates at each step, which maintains a multi-facet description of student's potential proficiency. We further provide theoretical analyses of such estimator's desirable statistical properties: asymptotic unbiasedness, efficiency, and consistency.

Existing math word problem solvers mainly work on word-level relationship extraction and the generation of expression solutions while lacking consideration of the clause-level relationship. To this end, inspired by the theory of two levels of process in comprehension, we propose a novel clause-level relationship-aware math solver (CLRSolver) to mimic the process of human comprehension from lower level to higher level. Specifically, in the lower-level processes, we split problems into clauses according to their natural division and learn their semantics. In the higher-level processes, following human\u2032s multi-view understanding of clause-level relationships, we first apply a CNN-based module to learn the dependency relationships between clauses from word relevance in a local view. Then, we propose two novel relationship-aware mechanisms to learn dependency relationships from the clause semantics in a global view. Next, we enhance the representation of clauses based on the learned clause-level dependency relationships. In expression generation, we develop a tree-based decoder to generate the mathematical expression. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets, where the results demonstrate the superiority of our framework."}}

Researchers have devoted significant efforts to developing KT models with impressive performance. However, in existing KT methods, the related question difficulty level, which directly affects students' knowledge state in learning, has not been effectively explored and employed. In this paper, we focus on exploring the question difficulty effect on learning to improve student's knowledge state assessment and propose the DIfficulty Matching Knowledge Tracing (DIMKT) model. Specifically, we first explicitly incorporate the difficulty level into the question representation. Then, to establish the relation between students' knowledge state and the question difficulty level during the practice process, we accordingly design an adaptive sequential neural network in three stages: (1) measuring students' subjective feelings of the question difficulty before practice; (2) estimating students' personalized knowledge acquisition while answering questions of different difficulty levels; (3) updating students' knowledge state in varying degrees to match the question difficulty level after practice. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that DIMKT outperforms state-of-the-art KT models. Moreover, DIMKT shows superior interpretability by exploring the question difficulty effect when making predictions. Our codes are available at https://github.com/shshen-closer/DIMKT."}}

Existing algorithms rely on some manually designed and pre-fixed informativeness/uncertainty metrics of question for selections, which is labor-intensive and not sufficient for capturing complex relations between students and questions. In this paper, we propose a fully adaptive framework named Neural Computerized Adaptive Testing (NCAT), which formally redefines CAT as a reinforcement learning problem and directly learns selection algorithm from real-world data. Specifically, a bilevel optimization is defined and simplified under CAT's application scenarios to make the algorithm learnable. Furthermore, to address the CAT task effectively, we tackle it as an equivalent reinforcement learning problem and propose an attentive neural policy to model complex non-linear interactions.

Recently, KT has attracted much research attention due to its critical significance in education. However, most of the existing KT methods pursue high accuracy of student performance prediction but neglect the consistency of students' changing knowledge state with their learning process. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for the KT task and propose a novel model named Learning Process-consistent Knowledge Tracing (LPKT), which monitors students' knowledge state through directly modeling their learning process. Specifically, we first formalize the basic learning cell as the tuple exercise---answer time---answer. Then, we deeply measure the learning gain as well as its diversity from the difference of the present and previous learning cells, their interval time, and students' related knowledge state. We also design a learning gate to distinguish students' absorptive capacity of knowledge. Besides, we design a forgetting gate to model the decline of students' knowledge over time, which is based on their previous knowledge state, present learning gains, and the interval time. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that LPKT could obtain more reasonable knowledge state in line with the learning process. Moreover, LPKT also outperforms state-of-the-art KT methods on student performance prediction. Our work indicates a potential future research direction for KT, which is of both high interpretability and accuracy."}}

Most solutions integrate all information of one question together following a supervised manner, where the representation results are unsatisfactory sometimes due to the following issues. First, they cannot ensure the presentation ability due to the scarcity of labeled data. Then, the label-dependent representation results have poor feasibility to be transferred. Moreover, aggregating all information into the unified may introduce some noises in applications since it cannot distinguish the diverse characteristics of questions. In this paper, we aim to learn the disentangled representations of questions. We propose a novel unsupervised model, namely DisenQNet, to divide one question into two parts, i.e., a concept representation that captures its explicit concept meaning and an individual representation that preserves its personal characteristics. We achieve this goal via mutual information estimation by proposing three self-supervised estimators in a large unlabeled question corpus. Then, we propose another enhanced model, DisenQNet+, that transfers the representation knowledge from unlabeled questions to labeled questions in specific applications by maximizing the mutual information between both. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DisenQNet can generate effective and meaningful disentangled representations for questions, and furthermore, DisenQNet+ can improve the performance of different applications."}}
