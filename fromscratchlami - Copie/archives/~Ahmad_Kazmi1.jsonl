This paper reviews the theoretical developments in career guidance theory and recom-mends a holistic approach towards \u2018Career Path Guidance\u2019, incorporating psychological, socio-logical and developmental perspectives. An approach that considers several future steps in a ca-reer cannot be without challenges. The contextual and environmental situations along with in-dividual characteristics are subject to change along a career path. Additionally, different stages in a career path are another variable that needs consideration to achieve a sustainable future. It has, therefore, been proposed that the career course be mapped by considering external factors, internal improvements and path-related dynamism. A multidimensional understanding of ca-reer guidance and the amount, complexity and sensitivity of the data involved mean that this approach may be better executed using computer-assisted systems that can source and logically analyze a large amount of information from several sources to produce coherent, sustainable and practical career path decisions."}}

The algorithm for PDDR-RED-based HEMS\nis developed by combining a DWS-PSO-based PDDR scheme for load shifting with the dispatch\nstrategy for the photovoltaic (PV), storage battery (SB), and power grid systems. Shiftable home\nappliances (SHAs) are modeled for mixed scheduling (MS). The MS includes advanced as well as\ndelayed scheduling (AS/DS) of SHAs to maximize the reduction in the net cost of energy (CE). A set\nof weighting vectors is deployed while implementing algorithms and a multi-objective-optimization\n(MOO) problem is decomposed into single-objective sub-problems that are optimized simultaneously\nin a single run. Furthermore, an innovative method to carry out the diversi\ufb01ed performance analysis\n(DPA) of the proposed algorithms is also proposed. The method comprises the construction of a\ndiversi\ufb01ed set of test problems (TPs), de\ufb01ning of performance metrics, and computation of the\nmetrics. The TPs are constructed for a set of standardized dynamic pricing signal and for scheduling\nmodels for MS and DS. The simulation results show the gradient of the tradeoff line for the reduction\nin CE and related discomfort for DPA."}}
