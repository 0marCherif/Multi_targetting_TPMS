Identifying its quantum counterpart would be appealing to both theoretical and practical quantum applications. A conventional approach to quantum speedups in optimization relies on the quantum acceleration of intermediate steps of classical algorithms, while keeping the overall algorithmic trajectory and solution quality unchanged. We propose Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD), which is derived from the path integral of dynamical systems referring to the continuous-time limit of classical gradient descent algorithms, as a truly quantum counterpart of classical gradient methods where the contribution from classically-prohibited trajectories can significantly boost QHD's performance for non-convex optimization. Moreover, QHD is described as a Hamiltonian evolution efficiently simulatable on both digital and analog quantum computers. By embedding the dynamics of QHD into the evolution of the so-called Quantum Ising Machine (including D-Wave and others), we empirically observe that the D-Wave-implemented QHD outperforms a selection of state-of-the-art gradient-based classical solvers and the standard quantum adiabatic algorithm, based on the time-to-solution metric, on non-convex constrained quadratic programming instances up to 75 dimensions. Finally, we propose a \"three-phase picture\" to explain the behavior of QHD, especially its difference from the quantum adiabatic algorithm."}}

While there is extensive previous work on simulating finite-dimensional systems, less is known about quantum algorithms for real-space dynamics. We conduct a systematic study of such algorithms. In particular, we show that the dynamics of a $d$-dimensional Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with $\\eta$ particles can be simulated with gate complexity $\\tilde{O}\\bigl(\\eta d F \\text{poly}(\\log(g'/\\epsilon))\\bigr)$, where $\\epsilon$ is the discretization error, $g'$ controls the higher-order derivatives of the wave function, and $F$ measures the time-integrated strength of the potential. Compared to the best previous results, this exponentially improves the dependence on $\\epsilon$ and $g'$ from $\\text{poly}(g'/\\epsilon)$ to $\\text{poly}(\\log(g'/\\epsilon))$ and polynomially improves the dependence on $T$ and $d$, while maintaining best known performance with respect to $\\eta$. For the case of Coulomb interactions, we give an algorithm using $\\eta^{3}(d+\\eta)T\\text{poly}(\\log(\\eta dTg'/(\\Delta\\epsilon)))/\\Delta$ one- and two-qubit gates, and another using $\\eta^{3}(4d)^{d/2}T\\text{poly}(\\log(\\eta dTg'/(\\Delta\\epsilon)))/\\Delta$ one- and two-qubit gates and QRAM operations, where $T$ is the evolution time and the parameter $\\Delta$ regulates the unbounded Coulomb interaction. We give applications to several computational problems, including faster real-space simulation of quantum chemistry, rigorous analysis of discretization error for simulation of a uniform electron gas, and a quadratic improvement to a quantum algorithm for escaping saddle points in nonconvex optimization."}}
