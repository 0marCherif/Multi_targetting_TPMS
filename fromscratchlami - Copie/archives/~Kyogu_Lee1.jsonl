However, most deep-learning methods overlook this real-world practice and assume fixed graph settings. To bridge this gap, we develop a system that reconstructs the entire graph from a given reference audio. We first generate a realistic graph-reference pair dataset and train a simple blind estimation system composed of a convolutional reference encoder and a transformer-based graph decoder. We apply our model to singing voice effects and drum mixing estimation tasks. Evaluation results show that our method can reconstruct complex signal routings, including multi-band processing and sidechaining."}}

Most of the previous works have focused on synthesizing binaural speeches by conditioning the positions and orientations in the feature space of convolutional neural networks. These synthesis approaches are powerful in estimating the target binaural speeches even for in-the-wild data but are difficult to generalize for rendering the audio from out-of-distribution domains. To alleviate this, we propose Neural Fourier Shift (NFS), a novel network architecture that enables binaural speech rendering in the Fourier space. Specifically, utilizing a geometric time delay based on the distance between the source and the receiver, NFS is trained to predict the delays and scales of various early reflections. NFS is efficient in both memory and computational cost, is interpretable, and operates independently of the source domain by its design. Experimental results show that NFS performs comparable to the previous studies on the benchmark dataset, even with its 25 times lighter memory and 6 times fewer calculations."}}

First, a local style token module, which predicts frame-level style tokens from an input pitch and text sequence, is proposed to allow the singing voice system to control musical expression often unspecified in sheet music (e.g., breathing and intensity). Second, we propose a dual-path pitch encoder with a choice of two different pitch inputs: MIDI pitch sequence or f0 contour. Because the initial generation of a singing voice is usually executed by taking a MIDI pitch sequence, one can later extract an f0 contour from the generated singing voice and modify the f0 contour to a finer level as desired. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we confirmed that the proposed model could control various musical expressions while not sacrificing the sound quality of the singing voice synthesis system."}}

However, it is essential to design a music recommendation system that can increase user satisfaction by understanding users' music tastes, not by the complexity of models. Although several studies related to music recommendation systems exploiting negative preferences have shown performance improvements, there was a lack of explanation on how they led to better recommendations. In this work, we analyze the role of negative preference in users' music tastes by comparing music recommendation models with contrastive learning exploiting preference (CLEP) but with three different training strategies - exploiting preferences of both positive and negative (CLEP-PN), positive only (CLEP-P), and negative only (CLEP-N). We evaluate the effectiveness of the negative preference by validating each system with a small amount of personalized data obtained via survey and further illuminate the possibility of exploiting negative preference in music recommendations. Our experimental results show that CLEP-N outperforms the other two in accuracy and false positive rate. Furthermore, the proposed training strategies produced a consistent tendency regardless of different types of front-end musical feature extractors, proving the stability of the proposed method."}}

This is achieved with an encoder pre-trained with a contrastive objective to extract only audio effects related information from a reference music recording. All our models are trained in a self-supervised manner from an already-processed wet multitrack dataset with an effective data preprocessing method that alleviates the data scarcity of obtaining unprocessed dry data. We analyze the proposed encoder for the disentanglement capability of audio effects and also validate its performance for mixing style transfer through both objective and subjective evaluations. From the results, we show the proposed system not only converts the mixing style of multitrack audio close to a reference but is also robust with mixture-wise style transfer upon using a music source separation model."}}

Remastering follows the same technical process, in which the context lies in mastering a song for the times. As these tasks have high entry barriers, we aim to lower the barriers by proposing an end-to-end music remastering system that transforms the mastering style of input audio to that of the target. The system is trained in a self-supervised manner, in which released pop songs were used for training. We also anticipated the model to generate realistic audio reflecting the reference's mastering style by applying a pre-trained encoder and a projection discriminator. We validate our results with quantitative metrics and a subjective listening test and show that the model generated samples of mastering style similar to the target."}}

It is necessary to actively control musical expression for creating a new music performance that conveys various emotions or nuances. However, previous approaches were limited to following the composer's guidelines of musical expression or dealing with only a part of the musical attributes. We aim to disentangle the entire musical expression and structural attribute of piano performance using a conditional VAE framework. It stochastically generates expressive parameters from latent representations and given note structures. In addition, we employ self-supervised approaches that force the latent variables to represent target attributes. Finally, we leverage a two-step encoder and decoder that learn hierarchical dependency to enhance the naturalness of the output. Experimental results show that our system can stably generate performance parameters relevant to the given musical scores, learn disentangled representations, and control musical attributes independently of each other."}}

However, the task of automatically generating piano covers of pop music is still understudied. This is partly due to the lack of synchronized {Pop, Piano Cover} data pairs, which made it challenging to apply the latest data-intensive deep learning-based methods. To leverage the power of the data-driven approach, we make a large amount of paired and synchronized {Pop, Piano Cover} data using an automated pipeline. In this paper, we present Pop2Piano, a Transformer network that generates piano covers given waveforms of pop music. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model to generate a piano cover directly from pop audio without using melody and chord extraction modules. We show that Pop2Piano, trained with our dataset, is capable of producing plausible piano covers."}}

Therefore, estimating the AR model parameters (ARPs) of a reference reverberation is a crucial task. Although a few recent deep-learning-based approaches have shown promising performance, their non-end-to-end training scheme prevents them from fully exploiting the potential of deep neural networks. This motivates the introduction of differentiable artificial reverberation (DAR) models, allowing loss gradients to be back-propagated end-to-end. However, implementing the AR models with their difference equations \u201cas is\u201d in the deep learning framework severely bottlenecks the training speed when executed with a parallel processor like GPU due to their infinite impulse response (IIR) components. We tackle this problem by replacing the IIR filters with finite impulse response (FIR) approximations with the frequency-sampling method. Using this technique, we implement three DAR models\u2014differentiable Filtered Velvet Noise (FVN), Advanced Filtered Velvet Noise (AFVN), and Delay Network (DN). For each AR model, we train its ARP estimation networks for analysis-synthesis (RIR-to-ARP) and blind estimation (reverberant-speech-to-ARP) task in an end-to-end manner with its DAR model counterpart. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves consistent performance improvement over the non-end-to-end approaches in both objective metrics and subjective listening test results."}}
