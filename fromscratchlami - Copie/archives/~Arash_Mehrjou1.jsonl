Pyfectious introduces several novelties which are unprecedented in the existing popular simulators in epidemiology. It constructs the population structure of a city without needing too detailed information by a novel probabilistic assignment method that is unparalleled to existing population synthesizers. The proposed disease propagation algorithm offers a multi-resolution functionality that allows running Pyfectious for large-population cities on normal computers. The modeling details can be easily traded-off with computational demand requiring minimal effort by the end user. The control and monitoring components are designed in an event-triggered fully flexible way by providing a rich action space from which effective policies are hoped to be discovered by advanced RL methods which are otherwise impossible for humans to find due to the immense complexity of the problem. An extensive set of experiments are included to illustrate various aspects of Pyfectious and also to briefly showcase its use as an RL environment which is hoped to help the automatic discovery of epidemic control policies upon bringing together RL scientists and epidemiologists."}}

Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in several generative tasks, but have not been extensively explored in the video domain.\nWe present Random-Mask Video Diffusion (RaMViD), which extends image diffusion models to videos using 3D convolutions, and introduces a new conditioning technique during training.\nBy varying the mask we condition on, the model is able to perform video prediction, infilling, and upsampling. Due to our simple conditioning scheme, we can utilize the same architecture as used for unconditional training, which allows us to train the model in a conditional and unconditional fashion at the same time. We evaluate the model on two benchmark datasets for video prediction, on which we achieve state-of-the-art results, and one for video generation.

With the advent of high-throughput methods for measuring single-cell gene expression under genetic perturbations, we now have effective means for generating evidence for causal gene-gene interactions at scale. However, inferring graphical networks of the size typically encountered in real-world gene-gene interaction networks is difficult in terms of both achieving and evaluating faithfulness to the true underlying causal graph. Moreover, standardised benchmarks for comparing methods for causal discovery in perturbational single-cell data do not yet exist. Here, we introduce CausalBench - a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating network inference methods on large-scale perturbational single-cell gene expression data. CausalBench introduces several biologically meaningful performance metrics and operates on two large, curated and openly available benchmark data sets for evaluating methods on the inference of gene regulatory networks from single-cell data generated under perturbations. With real-world datasets consisting of over 200000 training samples under interventions, CausalBench could potentially help facilitate advances in causal network inference by providing what is - to the best of our knowledge - the largest openly available test bed for causal discovery from real-world perturbation data to date."}}

With billions of potential hypotheses to test, an exhaustive  exploration of the entire space of potential interventions is impossible in practice. Sample-efficient methods based on active learning or bayesian optimization bear the promise of identifying interesting targets using the least experiments possible. However, genomic perturbation experiments typically rely on proxy outcomes measured in biological model systems that may not completely correlate with the outcome of interventions in humans. In practical experiment design, one aims to find a set of interventions which maximally move a target phenotype via a diverse set of mechanisms in order to reduce the risk of failure in future stages of trials. To that end, we introduce DiscoBAX \u2014 a sample-efficient algorithm for the discovery of genetic interventions that maximize the movement of a phenotype in a direction of interest while covering a diverse set of underlying mechanisms. We provide theoretical guarantees on the optimality of the approach under standard assumptions, conduct extensive experiments in synthetic and real-world settings relevant to genomic discovery and demonstrate that DiscoBAX outperforms state-of-the-art active learning and Bayesian optimization methods in this task. Better methods for selecting effective and diverse perturbations in biological systems could enable researchers to potentially discover novel therapeutics for a range of genetically-driven diseases."}}

This offers great opportunities in the healthcare sector, where large datasets are available but cannot be shared to ensure patient privacy. We systematically investigate the effectiveness of FL on the publicly available eICU dataset for predicting the survival of each ICU stay. We employ Federated Averaging as the main practical algorithm for FL and show how its performance changes by altering three key hyper-parameters, taking into account that clients can significantly vary in size. We find that in many settings, a large number of local training epochs improves the performance while at the same time reducing communication costs. Furthermore, we outline in which settings it is possible to have only a low number of hospitals participating in each federated update round. When many hospitals with low patient counts are involved, the effect of overfitting can be avoided by decreasing the batchsize. This study thus contributes toward identifying suitable settings for running distributed algorithms such as FL on clinical datasets."}}

Learning a good policy without a dynamic model can be prohibitively expensive. Learning the dynamic model of a system can reduce the cost of learning the policy, but it can also introduce bias if it is not accurate. We propose a middle ground where instead of the transition model, the sensitivity of the trajectories with respect to the perturbation of the parameters is learned. This allows us to predict the local behavior of the physical system around a set of nominal policies without knowing the actual model. We assay our method on a custom-built physical robot in extensive experiments and show the feasibility of the approach in practice. We investigate potential challenges when applying our method to physical systems and propose solutions to each of them."}}

However, evaluating the performance of causal inference methods in real-world environments is challenging due to the need for observations under both interventional and control conditions. Traditional evaluations conducted on synthetic datasets do not reflect the performance in real-world systems. To address this, we introduce CausalBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating network inference methods on real-world interventional data from large-scale single-cell perturbation experiments. CausalBench incorporates biologically-motivated performance metrics, including new distribution-based interventional metrics. A systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art causal inference methods using our CausalBench suite highlights how poor scalability of current methods limits performance. Moreover, methods that use interventional information do not outperform those that only use observational data, contrary to what is observed on synthetic benchmarks. Thus, CausalBench opens new avenues in causal network inference research and provides a principled and reliable way to track progress in leveraging real-world interventional data."}}
