First, we construct an embedding space, in which the direction and distance between objects represent order and metric relations between their ranks, by enforcing two geometric constraints: the order constraint compels objects to be sorted according to their ranks, while the metric constraint makes the distance between objects reflect their rank difference. Then, we perform the simple $k$ nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) search in the embedding space to estimate the rank of a test object. Moreover, to assess the quality of embedding spaces for rank estimation, we propose a metric called discriminative ratio for ranking (DRR). Extensive experiments on facial age estimation, historical color image (HCI) classification, and aesthetic score regression demonstrate that GOL constructs effective embedding spaces and thus yields excellent rank estimation performances.

First, we develop a binary comparator to predict missing ordering relations between instances. Then, by extending the Kahn\u2019s algorithm, we form a chain representing a linear ordering of instances. We fine-tune the comparator over pseudo pairs, which are sampled from the chain, and then re-estimate the linear ordering alternately. As a result, we obtain a more reliable comparator and a more meaningful linear ordering. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm yields excellent rank estimation performances under various weak supervision scenarios, including semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, and bipartite cases.

The convolution is a basic operator for feature extraction in deep learning. However, it is not directly applicable to a point cloud, which is an irregular, unordered point set. This makes deep learning on point clouds challenging. To address this issue, we propose the extended Laplacian filter (ELF) for point clouds, which adopts the design principles of discrete Laplacian filters in 2D image processing. In other words, ELF extends the Laplacian filters and has the following two properties: 1) it is a two-state filter using two filter matrices (one for a center point and the other for neighboring points), and 2) it employs a scalar weighting function to predict the relative importance of the neighboring points. Then, we develop ELF-Nets, which consist of ELF convolution layers and fully connected layers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ELF-Nets are capable of recognizing the 3D shape of a point cloud effectively and efficiently. In particular, ELF-Nets provide better or comparable performances than the state-of-the-art techniques in both object classification and part segmentation tasks."}}
