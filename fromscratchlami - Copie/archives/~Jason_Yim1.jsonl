In this line of work, a diffusion model over rigid bodies in 3D (referred to as frames) has shown success in generating novel, functional protein backbones that have not been observed in nature. However, there exists no principled methodological framework for diffusion on SE(3), the space of orientation preserving rigid motions in R3, that operates on frames and confers the group invariance. We address these shortcomings by developing theoretical foundations of SE(3) invariant diffusion models on multiple frames followed by a novel framework, FrameDiff, for learning the SE(3) equivariant score over multiple frames. We apply FrameDiff on monomer backbone generation and find it can generate designable monomers up to 500 amino acids without relying on a pretrained protein structure prediction network that has been integral to previous methods. We find our samples are capable of generalizing beyond any known protein structure."}}

But a general solution to this motif-scaffolding problem remains open. Current machine-learning techniques for scaffold design are either limited to unrealistically small scaffolds (up to length 20) or struggle to produce multiple diverse scaffolds. We propose to learn a distribution over diverse and longer protein backbone structures via an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network. We develop SMCDiff to efficiently sample scaffolds from this distribution conditioned on a given motif; our algorithm is the first to theoretically guarantee conditional samples from a diffusion model in the large-compute limit. We evaluate our designed backbones by how well they align with AlphaFold2-predicted structures. We show that our method can (1) sample scaffolds up to 80 residues and (2) achieve structurally diverse scaffolds for a fixed motif."}}

Decision forests are typically ensembles of axis-aligned decision trees; that is, trees that split only along feature dimensions. In contrast, many recent extensions to decision forests are based on axis-oblique splits. Unfortunately, these extensions forfeit one or more of the favorable properties of decision forests based on axis-aligned splits, such as robustness to many noise dimensions, interpretability, or computational efficiency. We introduce yet another decision forest, called \u201cSparse Projection Oblique Randomer Forests\u201d (SPORF). SPORF trees recursively split along very sparse random projections. Our method significantly improves accuracy over existing state-of-the-art algorithms on a standard benchmark suite for classification with $>100$ problems of varying dimension, sample size, and number of classes. To illustrate how SPORF addresses the limitations of both axis-aligned and existing oblique decision forest methods, we conduct extensive simulated experiments. SPORF typically yields improved performance over existing decision forest methods, while mitigating computational efficiency and scalability and maintaining interpretability. Very sparse random projections can be incorporated into gradient boosted trees to obtain potentially similar gains."}}
