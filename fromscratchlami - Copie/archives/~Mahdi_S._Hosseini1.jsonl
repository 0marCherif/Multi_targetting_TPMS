With this question in mind, we propose new explainability metrics that measure the redundant information in a network's layers using a low-rank factorization framework and quantify a complexity measure that is highly correlated with the generalization performance of a given optimizer, network, and dataset.

Many CPath workflows involve transferring learned knowledge between various image domains through transfer learning.

In this paper, we take a data-centric approach to the transfer learning problem and examine the existence of generalizable knowledge between histopathological datasets. First, we create a standardization workflow for aggregating existing histopathological data. We then measure inter-domain knowledge by training ResNet18 models across multiple histopathological datasets, and cross-transferring between them to determine the quantity and quality of innate shared knowledge. Additionally, we use weight distillation to share knowledge between models without additional training. We find that hard to learn, multi-class datasets benefit most from pretraining, and a two stage learning framework incorporating a large source domain such as ImageNet allows for better utilization of smaller datasets. Furthermore, we find that weight distillation enables models trained on purely histopathological features to outperform models using external natural image data."}}

When using DL, the limited dimensionality of ALL databases favors the use of transfer learning techniques to increase the accuracy in the detection, by considering Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) pretrained on the general purpose ImageNet database. However, no method in the literature has yet considered the use of CNNs pretrained on histopathology databases to perform transfer learning for ALL detection. In fact, the majority of histopathology databases in the literature has either a small number of samples or limited ground truth labeling possibilities (e.g., only two possible classes), which hinders the effectiveness of training CNNs from scratch. In this paper, we propose the first method based on histopathological transfer learning for ALL detection, that trains a CNN on a histopathology database to classify tissue types, then performs a fine tuning on the ALL database to detect the presence of lymphoblasts. As histopathology database, we consider a multi-label dataset with a significantly higher number of samples and classes with respect to the literature, which enables CNNs to learn general features for histopathology image processing and hence allow to perform a more effective transfer learning, with respect to CNNs pretrained on ImageNet. We evaluate the methodology on a publicly-available ALL database and considering multiple CNNs, with results confirming the validity of our approach."}}

We quantify how this surface behaves as a surrogate to model performance and can be solved using a trust-region search algorithm, which we call autoHyper.

It's becoming incredibly vital we, as a society, address the climate crisis as a universal effort, including those in the Computer Vision (CV) community. In this work, we analyze the total cost of CO2 emissions by breaking it into (1) the architecture creation cost and (2) the life-time evaluation cost. We show that over time, these costs are non-negligible and are having a direct impact on our future. Importantly, we conduct an ethical analysis of how the CV-community is unintentionally overlooking its own ethical AI principles by emitting this level of CO2. To address these concerns, we propose adding \"enforcement\" as a pillar of ethical AI and provide some recommendations for how architecture designers and broader CV community can curb the climate crisis."}}
