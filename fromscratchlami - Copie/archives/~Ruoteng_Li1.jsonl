In heavy rain, streaks are strongly visible, dense rain accumulation or rain veiling effect significantly washes out the image, further scenes are relatively more blurry, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address these problems. We put forth a 2-stage network: a physics-based backbone followed by a depth-guided GAN refinement. The first stage estimates the rain streaks, the transmission, and the atmospheric light governed by the underlying physics. To tease out these components more reliably, a guided filtering framework is used to decompose the image into its low- and high-frequency components. This filtering is guided by a rain-free residue image --- its content is used to set the passbands for the two channels in a spatially-variant manner so that the background details do not get mixed up with the rain-streaks. For the second stage, the refinement stage, we put forth a depth-guided GAN to recover the background details failed to be retrieved by the first stage, as well as correcting artefacts introduced by that stage. We have evaluated our method against state of the art methods. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms them on real rain image data, recovering visually clean images with good details."}}

To resolve the problem, we introduce a residue channel, a single channel (gray) image that is free from rain, and its colored version, a colored-residue image. We propose to utilize these two rain-free images in computing optical flow. To deal with the loss of contrast and the attendant sensitivity to noise, we decompose each of the input images into a piecewise-smooth structure layer and a high-frequency fine-detail texture layer. We combine the colored-residue images and structure layers in a unified objective function, so that the estimation of optical flow can be more robust. Results on both synthetic and real images show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods on different types of rain sequences. To our knowledge, this is the first optical flow method specifically dealing with rain. We also provide an optical flow dataset consisting of both synthetic and real rain images."}}
