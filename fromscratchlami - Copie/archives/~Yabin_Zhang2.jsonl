In this work, we focus on stylizing photorealistic appearance renderings of a given surface mesh of arbitrary topology. Motivated by the recent surge of cross-modal supervision of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, we propose TANGO, which transfers the appearance style of a given 3D shape according to a text prompt in a photorealistic manner. Technically, we propose to disentangle the appearance style as the spatially varying bidirectional reflectance distribution function, the local geometric variation, and the lighting condition, which are jointly optimized, via supervision of the CLIP loss, by a spherical Gaussians based differentiable renderer. As such, TANGO enables photorealistic 3D style transfer by automatically predicting reflectance effects even for bare, low-quality meshes, without training on a task-specific dataset. Extensive experiments show that TANGO outperforms existing methods of text-driven 3D style transfer in terms of photorealistic quality, consistency of 3D geometry, and robustness when stylizing low-quality meshes.

With the assumption of Gaussian feature distribution, conventional feature distribution matching methods usually match the mean and standard deviation of features. However, the feature distributions of real-world data are usually much more complicated than Gaussian, which cannot be accurately matched by using only the first-order and second-order statistics, while it is computationally prohibitive to use high-order statistics for distribution matching. In this work, we, for the first time to our best knowledge, propose to perform Exact Feature Distribution Matching (EFDM) by exactly matching the empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions (eCDFs) of image features, which could be implemented by applying the Exact Histogram Matching (EHM) in the image feature space. Particularly, a fast EHM algorithm, named Sort-Matching, is employed to perform EFDM in a plug-and-play manner with minimal cost. The effectiveness of our proposed EFDM method is verified on a variety of AST and DG tasks, demonstrating new state-of-the-art results. Codes are available at https://github.com/YBZh/EFDM."}}

Multi-Class Scoring Disagreement (MCSD) divergence is presented by aggregating the absolute margin violations in multi-class classification, and this proposed MCSD is able to fully characterize the relations between any pair of multi-class scoring hypotheses. By using MCSD as a measure of domain distance, we develop a new domain adaptation bound for multi-class UDA; its data-dependent, probably approximately correct bound is also developed that naturally suggests adversarial learning objectives to align conditional feature distributions across source and target domains. Consequently, an algorithmic framework of Multi-class Domain-adversarial learning Networks (McDalNets) is developed, and its different instantiations via surrogate learning objectives either coincide with or resemble a few recently popular methods, thus (partially) underscoring their practical effectiveness. Based on our identical theory for multi-class UDA, we also introduce a new algorithm of Domain-Symmetric Networks (SymmNets), which is featured by a novel adversarial strategy of domain confusion and discrimination. SymmNets affords simple extensions that work equally well under the problem settings of either closed set, partial, or open set UDA. We conduct careful empirical studies to compare different algorithms of McDalNets and our newly introduced SymmNets. Experiments verify our theoretical analysis and show the efficacy of our proposed SymmNets. In addition, we have made our implementation code publicly available."}}

However, they tend to overlook the very domain-shift nature of UDA. In this work, we take a step further to study the proper extensions of SSL techniques for UDA. Taking the algorithm of label propagation (LP) as an example, we analyze the challenges of adopting LP to UDA and theoretically analyze the conditions of affinity graph/matrix construction in order to achieve better propagation of true labels to unlabeled instances. Our analysis suggests a new algorithm of Label Propagation with Augmented Anchors (A $$^2$$ LP), which could potentially improve LP via generation of unlabeled virtual instances (i.e., the augmented anchors) with high-confidence label predictions. To make the proposed A $$^2$$ LP useful for UDA, we propose empirical schemes to generate such virtual instances. The proposed schemes also tackle the domain-shift challenge of UDA by alternating between pseudo labeling via A $$^2$$ LP and domain-invariant feature learning. Experiments show that such a simple SSL extension improves over representative UDA methods of domain-invariant feature learning, and could empower two state-of-the-art methods on benchmark UDA datasets. Our results show the value of further investigation on SSL techniques for UDA problems."}}

Impressive progress is made recently by learning invariant features via domain-adversarial training of deep networks. In spite of the recent progress, domain adaptation is still limited in achieving the invariance of feature distributions at a finer category level. To this end, we propose in this paper a new domain adaptation method called Domain-Symmetric Networks (SymNets). The proposed SymNet is based on a symmetric design of source and target task classifiers, based on which we also construct an additional classifier that shares with them its layer neurons. To train the SymNet, we propose a novel adversarial learning objective whose key design is based on a two-level domain confusion scheme, where the category-level confusion loss improves over the domain-level one by driving the learning of intermediate network features to be invariant at the corresponding categories of the two domains. Both domain discrimination and domain confusion are implemented based on the constructed additional classifier. Since target samples are unlabeled, we also propose a scheme of cross-domain training to help learn the target classifier. Careful ablation studies show the efficacy of our proposed method. In particular, based on commonly used base networks, our SymNets achieve the new state of the art on three benchmark domain adaptation datasets."}}
