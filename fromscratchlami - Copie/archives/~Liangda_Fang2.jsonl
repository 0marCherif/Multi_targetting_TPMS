This has also led to an increasing number of vehicle vulnerabilities and many safety issues. Therefore, it is particularly important to identify high-risk vehicle intelligent connected systems, because it can inform security personnel which systems are most vulnerable to attacks, allowing them to conduct more thorough inspections and tests. In this paper, we develop a new model for vehicle risk assessment by combining I-FAHP with FCA clustering: VSRQ model. We extract important indicators related to vehicle safety, use fuzzy cluster analys (FCA) combined with fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to mine the vulnerable components of the vehicle intelligent connected system, and conduct priority testing on vulnerable components to reduce risks and ensure vehicle safety. We evaluate the model on OpenPilot and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the VSRQ model in identifying the safety of vehicle intelligent connected systems. The experiment fully complies with ISO 26262 and ISO/SAE 21434 standards, and our model has a higher accuracy rate than other models. These results provide a promising new research direction for predicting the security risks of vehicle intelligent connected systems and provide typical application tasks for VSRQ. The experimental results show that the accuracy rate is 94.36%, and the recall rate is 73.43%, which is at least 14.63% higher than all other known indicators."}}

The modern KT models have two problems. One is that these KT models can't reflect students' actual knowledge level. Most KT models only judge students' knowledge state based on their performance in exercises, and poor performance will lead to a decline in knowledge state. However, the essence of students' learning process is the process of acquiring knowledge, which is also a manifestation of learning behavior. Even if they answer the exercises incorrectly, they will still gain knowledge. The other problem is that many KT models don't pay enough attention to the impact of students' forgetting behavior on the knowledge state in the learning process. In fact, learning and forgetting behavior run through students' learning process, and their effects on students' knowledge state shouldn't be ignored. In this paper, based on educational psychology theory, we propose a knowledge tracing model with learning and forgetting behavior (LFBKT). LFBKT comprehensively considers the factors that affect learning and forgetting behavior to build the knowledge acquisition layer, knowledge absorption layer and knowledge forgetting layer. In addition, LFBKT introduces difficulty information to enrich the information of the exercise itself, while taking into account other answering performances besides the answer. Experimental results on two public datasets show that LFBKT can better trace students' knowledge state and outperforms existing models in terms of ACC and AUC."}}

In this work, we propose a new mask-based adversarial defense scheme (MAD) for DNNs to mitigate the negative effect from adversarial attacks. Our method preprocesses multiple copies of a potential adversarial image by applying random masking, before the outputs of the DNN on all the randomly masked images are combined. As a result, the combined final output becomes more tolerant to minor perturbations on the original input. Compared with existing adversarial defense techniques, our method does not need any additional denoising structure or any change to a DNN\u2019s architectural design. We have tested this approach on a collection of DNN models for a variety of datasets, and the experimental results confirm that the proposed method can effectively improve the defense abilities of the DNNs against all of the tested adversarial attack methods. In certain scenarios, the DNN models trained with MAD can improve classification accuracy by as much as 90% compared to the original models when given adversarial inputs."}}

Interestingly, the notion of logical separability, proposed by Levesque, offers a general explanation for the tractability of clausal entailment for two remarkable languages: decomposable negation normal form and prime implicates. It is interesting to explore what role logical separability on earth plays in problem tractability. In this paper, we apply the notion of logical separability in three reasoning problems within the context of propositional logic: satisfiability check (CO), clausal entailment check (CE) and model counting (CT), contributing to three corresponding polytime procedures. We provide three logical separability based properties: CO- logical separability, CE-logical separability and CT-logical separability. We then identify three novel normal forms: CO-LSNNF, CE-LSNNF and CT-LSNNF based on the above properties. Besides, we show that every normal form is the necessary and sufficient condition under which the corresponding procedure is correct. We finally integrate the above four normal forms into the knowledge compilation map."}}

Existing cognitive diagnosis methods only consider which of knowledge concepts are involved in the knowledge components of exercises, but ignore the fact that different knowledge concepts have different effects on practice scores in actual learning situations. Therefore, researchers need to reshape the learning scene by combining the multi-factor relationships between knowledge components. In this paper, in order to more comprehensively simulate the interaction between students and exercises, we developed a neural network-based CDMFKC model for cognitive diagnosis. Our method not only captures the nonlinear interaction between exercise characteristics, student performance, and their mastery of each knowledge concept, but also further considers the impact of knowledge concepts by designing the difficulty and discrimination of knowledge concepts, and uses multiple neural layers to model their interaction so as to obtain accurate and interpretable diagnostic results. In addition, we propose an improved CDMFKC model with guessing parameter and slipping parameter designed by knowledge concept proficiency and student proficiency vectors. We validate the performance of these two diagnostic models on six real datasets. The experimental results show that the two models have better effects in the aspects of accuracy, rationality and interpretability."}}

The representative framework of classical planning is based on propositional logic. Due to the weak expressiveness of propositional logic, many applications of interest cannot be formalized as a classical planning problem. Some extensions such as numeric planning and generalized planning (GP) are therefore proposed. Qualitative numeric planning (QNP) is a decidable class of numeric and generalized extensions and serves as a numeric abstraction of GP. However, QNP is still far from being perfect and needs further improvement. In this paper, we introduce another generalized version of numeric planning, namely generalized linear integer numeric planning(GLINP), which is a more suitable abstract framework of GP than QNP. In addition, we develop a general framework to synthesize solutions to GLINP problems. Finally, we evaluate our approach on a number of benchmarks, and experimental results justify the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed approach."}}
