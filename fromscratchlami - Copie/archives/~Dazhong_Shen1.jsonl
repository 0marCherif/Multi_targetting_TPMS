As a result, both of the generative story and the topic formulation have totally ignored the semantic dependency among words, which is important for improving the semantic comprehension and model interpretability. To this end, in this paper, we revisit the task of topic modeling by transforming each document into a directed graph with word dependency as edges between word nodes, and develop a novel approach, namely Graph Neural Topic Model (GNTM). Specifically, in GNTM, a well-defined probabilistic generative story is designed to model both the graph structure and word sets with multinomial distributions on the vocabulary and word dependency edge set as the topics. Meanwhile, a Neural Variational Inference (NVI) approach is proposed to learn our model with graph neural networks to encode the document graphs. Besides, we theoretically demonstrate that Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can be derived from GNTM as a special case with similar objective functions. Finally, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness and interpretability of GNTM compared with state-of-the-art baselines."}}

While substantial efforts have been made on improving the job interview process, it is inevitable to have biased or inconsistent interview assessment due to the subjective nature of the traditional interview process. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to intelligent job interview assessment by learning the large-scale real-world interview data. Specifically, we develop a latent variable model named Joint Learning Model on Interview Assessment (JLMIA) to jointly model job description, candidate resume and interview assessment. JLMIA can effectively learn the representative perspectives of different job interview processes from the successful job application records in history. Therefore, a variety of applications in job interviews can be enabled, such as person-job fit and interview question recommendation. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world data clearly validate the effectiveness of JLMIA, which can lead to substantially less bias in job interviews and provide a valuable understanding of job interview assessment."}}
