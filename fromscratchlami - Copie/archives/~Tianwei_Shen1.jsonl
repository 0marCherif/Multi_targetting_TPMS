In this paper, we narrow down this gap by presenting an efficient CNN-based method to retrieve images with overlaps, which we refer to as the matchable image retrieval problem. Different from previous methods that generates training data based on sparse reconstruction, we create a large-scale image database with rich 3D geometrics and exploit information from surface reconstruction to obtain fine-grained training data. We propose a batched triplet-based loss function combined with mesh re-projection to effectively learn the CNN representation. The proposed method significantly accelerates the image retrieval process in 3D reconstruction and outperforms the \u2026"}}

In particular, we propose an adversarial learning framework for training visual descriptors that prevent image reconstruction, while maintaining the matching accuracy. We let a feature encoding network and image reconstruction network compete with each other, such that the feature encoder tries to impede the image reconstruction with its generated descriptors, while the reconstructor tries to recover the input image from the descriptors. The experimental results demonstrate that the visual descriptors obtained with our method significantly deteriorate the image reconstruction quality with minimal impact on correspondence matching and camera localization performance.\n"}}

The texture map encodes the parameterization from 3D to 2D domain, rendering not only RGB values but also rasterized geometric features if necessary. Since the parameterization of texture map is not pre-determined, and depends on the surface topologies, we therefore introduce a novel cross-atlas convolution to recover the original mesh geodesic neighborhood, so as to achieve the invariance property to arbitrary parameterization. The proposed module is integrated into classification and segmentation architectures, which takes the input texture map of a mesh, and infers the output predictions. Our method not only shows competitive performances on classification and segmentation public benchmarks, but also paves the way for the broad mesh surfaces learning."}}

In this paper, we go beyond the local detail representation by introducing context awareness to augment off-the-shelf local feature descriptors. Specifically, we propose a unified learning framework that leverages and aggregates the cross-modality contextual information, including (i) visual context from high-level image representation, and (ii) geometric context from 2D keypoint distribution. Moreover, we propose an effective N-pair loss that eschews the empirical hyper-parameter search and improves the convergence. The proposed augmentation scheme is lightweight compared with the raw local feature description, meanwhile improves remarkably on several large-scale benchmarks with diversified scenes, which demonstrates both strong practicality and generalization ability in geometric matching applications."}}

However, one major limitation of current learned MVS approaches is the scalability: the memory-consuming cost volume regularization makes the learned MVS hard to be applied to high-resolution scenes. In this paper, we introduce a scalable multi-view stereo framework based on the recurrent neural network. Instead of regularizing the entire 3D cost volume in one go, the proposed Recurrent Multi-view Stereo Network (R-MVSNet) sequentially regularizes the 2D cost maps along the depth direction via the gated recurrent unit (GRU). This reduces dramatically the memory consumption and makes high-resolution reconstruction feasible. We first show the state-of-the-art performance achieved by the proposed R-MVSNet on the recent MVS benchmarks. Then, we further demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method on several large-scale scenarios, where previous learned approaches often fail due to the memory constraint. Code is available at https://github.com/YoYo000/MVSNet."}}

This work proposes a divide-and-conquer framework to solve very large global SfM at the scale of millions of images. Specifically, we first divide all images into multiple partitions that preserve strong data association for well posed and parallel local motion averaging. Then, we solve a global motion averaging that determines cameras at partition boundaries and a similarity transformation per partition to register all cameras in a single coordinate frame. Finally, local and global motion averaging are iterated until convergence. Since local camera poses are fixed during the global motion average, we can avoid caching the whole reconstruction in memory at once. This distributed framework significantly enhances the efficiency and robustness of large-scale motion averaging."}}

We refer to the proposed descriptor as GeoDesc, and demonstrate its superior performance on various large-scale benchmarks, and in particular show its great success on challenging reconstruction tasks. Moreover, we provide guidelines towards practical integration of learned descriptors in Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, showing the good trade-off that GeoDesc delivers to 3D reconstruction tasks between accuracy and efficiency."}}

The correspondence problem is generally addressed by the design of discriminative 3D local descriptors on the one hand, and the development of robust matching strategies on the other hand. In this work, we first propose a multi-view local descriptor, which is learned from the images of multiple views, for the description of 3D keypoints. Then, we develop a robust matching approach, aiming at rejecting outlier matches based on the efficient inference via belief propagation on the defined graphical model. We have demonstrated the boost of our approaches to registration on the public scanning and multi-view stereo datasets. The superior performance has been verified by the intensive comparisons against a variety of descriptors and matching methods."}}

In this paper, we propose a scale-invariant image matching approach to tackling the very large scale variation of views. Drawing inspiration from the scale space theory, we start with encoding the image's scale space into a compact multi-scale representation. Then, rather than trying to find the exact feature matches all in one step, we propose a progressive two-stage approach. First, we determine the related scale levels in scale space, enclosing the inlier feature correspondences, based on an optimal and exhaustive matching in a limited scale space. Second, we produce both the image similarity measurement and feature correspondences simultaneously after restricting matching between the related scale levels in a robust way. The matching performance has been intensively evaluated on vision tasks including image retrieval, feature matching and Structurefrom- Motion (SfM). The successful integration of the challenging fusion of high aerial and low ground-level views with significant scale differences manifests the superiority of the proposed approach."}}

Insufficient match pairs may result in disconnected structures or incomplete components, while costly redundant pairs containing erroneous ones may lead to folded and superimposed structures. This paper presents a graph-based image matching method that tackles the issues of completeness, efficiency and consistency in a unified framework. Our approach starts by chaining all but singleton images using a visual-similarity-based minimum spanning tree. Then the minimum spanning tree is incrementally expanded to form locally consistent strong triplets. Finally, a global community-based graph algorithm is introduced to strengthen the global consistency by reinforcing potentially large connected components. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method in terms of accuracy and efficiency on both benchmark and Internet datasets. Our method also performs remarkably well on the challenging datasets of highly ambiguous and duplicated scenes."}}
