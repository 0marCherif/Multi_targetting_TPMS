However, efficiently serving LLMs has been a challenge due to its large memory bottleneck, specifically in small batch inference settings (e.g. mobile devices). Weight-only quantization can be a promising approach, but sub-4 bit quantization remains a challenge due to large-magnitude activation outliers. To mitigate the undesirable outlier effect, we first propose per-IC quantization, a simple yet effective method that creates quantization groups within each input channel (IC) rather than the conventional per-output channel (OC). Our method is motivated by the observation that activation outliers affect the input dimension of the weight matrix, so similarly grouping the weights in the IC direction can isolate outliers to be within a group. We also find that activation outliers do not dictate quantization difficulty, and inherent weight sensitivities also exist. With per-IC quantization as a new outlier-friendly scheme, we then propose Adaptive Dimensions (AdaDim), a versatile quantization framework that can adapt to various weight sensitivity patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaDim by augmenting prior methods such as Round-To-Nearest and GPTQ, showing significant improvements across various language modeling benchmarks for both base (up to +4.7% on MMLU) and instruction-tuned (up to +10% on HumanEval) LLMs."}}

Recent works such as quantization have attempted to replace the FP matrix multiplication (MatMul) of DNNs with simple integer MatMul by transforming the datatypes of both weights and activations into integers. Unfortunately, unlike weight values that are static, it is challenging to represent dynamic activations with integers. In this paper, to simultaneously achieve the accuracy of FP activation and the simplicity of integer arithmetic, we present a method for replacing FP arithmetic with integer one without changing FP activations in the storage format while weights are quantized. The proposed method pre-aligns the significands of FP activations just ahead of the MatMul on-the-fly so that the aligned significands (integers) can be used for the computation. Inspired by an observation that conventional FP arithmetic does not produce precise results due to rounding, we demonstrate that our proposed integer arithmetic-based scheme can produce the same level of errors as that of the FP arithmetic in case DNNs use FP activations and quantized weights. Experimental results show that the hardware based on the proposed scheme shows significant improvement over FP arithmetic-based designs in terms of energy efficiency and throughput-per-area while maintaining a similar level of accuracy."}}

However, accelerating the model itself and achieving better inference efficiency through model compression has not been thoroughly explored yet. Model compression could provide the benefits of reducing memory footprints, enabling low-precision computations, and ultimately achieving cost-effective inference. To combine parameter-efficient adaptation and model compression, we propose AlphaTuning consisting of post-training quantization of the pre-trained language model and fine-tuning only some parts of quantized parameters for a target task. Specifically, AlphaTuning works by employing binary-coding quantization, which factorizes the full-precision parameters into binary parameters and a separate set of scaling factors. During the adaptation phase, the binary values are frozen for all tasks, while the scaling factors are fine-tuned for the downstream task. We demonstrate that AlphaTuning, when applied to GPT-2 and OPT, performs competitively with full fine-tuning on a variety of downstream tasks while achieving >10x compression ratio under 4-bit quantization and >1,000x reduction in the number of trainable parameters."}}

However, powerful NLP models necessitate increasing model size, leading to substantial computational and memory requirements. In this paper, we introduce an efficient inference framework tailored for large-scale generative language models. To reduce the model size, we employ a weight-only quantization strategy while preserving full precision for activations. As a result, we attain sub-4-bit quantization for each weight through non-uniform or uniform quantization techniques. Our proposed kernel, called LUT-GEMM, then accelerates quantized matrix multiplications, offering a flexible balance between compression ratio and accuracy. Unlike earlier matrix multiplication kernels that accommodated weight-only quantization, LUT-GEMM efficiently eliminates the resource-demanding dequantization process for both uniform and non-uniform quantization methods. By reducing the latency of individual GPUs and the overall inference process for large-scale language models, LUT-GEMM provides significant performance improvements in inference. The impact of LUT-GEMM is facilitated by implementing high compression ratios through low-bit quantization and efficient LUT-based operations, which decreases the number of required GPUs. For the OPT-175B model with 3-bit quantization, we show that LUT-GEMM accelerates the latency for generating each token by 2.1x compared to OPTQ, which requires costly dequantization. Consequently, LUT-GEMM enables inference of the OPT-175B model on a single GPU without noticeable degradation in accuracy or performance, while the non-quantized OPT-175B model requires a minimum of 8 GPUs."}}

As a result, most previous ones rely on the quantization error minimization and/or quadratic approximations. Such approaches are computationally efficient and reasonable when a large number of quantization bits are employed.

In this paper, we propose a new post-training uniform quantization technique considering non-convexity. We empirically show that hyper-parameters for clipping and rounding of weights and activations can be explored by monitoring task loss. Then, an optimally searched set of hyper-parameters is frozen to proceed to the next layer such that an incremental non-convex optimization is enabled for post-training quantization.

For various regularization techniques, such as weight decay and dropout, optimizing the regularization strength is crucial to improve generalization in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). While model compression also demands the right amount of regularization, the regularization strength incurred by model compression has been controlled only by compression ratio. Throughout various experiments, we show that regularization frequency critically affects the regularization strength of model compression. Combining regularization frequency and compression ratio, the amount of weight updates by model compression per mini-batch can be optimized to achieve the best model accuracy. Modulating regularization frequency is implemented by occasional model compression while conventional compression-aware training is usually performed for every mini-batch."}}
