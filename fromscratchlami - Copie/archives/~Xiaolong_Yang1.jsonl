First, we introduce a two-stream architecture consisting of segmentation and regression streams. The segmentation stream processes the spatial embedding features and obtains the corresponding image crop. These features are further coupled with the image crop in the fusion network. Second, we use an efficient perspective-n-point (E-PnP) algorithm in the regression stream to extract robust spatial features between 3D and 2D keypoints. Finally, we perform iterative refinement with an end-to-end mechanism to improve the estimation performance. We conduct experiments on two public datasets of YCB-Video and the challenging Occluded-LineMOD. The results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both the speed and the accuracy."}}

First, we use a two-stream network to extract robust 3D-to-2D embedding feature correspondence. The segmentation stream processes the RGB information and spatial features individually. Then, we construct another fusion network to couple color and positional features, and predict the locations of keypoints in the regression stream. The pose can be obtained by an efficient RANSAC-based PnP algorithm. Moreover, we design an end-to-end iterative pose refinement procedure that further improves the reliable pose estimation. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in two public datasets."}}
