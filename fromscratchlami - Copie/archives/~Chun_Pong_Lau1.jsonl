We present a supervised contrastive learning framework to learn a feature embedding robust to changes in viewpoint, by effectively leveraging multi-view data. We use an improved supervised contrastive loss and augment the positives with those coming from synchronized viewpoints. We also propose a new approach to use classifier probabilities to guide the selection of hard negatives in the contrastive loss, to learn a more discriminative representation. Negative samples from confusing classes based on posterior are weighted higher. We also show that our method leads to better domain generalization compared to the standard supervised training based on synthetic multi-view data. Extensive experiments on real (NTU-60, NTU-120, NUMA) and synthetic (RoCoG) data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}}

Adversarial patch attacks, which are easy to implement in the physical world, pose a serious threat to state-of-the-art object detectors. Developing reliable defenses for object detectors against patch attacks is critical but severely understudied. In this paper, we propose Segment and Complete defense (SAC), a general framework for defending object detectors against patch attacks through detection and removal of adversarial patches. We first train a patch segmenter that outputs patch masks which provide pixel-level localization of adversarial patches. We then propose a self adversarial training algorithm to robustify the patch segmenter. In addition, we design a robust shape completion algorithm, which is guaranteed to remove the entire patch from the images if the outputs of the patch segmenter are within a certain Hamming distance of the ground-truth patch masks. Our experiments on COCO and xView datasets demonstrate that SAC achieves superior robustness even under strong adaptive attacks with no reduction in performance on clean images, and generalizes well to unseen patch shapes, attack budgets, and unseen attack methods. Furthermore, we present the APRICOT-Mask dataset, which augments the APRICOT dataset with pixel-level annotations of adversarial patches. We show SAC can significantly reduce the targeted attack success rate of physical patch attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/joellliu/SegmentAndComplete."}}

To mitigate the degradation due to turbulence which includes deformation and blur, we propose a generative single frame restoration algorithm which disentangles the blur and deformation due to turbulence and reconstructs a restored image. The disentanglement is achieved by decomposing the distortion due to turbulence into blur and deformation components using a deblur generator and a deformation correction generator, respectively. Two paths of restoration are implemented to regularize the disentanglement and generate two restored images from a given degraded image. A fusion function combines the features of the restored images to reconstruct a sharp image with rich details. Adversarial and perceptual losses are added to reconstruct a sharp image and suppress the artifacts respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed restoration algorithm, which achieves satisfactory performance for face restoration and face recognition tasks."}}

However, models trained with AT sacrifice standard accuracy and do not generalize well to novel attacks. Recent works show generalization improvement with adversarial samples under novel threat models such as on-manifold threat model or neural perceptual threat model. However, the former requires exact manifold information while the latter requires algorithm relaxation. Motivated by these considerations, we exploit the underlying manifold information with Normalizing Flow, ensuring that exact manifold assumption holds. Moreover, we propose a novel threat model called Joint Space Threat Model (JSTM), which can serve as a special case of the neural perceptual threat model that does not require additional relaxation to craft the corresponding adversarial attacks. Under JSTM, we develop novel adversarial attacks and defenses. The mixup strategy improves the standard accuracy of neural networks but sacrifices robustness when combined with AT. To tackle this issue, we propose the Robust Mixup strategy in which we maximize the adversity of the interpolated images and gain robustness and prevent overfitting. Our experiments show that Interpolated Joint Space Adversarial Training (IJSAT) achieves good performance in standard accuracy, robustness, and generalization in CIFAR-10/100, OM-ImageNet, and CIFAR-10-C datasets. IJSAT is also flexible and can be used as a data augmentation method to improve standard accuracy and combine with many existing AT approaches to improve robustness."}}

In many cases, multiple algorithms target the same tasks and even enforce the same constraints. In this work, we show that different attack algorithms produce adversarial examples which are distinct not only in their effectiveness but also in how they qualitatively affect their victims. We begin by demonstrating that one can determine the attack algorithm that crafted an adversarial example. Then, we leverage recent advances in parameter-space saliency maps to show, both visually and quantitatively, that adversarial attack algorithms differ in which parts of the network and image they target. Our findings suggest that prospective adversarial attacks should be compared not only via their success rates at fooling models but also via deeper downstream effects they have on victims."}}
