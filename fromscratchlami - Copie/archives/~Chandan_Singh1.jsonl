In this work, we explore whether we can leverage this learned ability to find and explain patterns in data. Specifically, given a pre-trained LLM and data examples, we introduce interpretable autoprompting (iPrompt), an algorithm that generates a natural-language string explaining the data. iPrompt iteratively alternates between generating explanations with an LLM and reranking them based on their performance when used as a prompt. Experiments on a wide range of datasets, from synthetic mathematics to natural-language understanding, show that iPrompt can yield meaningful insights by accurately finding groundtruth dataset descriptions. Moreover, the prompts produced by iPrompt are simultaneously human-interpretable and highly effective for generalization: on real-world sentiment classification datasets, iPrompt produces prompts that match or even improve upon human-written prompts for GPT-3. Finally, experiments with an fMRI dataset show the potential for iPrompt to aid in scientific discovery."}}

In contrast, generalized additive models (GAMs) can maintain interpretability, but often suffer from poor prediction performance due to their inability to effectively capture feature interactions. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by using pre-trained large-language models to extract embeddings for each input before learning a linear model in the embedding space. The final model (which we call Emb-GAM) is a transparent, linear function of its input features and feature interactions.\nLeveraging the language model allows Emb-GAM to learn far fewer linear coefficients, model larger interactions, and generalize well to novel inputs (e.g. unseen ngrams in text). Across a variety of natural-language-processing datasets, Emb-GAM achieves strong prediction performance without sacrificing interpretability. All code for using Emb-GAM and reproducing our results is made available on github."}}

Here, we propose Fast Interpretable Greedy-Tree Sums (FIGS), an algorithm for fitting concise rule-based models. Specifically, FIGS generalizes the CART algorithm to simultaneously grow a flexible number of trees in a summation. The total number of splits across all the trees can be restricted by a pre-specified threshold, thereby keeping both the size and number of its trees under control. When both are small, the fitted tree-sum can be easily visualized and written out by hand, making it highly interpretable. A partially oracle theoretical result hints at the potential for FIGS to overcome a key weakness of single-tree models by disentangling additive components of generative additive models, thereby reducing redundancy from repeated splits on the same feature. Furthermore, given oracle access to optimal tree structures, we obtain L2 generalization bounds for such generative models in the case of C1 component functions, matching known minimax rates in some cases. Extensive experiments across a wide array of real-world datasets show that FIGS achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance (among all popular rule-based methods) when restricted to just a few splits (e.g. less than 20). We find empirically that FIGS is able to avoid repeated splits, and often provides more concise decision rules than fitted decision trees, without sacrificing predictive performance.

To address these challenges, we propose an instance-weighted tree-sum method that effectively pools data across diverse groups to output a concise, rule-based model. Given distinct groups of instances in a dataset (e.g., medical patients grouped by age or treatment site), our method first estimates group membership probabilities for each instance. Then, it uses these estimates as instance weights in FIGS (Tan et al. 2022), to grow a set of decision trees whose values sum to the final prediction. We call this new method Group Probability-Weighted Tree Sums (G-FIGS). G-FIGS achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance on important clinical datasets; e.g., holding the level of sensitivity fixed at 92%, G-FIGS increases specificity for identifying cervical spine injury by up to 10% over CART and up to 3% over FIGS alone, with larger gains at higher sensitivity levels. By keeping the total number of rules below 16 in FIGS, the final models remain interpretable, and we find that their rules match medical domain expertise. All code, data, and models are released on Github."}}

To mitigate overfitting, trees are typically regularized by a variety of techniques that modify their structure (e.g. pruning). We introduce Hierarchical Shrinkage (HS), a post-hoc algorithm that does not modify the tree structure, and instead regularizes the tree by shrinking the prediction over each node towards the sample means of its ancestors. The amount of shrinkage is controlled by a single regularization parameter and the number of data points in each ancestor. Since HS is a post-hoc method, it is extremely fast, compatible with any tree growing algorithm, and can be used synergistically with other regularization techniques. Extensive experiments over a wide variety of real-world datasets show that HS substantially increases the predictive performance of decision trees, even when used in conjunction with other regularization techniques. Moreover, we find that applying HS to each tree in an RF often improves accuracy, as well as its interpretability by simplifying and stabilizing its decision boundaries and SHAP values. We further explain the success of HS in improving prediction performance by showing its equivalence to ridge regression on a (supervised) basis constructed of decision stumps associated with the internal nodes of a tree.

This chapter covers recent work aiming to interpret models by attributing importance to features and feature groups for a single prediction. Importantly, the proposed attributions assign importance to interactions between features, in addition to features in isolation. These attributions are shown to yield insights across real-world domains, including bio-imaging, cosmology image and natural-language processing. We then show how these attributions can be used to directly improve the generalization of a neural network or to distill it into a simple model. Throughout the chapter, we emphasize the use of reality checks to scrutinize the proposed interpretation techniques."}}
