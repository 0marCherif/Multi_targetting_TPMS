Specifically, we consider certain classes of copulas known as Archimedean and hierarchical Archimedean copulas, popular for their parsimonious representation and ability to model different tail dependencies. We consider their representation as mixture models with Laplace transforms of latent random variables from generative neural networks. This alternative representation allows for computational efficiencies and easy sampling, especially in high dimensions. We describe multiple methods for optimizing the network parameters. Finally, we present empirical results that demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method in learning multidimensional CDFs and its computational efficiency compared to existing methods."}}

We propose a point process construction that describes arrival time observations in terms of the state of a latent diffusion process. In this framework, we relate the return time of diffusion in a continuous path space to new arrivals of the point process. These models arise in many disciplines, such as financial settings where actions in a market are determined by a hidden continuous price or in neuroscience where a latent stimulus generates spike trains. Based on the developments in It\\^o's excursion theory, we describe computational methods for inferring and sampling from the point process derived from the diffusion process.  We provide numerical examples for the proposed method using both simulated and real data to illustrate the approach. The proposed methods and framework provide a basis for interpreting point processes through the lens of a diffusion. \n"}}

Archimax copulas are a family of distributions endowed with a precise representation that allows simultaneous modeling of the bulk and the tails of a distribution. Rather than separating the two as is typically done in practice, incorporating additional information from the bulk may improve inference of the tails, where observations are limited. Building on the stochastic representation of Archimax copulas, we develop a non-parametric inference method and sampling algorithm. Our proposed methods, to the best of our knowledge, are the first that allow for highly flexible and scalable inference and sampling algorithms, enabling the increased use of Archimax copulas in practical settings. We experimentally compare to state-of-the-art density modeling techniques, and the results suggest that the proposed method effectively extrapolates to the tails while scaling to higher dimensional data. Our findings suggest that the proposed algorithms can be used in a variety of applications where understanding the interplay between the bulk and the tails of a distribution is necessary, such as healthcare and safety."}}

MEVs arise from Extreme Value Theory (EVT) as the necessary class of models when extrapolating a distributional fit over large spatial and temporal scales based on data observed in intermediate scales. In turn, EVT dictates that $d$-max-decreasing, a stronger form of convexity, is an essential shape constraint in the characterization of MEVs. As far as we know, our proposed architecture provides the first class of non-parametric estimators for MEVs which preserve these essential shape constraints. We show that our architecture approximates the dependence structure encoded by MEVs at parametric rate. Moreover, we present a new method for sampling high-dimensional MEVs using a generative model. We demonstrate our methodology on a wide range of experimental settings, ranging from environmental sciences to financial mathematics and verify the structural properties of MEVs are retained compared to existing methods.\n"}}
