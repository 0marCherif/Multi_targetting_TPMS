Previous methods are mainly based on the contrastive learning paradigm, which optimize either in image level or pixel level. Imagelevel optimization (e.g., the spatially pooled feature of ResNet) learns robust high-level semantics but is sub-optimal since the pixel-level features are optimized implicitly. By contrast, pixel-level optimization is more explicit, however, it is sensitive to the visual quality of training data and is not robust to object deformation. To complementarily perform these two levels of optimization in a unified framework, we propose the In-aNd-Out (INO) generative learning from a purely generative perspective with the help of naturally designed class tokens and patch tokens in Vision Transformer (ViT). Specifically, for image-level optimization, we force the out-view imagination from local to global views on class tokens, which helps capture high-level semantics, and we name it as out-generative learning. As to pixel-level optimization, we perform in-view masked image modeling on patch tokens, which recovers the corrupted parts of an image via inferring its fine-grained structure, and we term it as in-generative learning. To discover the temporal information better, we additionally force the inter-frame consistency from both feature and affinity matrix levels. Extensive experiments on DAVIS-2017 val and YouTube-VOS 2018 val show that our INO outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by significant margins."}}

We find the relation between different joints is important with two-fold impact: 1) on the one hand, some relation is consistent across all the species and may help two joints mutually confirm each other, e.g., the eyes help confirm the nose and vice versa because they are close in all species. 2) on the other hand, some relation is inconsistent for different species due to the species variation and may bring severe distraction rather than benefit. With these two insights, we propose a Decompose-to-Generalize (D-Gen) pose estimation method to break the inconsistent relations while preserving the consistent ones. Specifically, D-Gen first decomposes the body joints into several joint concepts so that each concept contains multiple closely-related joints. Given these joint concepts, D-Gen 1) promotes the interaction between intra-concept joints to enhance their reliable mutual confirmation, and 2) suppresses the interaction between inter-concept joints to prohibit their mutual distraction.  Importantly, we explore various decomposition approaches, i.e., heuristic, geometric and attention-based approaches. Experimental results show that all these decomposition manners yield reasonable joint concepts and substantially improve cross-species generalization (and the attention-based approach is the best).

Based on vision transformers, the recently-developed Associating Objects with Transformers (AOT) approach introduces hierarchical propagation into VOS and has shown promising results. The hierarchical propagation can gradually propagate information from past frames to the current frame and transfer the current frame feature from object-agnostic to object-specific. However, the increase of object-specific information will inevitably lead to the loss of object-agnostic visual information in deep propagation layers. To solve such a problem and further facilitate the learning of visual embeddings, this paper proposes a Decoupling Features in Hierarchical Propagation (DeAOT) approach. Firstly, DeAOT decouples the hierarchical propagation of object-agnostic and object-specific embeddings by handling them in two independent branches. Secondly, to compensate for the additional computation from dual-branch propagation, we propose an efficient module for constructing hierarchical propagation, i.e., Gated Propagation Module, which is carefully designed with single-head attention. Extensive experiments show that DeAOT significantly outperforms AOT in both accuracy and efficiency. On YouTube-VOS, DeAOT can achieve 86.0% at 22.4fps and 82.0% at 53.4fps. Without test-time augmentations, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, i.e., YouTube-VOS (86.2%), DAVIS 2017 (86.2%), DAVIS 2016 (92.9%), and VOT 2020 (0.622 EAO).

Unlike previous practices that focus on exploring the embedding learning of foreground object (s), we consider background should be equally treated. Thus, we propose a Collaborative video object segmentation by Foreground-Background Integration (CFBI) approach. CFBI separates the feature embedding into the foreground object region and its corresponding background region, implicitly promoting them to be more contrastive and improving the segmentation results accordingly. Moreover, CFBI performs both pixel-level matching processes and instance-level attention mechanisms between the reference and the predicted sequence, making CFBI robust to various object scales. Based on CFBI, we introduce a multi-scale matching structure and propose an Atrous Matching strategy, resulting in a more robust and efficient framework, CFBI+. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks, i.e., DAVIS and YouTube-VOS. Without applying any simulated data for pre-training, our CFBI+ achieves the performance ( <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {J}$</tex-math></inline-formula> & <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {F}$</tex-math></inline-formula> ) of 82.9 and 82.8 percent, outperforming all the other state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, for the vision models, we use a two-stage training pipeline which first learns from the coarse labels provided in the training set and then conducts fine-grained self-supervised training, yielding a coarse-to-fine metric learning manner. For the vision-language models, we use the textual description of the training image as the supervision signals for fine-tuning the image-encoder (feature extractor).

How to align the source and target domains is critical to the CDWSOD accuracy. Existing methods usually focus on partial detection components for domain alignment. In contrast, this paper considers that all the detection components are important and proposes a Holistic and Hier-archical Feature Alignment (H <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> FA) R-CNN. H2FA R-CNN enforces two image-level alignments for the backbone features, as well as two instance-level alignments for the RPN and detection head. This coarse-to-fine aligning hierarchy is in pace with the detection pipeline, i.e., processing the image-level feature and the instance-level features from bottom to top. Importantly, we devise a novel hybrid supervision method for learning two instance-level align-ments. It enables the RPN and detection head to simultane-ously receive weak/full supervision from the target/source domains. Combining all these feature alignments, H2 FA R-CNN effectively mitigates the gap between the source and target domains.
