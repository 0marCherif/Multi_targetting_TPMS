Despite recent advances in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on modeling spatial layout patterns of documents, they have limited ability to capture reading orders of given word-level node representations in a graph. We propose Reading Order Equivariant Positional Encoding (ROPE), a new positional encoding technique designed to apprehend the sequential presentation of words in documents. ROPE generates unique reading order codes for neighboring words relative to the target word given a word-level graph connectivity. We study two fundamental document entity extraction tasks including word labeling and word grouping on the public FUNSD dataset and a large-scale payment dataset. We show that ROPE consistently improves existing GCNs with a margin up to 8.4% F1-score."}}

Thus far, the literature has focused on abstracting features from such graphs, while the learning of the affinities themselves has been overlooked. Here we propose a principled method to directly supervise the learning of weights in affinity graphs, to exploit meaningful connections between entities in the data source. Applied to a visual attention network, our affinity supervision improves relationship recovery between objects, even without the use of manually annotated relationship labels. We further show that affinity learning between objects boosts scene categorization performance and that the supervision of affinity can also be applied to graphs built from mini-batches, for neural network training. In an image classification task we demonstrate consistent improvement over the baseline, with diverse network architectures and datasets."}}

However, their application to object recognition and detection thus far has focused largely on appearance images as inputs. Motivated by demonstrations that depth can enhance the performance of CNN-based approaches, we consider the benefits of adding differential geometric shape features in a principled manner. This elementary idea of using zeroth order (depth), first-order (surface normal) and second-order (surface curvature) features boosts the performance of a CNN that has been pretrained on a color image database. In an object detection task involving 19 categories we improve on the current state-of-the-art detection accuracy on the NYUv2 dataset of 35.6% by Gupta et al. by 10.4% to a new result of 39.3%. Our results provide strong evidence that the abstraction of surface shape benefits object detection and recognition."}}

The state-of-the-art methods now achieve over 90% correct category level recognition performance on appearance images. We improve upon these methods by introducing a view clustering and pooling layer based on dominant sets. The key idea is to pool information from views which are similar and thus belong to the same cluster. The pooled feature vectors are then fed as inputs to the same layer, in a recurrent fashion. This recurrent clustering and pooling module, when inserted in an off-the-shelf pretrained CNN, boosts performance for multi-view 3D object recognition, achieving a new state of the art test set recognition accuracy of 93.8% on the ModelNet 40 database. We also explore a fast approximate learning strategy for our cluster-pooling CNN, which, while sacrificing end-to-end learning, greatly improves its training efficiency with only a slight reduction of recognition accuracy to 93.3%. Our implementation is available at this https URL."}}

Thus far, however, point features have been abstracted in an independent and isolated manner, ignoring the relative layout of neighboring points as well as their features. In the present article, we propose to overcome this limitation by using spectral graph convolution on a local graph, combined with a novel graph pooling strategy. In our approach, graph convolution is carried out on a nearest neighbor graph constructed from a point's neighborhood, such that features are jointly learned. We replace the standard max pooling step with a recursive clustering and pooling strategy, devised to aggregate information from within clusters of nodes that are close to one another in their spectral coordinates, leading to richer overall feature descriptors. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets, we show a consistent demonstrable advantage for the tasks of both point set classification and segmentation."}}

Such elements could be regions in an image output by a region proposal network, or words in a sentence, represented by word embedding. Thus far the learning of attention weights has been driven solely by the minimization of task specific loss functions. We introduce a method for learning attention weights to better emphasize informative pair-wise relations between entities. The key component is a novel center-mass cross entropy loss, which can be applied in conjunction with the task specific ones. We further introduce a focused attention backbone to learn these attention weights for general tasks. We demonstrate that the focused supervision leads to improved attention distribution across meaningful entities, and that it enhances the representation by aggregating features from them. Our focused attention module leads to state-of-the-art recovery of relations in a relationship proposal task and boosts performance for various vision and language tasks."}}
