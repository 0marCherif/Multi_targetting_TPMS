We present a simple yet effective method that exploits (i) point clustering in near-range areas where the point clouds are dense, (ii) temporal consistency to filter out noisy unsupervised detections, (iii) translation equivariance of CNNs to extend the auto-labels to long range, and (iv) self-supervision for improving on its own. Our approach, OYSTER (Object Discovery via Spatio-Temporal Refinement), does not impose constraints on data collection (such as repeated traversals of the same location), is able to detect objects in a zero-shot manner without supervised finetuning (even in sparse, distant regions), and continues to self-improve given more rounds of iterative self-training. To better measure model performance in self-driving scenarios, we propose a new planning-centric perception metric based on distance-to-collision. We demonstrate that our unsupervised object detector significantly outperforms unsupervised baselines on PandaSet and Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset, showing promise that self-supervision combined with object priors can enable object discovery in the wild.

Unfortunately, dense LiDARs are very expensive and the point clouds captured by low-beam LiDAR are often sparse. To address these issues, we present UltraLiDAR, a data-driven framework for scene-level LiDAR completion, LiDAR generation, and LiDAR manipulation. The crux of UltraLiDAR is a compact, discrete representation that encodes the point cloud\u2019s geometric structure, is robust to noise, and is easy to manipulate. We show that by aligning the representation of a sparse point cloud to that of a dense point cloud, we can densify the sparse point clouds as if they were captured by a real high-density LiDAR, drastically reducing the cost. Furthermore, by learning a prior over the discrete codebook, we can generate diverse, realistic LiDAR\npoint clouds for self-driving. We evaluate the effectiveness of UltraLiDAR on sparse-to-dense LiDAR completion and LiDAR generation. Experiments show that densifying real-world point clouds with our approach can significantly improve the performance of downstream perception systems. Compared to prior art on LiDAR generation, our approach generates much more realistic point clouds. According to A/B test, over 98.5% of the time human participants prefer our results over those of previous methods."}}

The industry typically relies on closed-loop simulation to evaluate how the SDV interacts on a corpus of synthetic and real scenarios and to verify good performance. However, they primarily only test the motion planning module of the system, and only consider behavior variations. It is key to evaluate the full autonomy system in closed-loop, and to understand how variations in sensor data based on scene appearance, such as the shape of actors, affect system performance. In this paper, we propose a framework, Adv3D, that takes real world scenarios and performs closed-loop sensor simulation to evaluate autonomy performance, and finds vehicle shapes that make the scenario more challenging, resulting in autonomy failures and uncomfortable SDV maneuvers. Unlike prior work that add contrived adversarial shapes to vehicle roof-tops or roadside to harm perception performance, we optimize a low-dimensional shape representation to modify the vehicle shape itself in a realistic manner to degrade full autonomy performance (e.g., perception, prediction, motion planning). Moreover, we find that the shape variations found with Adv3D optimized in closed-loop are much more effective than open-loop, demonstrating the importance of finding and testing scene appearance variations that affect full autonomy performance."}}

A promising alternative is to leverage \u201cauto-labelling\u201d offboard perception models that are trained to automatically generate annotations from raw LiDAR point clouds at a fraction of the cost. Auto-labels are most commonly generated via a two-stage approach \u2013 first objects are detected and tracked over time, and then each object trajectory is passed to a learned refinement model to improve accuracy. Since existing refinement models are overly complex and lack advanced temporal reasoning capabilities, in this work we propose LabelFormer, a simple, efficient, and effective trajectory-level refinement approach. Our approach first encodes each frame\u2019s observations separately, then exploits self-attention to reason about the trajectory with full temporal context, and finally decodes the re\ufb01ned object size and per-frame poses. Evaluation on both urban and highway datasets demonstrates that LabelFormer outperforms existing works by a large margin. Finally, we show that training on a dataset augmented with auto-labels generated by our method leads to improved downstream detection performance compared to existing methods.

Our contributions are two-fold. First, we advocate for predicting both the individual motions as well as the scene occupancy map in order to effectively deal with missing detections caused by postprocessing, e.g., confidence thresholding and non-maximum suppression. Second, we propose a Scene-Actor Graph Neural Network (SA-GNN) which preserves the relative spatial information of pedestrians via 2D convolution, and captures the interactions among pedestrians within the same scene, including those that have not been detected, via message passing. On two large-scale real-world datasets, nuScenes and ATG4D, we showcase that our scene-occupancy predictions are more accurate and better calibrated than those from state-of-the-art motion forecasting methods, while also matching their performance in pedestrian motion forecasting metrics."}}

Instead of learning view-invariant representation from simple images, humans learn representations in a complex world with changing scenes by observing object movement, deformation, pose variation, and ego motion. Motivated by this ability, we present a new self-supervised learning representation framework that can be directly deployed on a video stream of complex scenes with many moving objects. Our framework features a simple flow equivariance objective that encourages the network to predict the features of another frame by applying a flow transformation to the features of the current frame. Our representations, learned from high-resolution raw video, can be readily used for downstream tasks on static images. Readout experiments on challenging semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection benchmarks show that we are able to outperform representations obtained from previous state-of-the-art methods including SimCLR and BYOL."}}

To achieve a good trade-off between model size and performance, popular pruning techniques usually rely on hand-crafted heuristics and require manually setting the compression ratio for each layer. This process is typically time-consuming and requires expert knowledge to achieve good results. In this paper, we propose NAP, a unified and automatic pruning framework for both fine-grained and structured pruning. It can find out unimportant components of a network and automatically decide appropriate compression ratios for different layers, based on a theoretically sound criterion. Towards this goal, NAP uses an efficient approximation of the Hessian for evaluating the importances of components, based on a Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature method. Despite its simpleness to use, NAP outperforms previous pruning methods by large margins. For fine-grained pruning, NAP can compress AlexNet and VGG16 by 25x, and ResNet-50 by 6.7x without loss in accuracy on ImageNet. For structured pruning (e.g. channel pruning), it can reduce flops of VGG16 by 5.4x and ResNet-50 by 2.3x with only 1% accuracy drop. More importantly, this method is almost free from hyper-parameter tuning and requires no expert knowledge. You can start NAP and then take a nap!"}}

However, these online HPO algorithms still require running evaluation on a set of validation examples at each training step, steeply increasing the training cost. To decide when to query the validation loss, we model online HPO as a time-varying Bayesian optimization problem, on top of which we propose a novel \\textit{costly feedback} setting to capture the concept of the query cost. Under this setting, standard algorithms are cost-inefficient as they evaluate on the validation set at every round. In contrast, the cost-efficient GP-UCB algorithm proposed in this paper queries the unknown function only when the model is less confident about current decisions. We evaluate our proposed algorithm by tuning hyperparameters online for VGG and ResNet on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet100. Our proposed online HPO algorithm reaches human expert-level performance within a single run of the experiment, while incurring only modest computational overhead compared to regular training."}}

Different from previous methods, we address the problem of learning 3D complete shape from unaligned and real-world partial point clouds. To this end, we propose a weakly-supervised method to estimate both 3D canonical shape and 6-DoF pose for alignment, given multiple partial observations associated with the same instance. The network jointly optimizes canonical shapes and poses with multi-view geometry constraints during training, and can infer the complete shape given a single partial point cloud. Moreover, learned pose estimation can facilitate partial point cloud registration. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that it is feasible and promising to learn 3D shape completion through large-scale data without shape and pose supervision."}}

Recent advances in unsupervised contrastive representation learning invite the question of whether a learning algorithm can also be made local, that is, the updates of lower layers do not directly depend on the computation of upper layers. While Greedy InfoMax separately learns each block with a local objective, we found that it consistently hurts readout accuracy in state-of-the-art unsupervised contrastive learning algorithms, possibly due to the greedy objective as well as gradient isolation. In this work, we discover that by overlapping local blocks stacking on top of each other, we effectively increase the decoder depth and allow upper blocks to implicitly send feedbacks to lower blocks. This simple design closes the performance gap between local learning and end-to-end contrastive learning algorithms for the first time. Aside from standard ImageNet experiments, we also show results on complex downstream tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation directly using readout features."}}
