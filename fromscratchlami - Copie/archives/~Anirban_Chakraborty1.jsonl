However, hand-drawn crude sketches alone can be ambiguous for object localization, which could result in misidentification, e.g., a sketch of a laptop could be confused for a sofa. To overcome this, we propose a novel multimodal approach to object localization that combines sketch queries with linguistic category definitions, allowing for a better representation of visual and semantic cues. Our approach employs a cross-modal attention scheme that guides the region proposal network to obtain relevant proposals. Further, we propose an orthogonal projection-based proposal scoring technique that effectively ranks proposals with respect to the query. We evaluated our method using hand-drawn sketches from the \u2018Quick, Draw!\u2019 dataset and glosses from \u2018WordNet\u2019 as queries on the widely-used MS-COCO dataset, and achieve superior performance compared to related baselines in both open- and closed-set settings."}}

Existing works use this technique to provably secure a pretrained non-robust model by training a custom denoiser network on entire training data. However, access to the training set may be restricted to a handful of data samples due to constraints such as high transmission cost and the proprietary nature of the data. Thus, we formulate a novel problem of \"how to certify the robustness of pretrained models using only a few training samples\". We observe that training the custom denoiser directly using the existing techniques on limited samples yields poor certification.

In practice, there can often be substantial heterogeneity (e.g., class imbalance) across the local data distributions observed by each of these clients. Under such non-iid data distributions across clients, FL suffers from the 'client-drift' problem where every client converges to its own local optimum. This results in slower convergence and poor performance of the aggregated model. To address this limitation, we propose a novel regularization technique based on adaptive self-distillation (ASD) for training models on the client side. Our regularization scheme adaptively adjusts to the client's training data based on: (1) the closeness of the local model's predictions with that of the global model and (2) the client's label distribution. The proposed regularization can be easily integrated atop existing, state-of-the-art FL algorithms leading to a further boost in the performance of these off-the-shelf methods. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed FL approach through extensive experiments on multiple real-world benchmarks (including datasets with common corruptions and perturbations) and show substantial gains in performance over the state-of-the-art methods."}}

This problem proves difficult due to the abstract nature of hand-drawn sketches, variations in the style and quality of sketches, and the large domain gap existing between the sketches and the natural images. To mitigate these challenges, existing works proposed attention-based frameworks to incorporate query information into the image features. However, in these works, the query features are incorporated after the image features have already been independently learned, leading to inadequate alignment. In contrast, we propose a sketch-guided vision transformer encoder that uses cross-attention after each block of the transformer-based image encoder to learn query-conditioned image features leading to stronger alignment with the query sketch. Further, at the output of the decoder, the object and the sketch features are refined to bring the representation of relevant objects closer to the sketch query and thereby improve the localization. The proposed model also generalizes to the object categories not seen during training, as the target image features learned by our method are query-aware. Our localization framework can also utilize multiple sketch queries via a trainable novel sketch fusion strategy. The model is evaluated on the images from the public object detection benchmark, namely MS-COCO, using the sketch queries from QuickDraw! and Sketchy datasets. Compared with existing localization methods, the proposed approach gives a $6.6\\%$ and $8.0\\%$ improvement in mAP for seen objects using sketch queries from QuickDraw! and Sketchy datasets, respectively, and a $12.2\\%$ improvement in AP@50 for large objects that are `unseen' during training."}}

The main motive of this work is to solve for Single and Multi target Domain Adaptation (SMTDA) for the source-free paradigm, which enforces a constraint where the labeled source data is not available during target adaptation due to various privacy-related restrictions on data sharing. The source-free approach leverages target pseudo labels, which can be noisy, to improve the target adaptation. We introduce consistency between label preserving augmentations and utilize pseudo label refinement methods to reduce noisy pseudo labels. Further, we propose novel MixUp Knowledge Distillation (MKD) for better generalization on multiple target domains using various source-free STDA models. We also show that the Vision Transformer (VT) backbone gives better feature representation with improved domain transferability and class discriminability. Our proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various paradigms of source-free STDA and MTDA settings on popular domain adaptation datasets like Office-Home, Office-Caltech, and DomainNet.

Most of the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) algorithms focus on reducing the global domain shift between labelled source and unlabelled target domains by matching the marginal distributions under a small domain gap assumption. UDA performance degrades for the cases where the domain gap between source and target distribution is large. In order to bring the source and the target domains closer, we propose a novel approach based on traditional image processing technique Class Aware Frequency Transformation (CAFT) that utilizes pseudo label based class consistent low-frequency swapping for improving the overall performance of the existing UDA algorithms. The proposed approach, when compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning based methods, is computationally more efficient and can easily be plugged into any existing UDA algorithm to improve its performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach based on absolute difference of top-2 class prediction probabilities for filtering target pseudo labels into clean and noisy sets. Samples with clean pseudo labels can be used to improve the performance of unsupervised learning algorithms. We name the overall framework as CAFT++. We evaluate the same on the top of different UDA algorithms across many public domain adaptation datasets. Our extensive experiments indicate that CAFT++ is able to achieve significant performance gains across all the popular benchmarks."}}

A typical natural scene contains several objects, often exhibiting visual relationships of varied complexities between them. These inter-object relationships provide strong contextual cues towards improving grounding performance compared to a traditional object query-only-based localization task. A scene graph is an efficient and structured way to represent all the objects and their semantic relationships in the image. In an attempt towards bridging these two modalities representing scenes and utilizing contextual information for improving object localization, we rigorously study the problem of grounding scene graphs on natural images. To this end, we propose a novel graph neural network-based approach referred to as Visio-Lingual Message Passing Graph Neural Network (VL-MPAG Net). In VL-MPAG Net, we first construct a directed graph with object proposals as nodes and an edge between a pair of nodes representing a plausible relation between them. Then a three-step inter-graph and intra-graph message passing is performed to learn the context- dependent representation of the proposals and query objects. These object representations are used to score the proposals to generate object localization. The proposed method significantly outperforms the baselines on four public datasets."}}

A plethora of works based on adversarial training and regularization-based techniques have been proposed to make these deep networks robust against adversarial attacks. However, these methods require either retraining models or training them from scratch, making them infeasible to defend pre-trained models when access to training data is restricted. To address this problem, we propose a test time Data-free Adversarial Defense (DAD) containing detection and correction frameworks. Moreover, to further improve the efficacy of the correction framework in cases when the detector is under-confident, we propose a soft-detection scheme (dubbed as \"DAD++\"). We conduct a wide range of experiments and ablations on several datasets and network architectures to show the efficacy of our proposed approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach in imparting adversarial defense at test time under data-free (or data-efficient) applications/setups, such as Data-free Knowledge Distillation and Source-free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, as well as Semi-supervised classification frameworks. We observe that in all the experiments and applications, our DAD++ gives an impressive performance against various adversarial attacks with a minimal drop in clean accuracy.

To encounter them, the model requires training data for adversarial training or explicit regularization-based techniques. However, privacy has become an important concern, restricting access to only trained models but not the training data (e.g. biometric data). Also, data curation is expensive and companies may have proprietary rights over it. To handle such situations, we propose a completely novel problem of \u2018test-time adversarial defense in absence of training data and even their statistics\u2019. We solve it in two stages: a) detection and b) correction of adversarial samples. Our adversarial sample detection framework is initially trained on arbitrary data and is subsequently adapted to the unlabelled test data through unsupervised domain adaptation. We further correct the predictions on detected adversarial samples by transforming them in Fourier domain and obtaining their low frequency component at our proposed suitable radius for model prediction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed technique via extensive experiments against several adversarial attacks and for different model architectures and datasets. For a non-robust Resnet-18 model pretrained on CIFAR-10, our detection method correctly identifies 91.42% adversaries.
