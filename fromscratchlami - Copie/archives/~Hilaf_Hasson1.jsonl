Quantifying Uncertainty in Model Explanations", "abstract": "Even when a black-box model makes accurate predictions (e.g., whether it will rain tomorrow), it is difficult to extract principles from the model that improve human understanding (e.g., what set of atmospheric conditions best predict rainfall). Model explanations via explainability methods (e.g., LIME, Shapley values) can help by highlighting interpretable aspects of the model, such the data features to which the model is most sensitive. However, these methods can be unstable and inconsistent, which often ends up providing unreliable insights. Moreover, under the existence of many near-optimal models, there is no guarantee that explanations for a single model will agree with explanations from the true model that generated the data. In this work, instead of explaining a single best-fitting model, we develop principled methods to construct an uncertainty set for the ``true explanation'': the explanation from the (unknown) true model that generated the data. We show finite-sample guarantees that the uncertainty set we return includes the explanation for the true model with high probability. We show through synthetic experiments that our uncertainty sets have high fidelity to the explanations of the true model. We then report our findings on real-world data. \n"}}

Our studies discover a new attack pattern that negatively impact the forecasting of a target time series via making strategic, sparse (imperceptible) modifications to the past observations of a small number of other time series. To mitigate the impact of such attack, we have developed two defense strategies. First, we extend a previously developed randomized smoothing technique in classification to multivariate forecasting scenarios. Second, we develop an adversarial training algorithm that learns to create adversarial examples and at the same time optimizes the forecasting model to improve its robustness against such adversarial simulation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our attack schemes are powerful and our defense algorithms are more effective compared with baseline defense mechanisms.\n"}}

However, the only ensembling strategies that have been considered for time series forecasting in the past have been static methods, ones that have access to the predictions of the base learners but not to the base learners themselves. In this paper, we propose a novel  \\textit{dynamic ensemble policy}, which, unlike static methods, uses the power of the ensemble to improve each of the base learners being ensembled by reducing the error accumulation of each base learner via consecutively feeding an ensembled sample to each base learner. To do so, we adopt a deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework with a Markov Decision Process (MDP) designed where the ensemble agent interacts with our environment (\\textit{TS-GYM}) from offline data. The output of our ensemble strategy is a single autoregressive forecaster that supports several desirable properties of uncertainty quantification and sample path, along with notable performance gain. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated in multiple synthetic and real-world experiments."}}

This has resulted in a need for forecasting techniques that effectively leverage all available data by learning across all time series in each panel. Among the desirable properties of forecasting techniques, being able to generate probabilistic predictions ranks among the top. In this paper, we therefore present Level Set Forecaster (LSF), a simple yet effective general approach to transform a point estimator into a probabilistic one. By recognizing the connection of our algorithm to random forests (RFs) and quantile regression forests (QRFs), we are able to prove consistency guarantees of our approach under mild assumptions on the underlying point estimator. As a byproduct, we prove the first consistency results for QRFs under the CART-splitting criterion. Empirical experiments show that our approach, equipped with tree-based models as the point estimator, rivals state-of-the-art deep learning models in terms of forecasting accuracy."}}

To this extent, we present a novel approach reconciling classical state space models with deep learning methods. By augmenting state space models with normalizing flows, we mitigate imprecisions stemming from idealized assumptions in state space models. The resulting model is highly flexible while still retaining many of the attractive properties of state space models, e.g., uncertainty and observation errors are properly accounted for, inference is tractable, sampling is efficient, good generalization performance is observed, even in low data regimes. We demonstrate competitiveness against state-of-the-art deep learning methods on the tasks of forecasting real world data and handling varying levels of missing data."}}
