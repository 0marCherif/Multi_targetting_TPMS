This paper introduces a new method to identify such samples and mitigate their impact when training neural networks. At the heart of our algorithm is the Area Under the Margin (AUM) statistic, which exploits differences in the training dynamics of clean and mislabeled samples. A simple procedure - adding an extra class populated with purposefully mislabeled threshold samples - learns a AUM upper bound that isolates mislabeled data. This approach consistently improves upon prior work on synthetic and real-world datasets. On the WebVision50 classification task our method removes 17% of training data, yielding a 1.6% (absolute) improvement in test error. On CIFAR100 removing 13% of the data leads to a 1.2% drop in error."}}

This work studies the problem of selecting the best examples given a candidate pool to improve ICL performance on given a test input. Existing approaches either require training with feedback from a much larger LLM or are computationally expensive. We propose a novel metric, GistScore, based on Example Gisting, a novel approach for training example retrievers for ICL using an attention bottleneck via Gisting, a recent technique for compressing task instructions. To tradeoff performance with ease of use, we experiment with both fine-tuning gist models on each dataset and multi-task training a single model on a large collection of datasets. On 21 diverse datasets spanning 9 tasks, we show that our fine-tuned models get state-of-the-art ICL performance with 20% absolute average gain over off-the-shelf retrievers and 7% over the best prior methods. Our multi-task model generalizes well out-of-the-box to new task categories, datasets, and prompt templates with retrieval speeds that are consistently thousands of times faster than the best prior training-free method."}}

In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a characterization of submodular minimax optimization, the problem of finding a set (for either the min or the max player) that is effective against every possible response. We show when and under what conditions we can find such sets. We also demonstrate how minimax submodular optimization provides robust solutions for downstream machine learning applications such as (i) efficient prompt engineering for question answering, (ii) prompt engineering for dialog state tracking, (iii) identifying robust waiting locations for ride-sharing, (iv) ride-share difficulty kernelization, and (v) finding adversarial images. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithms consistently outperform other baselines."}}

In this paper, we propose the novel problem of multi-step workflow action prediction, in which the system predicts multiple future workflow actions. Accurate prediction of multiple steps allows for multi-turn automation, which can free up time to focus on more complex tasks. We propose three modeling approaches that are simple to implement yet lead to more action automation: 1) fine-tuning on a training dataset, 2) few-shot in-context learning leveraging retrieval and large language model prompting, and 3) zero-shot graph traversal, which aggregates historical action sequences into a graph for prediction. We show that multi-step action prediction produces features that improve accuracy on downstream dialogue tasks like predicting task success, and can increase automation of steps by 20% without requiring as much feedback from a human overseeing the system."}}

We focus on the underexplored problem of estimating clustering quality with limited labels.

However, we find that their estimation  can be biased and only relies on the labeled data. To that end, we introduce CEREAL, a comprehensive framework for few-sample clustering evaluation that extends active sampling approaches in three key ways. First, we propose novel NMI-based acquisition functions that account for the distinctive properties of clustering and uncertainties from a learned surrogate model. Next, we use ideas from semi-supervised learning and train the surrogate model with both the labeled and unlabeled data. Finally, we pseudo-label the unlabeled data with the surrogate model. We run experiments to estimate NMI in an active sampling pipeline on three datasets across vision and language. Our results show that CEREAL reduces the area under the absolute error curve by up to 57% compared to the best sampling baseline. We perform an extensive ablation study to show that our framework is agnostic to the choice of clustering algorithm and evaluation metric. We also extend CEREAL from clusterwise annotations to pairwise annotations. Overall, CEREAL can efficiently evaluate clustering with limited human annotations. "}}
