A multitude of heuristics exist for link prediction in ordinary networks with a single type of connection. However, link prediction in multiplex networks, or networks with multiple types of connections, is not a well understood problem. We propose a novel general framework and three families of heuristics for multiplex network link prediction that are simple, interpretable, and take advantage of the rich connection type correlation structure that exists in many real world networks. We further derive a theoretical threshold for determining when to use a different connection type based on the number of links that overlap with an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graph. Through experiments with simulated and real world scientific collaboration, transportation and global trade networks, we demonstrate that the proposed heuristics show increased performance with the richness of connection type correlation structure and significantly outperform their baseline heuristics for ordinary networks with a single connection type."}}

We propose a Bayesian consensus estimator that adjusts for miscalibration and noise and show that this estimator is unbiased and asymptotically more efficient than naive alternatives. We further propose a Hierarchical Bayesian Model that leverages our proposed estimator and apply it to two real world forecasting challenges that require consensus estimates from error prone individual estimates: forecasting influenza like illness (ILI) weekly percentages and forecasting annual earnings of public companies. We demonstrate that our approach is effective at mitigating bias and error and results in more accurate forecasts than existing consensus models."}}

However, its original extension to the multivariate case required enumerating all possible DAGs, and for some special distributions, e.g. linear Gaussian, the model is invertible and thus cannot be used for structure learning. We present a new approach which combines a PC style search using recent advances in kernel measures of conditional dependence with local searches for additive noise models in substructures of the equivalence class. This results in a more computationally efficient approach that is useful for arbitrary distributions even when additive noise models are invertible. Experiments with synthetic and real data show that this method is more accurate than previous methods when data are nonlinear and/or non-Gaussian."}}

In contexts such as fMRI analysis, data may consist of an ensemble of independent samples from a common data generating mechanism which may not have identical distributions. Pooling such data can result in a number of well known statistical problems so each sample must be analyzed individually, which offers no increase in power due to the presence of multiple samples. We show how existing constraint based methods can be modified to learn structure from the aggregate of such data in a statistically sound manner. The prescribed method is simple to implement and based on existing statistical methods employed in metaanalysis and other areas, but works surprisingly well in this context where there are increased concerns due to issues such as retesting. We report results for directed models, but the method given is just as applicable to undirected models."}}

There are several asymptotically correct, informative algorithms that search for causal information given a single dataset, even with missing values and hidden variables. There are, however, no such reliable procedures for distributed data with overlapping variables, and only a single heuristic procedure (Structural EM). This paper describes an asymptotically correct procedure, ION, that provides all the information about structure obtainable from the marginal independence relations. Using simulated and real data, the accuracy of ION is compared with that of Structural EM, and with inference on complete, unified data."}}
