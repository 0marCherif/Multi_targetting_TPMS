However, federated learning systems struggle to achieve trustworthiness and embody responsible AI principles. In particular, federated learning systems face accountability and fairness challenges due to multistakeholder involvement and heterogeneity in client data distribution. To enhance the accountability and fairness of federated learning systems, we present a blockchain-based trustworthy federated learning architecture. We first design a smart contract-based data-model provenance registry to enable accountability. Additionally, we propose a weighted fair data sampler algorithm to enhance fairness in training data. We evaluate the proposed approach using a COVID-19 X-ray detection use case. The evaluation results show that the approach is feasible to enable accountability and improve fairness. The proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than the default federated learning setting in terms of the model\u2019s generalization and accuracy."}}

While one can attribute its current prominence to blockchain and cryptocurrency, the distributed trust concept has been cultivating progress in federated learning, trustworthy and responsible AI in an ecosystem setting, data sharing, privacy issues across organizational boundaries, and zero trust cybersecurity. This paper will survey the concept of distributed trust in multiple disciplines. It will take a system/software architecture point of view to look at trust redistribution/shift and the associated tradeoffs in systems and applications enabled by distributed trust technologies."}}

However, existing approaches are rule-based and sequence-labeling based. They must manually enumerate the rules or label data for a wide range of sentence patterns, which involves a significant amount of labor overhead and is exacerbated by morphological and common-word ambiguity. In contrast to matching or labeling API entities and relations, this paper formulates heterogeneous API extraction and API relation extraction task as a sequence-to-sequence generation task, and proposes AERJE, an API entity-relation joint extraction model based on the large pre-trained language model. After training on a small number of ambiguous but correctly labeled data, AERJE builds a multi-task architecture that extracts API entities and relations from unstructured text using dynamic prompts. We systematically evaluate AERJE on a set of long and ambiguous sentences from Stack Overflow. The experimental results show that AERJE achieves high accuracy and discrimination ability in API entity-relation joint extraction, even with zero or few-shot fine-tuning."}}

However, many enterprises are restricted from freely sharing data due to regulatory restrictions across different regions, performance issues in moving large volume data, or requirements to maintain autonomy. In such situations, the enterprise can benefit from the concept of federated learning, in which machine learning models are constructed at various geographic sites. In this paper, we introduce a general framework, namely BDSP, to share data among enterprises based on Blockchain and federated learning techniques. Specifically, we propose a transparency contribution accounting mechanism to estimate the valuation of data and implement a proof-of-concept for further evaluation. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed BDSP has a competitive performance with higher training accuracy, an increase of over 5%, and lower communication overhead, reducing 3 times, compared to baseline approaches."}}

However, challenges abound in the sharing of SBOMs, including potential data tampering and hesitation among software vendors to disclose comprehensive information. These obstacles have stifled widespread adoption and utilization of SBOMs, underscoring the need for a more secure and flexible mechanism for SBOM sharing. This study proposes a novel solution to these challenges by introducing a blockchain-empowered architecture for SBOM sharing, leveraging verifiable credentials to allow for selective disclosure. This strategy not only heightens security but also offers flexibility. Furthermore, this paper broadens the remit of SBOM to encompass AI systems, thereby coining the term AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM). This extension is motivated by the rapid progression in AI technology and the escalating necessity to track the lineage and composition of AI software and systems. The evaluation of our solution indicates the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed SBOM sharing mechanism, positing a new solution for securing (AI) software supply chains."}}

Deep Feature Learning and Ensemble Setting to Rescue", "abstract": "To speed up the bug-fixing process, it is essential to triage bugs into the right components as soon as possible. Given the large number of bugs filed everyday, a reliable and effective bug-component triaging tool is needed to assist this task. LR-BKG is the state-of-the-art toolkit for doing this. However, the suboptimal performance for recommending the right component at the first position (low Top-1 accuracy) limits its usage in practice. We thoroughly investigate the limitations of LR-BKG and find out the gap between the manual feature design of LR-BKG and the characteristics of bug reports causes such suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose an approach, DEEPTRIAG, which uses the large scale pre-trained models to extract deep features automatically from bug reports (including bug summary and description), to fill this gap. DEEPTRIAG transforms bug-component triaging into a multi-classification task (CodeBERT-Classifier) and a generation task (CodeT5-Generator). Then, we ensemble the prediction results from them to improve the performance of bug-component triaging further. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of DEEPTRIAG on bug-component triaging over LR-BKG. In particular, the overall Top-1 accuracy is improved from 56.2% to 68.3% on Mozilla dataset and from 51.3% to 64.1% on Eclipse dataset, which verifies the effectiveness and generalization of our approach on improving the practical usage for bug-component triaging."}}

An Empirical Study of GitHub Issues", "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, which benefit from the availability of large-scale datasets and increasing computational power, have become effective solutions to various critical tasks, such as natural language understanding, speech recognition, and image processing. The advancement of these AI systems is inseparable from open-source software (OSS). Specifically, many benchmarks, implementations, and frameworks for constructing AI systems are made open source and accessible to the public, allowing researchers and practitioners to reproduce the reported results and broaden the application of AI systems. The development of AI systems follows a data-driven paradigm and is sensitive to hyperparameter settings and data separation. Developers may encounter unique problems when employing open-source AI repositories.This paper presents an empirical study that investigates the issues in the repositories of open-source AI repositories to assist developers in understanding problems during the process of employing AI systems. We collect 576 repositories from the PapersWithCode platform. Among these repositories, we find 24,953 issues by utilizing GitHub REST APIs. Our empirical study includes three phases. First, we manually analyze these issues to categorize the problems that developers are likely to encounter in open-source AI repositories. Specifically, we provide a taxonomy of 13 categories related to AI systems. The two most common issues are runtime errors (23.18%) and unclear instructions (19.53%). Second, we see that 67.5% of issues are closed. We also find that half of these issues resolve within four days. Moreover, issue management features, e.g., label and assign, are not widely adopted in open-source AI repositories. In particular, only 7.81% and 5.9% of repositories label issues and assign these issues to assignees, respectively. Finally, we empirically show that employing GitHub issue management features and writing issues with detailed descriptions facilitate the resolution of issues. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for developers to help better manage the issues of open-source AI repositories and improve their quality."}}
