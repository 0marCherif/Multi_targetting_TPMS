In many machine learning and computer vision tasks, a critical issue is the similarity between two feature vectors. In this paper, we present a novel technique to measure similarities among feature vectors by decomposing each feature vector as an \u2113 <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>  sparse linear combination of the rest of the feature vectors. The main idea is that the coefficients in such sparse decomposition reflect the features' neighborhood structure, thus providing better similarity measures among the decomposed feature vector and the rest of the feature vectors. The proposed approach is applied to label propagation and action recognition, and is evaluated on several commonly used datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed sparsity-induced similarity measure significantly improves the performance of both label propagation and action recognition."}}

In this paper, we present a novel approach for multi-object categorization within the BoF framework. The approach addresses two issues in BoF related methods simultaneously: how to avoid scene modeling and how to predict labels of an image when multiple categories of objects are co-existing. We employ a biased sampling strategy which combines the bottom-up, biologically inspired saliency information and loose, top-down class prior information for object class modeling. Then this biased sampling component is further integrated with a multi-instance multi-label leaning and classification algorithm. With the proposed biased sampling strategy, we can perform multi-object categorization within an image without semantic segmentation. The experimental results on PASCAL VOC2007 and SUN09 show that the proposed method significantly improves the discriminative ability of BoF methods and achieves good performance in multi-object categorization tasks."}}
