Current imputation methods minimize the error between the unobserved ground truth and the imputed values. We show that this strategy has major drawbacks in the presence of multimodal distributions, and we propose to use a qualitative approach rather than the actual quantitative one. We introduce the kNNxKDE algorithm: a hybrid method using chosen neighbors ($k$NN) for conditional density estimation (KDE) tailored for data imputation. We qualitatively and quantitatively show that our method preserves the original data structure when performing imputation. This work advocates for a careful and reasonable use of statistics and machine learning models by data practitioners."}}

Despite recent successes of deep reinforcement learning (RL) in various decision making problems, an important but under-explored aspect is how to leverage oracle observation (the information that is invisible during online decision making, but is available during offline training) to facilitate learning. For example, human experts will look at the replay after a Poker game, in which they can check the opponents' hands to improve their estimation of the opponents' hands from the visible information during playing. In this work, we study such problems based on Bayesian theory and derive an objective to leverage oracle observation in RL using variational methods. Our key contribution is to propose a general learning framework referred to as variational latent oracle guiding (VLOG) for DRL. VLOG is featured with preferable properties such as its robust and promising performance and its versatility to incorporate with any value-based DRL algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of VLOG in online and offline RL domains with tasks ranging from video games to a challenging tile-based game Mahjong. Furthermore, we publish the Mahjong environment and an offline RL dataset as a benchmark to facilitate future research on oracle guiding (https://github.com/Agony5757/mahjong)."}}

Over the last 70 years, various imputation algorithms for tabular data have been developed and shown useful at estimating missing values. Besides, recent infatuations for Artificial Neural Networks have led to the development of complex and powerful algorithms for data imputation. \nThis study is the first to compare state-of-the-art deep-learning models with the well-established KNN algorithm (1951). By using real-world and generated datasets in various missing data scenarios, we claim that the good old KNN algorithm is still competitive (nay better) than powerful deep-learning algorithms for tabular data imputation.\nThis work advocates for an appropriate and reasonable use of machine learning, in a world where overconsumption, performances and rapidity unfortunately often prevails over sustainability and common sense."}}
