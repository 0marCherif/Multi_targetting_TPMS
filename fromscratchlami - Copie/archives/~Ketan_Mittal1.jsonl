The practical goals are tangential relaxation along initially aligned curved boundaries and internal surfaces, and mesh fitting to initially non-aligned surfaces. The distinct feature of the method is that it utilizes discrete finite element functions (for example level set functions) to define implicit surfaces, which are used to adapt the positions of certain mesh nodes. The algorithm does not require CAD descriptions or analytic parametrizations, and can be beneficial in computations with dynamically changing geometry, for example shape optimization and moving mesh multimaterial simulations. The main advantage of this approach is that it completely avoids geometric operations (e.g., surface projections), and all calculations can be performed through finite element operations."}}

Abstract We develop a multirate timestepper for semi-implicit solutions of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE) based on a recently-developed multidomain spectral element method (SEM) [1]. For incompressible flows, multirate timestepping (MTS) is particularly challenging because of the tight coupling implied by the incompressibility constraint, which manifests as an elliptic subproblem for the pressure at each timestep. The novelty of our approach stems from the development of a stable overlapping Schwarz method applied directly to the Navier-Stokes equations, rather than to the convective, viscous, and pressure substeps that are at the heart of most INSE solvers. Our MTS approach is based on a predictor-corrector (PC) strategy that preserves the temporal convergence of the underlying semi-implicit timestepper. We present numerical results demonstrating that this approach scales to an arbitrary number of overlapping grids, accurately models complex turbulent flow phenomenon, and improves computational efficiency in comparison to singlerate timestepping-based calculations."}}
