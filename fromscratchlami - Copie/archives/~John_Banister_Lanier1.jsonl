In real-world environments, choosing the set of possible values for robust RL can be a difficult task. When that set is specified too narrowly, the agent will be left vulnerable to reasonable parameter values unaccounted for. When specified too broadly, the agent will be too cautious. In this paper, we propose Feasible Adversarial Robust RL (FARR), a novel problem formulation and objective for automatically determining the set of environment parameter values over which to be robust. FARR implicitly defines the set of feasible parameter values as those on which an agent could achieve a benchmark reward given enough training resources. By formulating this problem as a two-player zero-sum game, optimizing the FARR objective jointly produces an adversarial distribution over parameter values with feasible support and a policy robust over this feasible parameter set. We demonstrate that approximate Nash equilibria for this objective can be found using a variation of the PSRO algorithm. Furthermore, we show that an optimal agent trained with FARR is more robust to feasible adversarial parameter selection than with existing minimax, domain-randomization, and regret objectives in a parameterized gridworld and three MuJoCo control environments."}}

PSRO is based on the tabular double oracle (DO) method, an algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium, but may increase exploitability from one iteration to the next. We propose anytime double oracle (ADO), a tabular double oracle algorithm for 2-player zero-sum games that is guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium while decreasing exploitability from one iteration to the next. Unlike DO, in which the restricted distribution is based on the restricted game formed by each player's strategy sets, ADO finds the restricted distribution for each player that minimizes its exploitability against any policy in the full, unrestricted game. We also propose a method of finding this restricted distribution via a no-regret algorithm updated against best responses, called RM-BR DO. Finally, we propose anytime PSRO (APSRO), a version of ADO that calculates best responses via reinforcement learning. In experiments on Leduc poker and random normal form games, we show that our methods achieve far lower exploitability than DO and PSRO and decrease exploitability monotonically."}}

In domains where agents can choose to take their own action or delegate their action to a central mediator, an open question is how mediators should take actions on behalf of delegating agents. The main existing approach uses delegating agents to punish non-delegating agents in an attempt to get all agents to delegate, which tends to be costly for all. We introduce a Pareto Mediator which aims to improve outcomes for delegating agents without making any of them worse off. Our experiments in random normal form games, a restaurant recommendation game, and a reinforcement learning sequential social dilemma show that the Pareto Mediator greatly increases social welfare. Also, even when the Pareto Mediator is based on an incorrect model of agent utility, performance gracefully degrades to the pre-intervention level, due to the individual autonomy preserved by the voluntary mediator."}}
