However, in many realistic applications PDE modelling provides an incomplete description of the physics of interest. PDE-based machine learning techniques are designed to address this limitation. In this approach, the PDE is used as an inductive bias enabling the coupled model to rely on fundamental physical laws while requiring less training data. The deployment of high-performance simulations coupling PDEs and machine learning to complex problems necessitates the composition of capabilities provided by machine learning and PDE-based frameworks. We present a simple yet effective coupling between the machine learning framework PyTorch and the PDE system Firedrake that provides researchers, engineers and domain specialists with a high productive way of specifying coupled models while only requiring trivial changes to existing code."}}

The problem can be cast as a Gaussian Process (GP) bandit where $f$ lives in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The state of the art analysis of several learning algorithms shows a significant gap between the lower and upper bounds on the simple regret performance. When $N$ is the number of exploration trials and $\\gamma_N$ is the maximal information gain, we prove an $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{\\gamma_N/N})$ bound on the simple regret performance of a pure exploration algorithm that is significantly tighter than the existing bounds. We show that this bound is order optimal up to logarithmic factors for the cases where a lower bound on regret is known. To establish these results, we prove novel and sharp confidence intervals for GP models applicable to RKHS elements which may be of broader interest."}}
