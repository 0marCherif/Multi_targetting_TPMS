However, deficits to this framework include a lack of clarity for selecting the privacy budget \u03b5 and a lack of quantification for the privacy leakage for a particular data row by a particular trained model. We make progress toward these limitations and a new perspective by which to visualize DP results by studying a privacy metric that quantifies the extent to which a model trained on a dataset using a DP mechanism is ''covered'' by each of the distributions resulting from training on neighboring datasets. We connect this coverage metric to what has been established in the literature and use it to rank the privacy of individual samples from the training set in what we call a privacy profile. We additionally show that the privacy profile can be used to probe an observed transition to indistinguishability that takes place in the neighboring distributions as \u03b5 decreases, which we suggest is a tool that can enable the selection of \u03b5 by the ML practitioner wishing to make use of DP."}}

Telemedicine applications could benefit from thermal imagery, but conventional computers are reliant on RGB cameras and lack thermal sensors. As a result, we propose the Visible-to-Thermal Facial GAN (VTF-GAN) that is specifically designed to generate high-resolution thermal faces by learning both the spatial and frequency domains of facial regions, across spectra. We compare VTF-GAN against several popular GAN baselines and the first conditional DDPM for VT face translation (VTF-Diff). Results show that VTF-GAN achieves high quality, crisp, and perceptually realistic thermal faces using a combined set of patch, temperature, perceptual, and Fourier Transform losses, compared to all baselines including diffusion."}}

While large commercial datasets exist, they are prohibitively expensive. On the other hand, an entity (e.g., a bank or government), may be targeted with unique malware, but the data samples available will never be sufficient to train a bespoke ML-based detector. While data augmentation has been a key component in improving deep learning models by providing requisite diversity for generalization, it has proven far more challenging for malware detection. The main challenges are that (1) determining the augmentations to make is not straightforward, (2) operations are on binaries rather than source code (which is not available), complicating correctness and understanding, and (3) labeling new files mandates expensive binary reverse engineering. We present Marvolo for creating realistic, semantics preserving transformations that mimic the code alterations made by malware authors in practice, allowing us to generate augmented data on raw binary files. This also enables Marvolo to safely propagate labels to newly-generated data. Across several malware datasets and recent ML-based detectors, Marvolo improves accuracy and AUC by up to 5% and 10% respectively, while boosting efficiency by 79x by avoiding redundant computation."}}

The ability to subvert a model into making errant predictions using seemingly inconsequential changes to input is startling, as is our lack of success in building models robust to this concern. Existing research shows progress, but current mitigations come with a high cost and simultaneously reduce the model's accuracy. However, such trade-offs may not be necessary when other design choices could subvert the risk. In this survey we review the current literature on attacks and their real-world occurrences, or limited evidence thereof, to critically evaluate the real-world risks of adversarial machine learning (AML) for the average entity. This is done with an eye toward how one would then mitigate these attacks in practice, the risks for production deployment, and how those risks could be managed. In doing so we elucidate that many AML threats do not warrant the cost and trade-offs of robustness due to a low likelihood of attack or availability of superior non-ML mitigations. Our analysis also recommends cases where an actor should be concerned about AML to the degree where robust ML models are necessary for a complete deployment."}}

These building blocks include highly optimized computational patterns for k-NN graph construction, spanning trees, and dendrogram cluster extraction. We show how we used our primitives to implement cuSLINK end-to-end on the GPU, further enabling a wide range of real-world data mining and machine learning applications that were once intractable. In addition to being a primary computational bottleneck in the popular HDBSCAN algorithm, the impact of our end-to-end cuSLINK algorithm spans a large range of important applications, including cluster analysis in social and computer networks, natural language processing, and computer vision."}}

We modernize the classic computer vision task of image registration by applying and modifying a generative alignment algorithm to register VT cancer faces, without the need for a reference or alignment parameters. By registering VT faces, we demonstrate that the quality of thermal images produced in the generative AI downstream task of Visible-to-Thermal (V2T) image translation significantly improves up to 52.5%, than without registration.

An understudied question in that community is: for whom do these defenses defend? This work considers common approaches to defending learned systems and how security defenses result in performance inequities across different sub-populations. We outline appropriate parity metrics for analysis and begin to answer this question through empirical results of the fairness implications of machine learning security methods. We find that many methods that have been proposed can cause direct harm, like false rejection and unequal benefits from robustness training. The framework we propose for measuring defense equality can be applied to robustly trained models, preprocessing-based defenses, and rejection methods. We identify a set of datasets with a user-centered application and a reasonable computational cost suitable for case studies in measuring the equality of defenses. In our case study of speech command recognition, we show how such adversarial training and augmentation have non-equal but complex protections for social subgroups across gender, accent, and age in relation to user coverage. We present a comparison of equality between two rejection-based defenses: randomized smoothing and neural rejection, finding randomized smoothing more equitable due to the sampling mechanism for minority groups. This represents the first work examining the disparity in the adversarial robustness in the speech domain and the fairness evaluation of rejection-based defenses."}}

Differentially private versions of LASSO logistic regression have been developed, but generally produce dense solutions, reducing the intrinsic utility of the LASSO penalty. In this paper, we present a differentially private method for sparse logistic regression that maintains hard zeros. Our key insight is to first train a non-private LASSO logistic regression model to determine an appropriate privatized number of non-zero coefficients to use in final model selection. To demonstrate our method's performance, we run experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets."}}
