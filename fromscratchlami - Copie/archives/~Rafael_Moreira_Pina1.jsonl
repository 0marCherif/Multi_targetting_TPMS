In environments including multiple agents, such as football, the most common methods to train agents are Imitation Learning and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, the agents trained by Imitation Learning cannot outperform the expert demonstrator, which makes humans hardly get new insights from the learnt policy. Besides, MARL is prone to the credit assignment problem. In environments with sparse reward signal, this method can be inefficient. The objective of our research is to create a novel reward shaping method by embedding contextual information in reward function to solve the aforementioned challenges. We demonstrate this in the Google Research Football (GRF) environment. We quantify the contextual information extracted from game state observation and use this quantification together with original sparse reward to create the shaped reward. The experiment results in the GRF environment prove that our reward shaping method is a useful addition to state-of-the-art MARL algorithms for training agents in environments with sparse reward signal."}}

Such agents end up learning sub-optimal policies, demonstrating undesired lazy behaviours. To investigate this problem, we start by formalising the use of temporal causality applied to MARL problems. We then show how causality can be used to penalise such lazy agents and improve their behaviours. By understanding how their local observations are causally related to the team reward, each agent in the team can adjust their individual credit based on whether they helped to cause the reward or not. We show empirically that using causality estimations in MARL improves not only the holistic performance of the team, but also the individual capabilities of each agent. We observe that the improvements are consistent in a set of different environments."}}

Learning optimal policies using reinforcement learning in a multi-agent setting can be very difficult as the number of agents increases. Recent solutions such as Value Decomposition Networks (VDN), QMIX, QTRAN and QPLEX adhere to the centralized training and decentralized execution scheme and perform factorization of the joint action-value functions. However, these methods still suffer from increased environmental complexity, and at times fail to converge in a stable manner. We propose a novel concept of Residual Q-Networks (RQNs) for MARL, which learns to transform the individual Q-value trajectories in a way that preserves the Individual-Global-Max criteria (IGM), but is more robust in factorizing action-value functions. The RQN acts as an auxiliary network that accelerates convergence and will become obsolete as the agents reach the training objectives. The performance of the proposed method is compared against several state-of-the-art techniques such as QPLEX, QMIX, QTRAN and VDN, in a range of multi-agent cooperative tasks. The results illustrate that the proposed method, in general, converges faster, with increased stability and shows robust performance in a wider family of environments. The improvements in results are more prominent in environments with severe punishments for non-cooperative behaviours and especially in the absence of complete state information during training time."}}
