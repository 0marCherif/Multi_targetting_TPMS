A key operation of mixup is to compute a convex combination of a pair of inputs. This operation is straightforward for grid-like data, such as images, but challenging for graph data. The key difficulty lies in the fact that different graphs typically have different numbers of nodes, and thus there lacks a node-level correspondence between graphs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective mixup method for graph classification by soft alignments. Specifically, given a pair of graphs, we explicitly obtain node-level correspondence via computing a soft assignment matrix to match the nodes between two graphs. Based on the soft assignments, we transform the adjacency and node feature matrices of one graph, so that the transformed graph is aligned with the other graph. In this way, any pair of graphs can be mixed directly to generate an augmented graph. We conduct systematic experiments to show that our method can improve the performance and generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) on various graph classification tasks. In addition, we show that our method can increase the robustness of GNNs against noisy labels."}}

While this direction has been explored previously, existing methods invariably rely on certain assumptions on the properties of fair graph data in order to design fixed strategies on data augmentations. Nevertheless, the exact properties of fair graph data may vary significantly in different scenarios. Hence, heuristically designed augmentations may not always generate fair graph data in different application scenarios. In this work, we propose a method, known as Graphair, to learn fair representations based on automated graph data augmentations. Such fairness-aware augmentations are themselves learned from data. Our Graphair is designed to automatically discover fairness-aware augmentations from input graphs in order to circumvent sensitive information while preserving other useful information. Experimental results demonstrate that our Graphair consistently outperforms many baselines on multiple node classification datasets in terms of fairness-accuracy trade-off performance. In addition, results indicate that Graphair can automatically learn to generate fair graph data without prior knowledge on fairness-relevant graph properties."}}

The 6D pose estimation of such objects with only a monocular RGB camera is difficult because of the absence of rich texture features. Furthermore, the appearance of specularity heavily depends on the camera viewpoint and environmental light conditions making traditional methods, like template matching, fail. In the last 30 years, pose estimation of the specular object has been a consistent challenge, and most related works require massive knowledge modeling effort for light setups, environment, or the object surface. On the other hand, recent works exhibit the feasibility of 6D pose estimation on a monocular camera with convolutional neural networks(CNNs) however they mostly use opaque objects for evaluation. This paper provides a data-driven solution to estimate the 6D pose of specular objects for grasping them, proposes a cost function for handling symmetry, and demonstrates experimental results showing the system's feasibility."}}
