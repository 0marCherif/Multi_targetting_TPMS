Business closures, educational institution closures, and gathering bans reduced transmission, but reduced it less than they did in the first wave. This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours\u2014such as distancing\u2014which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them. Specifically, we find smaller effects for closing educational institutions, suggesting that stringent safety measures made schools safer compared to the first wave.

Existing methods for this problem mainly use a single genotyping signal, and either use a distance-based method with a pre-specified number of clusters, or a phylogenetic tree-based method with a pre-specified threshold. We propose PathOGiST, an algorithmic framework for clustering bacterial isolates by leveraging multiple genotypic signals and calibrated thresholds. PathOGiST uses different genotypic signals, clusters the isolates based on these individual signals with correlation clustering, and combines the clusterings based on the individual signals through consensus clustering. We implemented and tested PathOGiST on three different bacterial pathogens - Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis - and we conclude by discussing further avenues to explore."}}

Besides that, the majority of the existing datasets consist of bulk sequencing data of single tumor sample of an individual. Accurate inference of the phylogenetic order of mutations is particularly challenging in these cases and the existing methods are faced with several theoretical limitations. To overcome these limitations, new methods are required for integrating and harnessing the full potential of the existing data. Results We introduce a method called Hintra for intra-tumor heterogeneity detection. Hintra integrates sequencing data for a cohort of tumors and infers tumor phylogeny for each individual based on the evolutionary information shared between different tumors. Through an iterative process, Hintra learns the repeating evolutionary patterns and uses this information for resolving the phylogenetic ambiguities of individual tumors. The results of synthetic experiments show an improved performance compared to two state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results with a recent Breast Cancer dataset are consistent with the existing knowledge and provide potentially interesting findings.

These sequences are called optimal sorting scenarios. However, there is usually a large number of such scenarios, and a na\u00efve algorithm is very likely to be biased towards a specific type of scenario, impairing its usefulness in real-world applications. One way to go beyond the traditional sorting algorithms is to explore all possible solutions, looking at all the optimal sorting scenarios instead of just an arbitrary one. Another related approach is to analyze all the intermediate genomes, that is, all the genomes that can occur in an optimal sorting scenario. In this paper, we show how to count the number of optimal sorting scenarios and the number of intermediate genomes between any two given genomes, under the rank distance."}}

This diversity can be informative of evolutionary adaptations, host-pathogen interactions, and disease transmission patterns. However, capturing this diversity directly from biological samples is challenging. Results We introduce a framework for understanding the within-host diversity of a pathogen using multi-locus sequence types (MLST) from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Our approach consists of two stages. First we process each sample individually by assigning it, for each locus in the MLST scheme, a set of alleles and a proportion for each allele. Next, we associate to each sample a set of strain types using the alleles and the strain proportions obtained in the first step. We achieve this by using the smallest possible number of previously unobserved strains across all samples, while using those unobserved strains which are as close to the observed ones as possible, at the same time respecting the allele proportions as closely as possible. We solve both problems using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Our method performs accurately on simulated data and generates results on a real data set of Borrelia burgdorferi genomes suggesting a high level of diversity for this pathogen. Conclusions Our approach can apply to any bacterial pathogen with an MLST scheme, even though we developed it with Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease, in mind. Our work paves the way for robust strain typing in the presence of within-host heterogeneity, overcoming an essential challenge currently not addressed by any existing methodology for pathogen genomics."}}

Minimal cut sets (MCSs) are minimal sets of reactions whose inhibition blocks a target reaction in a metabolic network. Most approaches for finding the MCSs in constrained-based models require, either as an intermediate step or as a byproduct of the calculation, the computation of the set of elementary flux modes (EFMs), a convex basis for the valid flux vectors in the network. Recently, Ballerstein et al. proposed a method for computing the MCSs of a network without first computing its EFMs, by creating a dual network whose EFMs are a superset of the MCSs of the original network. However, their dual network is always larger than the original network and depends on the target reaction. Here we propose the construction of a different dual network, which is typically smaller than the original network and is independent of the target reaction, for the same purpose. We prove the correctness of our approach, minimal coordinated support (MCS 2 ), and describe how it can be modified to compute the few smallest MCSs for a given target reaction. Results We compare MCS 2 to the method of Ballerstein et al. and two other existing methods. We show that MCS 2 succeeds in calculating the full set of MCSs in many models where other approaches cannot finish within a reasonable amount of time. Thus, in addition to its theoretical novelty, our approach provides a practical advantage over existing methods.

While a fixed set of VNTRs is typically identified for a given species, the copy number at each VNTR varies between individuals within a species. Although VNTRs are found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, the methodology called multi-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) is widely used to distinguish different strains of bacteria, as well as cluster strains that might be epidemiologically related and investigate evolutionary rates. We propose PRINCE (Processing Reads to Infer the Number of Copies via Estimation), an algorithm that is able to accurately estimate the copy number of a VNTR given the sequence of a single repeat unit and a set of short reads from a whole-genome sequence (WGS) experiment. This is a challenging problem, especially in the cases when the repeat region is longer than the expected read length. Our proposed method computes a statistical approximation of the local coverage inside the repeat region. This approximation is then mapped to the copy number using a linear function whose parameters are fitted to simulated data. We test PRINCE on the genomes of three datasets of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and show that it is more than twice as accurate as a previous method.
