Analogously, distilling such large models to compact models for efficient deployment also necessitates a large amount of (labeled or unlabeled) training data. In this paper, we propose the teacher-guided training (TGT) framework for training a high-quality compact model that leverages the knowledge acquired by pretrained generative models, while obviating the need to go through a large volume of data. TGT exploits the fact that the teacher has acquired a good representation of the underlying data domain, which typically corresponds to a much lower dimensional manifold than the input space. Furthermore, we can use the teacher to explore input space more efficiently through sampling or gradient-based methods; thus, making TGT especially attractive for limited data or long-tail settings. We formally capture this benefit of proposed data-domain exploration in our generalization bounds. We find that TGT can improve accuracy on several image classification benchmarks as well as a range of text classification and retrieval tasks."}}

This is prohibitively large for a variety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering etc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup attention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as sparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we view attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such hierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two efficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention computes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse attention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize such challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training method. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for long-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost as accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the attention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12% higher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer."}}

Learning Diverse Features for Fine-grained and Long-tail Classification", "abstract": "Feature extractors learned from supervised training of deep neural networks have demonstrated superior performance over handcrafted ones. Recently, it is shown that such learned features have a neural collapse property, where within-class features collapse to the class mean and different class means are maximally separated. This paper examines the neural collapse property in the context of fine-grained classification tasks, where a feature extractor pretrained from a classification task with coarse labels is used for generating features for a downstream classification task with fine-grained labels. We argue that the within-class feature collapse is an undesirable property for fine-grained classification. Hence, we introduce a geometric arrangement of features called the maximal-separating-cone, where within-class features lie in a cone of nontrivial radius instead of collapsing to the class mean, and cones of different classes are maximally separated. We present a technique based on classifier weight and training loss design to produce such an arrangement. Experimentally we demonstrate an improved fine-grained classification performance with a feature extractor pretrained by our method. Moreover, our technique also provides benefits for the classification on data with long-tail distribution over classes. Our work may motivate future efforts on the design of better geometric arrangements of deep features."}}

However, a typical Transformer model computes such pairwise attention scores repeatedly for the same sequence, in multiple heads in multiple layers. We systematically analyze the empirical similarity of these scores across heads and layers and find them to be considerably redundant, especially adjacent layers showing high similarity. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel architecture that reuses attention scores computed in one layer in multiple subsequent layers. Experiments on a number of standard benchmarks show that reusing attention delivers performance equivalent to or better than standard transformers, while reducing both compute and memory usage."}}

This poses a challenge for generalisation on such labels, and also  makes naive learning biased towards dominant labels. In this paper,  we present a statistical framework that unifies and generalises several recent proposals to cope with these challenges. Our framework revisits the classic idea of logit adjustment based on the label frequencies, which encourages a large relative margin between logits of rare positive versus dominant negative labels. This yields two techniques  for long-tail learning, where such adjustment is either applied post-hoc to a trained model, or enforced in the loss during training. These techniques are statistically grounded, and practically effective on four real-world datasets with long-tailed label distributions. "}}
