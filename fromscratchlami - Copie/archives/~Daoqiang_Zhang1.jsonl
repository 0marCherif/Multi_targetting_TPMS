Effectively representing the brain network has always been the fundamental task of computeraided brain network analysis. Previous studies typically utilize human-engineered features to represent brain connectivity networks, but these features may not be well coordinated with subsequent classifiers. Besides, brain networks are often equipped with multiple hubs (i.e., nodes occupying a central position in the overall organization of a network), providing essential clues to describe connectivity patterns. However, existing studies often fail to explore such hubs from brain connectivity networks. To address these two issues, we propose a Connectivity Network analysis method with discriminative Hub Detection (CNHD) for brain disease diagnosis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Specifically, we incorporate both feature extraction of brain networks and network-based classification into a unified model, while discriminative hubs can be automatically identified from data via \u21131-norm and \u21132,1-norm regularizers. The proposed CNHD method is evaluated on three real-world schizophrenia datasets with fMRI scans. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in disease diagnosis, but also is effective in automatically identifying disease-related network hubs in the human brain."}}

However most recent works lack exploration of structure information of MRI images that is crucial for clinical diagnosis. To tackle this problem, we propose the Structure-Enhanced GAN (SEGAN) that aims at restoring structure information at both local and global scale. SEGAN defines a new structure regularization called Patch Correlation Regularization (PCR) which allows for efficient extraction of structure information. In addition, to further enhance the ability to uncover structure information, we propose a novel generator SU-Net by incorporating multiple-scale convolution filters into each layer. Besides, we theoretically analyze the convergence of stochastic factors contained in training process. Experimental results show that SEGAN is able to learn target structure information and achieves state-of-theart performance for CS-MRI reconstruction."}}

However, since lacking enough domain knowledge and experience, it is very difficult for common investors to analyze thousands of stocks manually. Algorithmic investment provides another rational way to formulate human knowledge as a trading agent. However, it still requires well-built knowledge and experience to design effective trading algorithms in such a volatile market. Fortunately, various kinds of historical trading records are easy to obtain in this big-data era, it is invaluable of us to extract the trading knowledge hidden in the data to help people make better decisions. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning driven Investor-Imitator framework to formalize the trading knowledge, by imitating an investor's behavior with a set of logic descriptors. In particular, to instantiate specific logic descriptors, we introduce the Rank-Invest model that can keep the diversity of logic descriptors by learning to optimize different evaluation metrics. In the experiment, we first simulate three types of investors, representing different degrees of information disclosure we may meet in real market. By learning towards these investors, we can tell the inherent trading logic of the target investor with the Investor-Imitator empirically, and the extracted interpretable knowledge can help us better understand and construct trading portfolios. Experimental results in this paper sufficiently demonstrate the designed purpose of Investor-Imitator, it makes the Investor-Imitator an applicable and meaningful intelligent trading framework in financial investment research."}}

Unlink previous methods, DHA is not limited by a restricted fixed kernel function. Further, it uses a parametric approach, rank-m Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and stochastic gradient descent for optimization. Therefore, DHA has a suitable time complexity for large datasets, and DHA does not require the training data when it computes the functional alignment for a new subject. Experimental studies on multi-subject fMRI analysis confirm that the DHA method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art HA algorithms."}}

One of the main challenges in MVP analysis is validating the generated results across subjects. However, analyzing multi-subject fMRI data requires accurate functional alignments between neuronal activities of different subjects, which can rapidly increase the performance and robustness of the final results. Hyperalignment (HA) is one of the most effective functional alignment methods, which can be mathematically formulated by the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) methods. Since HA mostly uses the unsupervised CCA techniques, its solution may not be optimized for MVP analysis. By incorporating the idea of Local Discriminant Analysis (LDA) into CCA, this paper proposes Local Discriminant Hyperalignment (LDHA) as a novel supervised HA method, which can provide better functional alignment for MVP analysis. Indeed, the locality is defined based on the stimuli categories in the train-set, where the correlation between all stimuli in the same category will be maximized and the correlation between distinct categories of stimuli approaches to near zero. Experimental studies on multi-subject MVP analysis confirm that the LDHA method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art HA algorithms."}}

In traditional ECOC-based methods, binary classifiers corresponding to those sub-problems are usually trained separately without considering the relationships among these classifiers. However, as these classifiers are established on the same training data, there may be some inherent relationships among them. Exploiting such relationships can potentially improve the generalization performances of individual classifiers, and, thus, boost ECOC learning algorithms. In this paper, we explore to mine and utilize such relationship through a joint classifier learning method, by integrating the training of binary classifiers and the learning of the relationship among them into a unified objective function. We also develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to solve the objective function. To evaluate the proposed method, we perform a series of experiments on eleven datasets from the UCI machine learning repository as well as two datasets from real-world image recognition tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, compared with state-of-the-art methods for ECOC-based multi-class classification."}}

Also, their feature selection steps usually neglect the image appearance changes in different local regions of CT images. To this end, we present a novel semi-automatic learning-based prostate segmentation method in this article. For segmenting the prostate in a certain treatment image, the radiation oncologist will be first asked to take a few seconds to manually specify the first and last slices of the prostate. Then, prostate is segmented with the following two steps: (i) Estimation of 3D prostate-likelihood map to predict the likelihood of each voxel being prostate by employing the coupled feature representation, and the proposed Spatial-COnstrained Transductive LassO (SCOTO); (ii) Multi-atlases based label fusion to generate the final segmentation result by using the prostate shape information obtained from both planning and previous treatment images. The major contribution of the proposed method mainly includes: (i) incorporating radiation oncologist's manual specification to aid segmentation, (ii) adopting coupled features to relax previous assumption of feature independency for voxel representation, and (iii) developing SCOTO for joint feature selection across different local regions. The experimental result shows that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in a real-world prostate CT dataset, consisting of 24 patients with totally 330 images, all of which were manually delineated by the radiation oncologist for performance evaluation. Moreover, our method is also clinically feasible, since the segmentation performance can be improved by just requiring the radiation oncologist to spend only a few seconds for manual specification of ending slices in the current treatment CT image."}}

Especially for both functional and structural connectivity interaction, graph theoretical analysis provided a new measure for human brain organization in vivo, with one fundamental challenge that is how to define the similarity between a pair of graphs. As one kind of similarity measure for graphs, graph kernels have been widely studied and applied in the literature. However, few works exploit to construct graph kernels for brain connectivity networks, where each node corresponds a unique EEG electrode or regions of interest(ROI). Accordingly, in this paper, we construct a new graph kernel for brain connectivity networks, which takes into account the inherent characteristic of nodes and captures the local topological properties of brain connectivity networks. To validate our method, we have performed extensive evaluation on a real mild cognitive impairment (MCI) dataset with the baseline functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from Alzheimers disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

However, most of those approaches ignore the complementary label information across modalities. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a novel label-alignment-based multi-task feature selection method to jointly select the most discriminative features from multi-modality data. Specifically, the feature selection procedure of each modality is treated as a task and a group sparsity regularizer (i.e., $$\\ell _{2,1}$$ norm) is adopted to ensure that only a small number of features to be selected jointly. In addition, we introduce a new regularization term to preserve label relatedness. The function of the proposed regularization term is to align paired within-class subjects from multiple modalities, i.e., to minimize their distance in corresponding low-dimensional feature space. The experimental results on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve better performances over state-of-the-art methods on multimodal classification of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)."}}
