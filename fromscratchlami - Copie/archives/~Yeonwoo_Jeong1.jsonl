In this context, recent works propose channel pruning via greedy channel selection to achieve practical acceleration and memory footprint reduction. We first show this channel-wise approach ignores the inherent quadratic coupling between channels in the neighboring layers and cannot safely remove inactive weights during the pruning procedure. Furthermore, we show that these pruning methods cannot guarantee the given resource constraints are satisfied and cause discrepancy with the true objective. To this end, we formulate a principled optimization framework with discrete variable QCQP,  which provably prevents any inactive weights and enables the exact guarantee of meeting the resource constraints in terms of FLOPs and memory. Also, we extend the pruning granularity beyond channels and jointly prune individual 2D convolution filters spatially for greater efficiency. Our experiments show competitive pruning results under the target resource constraints on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets on various network architectures.\n"}}

Recent works utilize intrinsic motivation to guide the exploration via generative models, predictive forward models, or more ad-hoc measures of surprise. We propose EMI, which is an exploration method that constructs embedding representation of states and actions that does not rely on generative decoding of the full observation but extracts predictive signals that can be used to guide exploration based on forward prediction in the representation space. Our experiments show the state of the art performance on challenging locomotion task with continuous control and on image-based exploration tasks with discrete actions on Atari."}}
