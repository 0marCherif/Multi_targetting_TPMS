Two orthogonal problems hinder the application of ML to antibody-specificity prediction and the benchmarking thereof: the lack of a unified ML formalization of immunological antibody-specificity prediction problems and the unavailability of large-scale synthetic datasets to benchmark real-world relevant ML methods and dataset design. Here we developed the Absolut! software suite that enables parameter-based unconstrained generation of synthetic lattice-based three-dimensional antibody\u2013antigen-binding structures with ground-truth access to conformational paratope, epitope and affinity. We formalized common immunological antibody-specificity prediction problems as ML tasks and confirmed that for both sequence- and structure-based tasks, accuracy-based rankings of ML methods trained on experimental data hold for ML methods trained on Absolut!-generated data. The Absolut! framework has the potential to enable real-world relevant development and benchmarking of ML strategies for biotherapeutics design."}}

Especially real world problems often contain such delayed and sparse rewards. Recently, return decomposition for delayed rewards (RUDDER) employed pattern recognition to remove or reduce delay in rewards, which dramatically simplifies the learning task of the underlying RL method. RUDDER was realized using a long short-term memory (LSTM). The LSTM was trained to identify important state-action pair patterns, responsible for the return. Reward was then redistributed to these important state-action pairs. However, training the LSTM is often difficult and requires a large number of episodes. In this work, we replace the LSTM with the recently proposed continuous modern Hopfield networks (MHN) and introduce Hopfield-RUDDER. MHN are powerful trainable associative memories with large storage capacity. They require only few training samples and excel at identifying and recognizing patterns. We use this property of MHN to identify important state-action pairs that are associated with low or high return episodes and directly redistribute reward to them. However, in partially observable environments, Hopfield-RUDDER requires additional information about the history of state-action pairs. Therefore, we evaluate several methods for compressing history and introduce reset-max history, a lightweight history compression using the max-operator in combination with a reset gate. We experimentally show that Hopfield-RUDDER is able to outperform LSTM-based RUDDER on various 1D environments with small numbers of episodes. Finally, we show in preliminary experiments that Hopfield-RUDDER scales to highly complex environments with the Minecraft ObtainDiamond task from the MineRL NeurIPS challenge."}}

The new data often differs from the previously seen data due to a domain shift, that is, a change of the input-target distribution. While several methods perform well on small domain shifts like new target classes with similar inputs, larger domain shifts are still challenging. Large domain shifts may result in abstract concepts that are not shared between the original and the new domain. However, low-level concepts like edges in images might still be shared and useful. For cross-domain few-shot learning, we suggest representation fusion to unify different abstraction levels of a deep neural network into one representation. We propose Cross-domain Hebbian Ensemble Few-shot learning (CHEF), which consists of representation fusion by an ensemble of Hebbian learners acting on different layers of a deep neural network that was trained on the original domain. On the few-shot datasets miniImagenet and tieredImagenet, where the domain shift is small, CHEF is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. On cross-domain few-shot benchmark challenges with larger domain shifts, CHEF obtains state-of-the-art results in all categories. We further apply CHEF on a real-world cross-domain application in drug discovery. We consider a domain shift from bioactive molecules to environmental chemicals and drugs with twelve associated toxicity prediction tasks. On these tasks that are highly relevant for computational drug discovery, CHEF significantly outperforms all its competitors. "}}
