UDA is important in many applications such as medicine, where it is used to adapt risk scores across different patient cohorts. In this paper, we develop a novel framework for UDA of time series data, called CLUDA. Specifically, we propose a contrastive learning framework to learn contextual representations in multivariate time series, so that these preserve label information for the prediction task. In our framework, we further capture the variation in the contextual representations between source and target domain via a custom nearest-neighbor contrastive learning. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first framework to learn domain-invariant, contextual representation for UDA of time series data. We evaluate our framework using a wide range of time series datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance for time series UDA. "}}

The power of graph algorithms lie in the capability to catch transaction linking network information, which is very hard to be captured by other algorithms. However, in most existing approaches, transaction or user connections are defined by \u201chard link\u201d strategies on shared properties, such as same credit card, same device, same ip address, same shipping address, etc. Those types of strategies will result in sparse linkages by entities with strong identification characteristics (ie. device) and over-linkages by entities that could be widely shared (ie. ip address), making it more difficult to learn useful information from graph. To address aforementioned problems, we present a novel behavioral biometric based method to establish transaction linkings based on user behavioral similarities, then train an unsupervised GNN to extract embedding features for downstream fraud prediction tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first time similarity based \u201csoft link\u201d has been used in graph embedding applications. To speed up similarity calculation, we apply an in-house GPU based HDBSCAN clustering method to remove highly concentrated and isolated nodes before graph construction. Our experiments show that embedding features learned from similarity-based behavioral graph have achieved significant performance increase to the baseline fraud detection model in various business scenarios. In new/guest buyer transaction scenario, this segment is a challenge for traditional method, we can make precision increase from 0.82 to 0.86 at the same recall of 0.27, which means we can decrease false positive rate using this method."}}

Traditional neural learning can model long-term dependencies in clickstream data, yet it ignores the different shopping phases (i.\u00a0e., goal-directed search vs. browsing) in user behavior as theorized by marketing research. In this paper, we develop a novel, theory-informed machine learning model to account for different shopping phases as defined in marketing theory. Specifically, we formalize a tailored attentive deep Markov model called ClickstreamDMM for predicting the risk of user exits without purchase in e-commerce web sessions. Our ClickstreamDMM combines (1)\u00a0an attention network to learn long-term dependencies in clickstream data and (2)\u00a0a latent variable model to capture different shopping phases (i.\u00a0e., goal-directed search vs. browsing). Due to the interpretable structure, our ClickstreamDMM allows marketers to generate new insights on how shopping phases relate to actual purchase behavior. We evaluate our model using real-world clickstream data from a leading e-commerce platform consisting of 26,279 sessions with 250,287 page clicks. Thereby, we demonstrate that our model is effective in predicting user exits without purchase: compared to existing baselines, it achieves an improvement by 11.5\u00a0% in AUROC and 12.7\u00a0% in AUPRC. Overall, our model enables e-commerce platforms to detect users at the risk of exiting without purchase. Based on it, e-commerce platforms can then intervene with marketing resources to steer users toward purchasing."}}

We analyze whether machine learning methods are able to classify these two tasks using eye-tracking and EEG features. We implement models with aggregated sentence-level features as well as fine-grained word-level features. We test the models in within-subject and cross-subject evaluation scenarios. All models are tested on the ZuCo 1.0 and ZuCo 2.0 data subsets, which are characterized by differing recording procedures and thus allow for different levels of generalizability. Finally, we provide a series of control experiments to analyze the results in more detail."}}

To this end, prediction algorithms have been developed that estimate the risk of mortality in ICUs. In this work, we propose a novel generative deep probabilistic model for real-time risk scoring in ICUs. Specifically, we develop an attentive deep Markov model called AttDMM. To the best of our knowledge, AttDMM is the first ICU prediction model that jointly learns both long-term disease dynamics (via attention) and different disease states in health trajectory (via a latent variable model). Our evaluations were based on an established baseline dataset (MIMIC-III) with 53,423 ICU stays. The results confirm that compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our AttDMM was superior: AttDMM achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.876, which yielded an improvement over the state-of-the-art method by 2.2%. In addition, the risk score from the AttDMM provided warnings several hours earlier. Thereby, our model shows a path towards identifying patients at risk so that health practitioners can intervene early and save patient lives."}}
