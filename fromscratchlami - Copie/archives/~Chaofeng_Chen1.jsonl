Different from existing single-view methods which can only recover a 2.5D scene representation (i.e., a normal / depth map for the visible surface), our method learns a neural reflectance field to represent the 3D geometry and BRDFs of a scene. Instead of relying on multi-view photo-consistency, our method exploits two information-rich monocular cues, namely shading and shadow, to infer scene geometry. Experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method is capable of recovering 3D geometry, including both visible and invisible parts, of a scene from single-view images. Thanks to the neural reflectance field representation, our method is robust to depth discontinuities. It supports applications like novel-view synthesis and relighting.

Although lots of efforts have been made to solve this problem, it remains unclear how the human visual system (HVS) relates to the temporal quality of videos. Meanwhile, recent work has found that the frames of natural video transformed into the perceptual domain of the HVS tend to form a straight trajectory of the representations. With the obtained insight that distortion impairs the perceived video quality and results in a curved trajectory of the perceptual representation, we propose a temporal perceptual quality index (TPQI) to measure the temporal distortion by describing the graphic morphology of the representation. Specifically, we first extract the video perceptual representations from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual area (V1) of the HVS, and then measure the straightness and compactness of their trajectories to quantify the degradation in naturalness and content continuity of video. Experiments show that the perceptual representation in the HVS is an effective way of predicting subjective temporal quality, and thus TPQI can, for the first time, achieve comparable performance to the spatial quality metric and be even more effective in assessing videos with large temporal variations. We further demonstrate that by combining with NIQE, a spatial quality metric, TPQI can achieve top performance over popular in-the-wild video datasets. More importantly, TPQI does not require any additional information beyond the video being evaluated and thus can be applied to any datasets without parameter tuning.

Recent works mainly focus on modeling the degradation with handcrafted or estimated degradation parameters, which are however incapable to model complicated real-world degradation types, resulting in limited quality improvement. Notably, LQ face images, which may have the same degradation process as natural images, can be robustly restored with photo-realistic textures by exploiting their strong structural priors. This motivates us to use the real-world LQ face images and their restored HQ counterparts to model the complex real-world degradation (namely ReDegNet), and then transfer it to HQ natural images to synthesize their realistic LQ counterparts. By taking these paired HQ-LQ face images as inputs to explicitly predict the degradation-aware and content-independent representations, we could control the degraded image generation, and subsequently transfer these degradation representations from face to natural images to synthesize the degraded LQ natural images. Experiments show that our ReDegNet can well learn the real degradation process from face images. The restoration network trained with our synthetic pairs performs favorably against SOTAs. More importantly, our method provides a new way to handle the real-world complex scenarios by learning their degradation representations from the facial portions, which can be used to significantly improve the quality of non-facial areas.

In this paper, we present a neural inverse rendering method for MVPS based on implicit representation. Given multi-view images of a non-Lambertian object illuminated by multiple unknown directional lights, our method jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lights. Our method first employs multi-light images to estimate per-view surface normal maps, which are used to regularize the normals derived from the neural radiance field. It then jointly optimizes the surface normals, spatially-varying BRDFs, and lights based on a shadow-aware differentiable rendering layer. After optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view rendering, relighting, and material editing. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method achieves far more accurate shape reconstruction than existing MVPS and neural rendering methods.

Recognizing faces under occlusion, however, still remains a challenge. Existing techniques often fail to recognize faces with both the mouth and nose covered by a mask, which is now very common under the COVID-19 pandemic. Common approaches to tackle this problem include 1) discarding information from the masked regions during recognition and 2) restoring the masked regions before recognition. Very few works considered the consistency between features extracted from masked faces and from their mask-free counterparts. This resulted in models trained for recognizing masked faces often showing degraded performance on mask-free faces. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, named Face Feature Rectification Network (FFR-Net), for recognizing both masked and mask-free faces alike. We introduce rectification blocks to rectify features extracted by a state-of-the-art recognition model, in both spatial and channel dimensions, to minimize the distance between a masked face and its mask-free counterpart in the rectified feature space. Experiments show that our unified framework can learn a rectified feature space for recognizing both masked and mask-free faces effectively, achieving state-of-the-art results.

These relationships lead to two important types of effects for video quality. Firstly, some temporal variations (such as shaking, flicker, and abrupt scene transitions) are causing temporal distortions and lead to extra quality degradations, while other variations (e.g. those related to meaningful happenings) do not. Secondly, the human visual system often has different attention to frames with different contents, resulting in their different importance to the overall video quality. Based on prominent time-series modeling ability of transformers, we propose a novel and effective transformer-based VQA method to tackle these two issues. To better differentiate temporal variations and thus capture the temporal distortions, we design a transformer-based Spatial-Temporal Distortion Extraction (STDE) module. To tackle with temporal quality attention, we propose the encoder-decoder-like temporal content transformer (TCT). We also introduce the temporal sampling on features to reduce the input length for the TCT, so as to improve the learning effectiveness and efficiency of this module. Consisting of the STDE and the TCT, the proposed Temporal Distortion-Content Transformers for Video Quality Assessment (DisCoVQA) reaches state-of-the-art performance on several VQA benchmarks without any extra pre-training datasets and up to 10% better generalization ability than existing methods. We also conduct extensive ablation experiments to prove the effectiveness of each part in our proposed model, and provide visualizations to prove that the proposed modules achieve our intention on modeling these temporal issues. We will publish our codes and pretrained weights later."}}

This cost hinders them from learning better video-quality-related representations via end-to-end training. Existing approaches typically consider naive sampling to reduce the computational cost, such as resizing and cropping. However, they obviously corrupt quality-related information in videos and are thus not optimal for learning good representations for VQA. Therefore, there is an eager need to design a new quality-retained sampling scheme for VQA. In this paper, we propose Grid Mini-patch Sampling (GMS), which allows consideration of local quality by sampling patches at their raw resolution and covers global quality with contextual relations via mini-patches sampled in uniform grids. These mini-patches are spliced and aligned temporally, named as fragments. We further build the Fragment Attention Network (FANet) specially designed to accommodate fragments as inputs. Consisting of fragments and FANet, the proposed FrAgment Sample Transformer for VQA (FAST-VQA) enables efficient end-to-end deep VQA and learns effective video-quality-related representations. It improves state-of-the-art accuracy by around 10% while reducing 99.5% FLOPs on 1080P high-resolution videos. The newly learned video-quality-related representations can also be transferred into smaller VQA datasets, boosting performance in these scenarios. Extensive experiments show that FAST-VQA has good performance on inputs of various resolutions while retaining high efficiency. We publish our code at https://github.com/timothyhtimothy/FAST-VQA."}}
