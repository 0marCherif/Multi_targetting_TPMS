Safety in design and operational safety assurance are critical factors for how humans will interact with increasingly autonomous systems. The IASMS Concept of Operations builds from traditional commercial operator safety management and scales in complexity to AAM. The transformative changes in future aviation systems pose potential new critical safety risks with novel types of aircraft and other vehicles having different performance capabilities, flying in increasingly complex airspace, and using adaptive contingencies to manage normal and non-normal operations. These changes compel development of new and emerging capabilities that enable innovative ways for humans to interact with data and manage information. Increasing complexity of AAM corresponds with use of predictive modeling, data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to effectively address known hazards and emergent risks. The roles of humans will dynamically evolve in increments with this technological and operational evolution. The interfaces for how humans will interact with increasingly complex and assured systems designed to operate autonomously and how information will need to be presented are important challenges to be resolved."}}

However, LMICs lack adequate air quality (AQ) monitoring infrastructure. A persistent challenge has been our inability to estimate AQ accurately in LMIC cities, which hinders emergency preparedness and risk mitigation. Deep learning-based models that map satellite imagery to AQ can be built for high-income countries (HICs) with adequate ground data. Here we demonstrate that a scalable approach that adapts deep transfer learning on satellite imagery for AQ can extract meaningful estimates and insights in LMIC cities based on spatiotemporal patterns learned in HIC cities. The approach is demonstrated for Accra in Ghana, Africa, with AQ patterns learned from two US cities, specifically Los Angeles and New York."}}

Estimating Air Pollution Spatial Variation Using Street-Level Imagery", "abstract": "High spatial resolution information on urban air pollution levels is unavailable in many areas globally, partially due to the high input data needs of existing estimation approaches. We introduced a computer vision method to estimate annual means for air pollution levels from street-level images. We used annual mean estimates of NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations from locally calibrated models as labels from London, New York, and Vancouver to allow for compilation of a sufficiently large dataset (~250 k images for each city). Our experimental setup is designed to quantify intra- and intercity transferability of image-based model estimates. Performances were high and comparable to traditional land-use regression (LUR) and dispersion models when training and testing images from the same city (R2 values between 0.51 and 0.95 when validated on data from ground monitoring stations). Similar to LUR models, transferability of models between cities in different geographies is more difficult. Specifically, transferability between the three cities (London, New York, and Vancouver), which have similar pollution source profiles, was moderately successful (R2 values between zero and 0.67). Comparatively, performances when transferring models trained on cities with very different source profiles, such as Accra in Ghana and Hong Kong, were lower (R2 between zero and 0.21). This suggests a need for local calibration, using additional measurement data from cities that share similar source profiles."}}

During the last few years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning to analyze these data in search of new exoplanets. Different from the existing machine learning works, ExoMiner, the proposed deep learning classifier in this work, mimics how domain experts examine diagnostic tests to vet a transit signal. ExoMiner is a highly accurate, explainable, and robust classifier that 1) allows us to validate 301 new exoplanets from the MAST Kepler Archive and 2) is general enough to be applied across missions such as the on-going TESS mission. We perform an extensive experimental study to verify that ExoMiner is more reliable and accurate than the existing transit signal classifiers in terms of different classification and ranking metrics. For example, for a fixed precision value of 99%, ExoMiner retrieves 93.6% of all exoplanets in the test set (i.e., recall=0.936) while this rate is 76.3% for the best existing classifier. Furthermore, the modular design of ExoMiner favors its explainability. We introduce a simple explainability framework that provides experts with feedback on why ExoMiner classifies a transit signal into a specific class label (e.g., planet candidate or not planet candidate)."}}

The outputs of the ensemble need to be properly calibrated before they can be used as probability estimates. In this work, we demonstrate that online boosting is also prone to producing distorted probability estimates. In batch learning, calibration is achieved by reserving part of the training data for training the calibrator function. In the online setting, a decision needs to be made on each round: shall the new example(s) be used to update the parameters of the ensemble or those of the calibrator. We proceed to resolve this decision with the aid of bandit optimization algorithms. We demonstrate superior performance to uncalibrated and naively-calibrated on-line boosting ensembles in terms of probability estimation. Our proposed mechanism can be easily adapted to other tasks(e.g. cost-sensitive classification) and is robust to the choice of hyperparameters of both the calibrator and the ensemble."}}

The RAPT (RAre Class Prediction in the absence of True labels) framework is able to build data adaptive classification models using noisy training labels. It is particularly suitable when expert annotated training samples are difficult to obtain as in the case of wild fires in the tropics. This framework has been used to build burned area maps from MODIS surface reflectance data as features and Active Fire hotspots as training labels that are known to have high commission and omission errors due to the prevalence of cloud cover and smoke, especially in the tropics. Using the RAPT framework we report burned areas for 16 MODIS tiles from 2001 to 2014. The total burned area detected in the tropical forests of South America and South-east Asia during these years is 2,071,378 MODIS (500 m) pixels (approximately 520 K sq. km.), which is almost three times compared to the estimates from collection 5 MODIS MCD64A1 (783,468 MODIS pixels). An evaluation using Landsat-based reference burned area maps indicates that our product has an average user\u2019s accuracy of 53% and producer\u2019s accuracy of 55% while collection 5 MCD64A1 burned area product has an average user\u2019s accuracy of 61% and producer\u2019s accuracy of 27%. Our analysis also indicates that the two products can be complimentary and a combination of the two approaches is likely to provide a more comprehensive assessment of tropical fires. Finally, we have created a publicly accessible web-based viewer that helps the community to visualize the burned area maps produced using RAPT and examine various validation sources corresponding to every detected MODIS pixel."}}

In this paper, we present RAPT, a three step predictive modeling framework for classifying rare class in such problem settings. The first step of the proposed framework learns a classifier that jointly optimizes precision and recall by only using imperfectly labeled training samples. We also show that, under certain assumptions on the imperfect labels, the quality of this classifier is almost as good as the one constructed using perfect labels. The second and third steps of the framework make use of the fact that imperfect labels are available for all instances to further improve the precision and recall of the rare class. We evaluate the RAPT frameworkon two real-world applications of mapping forest fires and urban extent from earth observing satellite data. The experimental results indicate that RAPTcan be used to identifyforest fires and urban areas with high precision and recall by using imperfect labels, even though obtaining expert annotated samples on a global scale is infeasible in these applications."}}

Use of active learning has been shown to diminish this review time significantly. However, since active learning is an iterative process of learning a classifier based on a small number of SME-provided labels at each iteration, the lack of an enabling tool can hinder the process of adoption of these technologies in real-life, in spite of their labor-saving potential. In this demo we present ASK-the-Expert, an interactive tool that allows SMEs to review instances from a data set and provide labels within a single framework. ASK-the-Expert is powered by an active learning algorithm for training a classifier in the backend. We demonstrate this system in the context of an aviation safety application, but the tool can be adopted to work as a simple review and labeling tool as well, without the use of active learning."}}

Our focus is on the aviation safety domain, where data objects are flights and time series are sensor readings and pilot switches. In this context the goal is to detect anomalous flight segments, due to mechanical, environmental, or human factors in order to identifying operationally significant events and provide insights into the flight operations and highlight otherwise unavailable potential safety risks and precursors to accidents. For this purpose, we propose a framework which represents each flight using a semi-Markov switching vector autoregressive (SMS-VAR) model. Detection of anomalies is then based on measuring dissimilarities between the model's prediction and data observation. The framework is scalable, due to the inherent parallel nature of most computations, and can be used to perform online anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results on simulated and real datasets illustrate that the framework can detect various types of anomalies along with the key parameters involved."}}

In a time series setting, a precursor may be considered as any event that precedes and increases the likelihood of an adverse event. In a multivariate time series data, there are exponential number of events which makes a brute force search intractable. ADOPT works by breaking down the problem into two steps - (1) inferring a model of the nominal time series (data without adverse event) by considering the nominal data to be generated by a hidden expert and (2) using the expert's model as a benchmark to evaluate the adverse time series to identify suboptimal events as precursors. For step (1), we use a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework where value functions and Bellman's optimality are used to infer the expert's actions. For step (2), we define a precursor score to evaluate a given instant of a time series by comparing its utility with that of the expert. Thus, the search for precursors is transformed to a search for sub-optimal action sequences in ADOPT. As an application case study, we use ADOPT to discover precursors to go-around events in commercial flights using real aviation data."}}
