Specifically, we present the notion of Flow Matching (FM), a simulation-free approach for training CNFs based on regressing vector fields of fixed conditional probability paths. Flow Matching is compatible with a general family of Gaussian probability paths for transforming between noise and data samples---which subsumes existing diffusion paths as specific instances. Interestingly, we find that employing FM with diffusion paths results in a more robust and stable alternative for training diffusion models. Furthermore, Flow Matching opens the door to training CNFs with other, non-diffusion probability paths. An instance of particular interest is using Optimal Transport (OT) displacement interpolation to define the conditional probability paths. These paths are more efficient than diffusion paths, provide faster training and sampling, and result in better generalization. Training CNFs using Flow Matching on ImageNet leads to consistently better performance than alternative diffusion-based methods in terms of both likelihood and sample quality, and allows fast and reliable sample generation using off-the-shelf numerical ODE solvers."}}

A new image-like (i.e., tensor) data representation for genus-zero 3D shapes is devised. It is based on the observation that complicated shapes can be well represented by multiple parameterizations (charts), each focusing on a different part of the shape. The new tensor data representation is used as input to Generative Adversarial Networks for the task of 3D shape generation. The 3D shape tensor representation is based on a multi-chart structure that enjoys a shape covering property and scale-translation rigidity. Scale-translation rigidity facilitates high quality 3D shape learning and guarantees unique reconstruction. The multi-chart structure uses as input a dataset of 3D shapes (with arbitrary connectivity) and a sparse correspondence between them. The output of our algorithm is a generative model that learns the shape distribution and is able to generate novel shapes, interpolate shapes, and explore the generated shape space. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated for the task of anatomic shape generation including human body and bone (teeth) shape generation."}}

However, for rich node features, such a bound does not exist and GNNs can be shown to be universal, namely, have the theoretical ability to approximate arbitrary graph functions. It is well known, however, that expressive power alone does not imply good generalization.\nIn an effort to improve generalization of GNNs we suggest the Low-Rank Global Attention (LRGA) module, taking advantage of the efficiency of low rank matrix-vector multiplication, that improves the algorithmic alignment (Xu et al., 2019b) of GNNs with the 2-folklore Weisfeiler-Lehman (FWL) algorithm; 2-FWL is a graph isomorphism algorithm that is strictly more powerful than vertex coloring. Concretely, we: (i) formulate 2-FWL using polynomial kernels; (ii) show LRGA aligns with this 2-FWL formulation; and (iii) bound the sample complexity of the kernel's feature map when learned with a randomly initialized two-layer MLP. The latter means the generalization error can be made arbitrarily small when training LRGA to learn the 2-FWL algorithm. From a practical point of view, augmenting existing GNN layers with LRGA produces state of the art results on most datasets in a GNN standard benchmark."}}

It was shown that the popular message passing GNN cannot distinguish between graphs that are indistinguishable by the -WL test \\citep{morris2019,xu2019}. Unfortunately, many simple instances of graphs are indistinguishable by the -WL test.   In search for more expressive graph learning models we build upon the recent -order invariant and equivariant graph neural networks \\citep{maron2019}  and present two results:   First, we show that such -order networks can distinguish between non-isomorphic graphs as good as the -WL tests, which are provably stronger than the -WL test for . This makes these models strictly stronger than message passing models. Unfortunately, the higher expressiveness of these models comes with a computational cost of processing high order tensors.   Second, setting our goal at building a provably stronger, \\emph{simple} and \\emph{scalable}  model we show that a reduced -order network containing just scaled identity operator, augmented with a single quadratic operation (matrix multiplication) has a provable -WL expressive power. Differently put, we suggest a simple model that interleaves applications of standard Multilayer-Perceptron (MLP) applied to the feature dimension and matrix multiplication.   We validate this model by presenting state of the art results on popular graph classification and regression tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical invariant/equivariant model with guaranteed -WL expressiveness, strictly stronger than message passing models."}}

A basic challenge in developing such networks is finding the maximal collection of invariant and equivariant \\emph{linear} layers. Although this question is answered for the first three examples (for popular transformations, at-least), a full characterization of invariant and equivariant linear layers for graphs is not known. In this paper we provide a characterization of all permutation invariant and equivariant linear layers for (hyper-)graph data, and show that their dimension, in case of edge-value graph data, is $2$ and $15$, respectively. More generally, for graph data defined on $k$-tuples of nodes, the dimension is the $k$-th and $2k$-th Bell numbers. Orthogonal bases for the layers are computed, including generalization to multi-graph data. The constant number of basis elements and their characteristics allow successfully applying the networks to different size graphs. From the theoretical point of view, our results generalize and unify recent advancement in equivariant deep learning. In particular, we show that our model is capable of approximating any message passing neural network. Applying these new linear layers in a simple deep neural network framework is shown to achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art and to have better expressivity than previous invariant and equivariant bases."}}
