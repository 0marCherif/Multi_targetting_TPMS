Motivated by the difficulty of curating suitable calibration datasets, synthetic augmentations have become highly prevalent for inlier/outlier specification. While there have been rapid advances in data augmentation techniques, this paper makes a striking finding that the space in which the inliers and outliers are synthesized, in addition to the type of augmentation, plays a critical role in calibrating OOD detectors. Using the popular energy-based OOD detection framework, we find that the optimal protocol is to synthesize latent-space inliers along with diverse pixel-space outliers. Based on empirical studies with multiple medical imaging benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach consistently leads to superior OOD detection ($15\\% - 35\\%$ in AUROC) over the state-of-the-art in a variety of open-set recognition settings."}}

Conventional approaches rely on either by-passing or replacing shaded modules with auxiliary panels through complex control mechanisms, optimization strategies, or simulator driven approaches to obtain the best topology. However, these solutions are not scalable and incur significant installation costs and computational overhead, motivating the need to develop \u2018smart\u2019 methods for topology reconfiguration. To this end, we propose a regularized neural network based algorithm that leverages panel-level sensor data to reconfigure the array to the topology that maximizes power output under arbitrary shading conditions. Based on our simulations that include wiring losses in different configurations, we observe power improvement of up to 11% through reconfiguration. The proposed algorithm can be easily integrated in any cyber-physical PV system with reconfiguration capabilities and is scalable."}}

In this paper, we present a striking new finding that an ensemble of neural networks with the same weight initialization, trained on datasets that are shifted by a constant bias gives rise to slightly inconsistent trained models, where the differences in predictions are a strong indicator of epistemic uncertainties. Using the neural tangent kernel (NTK), we demonstrate that this phenomena occurs in part because the NTK is not shift-invariant. Since this is achieved via a trivial input transformation, we show that this behavior can therefore be approximated by training a single neural network -- using a technique that we call $\\Delta-$UQ -- that estimates uncertainty around prediction by marginalizing out the effect of the biases during inference. We show that $\\Delta-$UQ's uncertainty estimates are superior to many of the current methods on a variety of benchmarks-- outlier rejection, calibration under distribution shift, and sequential design optimization of black box functions.

This is crucial in understanding how models behave in uncontrollable \u2018in-the-wild\u2019 scenarios, but existing techniques fail when target domain becomes very different from the source. Accurately capturing the relationship and distance between the source and target domains is critical for a reliable post-hoc estimation of generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for directly predicting accuracy on unseen target data with the help of anchoring and pre-text encoding in predictive models. Anchoring has been shown previously to perform effectively in characterizing domain shifts, which we exploit for predicting the generalization gap. Our experiments on the PACS dataset along with synthetic ablations indicate that our approach produces well calibrated accuracy estimates outperforming existing baselines."}}
