Yet, traditional multiple object tracking (MOT) benchmarks rely only on a few object categories that hardly represent the multitude of possible objects that are encountered in the real world. This leaves contemporary MOT methods limited to a small set of pre-defined object categories. In this paper, we address this limitation by tackling a novel task, open-vocabulary MOT, that aims to evaluate tracking beyond pre-defined training categories. We further develop OVTrack, an open-vocabulary tracker that is capable of tracking arbitrary object classes. Its design is based on two key ingredients: First, leveraging vision-language models for both classification and association via knowledge distillation; second, a data hallucination strategy for robust appearance feature learning from denoising diffusion probabilistic models. The result is an extremely data-efficient open-vocabulary tracker that sets a new state-of-the-art on the large-scale, large-vocabulary TAO benchmark, while being trained solely on static images."}}

Recently, the integration of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has transformed 3D-aware generation from single-view images. NeRF-GANs exploit the strong inductive bias of 3D neural representations and volumetric rendering at the cost of higher computational complexity. This study aims at revisiting pose-conditioned 2D GANs for efficient 3D-aware generation at inference time by distilling 3D knowledge from pretrained NeRF-GANS. We propose a simple and effective method, based on re-using the well-disentangled latent space of a pre-trained NeRF-GAN in a pose-conditioned convolutional network to directly generate 3D-consistent images corresponding to the underlying 3D representations. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method obtains results comparable with volumetric rendering in terms of quality and 3D consistency while benefiting from the superior computational advantage of convolutional networks.

Similarly, MOT methods typically only associate objects with the same class predictions. These two prevalent strategies in MOT implicitly assume that the classification performance is near-perfect. However, this is far from the case in recent large-scale MOT datasets, which contain large numbers of classes with many rare or semantically similar categories. Therefore, the resulting inaccurate classification leads to sub-optimal tracking and inadequate benchmarking of trackers. We address these issues by disentangling classification from tracking. We introduce a new metric, Track Every Thing Accuracy (TETA), breaking tracking measurement into three sub-factors: localization, association, and classification, allowing comprehensive benchmarking of tracking performance even under inaccurate classification. TETA also deals with the challenging incomplete annotation problem in large-scale tracking datasets. We further introduce a Track Every Thing tracker (TETer), that performs association using Class Exemplar Matching (CEM). Our experiments show that TETA evaluates trackers more comprehensively, and TETer achieves significant improvements on the challenging large-scale datasets BDD100K and TAO compared to the state-of-the-art."}}

However, these approaches are either limited to a set of discrete scales or struggle to maintain good perceptual quality at the scales for which the model is not trained explicitly. We propose the design of scale-consistent positional encodings invariant to our generator's layers transformations. This enables the generation of arbitrary-scale images even at scales unseen during training. Moreover, we incorporate novel inter-scale augmentations into our pipeline and partial generation training to facilitate the synthesis of consistent images at arbitrary scales. Lastly, we show competitive results for a continuum of scales on various commonly used datasets for image synthesis. "}}

Instead of drawing latent vectors from a continuous prior, we sample from a finite set of learnable latents. However, a direct parametrization of such a distribution leads to an intractable linear increase in memory in order to ensure sufficient sample diversity. We address this key issue by taking inspiration from the encoding of information in biological organisms. Instead of learning a separate latent vector for each sample, we split the latent space into a set of genes. For each gene, we train a small bank of gene variants. Thus, by independently sampling a variant for each gene and combining them into the final latent vector, our approach can represent a vast number of unique latent samples from a compact set of learnable parameters. Interestingly, our gene-inspired latent encoding allows for new and intuitive approaches to manipulation, latent-space exploration, and classifier-based conditional sampling, while preserving state-of-the-art photo-realism."}}

In this work, a graph memory network is developed to address the novel idea of \u201clearning to update the segmentation model\u201d. Specifically, we exploit an episodic memory network, organized as a fully connected graph, to store frames as nodes and capture cross-frame correlations by edges. Further, learnable controllers are embedded to ease memory reading and writing, as well as maintain a fixed memory scale. The structured, external memory design enables our model to comprehensively mine and quickly store new knowledge, even with limited visual information, and the differentiable memory controllers slowly learn an abstract method for storing useful representations in the memory and how to later use these representations for prediction, via gradient descent. In addition, the proposed graph memory network yields a neat yet principled framework, which can generalize well to both one-shot and zero-shot video object segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmark datasets verify that our graph memory network is able to facilitate the adaptation of the segmentation network for case-by-case video object segmentation.\n\n"}}

In this work, we therefore propose a tracker architecture employing a Transformer-based model prediction module. Transformers capture global relations with little inductive bias, allowing it to learn the prediction of more powerful target models. We further extend the model predictor to estimate a second set of weights that are applied for accurate bounding box regression. The resulting tracker relies on training and on test frame information in order to predict all weights transductively. We train the proposed tracker end-to-end and validate its performance by conducting comprehensive experiments on multiple tracking datasets. Our tracker sets a new state of the art on three benchmarks, achieving an AUC of 68.5% on the challenging LaSOT dataset."}}

However, energy-based regression requires a proposal distribution to be manually designed for training, and an initial estimate has to be provided at test-time. We address both of these issues by introducing a conceptually simple method to automatically learn an effective proposal distribution, which is parameterized by a separate network head. To this end, we derive a surprising result, leading to a unified training objective that jointly minimizes the KL divergence from the proposal to the EBM, and the negative log-likelihood of the EBM. At test-time, we can then employ importance sampling with the trained proposal to efficiently evaluate the learned EBM and produce stand-alone predictions. Furthermore, we utilize our derived training objective to learn mixture density networks (MDNs) with a jointly trained energy-based teacher, consistently outperforming conventional MDN training on four real-world regression tasks within computer vision.

However, their segmented masks are still very coarse. In this paper, we present Mask Transfiner for high-quality and efficient instance segmentation. Instead of operating on regular dense tensors, our Mask Transfiner decomposes and represents the image regions as a quadtree. Our transformer-based approach only processes detected error-prone tree nodes and self-corrects their errors in parallel. While these sparse pixels only constitute a small proportion of the total number, they are critical to the final mask quality. This allows Mask Transfiner to predict highly accurate instance masks, at a low computational cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mask Transfiner outperforms current instance segmentation methods on three popular benchmarks, significantly improving both two-stage and query-based frameworks by a large margin of +3.0 mask AP on COCO and BDD100K, and +6.6 boundary AP on Cityscapes.

While tackling the input domain gap, the standard domain adaptation settings assume no domain change in the output space. In semantic prediction tasks, different datasets are often labeled according to different semantic taxonomies. In many real-world settings, the target domain task requires a different taxonomy than the one imposed by the source domain. We therefore introduce the more general taxonomy adaptive cross-domain semantic segmentation (TACS) problem, allowing for inconsistent taxonomies between the two domains. We further propose an approach that jointly addresses the image-level and label-level domain adaptation. On the label-level, we employ a bilateral mixed sampling strategy to augment the target domain, and a relabelling method to unify and align the label spaces. We address the image-level domain gap by proposing an uncertainty-rectified contrastive learning method, leading to more domain-invariant and class-discriminative features. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our framework under different TACS settings: open taxonomy, coarse-to-fine taxonomy, and implicitly-overlapping taxonomy. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin, while being capable of adapting to target taxonomies.
