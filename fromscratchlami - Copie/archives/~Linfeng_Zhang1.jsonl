Recent success of AlphaFold and its variants shows that deep learning models are capable of accurately predicting protein complex structures, yet with the painstaking effort of homology search and pairing. To bypass this need, we present Uni-Fold MuSSe (Multimer with Single Sequence inputs), which predicts protein complex structures from their primary sequences with the aid of pre-trained protein language models. Specifically, we built protein complex prediction models based on the protein sequence representations of ESM-2, a large protein language model with 3 billion parameters. In order to adapt the language model to inter-protein evolutionary patterns, we slightly modified and further pre-trained the language model on groups of protein sequences with known interactions. Our results highlight the potential of protein language models for complex prediction and suggest room for improvements."}}

In most MRL methods, molecules are treated as 1D sequential tokens or 2D topology graphs, limiting their ability to incorporate 3D information for downstream tasks and, in particular, making it almost impossible for 3D geometry prediction/generation. In this paper, we propose a universal 3D MRL framework, called Uni-Mol, that significantly enlarges the representation ability and application scope of MRL schemes. Uni-Mol contains two pretrained models with the same SE(3) Transformer architecture: a molecular model pretrained by 209M molecular conformations; a pocket model pretrained by 3M candidate protein pocket data. Besides, Uni-Mol contains several finetuning strategies to apply the pretrained models to various downstream tasks. By properly incorporating 3D information, Uni-Mol outperforms SOTA in 14/15 molecular property prediction tasks. Moreover, Uni-Mol achieves superior performance in 3D spatial tasks, including protein-ligand binding pose prediction, molecular conformation generation, etc. The code, model, and data are made publicly available at https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Mol."}}

Herein, we propose Uni-Mol, a universal MRL framework that significantly enlarges the representation ability and application scope of MRL schemes. Uni-Mol is composed of two models with the same SE(3)-equivariant transformer architecture: a molecular pretraining model trained by 209M molecular conformations; a pocket pretraining model trained by 3M candidate protein pocket data. The two models are used independently for separate tasks, and are combined when used in protein-ligand binding tasks. By properly incorporating 3D information, Uni-Mol outperforms SOTA in 14/15 molecular property prediction tasks. Moreover, Uni-Mol achieves superior performance in 3D spatial tasks, including protein-ligand binding pose prediction, molecular conformation generation, etc. Finally, we show that Uni-Mol can be successfully applied to the tasks with few-shot data like pocket druggability prediction.

The generative map from the latent space to the data space follows a dynamical system, where a learnable potential function guides a compressible fluid to flow towards the target density distribution. Training of the model amounts to solving an optimal control problem. The Monge-Amp\\`ere flow has tractable likelihoods and supports efficient sampling and inference. One can easily impose symmetry constraints in the generative model by designing suitable scalar potential functions. We apply the approach to unsupervised density estimation of the MNIST dataset and variational calculation of the two-dimensional Ising model at the critical point. This approach brings insights and techniques from Monge-Amp\\`ere equation, optimal transport, and fluid dynamics into reversible flow-based generative models. "}}

Of particular interest is the inter-atomic potential energy surface (PES). Here we develop Deep Potential - Smooth Edition (DeepPot-SE), an end-to-end machine learning-based PES model, which is able to efficiently represent the PES for a wide variety of systems with the accuracy of ab initio quantum mechanics models. By construction, DeepPot-SE is extensive and continuously differentiable, scales linearly with system size, and preserves all the natural symmetries of the system. Further, we show that DeepPot-SE describes finite and extended systems including organic molecules, metals, semiconductors, and insulators with high fidelity."}}
