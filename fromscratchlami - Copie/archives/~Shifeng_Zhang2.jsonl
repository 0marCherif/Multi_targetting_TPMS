To address this challenge, we propose a novel face detector, named FaceBoxes, with superior performance on both speed and accuracy. Specifically, our method has a lightweight yet powerful network structure that consists of the Rapidly Digested Convolutional Layers (RDCL) and the Multiple Scale Convolutional Layers (MSCL). The RDCL is designed to enable FaceBoxes to achieve real-time speed on the CPU. The MSCL aims at enriching the receptive fields and discretizing anchors over different layers to handle faces of various scales. Besides, we propose a new anchor densification strategy to make different types of anchors have the same density on the image, which significantly improves the recall rate of small faces. As a consequence, the proposed detector runs at 20 FPS on a single CPU core and 125 FPS using a GPU for VGA-resolution images. Moreover, the speed of FaceBoxes is invariant to the number of faces. We comprehensively evaluate this method and present state-of-the-art detection performance on several face detection benchmark datasets, including the AFW, PASCAL face, and FDDB."}}

Specifically, we try to solve the common problem that anchor-based detectors deteriorate dramatically as the objects become smaller. We make contributions in the following three aspects: 1) proposing a scale-equitable face detection framework to handle different scales of faces well. We tile anchors on a wide range of layers to ensure that all scales of faces have enough features for detection. Besides, we design anchor scales based on the effective receptive field and a proposed equal proportion interval principle; 2) improving the recall rate of small faces by a scale compensation anchor matching strategy; 3) reducing the false positive rate of small faces via a max-out background label. As a consequence, our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on all the common face detection benchmarks, including the AFW, PASCAL face, FDDB and WIDER FACE datasets, and can run at 36 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) for VGA-resolution images."}}

However, recent works have exposed its limitation on feature discriminability. This paper casts a new viewpoint on the weakness of softmax loss. On the one hand, the CNN features learned using the softmax loss are often inadequately discriminative. We hence introduce a soft-margin softmax function to explicitly encourage the discrimination between different classes. On the other hand, the learned classifier of softmax loss is weak. We propose to assemble multiple these weak classifiers to a strong one, inspired by the recognition that the diversity among weak classifiers is critical to a good ensemble. To achieve the diversity, we adopt the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). Considering these two aspects in one framework, we design a novel loss, named as Ensemble soft-Margin Softmax (EM-Softmax). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted to show the superiority of our design over the baseline softmax loss and several state-of-the-art alternatives."}}

To inherit the merits of both while overcoming their disadvantages, in this paper, we propose a novel single-shot based detector, called RefineDet, that achieves better accuracy than two-stage methods and maintains comparable efficiency of one-stage methods. RefineDet consists of two inter-connected modules, namely, the anchor refinement module and the object detection module. Specifically, the former aims to (1) filter out negative anchors to reduce search space for the classifier, and (2) coarsely adjust the locations and sizes of anchors to provide better initialization for the subsequent regressor. The latter module takes the refined anchors as the input from the former to further improve the regression and predict multi-class label. Meanwhile, we design a transfer connection block to transfer the features in the anchor refinement module to predict locations, sizes and class labels of objects in the object detection module. The multi-task loss function enables us to train the whole network in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012, and MS COCO demonstrate that RefineDet achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with high efficiency."}}

Meanwhile, we use a new part occlusion-aware region of interest (PORoI) pooling unit to replace the RoI pooling layer in order to integrate the prior structure information of human body with visibility prediction into the network to handle occlusion.

This paper presents a novel single-shot face detector, named Selective Refinement Network (SRN), which introduces novel two-step classification and regression operations selectively into an anchor-based face detector to reduce false positives and improve location accuracy simultaneously. In particular, the SRN consists of two modules: the Selective Two-step Classification (STC) module and the Selective Two-step Regression (STR) module. The STC aims to filter out most simple negative anchors from low level detection layers to reduce the search space for the subsequent classifier, while the STR is designed to coarsely adjust the locations and sizes of anchors from high level detection layers to provide better initialization for the subsequent regressor. Moreover, we design a Receptive Field Enhancement (RFE) block to provide more diverse receptive field, which helps to better capture faces in some extreme poses. As a consequence, the proposed SRN detector achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the widely used face detection benchmarks, including AFW, PASCAL face, FDDB, and WIDER FACE datasets. Codes will be released to facilitate further studies on the face detection problem."}}

In comparison with the state-of-the-art anchor-based face detection methods, the main advantages of our method are summarized in four aspects. (1) We propose a scale-aware detection network using a wide scale range of layers associated with appropriate scales of anchors to handle faces with various scales, and describe a new equal density principle to ensure anchors with different scales to be evenly distributed on the image. (2) To improve the recall rates of faces with certain scales (e.g., the scales of the faces are quite different from the scales of designed anchors), we design a new anchor matching strategy with scale compensation. (3) We introduce an IoU-aware weighting scheme for each training sample in classification loss calculation to encode samples accurately in training process. (4) Considering the class imbalance issue, a max-out background strategy is used to reduce false positives. Several experiments are conducted on public challenging face detection datasets, i.e., WIDER FACE, AFW, PASCAL Face, FDDB, and MAFA, to demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results and runs at 82.1 FPS for the VGA-resolution images."}}

To cope with these problems, training detectors from scratch is a feasible solution. However, the detectors trained from scratch generally perform worse than the pretrained ones, even suffer from the convergence issue in training. In this paper, we explore to train object detectors from scratch robustly. By analysing the previous work on optimization landscape, we find that one of the overlooked points in current trained-from-scratch detector is the BatchNorm. Resorting to the stable and predictable gradient brought by BatchNorm, detectors can be trained from scratch stably while keeping the favourable performance independent to the network architecture. Taking this advantage, we are able to explore various types of networks for object detection, without suffering from the poor convergence. By extensive experiments and analyses on downsampling factor, we propose the Root-ResNet backbone network, which makes full use of the information from original images. Our ScratchDet achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012 and MS COCO among all the train-from-scratch detectors and even performs better than several one-stage pretrained methods."}}
