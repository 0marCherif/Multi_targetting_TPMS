The task poses two core challenges. First, most existing radiance field reconstruction approaches rely on accurate pre-estimated camera poses from Structure-from-Motion algorithms, which frequently fail on in-the-wild videos. Second, using a single, global radiance field with finite representational capacity does not scale to longer trajectories in an unbounded scene. For handling unknown poses, we jointly estimate the camera poses with radiance field in a progressive manner. We show that progressive optimization significantly improves the robustness of the reconstruction. For handling large unbounded scenes, we dynamically allocate new local radiance fields trained with frames within a temporal window. This further improves robustness (e.g., performs well even under moderate pose drifts) and allows us to scale to large scenes. Our extensive evaluation on the Tanks and Temples dataset and our collected outdoor dataset, Static Hikes, show that our approach compares favorably with the state-of-the-art."}}

We propose a simple yet effective method for correcting perspective distortions in a single close-up face. We first perform GAN inversion using a perspective-distorted input facial image by jointly optimizing the camera intrinsic/extrinsic parameters and face latent code. To address the ambiguity of joint optimization, we develop optimization scheduling, focal length reparametrization, starting from a short distance, and geometric regularization. Re-rendering the portrait at a proper focal length and camera distance effectively corrects perspective distortions and produces more natural-looking results. Our experiments show that our method compares favorably against previous approaches qualitatively and quantitatively. We showcase numerous examples validating the applicability of our method on portrait photos in the wild. We will release our system and the evaluation protocol to facilitate future work."}}

These methods facilitate the training procedure of conditional score models, as a mixture of scores can be separately estimated using a score model and a classifier. However, our analysis indicates that the training objectives for the classifier in these methods may lead to a serious score mismatch issue, which corresponds to the situation that the estimated scores deviate from the true ones. Such an issue causes the samples to be misled by the deviated scores during the diffusion process, resulting in a degraded sampling quality. To resolve it, we theoretically formulate a novel training objective, called Denoising Likelihood Score Matching (DLSM) loss, for the classifier to match the gradients of the true log likelihood density. Our experimental evidences show that the proposed method outperforms the previous methods on both Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 benchmarks noticeably in terms of several key evaluation metrics. We thus conclude that, by adopting DLSM, the conditional scores can be accurately modeled, and the effect of the score mismatch issue is alleviated."}}

In this paper, we propose a method to estimate not only a depth map but an AiF image from a set of images with different focus positions (known as a focal stack). We design a shared architecture to exploit the relationship between depth and AiF estimation. As a result, the proposed method can be trained either supervisedly with ground truth depth, or unsupervisedly with AiF images as supervisory signals.

Our core technical novelty lies in the learning-based hybrid-space fusion that alleviates artifacts caused by optical flow inaccuracy and fast-moving objects. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the NUS, selfie, and DeepStab video datasets. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the merits of our approach over prior video stabilization methods."}}
