In such games, agents maximize their utility by choosing actions that differ from their neighbors' actions. Two important problems concerning evolutionary games are the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium (NE) and the convergence time of the dynamics. In this work, we study these two problems for anti-coordination games under sequential and synchronous update schemes. For each update scheme, we examine two decision modes based on whether an agent considers its own previous action (self essential ) or not (self non-essential ) in choosing its next action. Using a relationship between games and dynamical systems, we show that for both update schemes, finding an NE can be done efficiently under the self non-essential mode but is computationally intractable under the self essential mode. To cope with this hardness, we identify special cases for which an NE can be obtained efficiently. For convergence time, we show that the best-response dynamics converges in a polynomial number of steps in the synchronous scheme for both modes; for the sequential scheme, the convergence time is polynomial only under the self non-essential mode. Through experiments, we empirically examine the convergence time and the equilibria for both synthetic and real-world networks."}}

Specifically, agents are of two types (characterized by features), and we measure diversity by the number of agents who have at least one neighbor of a different type. This problem is known to be NP-hard, and we focus on developing approximation algorithms with provable performance guarantees. We first present a local-improvement algorithm for general graphs that provides an approximation factor of 1/2. For the special case where the sizes of agent subgroups are similar, we present a randomized approach based on semidefinite programming that yields an approximation factor better than 1/2. Further, we show that the problem can be solved efficiently when the underlying graph is treewidth-bounded and obtain a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the problem on planar graphs. Lastly, we conduct experiments to evaluate the per-performance of the proposed algorithms on synthetic and real-world networks."}}

Fixed points of such dynamical systems represent configurations to which the system converges. In the dissemination of undesirable contagions (such as rumors and misinformation), convergence to fixed points with a small number of affected nodes is a desirable goal. Motivated by such considerations, we formulate a novel optimization problem of finding a nontrivial fixed point of the system with the minimum number of affected nodes. We establish that, unless P = NP, there is no polynomial time algorithm for approximating a solution to this problem to within the factor n^1-\\epsilon for any constant epsilon > 0. To cope with this computational intractability, we identify several special cases for which the problem can be solved efficiently. Further, we introduce an integer linear program to address the problem for networks of reasonable sizes. For solving the problem on larger networks, we propose a general heuristic framework along with greedy selection methods. Extensive experimental results on real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics."}}

We assume a threshold model for the propagation of the two contagions and use the formal framework of discrete dynamical systems. In particular, we study an optimization problem where the goal is to minimize the total number of new infections subject to a budget constraint on the total number of available vaccinations for the contagions. While this problem has been considered in the literature for a single contagion, our work considers the simultaneous propagation of two contagions. This optimization problem is NP-hard. We present two main solution approaches for the problem, namely an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to obtain optimal solutions and a heuristic based on a generalization of the set cover problem. We carry out a comprehensive experimental evaluation of our solution approaches using many real-world networks. The experimental results show that our heuristic algorithm produces solutions that are close to the optimal solution and runs several orders of magnitude faster than the ILP-based approach for obtaining optimal solutions. We also carry out sensitivity studies of our heuristic algorithm."}}

Also, there are many methods to control or block contagion spread. In this work, we introduce a novel method of blocking contagions that uses nodes from dominating sets (DSs). To our knowledge, this is the first use of DS nodes to block contagions. Finding minimum dominating sets of graphs is an NP-Complete problem, so we generalize a well-known heuristic, enabling us to customize its execution. Our method produces a prioritized list of dominating nodes, which is, in turn, a prioritized list of blocking nodes. Thus, for a given network, we compute this list of blocking nodes and we use it to block contagions for all blocking node budgets, contagion seed sets, and parameter values of the contagion model. We report on computational experiments of the blocking efficacy of our approach using two mined networks. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing blocking results with those from the high degree heuristic, which is a common standard in blocking studies."}}

These spread mechanisms can be effectively represented as diffusion processes on multi-scale, spatial networks. Such network-based modeling and simulation approaches are being increasingly applied in this domain. However, these works tend to be largely domain-specific, lacking any graph theoretic formalisms, and do not take advantage of more recent developments in network science. This work is aimed toward filling some of these gaps. We develop a generic multi-scale spatial network framework that is applicable to a wide range of models developed in the literature on biological invasions. A key question we address is the following: how do individual pathways and their combinations influence the rate and pattern of spread? The analytical complexity arises more from the multi-scale nature and complex functional components of the networks rather than from the sizes of the networks. We present theoretical bounds on the spectral radius and the diameter of multi-scale networks. These two structural graph parameters have established connections to diffusion processes. Specifically, we study how network properties, such as spectral radius and diameter are influenced by model parameters. Further, we analyze a multi-pathway diffusion model from the literature by conducting simulations on synthetic and real-world networks and then use regression tree..."}}

Our focus is on resource allocation problems where agents may have restrictions that make them incompatible with some resources. We assume that a Principle chooses a maximum matching randomly so that each agent is matched to a resource with some probability. Agents would like to improve their chances of being matched by modifying their restrictions within certain limits. The Principle's goal is to advise an unsatisfied agent to relax its restrictions so that the total cost of relaxation is within a budget (chosen by the agent) and the increase in the probability of being assigned a resource is maximized. We establish hardness results for some variants of this budget-constrained maximization problem and present algorithmic results for other variants. We experimentally evaluate our methods on synthetic datasets as well as on two novel real-world datasets: a vacation activities dataset and a classrooms dataset."}}

Agents' requirements limit the set of compatible resources and the rounds in which they want to be matched. Viewing such an application as a multi-round matching problem on a bipartite compatibility graph between agents and resources, we show that a solution (i.e., a set of matchings, with one matching per round) can be found efficiently if one exists. To cope with situations where a solution does not exist, we consider two extensions. In the first extension, a benefit function is defined for each agent and the objective is to find a multi-round matching to maximize the total benefit. For a general class of benefit functions satisfying certain properties (including diminishing returns), we show that this multi-round matching problem is efficiently solvable. This class includes utilitarian and Rawlsian welfare functions. For another benefit function, we show that the maximization problem is NP-hard. In the second extension, the objective is to generate advice to each agent (i.e., a subset of requirements to be relaxed) subject to a budget constraint so that the agent can be matched. We show that this budget-constrained advice generation problem is NP-hard. For this problem, we develop an integer linear programming formulation as well as a heuristic based on local search. We experimentally evaluate our algorithms on synthetic networks and apply them to two real-world situations: shared office spaces and matching courses to classrooms."}}
