We propose a novel 3D Neural Embedding Likelihood (3DNEL) over RGB-D images to address this gap. 3DNEL uses neural embeddings to predict 2D-3D correspondences from RGB and combines this with depth in a principled manner. 3DNEL is trained entirely from synthetic images and generalizes to real-world data. To showcase this capability, we develop a multi-stage inverse graphics pipeline that uses 3DNEL for 6D object pose estimation from real RGB-D images. Our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in sim-to-real pose estimation on the YCB-Video dataset, and improves robustness, with significantly fewer large-error predictions. Unlike existing bottom-up, discriminative approaches that are specialized for pose estimation, 3DNEL adopts a probabilistic generative formulation that jointly models multi-object scenes. This generative formulation enables easy extension of 3DNEL to additional tasks like object and camera tracking from video, using principled inference in the same probabilistic model without task specific retraining."}}

Decentralized learning has thus been advocated and widely deployed to make efficient use of distributed datasets, with an extensive focus on supervised learning (SL) problems. Unfortunately, the majority of real-world data are unlabeled and can be highly heterogeneous across sources. In this work, we carefully study decentralized learning with unlabeled data through the lens of self-supervised learning (SSL), specifically contrastive visual representation learning. We study the effectiveness of a range of contrastive learning algorithms under a decentralized learning setting, on relatively large-scale datasets including ImageNet-100, MS-COCO, and a new real-world robotic warehouse dataset. Our experiments show that the decentralized SSL (Dec-SSL) approach is robust to the heterogeneity of decentralized datasets, and learns useful representation for object classification, detection, and segmentation tasks, even when combined with the simple and standard decentralized learning algorithm of Federated Averaging (FedAvg). This robustness makes it possible to significantly reduce communication and to reduce the participation ratio of data sources with only minimal drops in performance. Interestingly, using the same amount of data, the representation learned by Dec-SSL can not only perform on par with that learned by centralized SSL which requires communication and excessive data storage costs, but also sometimes outperform representations extracted from decentralized SL which requires extra knowledge about the data labels. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into understanding why data heterogeneity is less of a concern for Dec-SSL objectives, and introduce feature alignment and clustering techniques to develop a new Dec-SSL algorithm that further improves the performance, in the face of highly non-IID data. Our study presents positive evidence to embrace unlabeled data in decentralized learning, and we hope to provide new insights into whether and why decentralized SSL is effective and/or even advantageous."}}

Open-loop manipulation pipelines may fail due to inaccurate state estimation, while most end-to-end grasping methods have not yet scaled to complex scenes with obstacles. In this work, we propose a new method for end-to-end learning of 6D grasping in cluttered scenes. Our hierarchical framework learns collision-free target-driven grasping based on partial point cloud observations. We learn an embedding space to encode expert grasping plans during training and a variational autoencoder to sample diverse grasping trajectories at test time. Furthermore, we train a critic network for plan selection and an option classifier for switching to an instance grasping policy through hierarchical reinforcement learning. We evaluate and analyze our method and compare against several baselines in simulation, and demonstrate that our latent planning can generalize to real-world cluttered-scene grasping tasks. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>"}}

To this end, we present PredictionNet, a deep neural network (DNN) that predicts the motion of all surrounding traffic agents together with the ego-vehicle's motion. All predictions are probabilistic and are represented in a simple top-down rasterization that allows an arbitrary number of agents. Conditioned on a multi-layer map with lane information, the network outputs future positions, velocities, and backtrace vectors jointly for all agents including the ego-vehicle in a single pass. Trajectories are then extracted from the output. The network can be used to simulate realistic traffic, and it produces competitive results on popular benchmarks. More importantly, it has been used to successfully control a real-world vehicle for hundreds of kilometers, by combining it with a motion planning/control subsystem. The network runs faster than real-time on an embedded GPU, and the system shows good generalization (across sensory modalities and locations) due to the choice of input representation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by extending the DNN with reinforcement learning (RL), it can better handle rare or unsafe events like aggressive maneuvers and crashes."}}

We introduce a goal-auxiliary actor-critic algorithm, which uses grasping goal prediction as an auxiliary task to facilitate policy learning. The supervision on grasping goals can be obtained from the expert planner for known objects or from hindsight goals for unknown objects. Overall, our learned closed-loop policy achieves over $90\\%$ success rates on grasping various ShapeNet objects and YCB objects in simulation. The policy also transfers well to the real world with only one failure among grasping of ten different unseen objects in the presence of perception noises."}}
