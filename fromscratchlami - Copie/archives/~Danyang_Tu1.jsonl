The tubelet tokens structurize videos by agglomerating and linking semantically-related patch tokens along spatial and temporal domains, which enjoy two benefits: 1) Compactness: each token is learned by a selective attention mechanism to reduce redundant dependencies from others; 2) Expressiveness: each token is enabled to align with a semantic instance, i.e., an object or a human, thanks to agglomeration and linking. The effectiveness and efficiency of TUTOR are verified by extensive experiments. Results show our method outperforms existing works by large margins, with a relative mAP gain of $16.14\\%$ on VidHOI and a 2 points gain on CAD-120 as well as a $4 \\times$ speedup."}}

Current approaches decouple the HGT detection task into separate branches of salient object detection and human gaze prediction, employing a two-stage framework where human head locations must first be detected and then be fed into the next gaze target prediction sub-network. In contrast, we redefine the HGT detection task as detecting human head locations and their gaze targets, simultaneously. By this way, our method, named Human-Gaze-Target detection TRansformer or HGTTR, streamlines the HGT detection pipeline by eliminating all other additional components. HGTTR reasons about the relations of salient objects and human gaze from the global image context. Moreover, unlike existing two-stage methods that require human head locations as input and can predict only one human's gaze target at a time, HGTTR can directly predict the locations of all people and their gaze targets at one time in an end-to-end manner. The effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method are verified with extensive experiments on the two standard benchmark datasets, GazeFollowing and VideoAttentionTarget. Without bells and whistles, HGTTR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by large margins (6.4 mAP gain on GazeFollowing and 10.3 mAP gain on VideoAttentionTarget) with a much simpler architecture."}}

The primary theory underlying AR is human visual confusion, which allows users to perceive the real-world scenes and augmented contents (virtual-world scenes) simultaneously by superimposing them together. To achieve good Quality of Experience (QoE), it is important to understand the interaction between two scenarios, and harmoniously display AR contents. However, studies on how this superimposition will influence the human visual attention are lacking. Therefore, in this paper, we mainly analyze the interaction effect between background (BG) scenes and AR contents, and study the saliency prediction problem in AR. Specifically, we first construct a Saliency in AR Dataset (SARD), which contains 450 BG images, 450 AR images, as well as 1350 superimposed images generated by superimposing BG and AR images in pair with three mixing levels. A large-scale eye-tracking experiment among 60 subjects is conducted to collect eye movement data. To better predict the saliency in AR, we propose a vector quantized saliency prediction method and generalize it for AR saliency prediction. For comparison, three benchmark methods are proposed and evaluated together with our proposed method on our SARD. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method on both of the common saliency prediction problem and the AR saliency prediction problem over benchmark methods.

Iwin Transformer is a hierarchical Transformer which progressively performs token representation learning and token agglomeration within irregular windows. The irregular windows, achieved by augmenting regular grid locations with learned offsets, 1) eliminate redundancy in token representation learning, which leads to efficient human/object detection, and 2) enable the agglomerated tokens to align with humans/objects with different shapes, which facilitates the acquisition of highly-abstracted visual semantics for interaction recognition. The effectiveness and efficiency of Iwin Transformer are verified on the two standard HOI detection benchmark datasets, HICO-DET and V-COCO. Results show our method outperforms existing Transformers-based methods by large margins (3.7 mAP gain on HICO-DET and 2.0 mAP gain on V-COCO) with fewer training epochs ($0.5 \\times$)."}}
