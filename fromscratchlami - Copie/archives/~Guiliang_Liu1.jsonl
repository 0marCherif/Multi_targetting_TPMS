Meanwhile, federated learning (FL) addresses the data sharing problem, enabling privacy-preserved collaborative training to provide sufficient precious data. Great potential, therefore, arises with the confluence of them, known as multimodal federated learning. However, limitation lies in the predominant approaches as they often assume that each local dataset records samples from all modalities. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing an Unimodal Training - Multimodal Prediction (UTMP) framework under the context of multimodal federated learning. We design HA-Fedformer, a novel transformer-based model that empowers unimodal training with only a unimodal dataset at the client and multimodal testing by aggregating multiple clients' knowledge for better accuracy. The key advantages are twofold. Firstly, to alleviate the impact of data non-IID, we develop an uncertainty-aware aggregation method for the local encoders with layer-wise Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. Secondly, to overcome the challenge of unaligned language sequence, we implement a cross-modal decoder aggregation to capture the hidden signal correlation between decoders trained by data from different modalities. Our experiments on popular sentiment analysis benchmarks, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that HA-Fedformer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal models under the UTMP federated learning frameworks, with 15%-20% improvement on most attributes."}}

In many real-world problems, however, the constraints are often hard to specify mathematically and unknown to the RL agents. To tackle these issues, Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) empirically estimates constraints from expert demonstrations. As an emerging research topic, ICRL does not have common benchmarks, and previous works tested algorithms under hand-crafted environments with manually-generated expert demonstrations. In this paper, we construct an ICRL benchmark in the context of RL application domains, including robot control, and autonomous driving. For each environment, we design relevant constraints and train expert agents to generate demonstration data. Besides, unlike existing baselines that learn a deterministic constraint, we propose a variational ICRL method to model a posterior distribution of candidate constraints. We conduct extensive experiments on these algorithms under our benchmark and show how they can facilitate studying important research challenges for ICRL. The benchmark, including the instructions for reproducing ICRL algorithms, is available at https://github.com/Guiliang/ICRL-benchmarks-public."}}

While previous work has focused on recovering hard constraints, our method can recover cumulative soft constraints that the agent satisfies on average per episode. In IRL fashion, our method solves this problem by adjusting the constraint function iteratively through a constrained optimization procedure, until the agent behavior matches the expert behavior. We demonstrate our approach on synthetic environments, robotics environments and real world highway driving scenarios."}}

Previous methods commonly measured the impact of players' actions on desirable outcomes (e.g., goals or winning) without considering the risk induced by stochastic game dynamics.  In this paper, we design an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to learn a risk-sensitive player evaluation metric from stochastic game dynamics. To embed the risk of a player\u2019s movements into the distribution of action-values, we model their 1) aleatoric uncertainty, which represents the intrinsic stochasticity in a sports game, and 2) epistemic uncertainty, which is due to a model's insufficient knowledge regarding Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples. We demonstrate how a distributional Bellman operator and a feature-space density model can capture these uncertainties. Based on such uncertainty estimation, we propose a Risk-sensitive Game Impact Metric (RiGIM) that measures players' performance over a season by conditioning on a specific confidence level. Empirical evaluation, based on over 9M play-by-play ice hockey and soccer events, shows that RiGIM correlates highly with standard success measures and has a consistent risk sensitivity."}}
