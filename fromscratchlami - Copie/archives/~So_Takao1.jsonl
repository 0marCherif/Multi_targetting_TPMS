Motivated by a desire to deploy Gaussian processes in novel areas of science, a rapidly-growing line of research has focused on constructively extending these models to handle non-Euclidean domains, including Riemannian manifolds, such as spheres and tori. We propose techniques that generalize this class to model vector fields on Riemannian manifolds, which are important in a number of application areas in the physical sciences. To do so, we present a general recipe for constructing gauge independent kernels, which induce Gaussian vector fields, i.e. vector-valued Gaussian processes coherent with\ngeometry, from scalar-valued Riemannian kernels. We extend standard Gaussian process training methods, such as variational inference, to this setting. This enables vector-valued Gaussian processes on Riemannian manifolds to be trained using standard methods and makes them accessible to machine learning practitioners."}}

The result is the Kunita\u2013It\u00f4\u2013Wentzell (KIW) formula for k-forms. We also establish a correspondence between the KIW formula for k-forms derived here and a certain class of stochastic fluid dynamics models which preserve the geometric structure of deterministic ideal fluid dynamics. This geometric structure includes Eulerian and Lagrangian variational principles, Lie\u2013Poisson Hamiltonian formulations and natural analogues of the Kelvin circulation theorem, all derived in the stochastic setting."}}

Using the special geometric structure of Lie groups $$\\mathcal G$$ and dissipation fields compatible with the symplectic structure, we construct an irreversible HMC-like MCMC algorithm on $$\\mathcal G$$ , where we first update the momentum by solving an OU process on the corresponding Lie algebra $$\\mathfrak g$$ , and then approximate the Hamiltonian system on $$\\mathcal G\\times \\mathfrak g$$ with a reversible symplectic integrator followed by a Metropolis-Hastings correction step. In particular, when the OU process is simulated over sufficiently long times, we recover HMC as a special case. We illustrate this algorithm numerically using the example $$\\mathcal G= SO(3)$$ ."}}
