Planning-based algorithms show their advantages in collision avoidance while avoiding exponential growth in the number of agents. Reinforcement-learning (RL)-based algorithms can be deployed efficiently but cannot prevent collisions entirely due to the lack of hard constraints. This paper combines the merits of planning-based and RL-based MAPF methods to propose a deployment-efficient and collision-free MAPF algorithm. The experiments show the effectiveness of our approach."}}

Previous arts mainly focus on facilitating the coordination ability from different aspects (e.g., non-stationarity, credit assignment) in single-task or multi-task scenarios, ignoring the stream of tasks that appear in a continual manner. This ignorance makes the continual coordination an unexplored territory, neither in problem formulation nor efficient algorithms designed. Towards tackling the mentioned issue, this paper proposes an approach Multi-Agent Continual Coordination via Progressive Task Contextualization, dubbed MACPro. The key point lies in obtaining a factorized policy, using shared feature extraction layers but separated independent task heads, each specializing in a specific class of tasks. The task heads can be progressively expanded based on the learned task contextualization. Moreover, to cater to the popular CTDE paradigm in MARL, each agent learns to predict and adopt the most relevant policy head based on local information in a decentralized manner. We show in multiple multi-agent benchmarks that existing continual learning methods fail, while MACPro is able to achieve close-to-optimal performance. More results also disclose the effectiveness of MACPro from multiple aspects like high generalization ability."}}

The widely studied RL algorithms mainly focus on a single input form, such as pixel-based image input or symbolic vector input. These two forms have different characteristics and, in many scenarios, will appear together, while few RL algorithms have studied the problems with mixed input types. Specifically, in the scenario where both pixel and symbolic inputs are available, symbolic input usually offers abstract features with specific semantics, which is more conducive to the agent's focus. Conversely, pixel input provides more comprehensive information, enabling the agent to make well-informed decisions. Tailoring the processing approach based on the properties of these two input types can contribute to solving the problem more effectively. To tackle the above issue, we propose an Internal Logical Induction (ILI) framework that integrates deep RL and rule learning into one system. ILI utilizes the deep RL algorithm to process the pixel input and the rule learning algorithm to induce propositional logic knowledge from symbolic input. To efficiently combine these two mechanisms, we further adopt a reward shaping technique by treating valuable knowledge as intrinsic rewards for the RL procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that the ILI framework outperforms baseline approaches in RL problems with pixel-symbolic input, and its inductive knowledge exhibits transferability advantages when pixel input semantics change."}}

Previous multi-task MARL approaches require costly interactions to simultaneously learn or fine-tune policies in different tasks. However, the situation that an agent should generalize to multiple tasks with only offline data from limited tasks is more in line with the needs of real-world applications. Since offline multi-task data contains a variety of behaviors, an effective data-driven approach is to extract informative latent variables that can represent universal skills for realizing coordination across tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Offline MARL algorithm to Discover coordInation Skills (ODIS) from multi-task data. ODIS first extracts task-invariant coordination skills from offline multi-task data and learns to delineate different agent behaviors with the discovered coordination skills. Then we train a coordination policy to choose optimal coordination skills with the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. We further demonstrate that the discovered coordination skills can assign effective coordinative behaviors, thus significantly enhancing generalization to unseen tasks. Empirical results in cooperative MARL benchmarks, including the StarCraft multi-agent challenge, show that ODIS obtains superior performance in a wide range of tasks only with offline data from limited sources."}}

Popular MARL methods mainly focus on the scalability or the representational capacity of value functions. Such a learning paradigm can reduce agents' uncertainties and promote coordination. However, they fail to leverage the task structure decomposability, which generally exists in real-world multi-agent systems (MASs), leading to a significant amount of time exploring the optimal policy in complex scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework Multi-Agent Concentrative Coordination (MACC) based on task decomposition, with which an agent can implicitly form local groups to reduce the learning space to facilitate coordination. In MACC, agents first learn representations for subtasks from their local information and then implement an attention mechanism to concentrate on the most relevant ones. Thus, agents can pay targeted attention to specific subtasks and improve coordination. Extensive experiments on various complex multi-agent benchmarks demonstrate that MACC achieves remarkable performance compared to existing methods."}}

One popular communication scheme is exchanging agents' local observations or latent embeddings and using them to augment individual local policy input. Such a communication paradigm can reduce uncertainty for local decision-making and induce implicit coordination. However, it enlarges agents' local policy spaces and increases learning complexity, leading to poor coordination in complex settings. To handle this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework named Multi-Agent Incentive Communication (MAIC) that allows each agent to learn to generate incentive messages and bias other agents' value functions directly, resulting in effective explicit coordination. Our method firstly learns targeted teammate models, with which each agent can anticipate the teammate's action selection and generate tailored messages to specific agents. We further introduce a novel regularization to leverage interaction sparsity and improve communication efficiency. MAIC is agnostic to specific MARL algorithms and can be flexibly integrated with different value function factorization methods. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines and achieves excellent performance on multiple cooperative MARL tasks."}}
