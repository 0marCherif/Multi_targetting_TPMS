Unlike the human-centric solution, which requires months of intense effort by hardware engineers to produce a layout to minimize delay and energy consumption, deep reinforcement learning has become an emerging autonomous tool. However, the learning-centric method is still in its early stage, impeded by a massive design space of size ten to the order of a few thousand. This work presents MaskPlace to automatically generate a valid chip layout design within a few hours, whose performance can be superior or comparable to recent advanced approaches. It has several appealing benefits that prior arts do not have. Firstly, MaskPlace recasts placement as a problem of learning pixel-level visual representation to comprehensively describe millions of modules on a chip,  enabling placement in a high-resolution canvas and a large action space. It outperforms recent methods that represent a chip as a hypergraph. Secondly, it enables training the policy network by an intuitive reward function with dense reward, rather than a complicated reward function with sparse reward from previous methods. Thirdly, extensive experiments on many public benchmarks show that MaskPlace outperforms existing RL approaches in all key performance metrics, including wirelength, congestion, and density. For example, it achieves 60%-90% wirelength reduction and guarantees zero overlaps. We believe MaskPlace can improve AI-assisted chip layout design. The deliverables are released at https://laiyao1.github.io/maskplace."}}

Therefore, many researchers have proposed various machine learning models for DGA domain name detection, but how to detect unknown classes of DGA domain names (unknown DGAs) is still a challenging problem. In fact, the problem of detecting unknown classes is also called open set recognition problem. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel classification model OpenSMax which can not only detect various DGA domain names but also classify them into known and unknown classes of DGAs. In this model, we use the one-hot encoding method and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to extract the features of the Top Level Domain (TLD) and the Second Level Domain (SLD) respectively. Then, these two feature categories are concatenated and propagated forwards by two fully connected layers for known DGA domain name detection and classification. Finally, both the openmax layer (the layer before the softmax layer) and the softmax layer are used to build One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for unknown classes recognition. In our experiments, OpenSMax model outperforms the state-of-art methods both in known and unknown DGA domain names detection tasks. Also, OpenSMax provides a bounded open space risk in theory, and therefore it formally provides an effective solution for unknown DGA domain name detection."}}
