In this paper, we re-think this approach and propose a surprisingly simple yet effective detection-centric network for both LPS and tracking. Our network is modular by design and optimized for all aspects of both the panoptic segmentation and tracking task. One of the core components of our network is the object instance detection branch, which we train using point-level (modal) annotations, as available in segmentation-centric datasets. In the absence of amodal (cuboid) annotations, we regress modal centroids and object extent using trajectory-level supervision that provides information about object size, which cannot be inferred from single scans due to occlusions and the sparse nature of the lidar data. We obtain fine-grained instance segments by learning to associate lidar points with detected centroids. We evaluate our method on several 3D/4D LPS benchmarks and observe that our model establishes a new state-of-the-art among open-sourced models, outperforming recent query-based models."}}

Furthermore, existing real-world benchmarks and datasets do not categorize image data based on the types and appearances of reflection (e.g., smoothness, intensity), making it hard to analyze reflection removal methods. Hence, we construct a new reflection removal dataset that is categorized, diverse, and real-world (CDR). A pipeline based on RAW data is used to capture perfectly aligned input images and transmission images. The dataset is constructed using diverse glass types under various environments to ensure diversity. By analyzing several reflection removal methods and conducting extensive experiments on our dataset, we show that state-of-the-art reflection removal methods generally perform well on blurry reflection but fail in obtaining satisfying performance on other types of real-world reflection. We believe our dataset can help develop novel methods to remove real-world reflection better. Our dataset is available at https://alexzhao-hugga.github.io/Real-World-Reflection-Removal/."}}

It offers 3,670 hours of dailylife activity video spanning hundreds of scenarios (household, outdoor, workplace, leisure, etc.) captured by 931 unique camera wearers from 74 worldwide locations and 9 different countries. The approach to collection is designed to uphold rigorous privacy and ethics standards, with consenting participants and robust de-identification procedures where relevant. Ego4D dramatically expands the volume of diverse egocentric video footage publicly available to the research community. Portions of the video are accompanied by audio, 3D meshes of the environment, eye gaze, stereo, and/or synchronized videos from multiple egocentric cameras at the same event. Furthermore, we present a host of new benchmark challenges centered around understanding the first-person visual experience in the past (querying an episodic memory), present (analyzing hand-object manipulation, audio-visual conversation, and social interactions), and future (forecasting activities). By publicly sharing this massive annotated dataset and benchmark suite, we aim to push the frontier of first-person perception. Project page: https://ego4d-data.org/"}}

We first identify the misalignment issues of existing reflection removal datasets where the collected reflection-free images are not perfectly aligned with input mixed images due to glass refraction. Then we build a new dataset with more than 100 types of glass in which obtained transmission images are perfectly aligned with input mixed images. Second, capitalizing on the special relationship between reflection and polarized light, we propose a polarized reflection removal model with a two-stage architecture. In addition, we design a novel perceptual NCC loss that can improve the performance of reflection removal and general image decomposition tasks. We conduct extensive experiments, and results suggest that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on reflection removal."}}

While the VOS task can be naturally decoupled into image semantic segmentation and video object tracking, significantly much more research effort has been made in segmentation than tracking. In this paper, we introduce \"tracking-by-detection\" into VOS which can coherently integrates segmentation into tracking, by proposing a new temporal aggregation network and a novel dynamic time-evolving template matching mechanism to achieve significantly improved performance. Notably, our method is entirely online and thus suitable for one-shot learning, and our end-to-end trainable model allows multiple object segmentation in one forward pass. We achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the DAVIS benchmark without complicated bells and whistles in both speed and accuracy, with a speed of 0.14 second per frame and J &F measure of 75.9% respectively."}}
