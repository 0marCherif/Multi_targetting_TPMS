Here, we propose correlative information maximization between layer activations as an alternative normative approach to describe the signal propagation in biological neural networks in both forward and backward directions. This new framework addresses many concerns about the biological-plausibility of conventional artificial neural networks and the backpropagation algorithm. The coordinate descent-based optimization of the corresponding objective, combined with the mean square error loss function for fitting labeled supervision data, gives rise to a neural network structure that emulates a more biologically realistic network of multi-compartment pyramidal neurons with dendritic processing and lateral inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, our approach provides a natural resolution to the weight symmetry problem between forward and backward signal propagation paths, a significant critique against the plausibility of the conventional backpropagation algorithm. This is achieved by leveraging two alternative, yet equivalent forms of the correlative mutual information objective. These alternatives intrinsically lead to forward and backward prediction networks without weight symmetry issues, providing a compelling solution to this long-standing challenge."}}

Most prior attempts at this problem proposed neural networks that implement independent component analysis, which works under the limitation that latent elements are mutually independent. Here, we relax this limitation and propose a biologically plausible neural network that extracts correlated latent sources by exploiting information about their domains. To derive this network, we choose maximum correlative information transfer from inputs to outputs as the separation objective under the constraint that the outputs are restricted to their presumed sets. The online formulation of this optimization problem naturally leads to neural networks with local learning rules. Our framework incorporates infinitely many source domain choices and flexibly models complex latent structures. Choices of simplex or polytopic source domains result in networks with piecewise-linear activation functions. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate the superior correlated source separation capability for both synthetic and natural sources."}}

While the brain solves this blind source separation (BSS) problem continuously, its algorithms remain unknown. Previous work on biologically-plausible BSS algorithms assumed that observed signals are linear mixtures of statistically independent or uncorrelated sources, limiting the domain of applicability of these algorithms. To overcome this limitation, we propose novel biologically-plausible neural networks for the blind separation of potentially dependent/correlated sources. Differing from previous work, we assume some general geometric, not statistical, conditions on the source vectors allowing separation of potentially dependent/correlated sources. Concretely, we assume that the source vectors are sufficiently scattered in their domains which can be described by certain polytopes. Then, we consider recovery of these sources by the Det-Max criterion, which maximizes the determinant of the output correlation matrix to enforce a similar spread for the source estimates. Starting from this normative principle, and using a weighted similarity matching approach that enables arbitrary linear transformations adaptable by local learning rules, we derive two-layer biologically-plausible neural network algorithms that can separate mixtures into sources coming from a variety of source domains. We demonstrate that our algorithms outperform other biologically-plausible BSS algorithms on correlated source separation problems."}}
