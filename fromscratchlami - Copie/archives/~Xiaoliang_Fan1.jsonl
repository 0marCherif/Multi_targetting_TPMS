To alleviate this problem, crowd-based patrol forces including traffic police and voluntary participants have been employed in many cities. To adaptively optimize patrol routes with limited manpower, it is essential to be aware of traffic violation hotspots. Traditionally, traffic violation hotspots are directly inferred from experience, and existing patrol routes are usually fixed. In this paper, we propose a mobile crowdsensing-based framework to dynamically infer traffic violation hotspots and adaptively schedule crowd patrol routes. Specifically, we first extract traffic violation-prone locations from heterogeneous crowd-sensed data and propose a spatiotemporal context-aware self-adaptive learning model (CSTA) to infer traffic violation hotspots. Then, we propose a tensor-based integer linear problem modeling method (TILP) to adaptively find optimal patrol routes under human labor constraints. Experiments on real-world data from two Chinese cities (Xiamen and Chengdu) show that our approach accurately infers traffic violation hotspots with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F1-scores</i> above 90% in both cities, and generates patrol routes with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">relative coverage ratios</i> above 85%, significantly outperforming baseline methods."}}

Many existing FL frameworks offer a range of benchmarks to evaluate the performance of FL under realistic conditions. However, the process of customizing simulations to accommodate application-specific settings, data heterogeneity, and system heterogeneity typically remains unnecessarily complicated. This creates significant hurdles for traditional ML researchers in exploring the usage of FL, while also compromising the shareability of codes across FL frameworks. To address this issue, we propose a novel lightweight FL platform called FLGo, to facilitate cross-application FL studies with a high degree of shareability. Our platform offers 40+ benchmarks, 20+ algorithms, and 2 system simulators as out-of-the-box plugins. We also provide user-friendly APIs for quickly customizing new plugins that can be readily shared and reused for improved reproducibility. Finally, we develop a range of experimental tools, including parallel acceleration, experiment tracker and analyzer, and parameters auto-tuning. FLGo is maintained at \\url{flgo-xmu.github.io}."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel inductive graph representation learning model for spatio-temporal kriging. We first encode heterogeneous spatial relations between the unobserved and observed locations by their spatial proximity, functional similarity, and transition probability. Based on each relation, we accurately aggregate the information of most correlated observed locations to produce inductive representations for the unobserved locations, by jointly modeling their similarities and differences. Then, we design relation-aware gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks to adaptively capture the temporal correlations in the generated sequence representations for each relation.

First, we integrate the graphs with spatio-temporal similarity as mobility patterns through a mobility graph fusion module. Then, in the mobility pattern joint learning module, we design the multi-level cross-attention mechanism to learn the comprehensive embeddings from multiple mobility patterns based on intra-pattern and inter-pattern messages.

These data have irregular space and time coordinates. To represent geo-sensory data, there have been extensive research efforts using time sequences, grid-like images, and graph signals. However, there still lacks a proper representation that can describe both the mobile and stationary geo-sensory data without the information-losing discretization in spatial and temporal dimensions.

In this way, STPC-Net learns the key information of STPC, and overcomes challenges in data irregularity.
