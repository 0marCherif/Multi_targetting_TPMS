We propose GLSearch, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based learning to search model. Our model is built upon the branch and bound algorithm, which selects one pair of nodes from the two input graphs to expand at a time. We propose a novel GNN-based Deep Q-Network (DQN) to select the node pair, making the search process much faster. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graph pairs demonstrate that our model learns a search strategy that is able to detect significantly larger common subgraphs than existing MCS solvers given the same computation budget. GLSearch can be potentially extended to solve many other combinatorial problems with constraints on graphs."}}

As such, these KGs contain heterogeneous structures that are hierarchical, from the ontology-view, and cyclical, from the instance-view. Despite these various structures in KGs, most recent works on embedding KGs assume that the entire KG belongs to only one of the two views but not both simultaneously. For works that seek to put both views of the KG together, the instance and ontology views are assumed to belong to the same geometric space, such as all nodes embedded in the same Euclidean space or non-Euclidean product space, an assumption no longer reasonable for two-view KGs where different portions of the graph exhibit different structures. To address this issue, we define and construct a dual-geometric space embedding model (DGS) that models two-view KGs using a complex non-Euclidean geometric space, by embedding different portions of the KG in different geometric spaces. DGS utilizes the spherical space, hyperbolic space, and their intersecting space in a unified framework for learning embeddings. Furthermore, for the spherical space, we propose novel closed spherical space operators that directly operate in the spherical space without the need for mapping to an approximate tangent space. Experiments on public datasets show that DGS significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models on KG completion tasks, demonstrating its ability to better model heterogeneous structures in KGs."}}

Training is usually conducted on a given set of computation kernels (or kernels in short) needed for hardware acceleration. However, the model must also perform well on new kernels. The discrepancy between the training set and new kernels, called domain shift, frequently leads to model accuracy drop which in turn negatively impact the DSE performance. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of adapting an existing meta-learning approach, named MAML, to the task of design quality prediction. Experiments show the MAML-enhanced model outperforms a simple baseline based on fine tuning in terms of both offline evaluation on hold-out test sets and online evaluation for DSE speedup results1."}}

However, it still can take weeks to develop a high-performance architecture mainly because there are many design choices at a higher level to explore. Besides, it takes several minutes to hours to evaluate the design with the HLS tool. To solve this problem, we model the HLS tool with a graph neural network that is trained to be used for a wide range of applications. The experimental results demonstrate that our model can estimate the quality of design in milliseconds with high accuracy, resulting in up to 79X speedup (with an average of 48X) for optimizing the design compared to the previous state-of-the-art work relying on the HLS tool."}}

Notably, it is challenging and critical to consider both the developers' interests and the semantic features of the project code to recommend appropriate development tasks to OSS developers. In this paper, we formulate the novel problem of code recommendation, whose purpose is to predict the future contribution behaviors of developers given their interaction history, the semantic features of source code, and the hierarchical file structures of projects. Considering the complex interactions among multiple parties within the system, we propose CODER, a novel graph-based code recommendation framework for open source software developers. CODER jointly models microscopic user-code interactions and macroscopic user-project interactions via a heterogeneous graph and further bridges the two levels of information through aggregation on file-structure graphs that reflect the project hierarchy. Moreover, due to the lack of reliable benchmarks, we construct three large-scale datasets to facilitate future research in this direction. Extensive experiments show that our CODER framework achieves superior performance under various experimental settings, including intra-project, cross-project, and cold-start recommendation. We will release all the datasets, code, and utilities for data retrieval upon the acceptance of this work."}}
