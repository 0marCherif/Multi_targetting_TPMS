Existing approaches enhance few-shot generalization with the sacrifice of base-class performance, or maintain high precision in base-class detection with limited improvement in novel-class adaptation. In this paper, we point out the reason is insufficient Discriminative feature learning for all of the classes. As such, we propose a new training framework, DiGeo, to learn Geometry-aware features of interclass separation and intra-class compactness. To guide the separation of feature clusters, we derive an offline simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) classifier whose weights serve as class centers and are maximally and equally separated. To tighten the cluster for each class, we include adaptive class-specific margins into the classification loss and encourage the features close to the class centers. Experimental studies on two few-shot benchmark datasets (VOC, COCO) and one long-tail dataset (LVIS) demonstrate that, with a single model, our method can effectively improve generalization on novel classes without hurting the detection of base classes. Our code can be found here."}}

In this paper, we propose Cross-Domain Empirical Risk Minimization (xERM) for training an unbiased test-agnostic model to achieve strong performances on both test distributions, which empirically demonstrates that xERM fundamentally improves the classification by learning better feature representation rather than the\" head vs. tail\" game. Based on causality, we further theoretically explain why xERM achieves unbiasedness: the bias caused by the domain selection is removed by adjusting the empirical risks on the imbalanced domain and the balanced but unseen domain."}}

Most former works only attempted to mitigate biases in semantically low-level and conventional visual-question-answering typed datasets like VQA and GQA. However, these methods cannot generalize to recently emerging highly semantic VL datasets like VCR and are also difficult to scale due to many severe problems like high-cost labors, drastically disrupting the data distribution\\textit{, etc.}To resolve those problems and also address other unique biases on VCR-like datasets, we first conduct in-depth analysis and identify important biases in VCR dataset. We further propose a generalized solution that synthesizes counterfactual image and text data based on the original query's semantic focus while producing less distortion to the data distribution. To utilize our synthesized data, we also design an innovative intra-sample contrastive training strategy to assist QA learning in Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR). Moreover, our synthesized VL data also serve as a highly-semantic debiased benchmark for evaluating future VL models' robustness. Extensive experiments show that our proposed synthesized data and training strategy improve existing VL models' performances on both the original VCR dataset and our proposed debiased benchmark."}}

Nevertheless, they lose diversity and complexity due to the constraints in collecting data. Meanwhile, models pre-trained with image-only or text-only data (we call them unimodal pretrained models) continue to flourish and impress the community. Compared to image-text pairs, unimodal data has less constraints during the collection process resulting in more diverse styles. A natural question is how to leverage unimodal pretrained models to benefit downstream VL tasks? Most existing works focus on fusing VL information in the expensive pre-training stage. They directly plug in unimodal pre-trained encoders into a VL framework and redo an additional pre-training step on paired image-text data. This causes additional computation expense and the unimodal pretrained knowledge might be forgotten. In this paper, we take a different route and investigate how to fuse VL information in the finetuning stage oaly. To directly transfer pretrained knowledge from unimodal models to belp downstream VL tasks, we propose $\\mathrm{ADVL}$, which avoids redoing any pre-training step and is generalizable to be applied of top of various VL models. To comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of ADVL, we conduct evaluation across three mostly recognized highly semantic VL benchmarks: VCR, VQA, and SNLI-VE under three settings, low-shot, full-shot and domainshifted settings. Results show that ADVL consistently improves the performance with different VL base models across all settings. It even achieves state-of-theart (SOTA) performance on VCR among models pre-trained with image-text data and delivers competitive results on VQA and SNLI-VE, Based on our analysis, we also discover that ADVL can improve the robustness of VL models and regulate them to better use vision information."}}

Therefore, prompt shows a great potential for fast adapting the VLMs to downstream tasks if we fine-tune the prompt-based similarity measure. However, we find a common failure that improper fine-tuning may not only undermine the prompt's inherent prediction for the task-related classes, but also for other classes in the VLM vocabulary. Existing methods still address this problem by using traditional anti-overfitting techniques such as early stopping and data augmentation, which lack a principled solution specific to prompt. We present Prompt-aligned Gradient, dubbed $\\texttt{ProGrad}$, to prevent prompt tuning from forgetting the the general knowledge learned from VLMs. In particular, $\\texttt{ProGrad}$ only updates the prompt whose gradient is aligned (or non-conflicting) to the ``general direction'', which is represented as the gradient of the KL loss of the pre-defined prompt prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the stronger few-shot generalization ability of $\\texttt{ProGrad}$ over state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods. Codes are in Appendix."}}

The network response serves as additional supervision to formulate the machine domain, which uses the data collected from the human domain as a transfer set. Traditional KD methods hold an underlying assumption that the data collected in both human domain and machine domain are both independent and identically distributed (IID). We point out that this naive assumption is unrealistic and there is indeed a transfer gap between the two domains. Although the gap offers the student model external knowledge from the machine domain, the imbalanced teacher knowledge would make us incorrectly estimate how much to transfer from teacher to student per sample on the non-IID transfer set. To tackle this challenge, we propose Inverse Probability Weighting Distillation (IPWD) that estimates the propensity of a training sample belonging to the machine domain, and assigns its inverse amount to compensate for under-represented samples. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of \\ours~for both two-stage distillation and one-stage self-distillation."}}

Different from existing SSL solutions that overlook the role of  ''class'' in causing the non-randomness, e.g., users are more likely to label popular classes, we explicitly incorporate ''class'' into SSL. Our method is three-fold: 1) We propose Class-Aware Propensity (CAP) that exploits the unlabeled data to train an improved classifier using the biased labeled data. 2) To encourage rare class training, whose model is low-recall but high-precision that discards too many pseudo-labeled data, we propose Class-Aware Imputation (CAI) that dynamically decreases (or increases) the pseudo-label assignment threshold for rare (or frequent) classes. 3) Overall, we integrate CAP and CAI into a Class-Aware Doubly Robust (CADR) estimator for training an unbiased SSL model. Under various MNAR settings and ablations, our method not only significantly outperforms existing baselines, but also surpasses other label bias removal SSL methods.\n"}}

Recent debiasing methods achieve good out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability with a considerable sacrifice of the in-distribution (ID) performance. Therefore, they are only applicable in domains where the test distribution is known in advance. In this paper, we present a novel debiasing method called Introspective Distillation (IntroD) to make the best of both worlds for QA. Our key technical contribution is to blend the inductive bias of OOD and ID by introspecting whether a training sample fits in the factual ID world or the counterfactual OOD one. Experiments on visual QA datasets VQA v2, VQA-CP, and reading comprehension dataset SQuAD demonstrate that our proposed IntroD maintains the competitive OOD performance compared to other debiasing methods, while sacrificing little or even achieving better ID performance compared to the non-debiasing ones."}}

Given such SGG, the down-stream tasks such as VQA can hardly infer better scene structures than merely a bag of objects. However, debiasing in SGG is not trivial because traditional debiasing methods cannot distinguish between the good and bad bias, e.g., good context prior (e.g., \"person read book\" rather than \"eat\") and bad long-tailed bias (e.g., \"near\" dominating \"behind / in front of\"). In this paper, we present a novel SGG framework based on causal inference but not the conventional likelihood. We first build a causal graph for SGG, and perform traditional biased training with the graph. Then, we propose to draw the counterfactual causality from the trained graph to infer the effect from the bad bias, which should be removed. In particular, we use Total Direct Effect (TDE) as the proposed final predicate score for unbiased SGG. Note that our framework is agnostic to any SGG model and thus can be widely applied in the community who seeks unbiased predictions. By using the proposed Scene Graph Diagnosis toolkit on the SGG benchmark Visual Genome and several prevailing models, we observed significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art methods."}}
