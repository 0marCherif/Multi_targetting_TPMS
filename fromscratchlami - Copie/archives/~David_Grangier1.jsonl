This provides some shift-invariance while reducing the computational complexity of the whole architecture. A critical hyperparameter of such layers is their stride: the integer factor of downsampling. As strides are not differentiable, finding the best configuration either requires cross-validation or discrete optimization (e.g. architecture search), which rapidly become prohibitive as the search space grows exponentially with the number of downsampling layers. Hence, exploring this search space by gradient descent would allow finding better configurations at a lower computational cost. This work introduces DiffStride, the first downsampling layer with learnable strides. Our layer learns the size of a cropping mask in the Fourier domain, that effectively performs resizing in a differentiable way. Experiments on audio and image classification show the generality and effectiveness of our solution: we use DiffStride as a drop-in replacement to standard downsampling layers and outperform them. In particular, we show that introducing our layer into a ResNet-18 architecture allows keeping consistent high performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet even when training starts from poor random stride configurations. Moreover, formulating strides as learnable variables allows us to introduce a regularization term that controls the computational complexity of the architecture. We show how this regularization allows trading off accuracy for efficiency on ImageNet."}}

In this case,\ncareful consideration is needed to select tasks and model parameterizations such that updates from\nthe auxiliary tasks actually help the primary task. We seek to alleviate this burden by formulating a model-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained manipulation of the auxiliary task gradients. We propose to decompose auxiliary updates into directions which help, damage or leave the primary task loss unchanged. This allows weighting the update directions \ndifferently depending on their impact on the problem of interest. We present a novel and efficient algorithm for that\npurpose and show its advantage in practice. Our method leverages efficient automatic differentiation \nprocedures and randomized singular value decomposition for scalability. We show that our framework is \ngeneric and encompasses some prior work as particular cases. Our approach consistently outperforms strong and widely used baselines when leveraging out-of-distribution data for Text and Image classification tasks."}}

The dataset comprises 270K threads from the Reddit forum ``Explain Like I'm Five'' (ELI5) where an online community provides answers to questions which are comprehensible by five year olds. Compared to existing datasets, ELI5 comprises diverse questions requiring multi-sentence answers. We provide a large set of web documents to help answer the question. Automatic and human evaluations show that an abstractive model trained with a multi-task objective outperforms conventional Seq2Seq, language modeling, as well as a strong extractive baseline. However, our best model is still far from human performance since raters prefer gold responses in over 86% of cases, leaving ample opportunity for future improvement."}}

Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers quadratic compute and\nmemory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to\nreduce this complexity focused on attention to local sliding windows or a small\nset of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic\nsparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend\nto content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of\nresearch: it combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse\nattention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse\nattention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse\nrouting module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of\nattention to O(n^{1.5}d) from O(n^2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension\nd. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on\nlanguage modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity) as well as on\nimage generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers.\nCode will be open-sourced on acceptance."}}

This work broadens the understanding of back-translation and investigates a number of methods to generate synthetic source sentences. We find that in all but resource poor settings back-translations obtained via sampling or noised beam outputs are most effective. Our analysis shows that sampling or noisy synthetic data gives a much stronger training signal than data generated by beam or greedy search. We also compare how synthetic data compares to genuine bitext and study various domain effects. Finally, we scale to hundreds of millions of monolingual sentences and achieve a new state of the art of 35 BLEU on the WMT'14 English-German test set."}}

Our model then generates a new sentence which reformulates the initial sentence by avoiding marked words. The approach builds upon neural sequence-to-sequence modeling and introduces a neural network which takes as input a sentence along with change markers. Our model is trained on translation bitext by simulating post-edits. We demonstrate the advantage of our approach for translation post-editing through simulated post-edits.
