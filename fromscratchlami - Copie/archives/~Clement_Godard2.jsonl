While depth-based fusion is the foundation of most real-time approaches for 3D reconstruction, recent learning based methods that operate directly on RGB images can achieve higher quality reconstructions, but at the cost of increased runtime and memory requirements, making them unsuitable for AR applications. We propose an efficient learning-based method that refines the 3D reconstruction obtained by a traditional fusion approach. By leveraging a top-down heightfield representation, our method remains real-time while approaching the quality of other learning-based methods. Despite being a simplification, our heightfield is perfectly appropriate for robotic path planning or augmented reality character placement. We outline several innovations that push the performance beyond existing top-down prediction baselines, and we present an evaluation framework on the challenging ScanNetV2 dataset, targeting AR tasks. Ultimately, we show that our method improves over the baselines for AR applications."}}

Recently, a family of methods have emerged that perform reconstruction directly in final 3D volumetric\nfeature space. While these methods have shown impressive reconstruction results, they rely on expensive 3D convolutional layers, limiting their application in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we instead go back to the traditional route, and show how focusing on high quality multi-view depth prediction leads to highly accurate 3D reconstructions using simple off-the-shelf depth fusion. We propose a simple state-of-the-art multi-view depth estimator with two main contributions: 1) a carefully-designed 2D CNN which utilizes strong image priors alongside a plane-sweep feature volume and geometric losses, combined with 2) the integration of keyframe and geometric metadata into the cost volume which allows informed depth plane scoring. Our method achieves a significant lead over the current state-of-the-art for depth estimation and close or better for 3D reconstruction on ScanNet and 7-Scenes, yet still allows for online real-time low-memory reconstruction.

The shapes of diffuse and rough specular objects can be captured in an uncontrolled setting using consumer equipment. In contrast, highly specular objects have previously deterred capture in uncontrolled environments and have only been reconstructed using tailor-made hardware. We propose a method to reconstruct such objects in uncontrolled environments using only commodity hardware. As input, our method expects multi-view photographs of the specular object, its silhouettes and an environment map of its surroundings.\n\nWe compare the reflected colors in the photographs with the ones in the environment to form probability distributions over the surface normals. As the effect of inter-reflections cannot be ignored for highly specular objects, we explicitly model them when forming the probability distributions. We recover the shape of the object in an iterative process where we alternate between estimating normals and updating the shape of the object to better explain these normals.\n\nWe run experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, that show our method is robust and produces accurate reconstructions with as few as 25 input photographs."}}

To overcome this limitation, self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising alternative for training models to perform monocular depth estimation. In this paper, we propose a set of improvements, which together result in both quantitatively and qualitatively improved depth maps compared to competing self-supervised methods. Research on self-supervised monocular training usually explores increasingly complex architectures, loss functions, and image formation models, all of which have recently helped to close the gap with fully-supervised methods. We show that a surprisingly simple model, and associated design choices, lead to superior predictions. In particular, we propose (i) a minimum reprojection loss, designed to robustly handle occlusions, (ii) a full-resolution multi-scale sampling method that reduces visual artifacts, and (iii) an auto-masking loss to ignore training pixels that violate camera motion assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in isolation, and show high quality, state-of-the-art results on the KITTI benchmark."}}

One strategy for mitigating noise in low-light situations is to increase the shutter time, allowing each photosite to integrate more light and decrease noise variance. However, there are two downsides of long exposures: (a) bright regions can exceed the sensor range, and (b) camera and scene motion will cause blur. Another way of gathering more light is to capture multiple short (thus noisy) frames in a burst and intelligently integrate the content, thus avoiding the above downsides. In this paper, we use the burst-capture strategy and implement the intelligent integration via a recurrent fully convolutional deep neural net (CNN). We build our novel, multi-frame architecture to be a simple addition to any single frame denoising model. The resulting architecture denoises all frames in a sequence of arbitrary length. We show that it achieves state of the art denoising results on our burst dataset, improving on the best published multi-frame techniques, such as VBM4D and FlexISP. Finally, we explore other applications of multi-frame image enhancement and show that our CNN architecture generalizes well to image super-resolution."}}

However, most existing approaches treat depth prediction as a supervised regression problem and as a result, require vast quantities of corresponding ground truth depth data for training. Just recording quality depth data in a range of environments is a challenging problem. In this paper, we innovate beyond existing approaches, replacing the use of explicit depth data during training with easier-to-obtain binocular stereo footage. We propose a novel training objective that enables our convolutional neural network to learn to perform single image depth estimation, despite the absence of ground truth depth data. Ex-ploiting epipolar geometry constraints, we generate disparity images by training our network with an image reconstruction loss. We show that solving for image reconstruction alone results in poor quality depth images. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel training loss that enforces consistency between the disparities produced relative to both the left and right images, leading to improved performance and robustness compared to existing approaches. Our method produces state of the art results for monocular depth estimation on the KITTI driving dataset, even outperforming supervised methods that have been trained with ground truth depth."}}
