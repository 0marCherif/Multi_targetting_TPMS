In this paper, we employ Bayesian Bayesian nonparametric methods to address these challenges. In particular, we propose modeling the multiple object parameter state prior using the dependent Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes. These nonparametric models have been shown to be more flexible and robust, when compared to existing methods, for estimating the time-varying number of objects, providing object labeling and identifying measurement to object associations. Monte Carlo sampling methods are then proposed to efficiently learn the trajectory of objects from noisy measurements. Using simulations, we demonstrate the estimation performance advantage of the new methods when compared to existing algorithms such as the generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli filter."}}

This process is shown to be more flexible and a better match than the dependent Dirichlet process in tracking a time-varying number of objects. The DPY model directly incorporates learning multiple parameters from correlated information. Integrated with a Dirichlet process mixture model, the overall approach estimates time dependent object cardinality, provides object labeling, and identifies object associated measurements. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods, the performance of the DPY based approach is demonstrated and compared to the labeled multi Bernoulli tracker."}}

However, some of the challenging problems including time dependent cardinality, unordered measurement set, and object labeling remain unclear. In this paper, we propose robust nonparametric methods to model the state prior for MOT problem. These models are shown to be more flexible and robust compared to existing methods. In particular, the overall approach estimates time dependent object cardinality, provides object labeling, and identifies object associated measurements. Moreover, our proposed framework dynamically contends with the birth/death and survival of the objects through dependent nonparametric processes. We present Inference algorithms that demonstrate the utility of the dependent nonparametric models for tracking. We employ Monte Carlo sampling methods to demonstrate the proposed algorithms efficiently learn the trajectory of objects from noisy measurements. The computational results display the performance of the proposed algorithms and comparison not only between one another, but also between proposed algorithms and labeled multi Bernoulli tracker."}}

Based on the sensing modalities, these observations are associated with different measurement models. They are also statistically dependent if acquired synchronously while capturing the same scene. Although dependency among measurements is largely overlooked, improved performance can be achieved if this additional information is modeled and incorporated in the tracking formulation. This paper employs a hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture to model the data dependency and extract the time-varying cardinality of the measurements of each sensor. The hierarchical Dirichlet process framework provides a joint measurement density model that is integrated with Bayesian tracking methods to estimate the target state information."}}

Another challenge is how to robustly associate objects on a new scene with previously estimated objects. We propose a new method to track a dynamically varying number of objects using information from previously tracked ones. Our method is based on nonparametric Bayesian modeling using diffusion processes and random trees. We use simulations to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and compare it to a labeled multi-Bernoulli filter based tracker."}}

The problem becomes even more challenging when the unordered measurements have a large number of false alarms due to high noise or clutter. We propose a new approach that exploits the dependent Dirichlet process as the prior on the evolving object-state distributions. At each time step, a Dirichlet process mixture model, integrated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, is also used to learn the object-state identity from the measurements and infer the time- dependent object cardinality. A radar tracking example, with ten targets that are present in the observation scene at different times, is used to evaluate the new approach. We also compare it to the labeled multi-Bernoulli filter and demonstrate its improved tracking performance."}}
