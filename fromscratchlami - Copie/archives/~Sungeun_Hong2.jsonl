Compared to conventional anytime networks only with the depth controllability, the increased architectural diversity leads to higher resource utilization and consequent performance improvement under various and dynamic resource budgets. We highlight architectural features to make our scheme feasible as well as efficient, and show its effectiveness in image classification tasks."}}
