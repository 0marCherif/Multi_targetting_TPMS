However, contrastive learning is susceptible to feature suppression \u2013 i.e., it may discard important information relevant to the task of interest, and learn irrelevant features. Past work has addressed this limitation via handcrafted data augmentations that eliminate irrelevant information. This approach however does not work across all datasets and tasks. Further, data augmentations fail in addressing feature suppression in multi-attribute classification when one attribute can suppress features relevant to other attributes. In this paper, we analyze the objective function of contrastive learning and formally prove that it is vulnerable to feature suppression. We then present Predictive Contrastive Learning (PrCL), a framework for learning unsupervised representations that are robust to feature suppression. The key idea is to force the learned representation to predict the input, and hence prevent it from discarding important information. Extensive experiments verify that PrCL is robust to feature suppression and outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods on a variety of datasets and tasks."}}

But what if it is too dark, or if the person is occluded or behind a wall? In this paper, we introduce a neural network model that can detect human actions through walls and occlusions, and in poor lighting conditions. Our model takes radio frequency (RF) signals as input, generates 3D human skeletons as an intermediate representation, and recognizes actions and interactions of multiple people over time. By translating the input to an intermediate skeleton-based representation, our model can learn from both vision-based and RF-based datasets, and allow the two tasks to help each other. We show that our model achieves comparable accuracy to vision-based action recognition systems in visible scenarios, yet continues to work accurately when people are not visible, hence addressing scenarios that are beyond the limit of today's vision-based action recognition."}}

We leverage that radio frequency (RF) signals in the WiFi range traverse clothes and occlusions and bounce off the human body. Our model parses such radio signals and recovers 3D body meshes. Our meshes are dynamic and smoothly track the movements of the corresponding people. Further, our model works both in single and multi-person scenarios. Inferring body meshes from radio signals is a highly under-constrained problem. Our model deals with this challenge using: 1) a combination of strong and weak supervision, 2) a multi-headed self-attention mechanism that attends differently to temporal information in the radio signal, and 3) an adversarially trained temporal discriminator that imposes a prior on the dynamics of human motion. Our results show that RF-Avatar accurately recovers dynamic 3D meshes in the presence of occlusions, baggy clothes, bad lighting conditions, and even through walls."}}

Recently, researchers have in-vestigated the potential of supervised contrastive learning for long-tailed recognition, and demonstrated that it provides a strong performance gain. In this paper, we show that while supervised contrastive learning can help improve performance, past baselines suffer from poor uniformity brought in by imbalanced data distribution. This poor uni-formity manifests in samples from the minority class having poor separability in the feature space. To address this problem, we propose targeted supervised contrastive learning (TSC), which improves the uniformity of the feature distribution on the hypersphere. TSC first generates a set of targets uniformly distributed on a hypersphere. It then makes the features of different classes converge to these distinct and uniformly distributed targets during training. This forces all classes, including minority classes, to main-tain a uniform distribution in the feature space, improves class boundaries, and provides better generalization even in the presence of long-tail data. Experiments on multi-ple datasets show that TSC achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-tailed recognition tasks."}}

It leverages that RF signals traverse walls and occlusions to deliver through-wall pose estimation, action recognition, scene captioning, and human re-identification. However, unlike RGB datasets which can be labeled by human workers, labeling RF signals is a daunting task because such signals are not human interpretable. Yet, it is fairly easy to collect unlabelled RF signals. It would be highly beneficial to use such unlabeled RF data to learn useful representations in an unsupervised manner. Thus, in this paper, we explore the feasibility of adapting RGB-based unsupervised representation learning to RF signals. We show that while contrastive learning has emerged as the main technique for unsupervised representation learning from images and videos, such methods produce poor performance when applied to sensing humans using RF signals. In contrast, predictive unsupervised learning methods learn high-quality representations that can be used for multiple downstream RF-based sensing tasks. Our empirical results show that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art RF-based human sensing on various tasks, opening the possibility of unsupervised representation learning from this novel modality."}}

However, these models are typically trained independently, which ignores the potential for each task to help the other, and leads to training and model maintenance overheads. In this work, we propose MAsked Generative Encoder (MAGE), the first framework to unify SOTA image generation and self-supervised representation learning. Our key insight is that using variable masking ratios in masked image modeling pre-training can allow generative training (very high masking ratio) and representation learning (lower masking ratio) under the same training framework. Inspired by previous generative models, MAGE uses semantic tokens learned by a vector-quantized GAN at inputs and outputs, combining this with masking. We can further improve the representation by adding a contrastive loss to the encoder output. We extensively evaluate the generation and representation learning capabilities of MAGE. On ImageNet-1K, a single MAGE ViT-L model obtains 9.10 FID in the task of class-unconditional image generation and 78.9% top-1 accuracy for linear probing, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image generation and representation learning.

We introduce RF-Diary, a new model for captioning daily life by analyzing the privacy-preserving radio signal in the home with the home\u2019s floormap. RF-Diary can further observe and caption people\u2019s life through walls and occlusions and in dark settings. In designing RF-Diary, we exploit the ability of radio signals to capture people\u2019s 3D dynamics, and use the floormap to help the model learn people\u2019s interactions with objects. We also use a multi-modal feature alignment training scheme that leverages existing video-based captioning datasets to improve the performance of our radio-based captioning model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RF-Diary generates accurate captions under visible conditions. It also sustains its good performance in dark or occluded settings, where video-based captioning approaches fail to generate meaningful captions.(For more information, please visit our project webpage: http://rf-diary.csail.mit.edu )"}}

Existing ReID methods rely on images or videos collected using RGB cameras. They extract appearance features like clothes, shoes, hair, etc. Such features, however, can change drastically from one day to the next, leading to inability to identify people over extended time periods. In this paper, we introduce RF-ReID, a novel approach that harnesses radio frequency (RF) signals for longterm person ReID. RF signals traverse clothes and reflect off the human body; thus they can be used to extract more persistent human-identifying features like body size and shape. We evaluate the performance of RF-ReID on longitudinal datasets that span days and weeks, where the person may wear different clothes across days. Our experiments demonstrate that RF-ReID outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-based ReID approaches for long term person ReID. Our results also reveal two interesting features: First since RF signals work in the presence of occlusions and poor lighting, RF-ReID allows for person ReID in such scenarios. Second, unlike photos and videos which reveal personal and private information, RF signals are more privacy-preserving, and hence can help extend person ReID to privacy-concerned domains, like healthcare."}}

However, conventional fine-tuning suffers from the requirement of a large training set and the time-consuming training procedure. This paper proposes a novel solution for knowledge distillation from label-free few samples to realize both data efficiency and training/processing efficiency. We treat the original network as \"teacher-net\" and the compressed network as \"student-net\". A 1x1 convolution layer is added at the end of each layer block of the student-net, and we fit the block-level outputs of the student-net to the teacher-net by estimating the parameters of the added layers. We prove that the added layer can be merged without adding extra parameters and computation cost during inference. Experiments on multiple datasets and network architectures verify the method's effectiveness on student-nets obtained by various network pruning and weight decomposition methods. Our method can recover student-net's accuracy to the same level as conventional fine-tuning methods in minutes while using only 1% label-free data of the full training data."}}
