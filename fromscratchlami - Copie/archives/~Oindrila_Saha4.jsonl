In this paper, we introduce RNNPool, a novel pooling operator based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), that efficiently aggregates features over large patches of an image and rapidly downsamples activation maps. Empirical evaluation indicates that an RNNPool layer can effectively replace multiple blocks in a variety of architectures such as MobileNets, DenseNet when applied to standard vision tasks like image classification and face detection.

We propose a framework to exploit coarse labels such as figure-ground masks and keypoint locations that are readily available for some categories to improve part segmentation models. A key challenge is that these annotations were collected for different tasks and with different labeling styles and cannot be readily mapped to the part labels. To this end, we propose to jointly learn the dependencies between labeling styles and the part segmentation model, allowing us to utilize supervision from diverse labels. To evaluate our approach we develop a benchmark on the Caltech-UCSD birds and OID Aircraft dataset. Our approach outperforms baselines based on multi-task learning, semi-supervised learning, and competitive methods relying on loss functions manually designed to exploit sparse-supervision."}}

However, publicly available saliency prediction datasets can be utilized to create more information for each stimulus than just a final aggregate saliency map. This information when utilized in a biologically inspired fashion can contribute in better prediction performance without the use of models with huge number of parameters. In this light, we propose to extract and use the statistics of (a) region specific saliency and (b) temporal order of fixations, to provide additional context to our network. We show that extra supervision using spatially or temporally sequenced fixations results in achieving better performance in saliency prediction. Further, we also design novel architectures for utilizing this extra information and show that it achieves superior performance over a base model which is devoid of extra supervision. We show that our best method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with 50-80% fewer parameters. We also show that our models perform consistently well across all evaluation metrics unlike prior methods."}}

Retinopathy can affect all diabetic patients and becomes particularly dangerous, increasing the risk of blindness, if it is left untreated. The success rate of its curability solemnly depends on diagnosis at an early stage. The development of automated computer aided disease diagnosis tools could help in faster detection of symptoms with a wider reach and reasonable cost. This paper proposes a method for the automated segmentation of retinal lesions and optic disk in fundus images using a deep fully convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation. This trainable segmentation pipeline consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by pixel-wise classification to segment microaneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates, soft exudates, optic disk from background. The network was trained using Binary cross entropy criterion with Sigmoid as the last layer, while during an additional SoftMax layer was used for boosting response of single class. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using sensitivity, positive prediction value (PPV) and accuracy as the metrices. Further, the position of the Optic disk is localised using the segmented output map."}}

Studying the 2016 US Presidential Debates", "abstract": "Social media is the primary platform for discussions and reactions during various social events. Studies in this space focus on the aggregate opinion and sentiment analysis but fail to analyze the micro-dynamics. In this work, we present a case study of the 2016 US Presidential Debates, analyzing the user opinion micro-dynamics across the timeline. We present an opinion variation analysis coupled with micro and macro level user analysis in order to explain opinion change. We also identify and characterize varied user-groups derived through this analyses. We discover that aggregate change in opinion is better explained by the differential influx of polarized population rather than the change in individual\u2019s stance or opinion."}}
