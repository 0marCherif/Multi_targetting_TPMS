The current certification process for assessing robustness is costly and time-consuming due to the extensive number of image projections required for Monte Carlo sampling in the 3D camera motion space. To address these challenges, we present a novel, efficient, and practical framework for certifying the robustness of 3D-2D projective transformations against camera motion perturbations. Our approach leverages a smoothing distribution over the 2D pixel space instead of in the 3D physical space, eliminating the need for costly camera motion sampling and significantly enhancing the efficiency of robustness certifications. With the pixel-wise smoothed classifier, we are able to fully upper bound the projection errors using a technique of uniform partitioning in camera motion space. Additionally, we extend our certification framework to a more general scenario where only a single-frame point cloud is required in the projection oracle. Through extensive experimentation, we validate the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency enabled by our proposed method. Remarkably, our approach achieves approximately 80% certified accuracy while utilizing only 30% of the projected image frames.

(2) We regularize the model for smoother performance on the continuous geodesic path connecting subpopulation distributions. (3) Additionally, we provide a theoretical guarantee of robustness improvement and investigate how the geodesic location and the sample size contribute, respectively. Experimental validations of the proposed strategy on four datasets, including CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, establish the efficacy of our method, e.g., our method improves the baselines' certifiable robustness on CIFAR10 up to $7.7\\%$, with $16.8\\%$ on empirical robustness on CIFAR-100. Our work provides a new perspective of model robustness through the lens of Wasserstein geodesic-based interpolation with a practical off-the-shelf strategy that can be combined with existing robust training methods."}}

This task is particularly challenging due to the complex dynamics of fluid and the need to achieve multi-modal goals. The policy is required to successfully reach both position goals and water amount goals, which leads to a large convoluted goal state space. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Goal Sampling Adaptation for Scooping (GOATS), a curriculum reinforcement learning method that can learn an effective and generalizable policy for robot scooping tasks. Specifically, we use a goal-factorized reward formulation and interpolate position goal distributions and amount goal distributions to create curriculum throughout the learning process. As a result, our proposed method can outperform the baselines in simulation and achieves 5.46% and 8.71% amount errors on bowl scooping and bucket scooping tasks, respectively, under 1000 variations of initial water states in the tank and a large goal state space. Besides being effective in simulation environments, our method can efficiently adapt to noisy real-robot water-scooping scenarios with diverse physical configurations and unseen settings, demonstrating superior efficacy and generalizability.

To this end, we study the robustness of the visual perception model under camera motion perturbations to investigate the influence of camera motion on robotic perception. Specifically, we propose a motion smoothing technique for arbitrary image classification models, whose robustness under camera motion perturbations could be certified. The proposed robustness certification framework based on camera motion smoothing provides effective and scalable robustness guarantees for visual perception modules so that they are applicable to wide robotic applications. As far as we are aware, this is the first work to provide robustness certification for the deep perception module against camera motions, which improves the trustworthiness of robotic perception. A realistic indoor robotic dataset with a dense point cloud map for the entire room, MetaRoom, is introduced for the challenging certifiable robust perception task. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the certification approach via motion smoothing against camera motion perturbations. Our framework guarantees the certified accuracy of 81.7% against camera translation perturbation along depth direction within -0.1m ~ 0.1m. We also validate the effectiveness of our method on the real-world robot by conducting hardware experiments on the robotic arm with an eye-in-hand camera.

In this work, we focus on the idea of framing CRL as interpolations between a source (auxiliary) and a target task distribution. Although existing studies have shown the great potential of this idea, it remains unclear how to formally quantify and generate the movement between task distributions. Inspired by the insights from gradual domain adaptation in semi-supervised learning, we create a natural curriculum by breaking down the potentially large task distributional shift in CRL into smaller shifts. We propose GRADIENT which formulates CRL as an optimal transport problem with a tailored distance metric between tasks. Specifically, we generate a sequence of task distributions as a geodesic interpolation between the source and target distributions, which are actually the Wasserstein barycenter. Different from many existing methods, our algorithm considers a task-dependent contextual distance metric and is capable of handling nonparametric distributions in both continuous and discrete context settings. In addition, we theoretically show that GRADIENT enables smooth transfer between subsequent stages in the curriculum under certain conditions. We conduct extensive experiments in locomotion and manipulation tasks and show that our proposed GRADIENT achieves higher performance than baselines in terms of learning efficiency and asymptotic performance."}}

Specific examples include occupant tracking, energy flow optimization, and security surveillance. Typical person re-identification (re-ID) systems rely on cameras to match the same person across different locations. While it is accurate, vision-based sensing requires direct line-of-sight and may raise privacy concerns. Besides, other sensing methods (e.g., wearables, pressure mats, RF/WiFi) are restricted to requirements such as carrying devices, dense deployment, and motion through wave path. In this paper, we develop Re-Vibe, the first system that re-identifies people through footstep-induced floor vibrations. Our approach is device-free, wide-ranged, and perceived as more privacy-friendly. The main challenge in developing this system is the discrepancy in structural properties and variations in footsteps at distinct locations, leading to different vibration feature patterns within the same person. As a result, it is difficult to match the same person's footsteps across various locations. To overcome this challenge, we model the structure and human influence on the vibration signals to develop a cross-structure transfer model that enables footstep matching despite the structure and human variations. The model is formulated based on optimal transport (OT), which compares the distribution pattern of a person's footstep features across multiple structures for person re-ID. We evaluate Re-Vibe at two locations in a building with wooden and concrete flooring. Re-Vibe achieved a 0.9 F-1 score with four people in person re-ID across these two locations."}}
