They have, however, been plagued by a slew of inherent flaws due to the intrinsic characteristics of chain-style conditional modeling (e.g., exposure bias or lack of long-range coherence), severely limiting their ability to model  distributions properly. In this paper, we propose a unique method termed E-Forcing for training autoregressive generative models that takes advantage of a well-designed energy-based learning objective. By leveraging the extra degree of freedom of the softmax operation, we are allowed to make the autoregressive model itself an energy-based model for measuring the likelihood of input without introducing any extra parameters. Furthermore, we show that with the help of E-Forcing, we can alleviate the above flaws for autoregressive models. Extensive empirical results, covering numerous benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}

Recent advances in neuroscience revealed that neurons interact with each other through various kinds of connectivity patterns to process information, in which the common connectivity patterns are also called circuit motifs. However, many existing ANNs can only model one or two circuit motifs in their architectures, so that their performance may drastically vary among different types of machine learning tasks. \nIn this paper, we propose a new type of neural network inspired by the architectures of neuronal circuits, namely Circuit Neural Network (CircuitNet). In CircuitNet, a group of densely connected neurons, namely circuit motif unit (CMU), form the basic unit of the network, which is capable of modeling universal circuit motifs by adjusting the weights within the CMUs. Compared with traditional feed-forward networks, CircuitNet has the ability to model more types of neuron connections such as feed-back and lateral motifs.\nInspired by the locally dense and globally sparse structure of the human brain, several iterations of signal transmission among different CMUs are achieved by sparse connections through the input ports and output ports of different CMUs. \nExperiments have demonstrated that CircuitNet can outperform popular neural network architectures in function approximation, reinforcement learning, image classification, and time series forecasting tasks."}}

Previous works on sentence scoring mainly adopted either causal language modeling (CLM) like GPT or masked language modeling (MLM) like BERT, which have some limitations: 1) CLM only utilizes unidirectional information for the probability estimation of a sentence without considering bidirectional context, which affects the scoring quality; 2) MLM can only estimate the probability of partial tokens at a time and thus requires multiple forward passes to estimate the probability of the whole sentence, which incurs large computation and time cost. In this paper, we propose \\textit{Transcormer} -- a Transformer model with a novel \\textit{sliding language modeling} (SLM) for sentence scoring. Specifically, our SLM adopts a triple-stream self-attention mechanism to estimate the probability of all tokens in a sentence with bidirectional context and only requires a single forward pass. SLM can avoid the limitations of CLM (only unidirectional context) and MLM (multiple forward passes) and inherit their advantages, and thus achieve high effectiveness and efficiency in scoring. Experimental results on multiple tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than other language modelings. "}}

In this paper, we propose a unique method for training the autoregressive generative model that takes advantage of a well-designed energy-based learning objective. We show that our method is capable of alleviating the exposure bias problem and increase temporal coherence by imposing a constraint which fits joint distributions at each time step. Besides, unlike former energy-based models, we estimate energy scores based on the underlying autoregressive network itself, which does not require any extra network. Finally, thanks to importance sampling, we can train the entire model efficiently without requiring an MCMC process. Extensive empirical results, covering benchmarks like language modeling, neural machine translation, and image generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}

Hence, model compression should be performed in order to reduce the computation and memory cost of pre-trained models. In this work, we aim to compress BERT and address the following two challenging practical issues: (1) The compression algorithm should be able to output multiple compressed models with different sizes and latencies, so as to support devices with different kinds of memory and latency limitations; (2) the algorithm should be downstream task agnostic, so that the compressed models are generally applicable for different downstream tasks.  We leverage techniques in neural architecture search (NAS) and propose NAS-BERT, an efficient method for BERT compression. NAS-BERT trains a big supernet on a carefully designed search space containing various architectures and outputs multiple compressed models with adaptive sizes and latency. Furthermore, the training of NAS-BERT is conducted on standard self-supervised pre-training tasks (e.g., masked language model) and does not depend on specific downstream tasks. Thus, the models it produces can be used across various downstream tasks. The technical challenge of NAS-BERT is that training a big supernet on the pre-training task is extremely costly. We employ several techniques including block-wise search, search space pruning, and performance approximation to improve search efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on GLUE benchmark datasets demonstrate that NAS-BERT can find lightweight models with better accuracy than previous approaches, and can be directly applied to different downstream tasks with adaptive model sizes for different requirements of memory or latency."}}

In this paper, we propose LightPAFF, a Lightweight Pre-training And Fine-tuning Framework that leverages two-stage knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a big teacher model to a lightweight student model in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages. In this way the lightweight model can achieve similar accuracy as the big teacher model, but with much fewer parameters and thus faster online inference speed. LightPAFF can support different pre-training methods (such as BERT, GPT-2 and MASS~\\citep{song2019mass}) and be applied to many downstream tasks. Experiments on three language understanding tasks, three language modeling tasks and three sequence to sequence generation tasks demonstrate that while achieving similar accuracy with the big BERT, GPT-2 and MASS models, LightPAFF reduces the model size by nearly 5x and improves online inference speed by 5x-7x."}}
