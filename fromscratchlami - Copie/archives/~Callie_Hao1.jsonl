Efficient or near-zero-cost NAS proxies are further proposed to address the demanding computational issues of NAS, where each candidate architecture network only requires one iteration of backpropagation. The values obtained from the proxies are considered the predictions of architecture performance on downstream tasks. However, two significant drawbacks hinder the extended usage of Efficient NAS proxies. (1) Efficient proxies are not adaptive to various search spaces. (2) Efficient proxies are not extensible to multi-modality downstream tasks. Based on the observations, we design a Extensible proxy (Eproxy) that utilizes self-supervised, few-shot training (i.e., 10 iterations of backpropagation) which yields near-zero costs. The key component that makes Eproxy efficient is an untrainable convolution layer termed barrier layer that add the non-linearities to the optimization spaces so that the Eproxy can discriminate the performance of architectures in the early stage. Furthermore, to make Eproxy adaptive to different downstream tasks/search spaces, we propose a Discrete Proxy Search (DPS) to find the optimized training settings for Eproxy with only handful of benchmarked architectures on the target tasks. Our extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of both Eproxy and Eproxy+DPS. On NAS-Bench-101 (~423k architectures), Eproxy achieves 0.65 as the spearman rho. In contrast, the previous best zero-cost method achieves 0.45. On NDS-ImageNet search spaces, Eproxy+DPS delivers 0.73 Spearman $\\rho$ average ranking correlation while the previous efficient proxy only achieves 0.47.  On NAS-Bench-Trans-Micro search space (7 tasks), Eproxy+DPS delivers comparable performance with early stop methods which requires 660 GPU hours per task. For the end-to-end task such as DARTS-ImageNet-1k, our method delivers better results compared to NAS performed on CIFAR-10 while only requiring a GPU hour with a single batch of CIFAR-10 images."}}

Innovative achievements are yielded from the area like convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN) and so on. However, research on NAS for graph neural networks (GNN) is still in a preliminary stage. Because of the special structure of graph data, some conclusions drew from CNN cannot be directly applied to GNN. At the same time, for NAS, the models' ranking stability is of great importance for it reflects the reliability of the NAS performance. Unfortunately, little research attention has been paid to it, making it a pitfall in the development of NAS research. In this paper, we proposed a novel NAS pipeline, ReG-NAS, which balances stability, reliability and time cost to search the best GNN architecture. Besides, for the first time, we systematically analyzed factors that will affect models' ranking stability in a given search space, which can be used as a guideline for subsequent studies.

This work proposes an unsupervised learning framework for CO problems. Our framework follows the standard relaxation-plus-rounding approach and adopts neural networks to parameterize the relaxed solutions so that simple back-propagation can train them end-to-end. Our key contribution is the observation that if the relaxed objective satisfies entry-wise concavity, a low optimization loss guarantees the quality of the obtained integral solutions. This observation significantly generalizes the applicability of the previous framework inspired by Erdos' probabilistic method (Karalias & Loukas, 2020). Our framework is particularly suitable to guide the design of objective models in the applications where the objectives are not given explicitly while requiring being modeled and learned first. We evaluate our framework by solving a synthetic graph optimization problem, and two real-world applications including resource allocation in circuit design and approximate computing. Our framework largely outperforms the baselines based on reinforcement learning and Gumbel-softmax tricks. "}}

Multi-tasking models have become successful and often essential for many sophisticated systems such as autonomous driving and indoor robots. However, when deploying MTL onto those real-world systems that are often resource-constrained or latency-sensitive, two prominent challenges arise: (i) during training, simultaneously optimizing all tasks is often difficult due to gradient conflicts across tasks, and the challenge is amplified when a growing number of tasks have to be squeezed into one compact model; (ii) at inference, current MTL regimes have to activate nearly the entire model even to just execute a single task. Yet most real systems demand only one or two tasks at each moment, while flexibly switching between tasks per need: therefore such \u201call tasks activated\u201d inference is also highly inefficient and non-scalable in practice. \nIn this paper, we present a model-accelerator co-design framework to enable efficient on-device MTL, that tackles both training and inference bottlenecks. Our framework, dubbed M\u00b3ViT, customizes mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers into a vision transformer (ViT) backbone for MTL, and sparsely activates task-specific experts during training, which effectively disentangles the parameter spaces to avoid different tasks\u2019 training conflicts. Then at inference with any task of interest, the same design allows for activating only the task-corresponding sparse \u201cexpert\u201d pathway, instead of the full model. Our new model design is further enhanced by hardware-level innovations, in particular, a novel computation reordering scheme tailored for memory-constrained MTL that achieves zero-overhead switching between tasks and can scale to any number of experts. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-Context and NYUD-v2 datasets at both software and hardware levels are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. When executing the practical scenario of single-task inference, M\u00b3ViT achieves higher accuracies than encoder-focused MTL methods, while significantly reducing 88% inference FLOPs. When implemented on a hardware platform of one Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, our co-design framework reduces the memory requirement by 2.40\u00d7, while achieving energy efficiency (as the product of latency and power) up to 9.23\u00d7 times higher than a comparable FPGA baseline."}}

To achieve fast and accurate visual assistance, there are strict requirements on the maximum latency and minimum throughput of the segmentation framework. State-of-the-art neural networks on this task are mostly hand-crafted to satisfy these constraints while achieving high accuracy. On the other hand, while existing literature have demonstrated the power of neural architecture search (NAS) in automatically identifying the best neural architectures for various medical applications, they are mostly guided by accuracy, sometimes with computation complexity, and the importance of real-time constraints are overlooked. A major challenge is that such constraints are non-differentiable and are thus not compatible with the widely used differentiable NAS frameworks. In this paper, we present a strategy that directly handles real-time constraints in a differentiable NAS framework named RT-DNAS. Experiments on extended 2017 MICCAI ACDC dataset show that compared with state-of-the-art manually and automatically designed architectures, RT-DNAS is able to identify ones with better accuracy while satisfying the real-time constraints."}}

To this end, we propose hybrid graph neural network (GNN) based approaches towards highly accurate quality-of-result (QoR) estimations with great generalization capability, specifically targeting logic synthesis optimization. The key idea is to simultaneously leverage spatio-temporal information from hardware designs and logic synthesis flows to forecast performance (i.e., delay/area) of various synthesis flows on different designs. The structural characteristics inside hardware designs are distilled and represented by GNNs; the temporal knowledge (i.e., relative ordering of logic transformations) in synthesis flows can be imposed on hardware designs by combining a virtually added supernode or a sequence processing model with conventional GNN models. Evaluation on 3.3 million data points shows that the testing mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) on designs seen and unseen during training are no more than 1.2% and 3.1%, respectively, which are 7-15X lower than existing studies."}}
