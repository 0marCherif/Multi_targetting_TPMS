In this respect, DSTC10-Track2-Task2 is proposed, which aims to build a task-oriented dialogue (TOD) system incorporating unstructured external knowledge on a spoken conversation, extending DSTC9-Track1. This paper introduces our system containing four advanced methods: data construction, weighted negative sampling, post-training, and style transfer. We first automatically construct a large training data because DSTC10-Track2 does not release the official training set. For the knowledge selection task, we propose weighted negative sampling to train the model more fine-grained manner. We also employ post-training and style transfer for the response generation task to generate an appropriate response with a similar style to the target response. In the experiment, we investigate the effect of weighted negative sampling, post-training, and style transfer. Our model ranked 7 out of 16 teams in the objective evaluation and 6 in human evaluation."}}

In our preliminary error analysis, we find that beam search produces a pool of candidates that is likely to include the correct dialogue state. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a novel framework, called BREAK (Beam search and RE-rAnKing), that achieves outstanding performance on DST. BREAK performs DST in two stages: (i) generating k-best dialogue state candidates with beam search and (ii) re-ranking the candidates to select the correct dialogue state. This simple yet powerful framework shows state-of-the-art performance on all versions of MultiWOZ and M2M datasets. Most notably, we push the joint goal accuracy to 80-90% on MultiWOZ 2.1-2.4, which is an improvement of 23.6%, 26.3%, 21.7%, and 10.8% over the previous best-performing models, respectively.

This is especially a challenging problem because the research community still lacks a coherent dataset for assessing the adaptability of LMs to frequently-updated knowledge corpus such as Wikipedia. To this end, we introduce TemporalWiki, a lifelong benchmark for ever-evolving LMs that utilizes the difference between consecutive snapshots of English Wikipedia and English Wikidata for training and evaluation, respectively. The benchmark hence allows researchers to periodically track an LM\u2019s ability to retain previous knowledge and acquire updated/new knowledge at each point in time. We also find that training an LM on the diff data through continual learning methods achieves similar or better perplexity than on the entire snapshot in our benchmark with 12 times less computational cost, which verifies that factual knowledge in LMs can be safely updated with minimal training data via continual learning."}}

This year\u2019s challenge differs from previous ones as it includes subjective knowledge snippets and requires multiple snippets for a single turn. We propose a pipeline system for the challenge focusing on entity tracking, knowledge selection and response generation. Specifically, we devise a novel heuristic to ensemble the outputs from the rule-based method and neural model for entity tracking and knowledge selection. We also leverage metadata information in the knowledge source to handle fine-grained user queries.

On 14 tasks of the BIG-bench benchmark, the 11B-sized FLIPPED outperforms zero-shot T0-11B and even a 16 times larger 3-shot GPT-3 (175B) on average by 8.4% and 9.7% points, respectively. Flipped Learning gives particularly large improvements on tasks with unseen labels, outperforming T0-11B by up to +20% average F1 score. This indicates that the strong task generalization of Flipped Learning comes from improved generalization to novel labels. "}}

In real-world scenarios, the world knowledge stored in the LMs can quickly become outdated as the world changes, but it is non-trivial to avoid catastrophic forgetting and reliably acquire new knowledge while preserving invariant knowledge. To push the community towards better maintenance of ever-changing LMs, we formulate a new continual learning (CL) problem called Continual Knowledge Learning (CKL). We construct a new benchmark and metric to quantify the retention of time-invariant world knowledge, the update of outdated knowledge, and the acquisition of new knowledge. We adopt applicable recent methods from literature to create several strong baselines. Through extensive experiments, we find that CKL exhibits unique challenges that are not addressed in previous CL setups, where parameter expansion is necessary to reliably retain and learn knowledge simultaneously. By highlighting the critical causes of knowledge forgetting, we show that CKL is a challenging and important problem that helps us better understand and train ever-changing LMs."}}

(2) The autoregressive speech generation shows a lack of robustness due to its error propagation property. In this paper, we propose a novel non-autoregressive TTS model called BVAE-TTS, which eliminates the architectural limitations and generates a mel-spectrogram in parallel. BVAE-TTS adopts a bidirectional-inference variational autoencoder (BVAE) that learns hierarchical latent representations using both bottom-up and top-down paths to increase its expressiveness. To apply BVAE to TTS, we design our model to utilize text information via an attention mechanism. By using attention maps that BVAE-TTS generates, we train a duration predictor so that the model uses the predicted duration of each phoneme at inference. In experiments conducted on LJSpeech dataset, we show that our model generates a mel-spectrogram 27 times faster than Tacotron 2 with similar speech quality. Furthermore, our BVAE-TTS outperforms Glow-TTS, which is one of the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive TTS models, in terms of both speech quality and inference speed while having 58% fewer parameters."}}

Especially, widely used n-gram similarity metrics often fail to discriminate the incorrect answers since they equally consider all of the tokens. To alleviate this problem, we propose KPQA-metric, a new metric for evaluating the correctness of GenQA. Specifically, our new metric assigns different weights to each token via keyphrase prediction, thereby judging whether a generated answer sentence captures the key meaning of the reference answer. To evaluate our metric, we create high-quality human judgments of correctness on two GenQA datasets. Using our human-evaluation datasets, we show that our proposed metric has a significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing metrics.

Furthermore, the T-TA shows competitive or even better accuracies than those of BERT on the above tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/joongbo/tta."}}
