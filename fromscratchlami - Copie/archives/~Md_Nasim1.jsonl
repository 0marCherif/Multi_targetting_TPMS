Previous randomized algorithms exploit sparsity in PDE updates for acceleration. However such methods are applicable to a limited class of decomposable PDEs, which have sparse features in the value domain. We propose Reel, which accelerates the learning of PDEs via random projection and has much broader applicability. Reel exploits the sparsity by decomposing dense updates into sparse ones in both the value and frequency domains. This decomposition enables efficient learning when the source of the updates consists of gradually changing terms across large areas (sparse in the frequency domain) in addition to a few rapid updates concentrated in a small set of \"interfacial\" regions (sparse in the value domain). Random projection is then applied to compress the sparse signals for learning. To expand the model applicability, Taylor series expansion is used in Reel to approximate the nonlinear PDE updates with polynomials in the decomposable form. Theoretically, we derive a constant factor approximation between the projected loss function and the original one with poly-logarithmic number of projected dimensions. Experimentally, we provide empirical evidence that our proposed Reel can lead to faster learning of PDE models (70-98% reduction in training time when the data is compressed to 1% of its original size) with comparable quality as the non-compressed models."}}

Nevertheless, such matching involves computation over billions of elements, presenting a significant computational overhead. We notice many PDEs in real world problems are sparse and decomposable, where the temporal updates and the spatial features are sparsely concentrated on small interface regions. We propose Rapid-PDE, an algorithm to expedite the learning of sparse and decomposable PDEs. Our Rapid-PDE first uses random projection to compress the high dimensional sparse updates and features into low dimensional representations and then use these compressed signals during learning. Crucially, such a conversion is only carried out once prior to learning and the entire learning process is conducted in the compressed space. Theoretically, we derive a constant factor approximation between the projected loss function and the original one with logarithmic number of projected dimensions. Empirically, we demonstrate Rapid-PDE with data compressed to 0.05% of its original size learns similar models compared with uncompressed algorithms in learning a set of phase-field models which govern the spatial-temporal dynamics of nano-scale structures in metallic materials."}}

This paper proposes neural differential equation embedding (NeuraDiff), an end-to-end approach to learn a physics model characterized by a set of partial differential equations directly from experiment data. The key idea is the integration of two neural networks \u2013 one recognition net extracting the values of physics model variables from experimental data, and the other neural differential equation net simulating the temporal evolution of the physics model. Learning is completed by matching the outcomes of the two neural networks. We apply NeuraDiff to the real-world application of tracking and learning the physics model of nano-scale defects in crystalline materials under irradiation and high temperature. Experimental results demonstrate that NeuraDiff produces highly accurate tracking results while capturing the correct dynamics of nano-scale defects."}}

Given the proliferation of public computing devices in the developing regions, a context-aware HCI design, focusing the low-literate and novice users from these regions, has the utmost importance. Taking the hygiene issue with the usage of touch-based public computing devices into account, in-air hand gestures are considered as one of the most natural forms of non-verbal interaction in this regard. In this paper, we present Duity -- a low-cost finger-count based hand gesture recognition system -- which reliably tackles the hurdle faced by novice and low-literacy populations. Exploiting the reflective property of visible light spectrum, we develop a mechanism that can reliably count fingers and thus identify different gestures. The system is fine-tuned to such an extent that varying lighting conditions and environmental setups can not perturb the accurate identification of the gestures. Our claims are supported by a user evaluation, which takes multiple scenarios into accounts, confirming the robustness, usability, and acceptability of Duity."}}

As a remedy to this situation, in this paper, we propose a visible light based touchless input device (named Sporshohin), retaining all the properties mentioned above, for ensuring ubiquitous usage. Sporshohin recognizes predefined gestures performed by the user, through an underlying mechanism that exploits well-known reflection model over the visible light spectrum. The underlying mechanism is intelligent enough to guarantee robustness against varying environmental lighting conditions and undefined noisy gestures. Real implementation, involving interaction with diversified users, confirms high accuracy and usability along with existence of all the above mentioned properties. We show the emulation of Sporshohin as an input interface for an information kiosk.
