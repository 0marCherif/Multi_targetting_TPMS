In these diverse real-world applications, there is often a degree of uncertainty in the input which has led to the study of stochastic matching models. Here, each edge in the graph has a known, independent probability of existing derived from some prediction. Algorithms must probe edges to determine existence and match them irrevocably if they exist. Further, each vertex may have a patience constraint denoting how many of its neighboring edges can be probed. We present new ordered contention resolution schemes yielding improved approximation guarantees for some of the foundational problems studied in this area. For stochastic matching with patience constraints in general graphs, we provide a $0.382$-approximate algorithm, significantly improving over the previous best $0.31$-approximation of Baveja et al. (2018). When the vertices do not have patience constraints, we describe a $0.432$-approximate random order probing algorithm with several corollaries such as an improved guarantee for the Prophet Secretary problem under Edge Arrivals. Finally, for the special case of bipartite graphs with unit patience constraints on one of the partitions, we show a $0.632$-approximate algorithm that improves on the recent $1/3$-guarantee of Hikima et al. (2021)."}}

PettingZoo is a library of diverse sets of multi-agent environments with a universal, elegant Python API. PettingZoo was developed with the goal of accelerating research in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (``\"MARL\"), by making work more interchangeable, accessible and reproducible akin to what OpenAI's Gym library did for single-agent reinforcement learning. PettingZoo's API, while inheriting many features of Gym, is unique amongst MARL APIs in that it's based around the novel AEC games model. We argue, in part through case studies on major problems in popular MARL environments, that the popular game models are poor conceptual models of the games commonly used with MARL, that they promote severe bugs that are hard to detect, and that the AEC games model addresses these problems."}}

It results from every agent's policy changing during learning, while being part of the environment from the perspective of other agents. This causes information to inherently oscillate between agents during learning, greatly slowing convergence. We use the MAILP model of information transfer during multi-agent learning to show that increasing centralization during learning arbitrarily mitigates the slowing of convergence due to nonstationarity. The most centralized case of learning is parameter sharing, an uncommonly used MARL method, specific to environments with homogeneous agents. It bootstraps single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) methods and learns an identical policy for each agent. We experimentally replicate our theoretical result of increased learning centralization leading to better performance. We further apply parameter sharing to 8 more modern single-agent deep RL methods for the first time, achieving up to 44 times more average reward in 16% as many episodes compared to previous parameter sharing experiments. We finally give a formal proof of a set of methods that allow parameter sharing to serve in environments with heterogeneous agents."}}
