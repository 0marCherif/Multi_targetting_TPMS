However, they still impose huge computational costs during inference. We apply global, structural pruning with latency-aware regularization on all parameters of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model for latency reduction. Furthermore, we analyze the pruned architectures and find interesting regularities in the final weight structure. Our discovered insights lead to a new architecture called NViT (Novel ViT), with a redistribution of where parameters are used. This architecture utilizes parameters more efficiently and enables control of the latency-accuracy trade-off. On ImageNet-1K, we prune the DEIT-Base (Touvron et al., 2021) model to a 2.6$\\times$ FLOPs reduction, 5.1$\\times$ parameter reduction, and 1.9$\\times$ run-time speedup with only 0.07% loss in accuracy. We achieve more than 1% accuracy gain when compressing the base model to the throughput of the Small/Tiny variants. NViT gains 0.1-1.1% accuracy over the hand-designed DEIT family when trained from scratch, while being faster."}}

This scenario significantly differs from the \"standard\" blackbox setting, and warrants a unique approach to the attacking process. Our methodology begins with the construction of a class correspondence matrix between the whitebox and blackbox label sets. During the online phase of the attack, we then leverage representations of highly related proxy classes from the whitebox distribution to fool the blackbox model into predicting the desired target class. Our attacks are evaluated in three complex and challenging test environments where the source and target models have varying degrees of conceptual overlap amongst their unique categories. Ultimately, we find that it is indeed possible to construct targeted transfer-based adversarial attacks between models that have non-overlapping label spaces! We also analyze the sensitivity of attack success to properties of the clean data. Finally, we show that our transfer attacks serve as powerful adversarial priors when integrated with query-based methods, markedly boosting query efficiency and adversarial success."}}

However, it lacks a systematic method to determine the exact quantization scheme. Previous methods either examine only a small manually-designed search space or utilize a cumbersome neural architecture search to explore the vast search space. These approaches cannot lead to an optimal quantization scheme efficiently. This work proposes bit-level sparsity quantization (BSQ) to tackle the mixed-precision quantization from a new angle of inducing bit-level sparsity. We consider each bit of quantized weights as an independent trainable variable and introduce a differentiable bit-sparsity regularizer. BSQ can induce all-zero bits across a group of weight elements and realize the dynamic precision reduction, leading to a mixed-precision quantization scheme of the original model. Our method enables the exploration of the full mixed-precision space with a single gradient-based optimization process, with only one hyperparameter to tradeoff the performance and compression. BSQ achieves both higher accuracy and higher bit reduction on various model architectures on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets comparing to previous methods."}}

However, recent works demonstrated that sharing model updates makes FL vulnerable to inference attacks. In this work, we show our key observation that the data representation leakage from gradients is the essential cause of privacy leakage in FL. We also provide an analysis of this observation to explain how the data presentation is leaked. Based on this observation, we propose a defense against model inversion attack in FL. The key idea of our defense is learning to perturb data representation such that the quality of the reconstructed data is severely degraded, while FL performance is maintained. In addition, we derive certified robustness guarantee to FL and convergence guarantee to FedAvg, after applying our defense. To evaluate our defense, we conduct experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 for defending against the DLG attack and GS attack. Without sacrificing accuracy, the results demonstrate that our proposed defense can increase the mean squared error between the reconstructed data and the raw data by as much as more than 160X for both DLG attack and GS attack, compared with baseline defense methods. The privacy of the FL system is significantly improved."}}

Adversarial training, as a general robustness improvement technique, eliminates the vulnerability in a single model by forcing it to learn robust features. The process is hard, often requires models with large capacity, and suffers from significant loss on clean data accuracy. Alternatively, ensemble methods are proposed to induce sub-models with diverse outputs against a transfer adversarial example, making the ensemble robust against transfer attacks even if each sub-model is individually non-robust. Only small clean accuracy drop is observed in the process. However, previous ensemble training methods are not efficacious in inducing such diversity and thus ineffective on reaching robust ensemble. We propose DVERGE, which isolates the adversarial vulnerability in each sub-model by distilling non-robust features, and diversifies the adversarial vulnerability to induce diverse outputs against a transfer attack. The novel diversity metric and training procedure enables DVERGE to achieve higher robustness against transfer attacks comparing to previous ensemble methods, and enables the improved robustness when more sub-models are added to the ensemble.

These datasets are often crowdsourced from individual users and contain private information like gender, age, etc. The emerging privacy concerns from users on data sharing hinder the generation or use of crowdsourcing datasets and lead to hunger of training data for new deep learning applications. One naive solution is to pre-process the raw data to extract features at the user-side, and then only the extracted features will be sent to the data collector. Unfortunately, attackers can still exploit these extracted features to train an adversary classifier to infer private attributes. Some prior arts leveraged game theory to protect private attributes. However, these defenses are designed for known primary learning tasks, the extracted features work poorly for unknown learning tasks. To tackle the case where the learning task may be unknown or changing, we present TIPRDC, a task-independent privacy-respecting data crowdsourcing framework with anonymized intermediate representation. The goal of this framework is to learn a feature extractor that can hide the privacy information from the intermediate representations; while maximally retaining the original information embedded in the raw data for the data collector to accomplish unknown learning tasks. We design a hybrid training method to learn the anonymized intermediate representation: (1) an adversarial training process for hiding private information from features; (2) maximally retain original information using a neural-network-based mutual information estimator. We extensively evaluate TIPRDC and compare it with existing methods using two image datasets and one text dataset. Our results show that TIPRDC substantially outperforms other existing methods. Our work is the first task-independent privacy-respecting data crowdsourcing framework."}}

In order to deploy DNN algorithms efficiently on edge or mobile devices, a series of DNN compression algorithms have been explored, including the line of works on factorization methods. Factorization methods approximate the weight matrix of a DNN layer with multiplication of two or multiple low-rank matrices. However, it is hard to measure the ranks of DNN layers during the training process. Previous works mainly induce low-rank through implicit approximations or via costly singular value decomposition (SVD) process on every training step. The former approach usually induces a high accuracy loss while the latter prevents DNN factorization from efficiently reaching a high compression rate. In this work, we propose SVD training, which first applies SVD to decompose DNN's layers and then performs training on the full-rank decomposed weights. To improve the training quality and convergence, we add orthogonality regularization to the singular vectors, which ensure the valid form of SVD and avoid gradient vanishing/exploding. Low-rank is encouraged by applying sparsity-inducing regularizers on the singular values of each layer. Singular value pruning is applied at the end to reach a low-rank model. We empirically show that SVD training can significantly reduce the rank of DNN layers and achieve higher reduction on computation load under the same accuracy, comparing to not only previous factorization methods but also state-of-the-art filter pruning methods.

The L0 regularizer measures the parameter sparsity directly and is invariant to the scaling of parameter values. But it cannot provide useful gradients and therefore requires complex optimization techniques. The L1 regularizer is almost everywhere differentiable and can be easily optimized with gradient descent. Yet it is not scale-invariant and causes the same shrinking rate to all parameters, which is inefficient in increasing sparsity. Inspired by the Hoyer measure (the ratio between L1 and L2 norms) used in traditional compressed sensing problems, we present DeepHoyer, a set of sparsity-inducing regularizers that are both differentiable almost everywhere and scale-invariant. Our experiments show that enforcing DeepHoyer regularizers can produce even sparser neural network models than previous works, under the same accuracy level. We also show that DeepHoyer can be applied to both element-wise and structural pruning."}}

Their vulnerability to adversarial attacks thus become a vital issue to consider. In this work, we propose DPatch, a adversarial-patch-based attack towards mainstream object detectors (i.e., Faster R-CNN and YOLO). Unlike the original adversarial patch that only manipulates image-level classifier, our DPatch simultaneously optimizes the bounding box location and category targets so as to disable their predictions. Compared to prior works, DPatch has several appealing properties: (1) DPatch can perform both untargeted and targeted effective attacks, degrading the mAP of Faster R-CNN and YOLO from 70.0% and 65.7% down to below 1% respectively; (2) DPatch is small in size and its attacking effect is location-independent, making it very practical to implement real-world attacks; (3) DPatch demonstrates great transferability between different detector architectures. For example, DPatch that is trained on Faster R-CNN can effectively attack YOLO, and vice versa. Extensive evaluations imply that DPatch can perform effective attacks under black-box setup, i.e., even without the knowledge of the attacked network's architectures and parameters. The successful realization of DPatch also illustrates the intrinsic vulnerability of the modern detector architectures to such patch-based adversarial attacks."}}

Due to the in-situ computation capability, analog ReRAM crossbars yield significant throughput improvement and energy reduction compared to traditional digital methods. However, the power hungry analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) prevent the practical deployment of ReRAM-based DNN accelerators on end devices with limited chip area and power budget. We observe that due to the limited bit-density of ReRAM cells, DNN weights are bit sliced and correspondingly stored on multiple ReRAM bitlines. The accumulated current on bitlines resulted by weights directly dictates the overhead of ADCs. As such, bitwise weight sparsity rather than the sparsity of the full weight, is desirable for efficient ReRAM deployment. In this work, we propose bit-slice L1, the first algorithm to induce bit-slice sparsity during the training of dynamic fixed-point DNNs. Experiment results show that our approach achieves 2x sparsity improvement compared to previous algorithms. The resulting sparsity allows the ADC resolution to be reduced to 1-bit of the most significant bit-slice and down to 3-bit for the others bits, which significantly speeds up processing and reduces power and area overhead."}}
