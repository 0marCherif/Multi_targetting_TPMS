We focus on the $\\epsilon$-coreset for robust clustering, a small proxy of the dataset that preserves the clustering cost within $\\epsilon$-relative error for all center sets. Our main result is an $\\epsilon$-coreset of size $O(m + \\mathrm{poly}(k \\epsilon^{-1}))$ that can be constructed in near-linear time. This significantly improves previous results, which either suffers an exponential dependence on $(m + k)$ [Feldman and Schulman, SODA'12], or has a weaker bi-criteria guarantee [Huang et al., FOCS'18]. Furthermore, we show this dependence in $m$ is nearly-optimal, and the fact that it is isolated from other factors may be crucial for dealing with large number of outliers. We construct our coresets by adapting to the outlier setting a recent framework [Braverman et al., FOCS'22] which was designed for capacity-constrained clustering, overcoming a new challenge that the participating terms in the cost, particularly the excluded $m$ outlier points, are dependent on the center set $C$. We validate our coresets on various datasets, and we observe a superior size-accuracy tradeoff compared with popular baselines including uniform sampling and sensitivity sampling. We also achieve a significant speedup of existing approximation algorithms for robust clustering using our coresets."}}

While RFF has been analyzed under various notions of error guarantee, the ability to preserve the kernel distance with \\emph{relative} error is less understood. We show that for a significant range of kernels, including the well-known Laplacian kernels, RFF cannot approximate the kernel distance with small relative error using low dimensions. We complement this by showing as long as the shift-invariant kernel is analytic, RFF with $\\mathrm{poly}(\\epsilon^{-1} \\log n)$ dimensions achieves $\\epsilon$-relative error for pairwise kernel distance of $n$ points, and the dimension bound is improved to $\\mathrm{poly}(\\epsilon^{-1}\\log k)$ for the specific application of kernel $k$-means. Finally, going beyond RFF, we make the first step towards data-oblivious dimension-reduction for general shift-invariant kernels, and we obtain a similar $\\mathrm{poly}(\\epsilon^{-1} \\log n)$ dimension bound for Laplacian kernels. We also validate the dimension-error tradeoff of our methods on simulated datasets, and they demonstrate superior performance compared with other popular methods including random-projection and Nystr\\\"{o}m methods."}}
