In this work, we consider the celebrated definition of counterfactual fairness. We begin by showing that an algorithm which satisfies counterfactual fairness also satisfies demographic parity, a far simpler fairness constraint. Similarly, we show that all algorithms satisfying demographic parity can be trivially modified to satisfy counterfactual fairness. Together, our results indicate that counterfactual fairness is basically equivalent to demographic parity, which has important implications for the growing body of work on counterfactual fairness. We then validate our theoretical findings empirically, analyzing three existing algorithms for counterfactual fairness against three simple benchmarks. We find that two simple benchmark algorithms outperform all three existing algorithms---in terms of fairness, accuracy, and efficiency---on several data sets. Our analysis leads us to formalize a concrete fairness goal: to preserve the order of individuals within protected groups. We believe transparency around the ordering of individuals within protected groups makes fair algorithms more trustworthy. By design, the two simple benchmark algorithms satisfy this goal while the existing algorithms do not."}}

Unfortunately, the algorithm uses linear qubits in the worst case, and only works if the constraints of the general adversary dual are exactly satisfied. The challenge of improving the algorithm is that it is brittle to arbitrarily small errors since it relies on a reflection over a span of vectors. We overcome this challenge and build a robust dual adversary algorithm that can handle approximately satisfied constraints. As one application of our robust algorithm, we prove that for any Boolean function with polynomially many 1-valued inputs (or in fact a slightly weaker condition) there is a query-optimal algorithm that uses logarithmic qubits. As another application, we prove that numerically derived, approximate solutions to the general adversary dual give a bounded-error quantum algorithm under certain conditions. Further, we show that these conditions empirically hold with reasonable iterations for Boolean functions with small domains. We also develop several tools that may be of independent interest, including a robust approximate spectral gap lemma, a method to compress a general adversary dual solution using the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, and open-source code to find solutions to the general adversary dual."}}

We determine f(x) by sequentially testing the variables of x, each of which is associated with a cost of testing and an independent probability of being true. If a strategy for solving the problem is adaptive in the sense that its next test can depend on the outcomes of previous tests, it has lower expected cost but may take up to exponential space to store. In contrast, a non-adaptive strategy may have higher expected cost but can be stored in linear space and benefit from parallel resources. The adaptivity gap, the ratio between the expected cost of the optimal non-adaptive and adaptive strategies, is a measure of the benefit of adaptivity. We present lower bounds on the adaptivity gap for the SBFE problem for popular classes of Boolean functions, including read-once DNF formulas, read-once formulas, and general DNFs. Our bounds range from $$\\varOmega (\\log n)$$ to $$\\varOmega (n/\\log n)$$ , contrasting with recent O(1) gaps shown for symmetric functions and linear threshold functions."}}
