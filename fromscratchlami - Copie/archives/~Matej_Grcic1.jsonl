Existing dense anomaly detectors operate either through generative modelling of regular training data or by discriminating with respect to negative training data. These two approaches optimize different objectives and therefore exhibit different failure modes. Consequently, we propose the first dense hybrid anomaly score that fuses generative and discriminative cues. The proposed score can be efficiently implemented by upgrading any semantic segmentation model with dense estimates of data likelihood and dataset posterior. Our design is a remarkably good fit for efficient inference on large images due to negligible computational overhead over the closed-set baseline. The resulting dense hybrid open-set models require negative training images that can be sampled from an auxiliary negative dataset, from a jointly trained generative model, or from a mixture of both sources. We evaluate our contributions on benchmarks for dense anomaly detection and open-set segmentation. The experiments reveal strong open-set performance in spite of negligible computational overhead."}}

These approaches deliver competitive performance in usual closed-set setups. However, important applications in the wild typically require strong performance in presence of outliers. We show that this demanding setup greatly benefits from mask-level predictions, even in the case of non-finetuned baseline models. Moreover, we propose an alternative formulation of dense recognition uncertainty that effectively reduces false positive responses at semantic borders. The proposed formulation produces a further improvement over a very strong baseline and sets the new state of the art in outlier-aware semantic segmentation with and without training on negative data. Our contributions also lead to performance improvement in a recent panoptic setup. In-depth experiments confirm that our approach succeeds due to implicit aggregation of pixel-level cues into mask-level predictions."}}

These two approaches exhibit different failure modes. Consequently, hybrid algorithms present an attractive research goal. Unfortunately, dense anomaly detection requires translational equivariance and very large input resolutions. These requirements disqualify all previous hybrid approaches to the best of our knowledge. We therefore design a novel hybrid algorithm based on reinterpreting discriminative logits as a logarithm of the unnormalized joint distribution $$\\hat{p}(\\textbf{x},\\textbf{y})$$ . Our model builds on a shared convolutional representation from which we recover three dense predictions: i) the closed-set class posterior $$P(\\textbf{y}|\\textbf{x})$$ , ii) the dataset posterior $$P(d_{in}|\\textbf{x})$$ , iii) unnormalized data likelihood $$\\hat{p}(\\textbf{x})$$ . The latter two predictions are trained both on the standard training data and on a generic negative dataset. We blend these two predictions into a hybrid anomaly score which allows dense open-set recognition on large natural images. We carefully design a custom loss for the data likelihood in order to avoid backpropagation through the untractable normalizing constant $$Z(\\theta )$$ . Experiments evaluate our contributions on standard dense anomaly detection benchmarks as well as in terms of open-mIoU - a novel metric for dense open-set performance. Our submissions achieve state-of-the-art performance despite neglectable computational overhead over the standard semantic segmentation baseline.

The resulting models often give rise to confident incorrect predictions which may lead to devastating consequences. This problem is especially demanding in the context of dense prediction since input images may be partially anomalous. Previous work has addressed dense anomaly detection by discriminative training on mixed-content images. We extend this approach with synthetic negative patches which simultaneously achieve high inlier likelihood and uniform discriminative prediction. We generate synthetic negatives with normalizing flows due to their outstanding distribution coverage and capability to generate samples at different resolutions. We also propose to detect anomalies according to a principled information-theoretic criterion which can be consistently applied through training and inference. The resulting models set the new state of the art on standard benchmarks and datasets in spite of minimal computational overhead and refraining from auxiliary negative data."}}
