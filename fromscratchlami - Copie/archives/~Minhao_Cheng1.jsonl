We conduct the first study of backdoor attacks in the pFL framework, testing 4 widely used backdoor attacks against 6 pFL methods on benchmark datasets FEMNIST and CIFAR-10, a total of 600 experiments. The study shows that pFL methods with partial model-sharing can significantly boost robustness against backdoor attacks. In contrast, pFL methods with full model-sharing do not show robustness. To analyze the reasons for varying robustness performances, we provide comprehensive ablation studies on different pFL methods. Based on our findings, we further propose a lightweight defense method, Simple-Tuning, which empirically improves defense performance against backdoor attacks. We believe that our work could provide both guidance for pFL application in terms of its robustness and offer valuable insights to design more robust FL methods in the future. We open-source our code to establish the first benchmark for black-box backdoor attacks in pFL: https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope/tree/backdoor-bench."}}

Even though many defence methods have been proposed to enhance the robustness, it is still a long way toward providing an attack-free method to build a trustworthy machine learning system. In this paper, instead of enhancing the robustness, we take the investigator's perspective and propose a new framework to trace the first compromised model in a forensic investigation manner. Specifically, we focus on the following setting: the machine learning service provider provides models for a set of customers. However, one of the customers conducted adversarial attacks to fool the system. Therefore, the investigator's objective is to identify the first compromised model by collecting and analyzing evidence from only available adversarial examples. To make the tracing viable, we design a random mask watermarking mechanism to differentiate adversarial examples from different models. First, we propose a tracing approach in the data-limited case where the original example is also available. Then, we design a data-free approach to identify the adversary without accessing the original example. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed framework is evaluated by extensive experiments with different model architectures, adversarial attacks, and datasets."}}

The attacker injects a trigger into the model during the training process. The victim model behaves normally on data without the backdoor attack trigger but gives a prediction the same as the attacker-specified target. Backdoor attacks were first investigated in computer vision. The investigation of backdoor attacks has also emerged in natural language processing (NLP) recently. However, the study of defense methods against textual backdoor attacks is still insufficient. Especially, there are not enough methods available to protect against backdoor attacks using syntax as the trigger. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can effectively defend against syntactic backdoor attacks. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method on BERT for syntactic backdoor attacks when choosing five different syntaxes as triggers."}}

Existing iterative model averaging based FL algorithms require a large number of communication rounds to obtain a well-performed model due to extremely unbalanced and non-i.i.d data partitioning among different clients. Thus, we propose FedDM to build the global training objective from multiple local surrogate functions, which enables the server to gain a more global view of the loss landscape. In detail, we construct synthetic sets of data on each client to locally match the loss landscape from original data through distribution matching. FedDM reduces communication rounds and improves model quality by transmitting more informative and smaller synthesized data compared with unwieldy model weights. We conduct extensive experiments on three image classification datasets, and results show that our method can outperform other FL counterparts in terms of efficiency and model performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that FedDM can be adapted to preserve differential privacy with Gaussian mechanism and train a better model under the same privacy budget."}}

Yet, existing works mainly for local explanation lack global knowledge to show class-wise explanations in the whole training procedure. To fill this gap, we proposed to visualize global explanation in the input space for every class learned in the training procedure. Specifically, our solution finds a representation set that could demonstrate the learned knowledge for each class. To achieve this goal, we optimize the representation set by imitating the model training procedure over the full dataset. Experimental results show that our method could generate class-wise explanations with high quality in a series of image classification datasets. Using our global explanation, we further analyze the model knowledge in different training procedures, including adversarial training and noisy label learning. Moreover, we illustrate that the generated explanations could lend insights into diagnosing model failures, such as revealing triggers in a backdoored model."}}

However, prior methods in optimizer search are often limited by their scalability, generability, or sample efficiency. With the goal of democratizing research and application of optimizer search, we present the first efficient, scalable and generalizable framework that can directly search on the tasks of interest. We first observe that optimizer updates are fundamentally mathematical expressions applied to the gradient. Inspired by the innate tree structure of the underlying math expressions, we re-arrange the space of optimizers into a super-tree, where each path encodes an optimizer. This way, optimizer search can be naturally formulated as a path-finding problem, allowing a variety of well-established tree traversal methods to be used as the search algorithm. We adopt an adaptation of the Monte Carlo method to tree search, equipped with rejection sampling and equivalent-form detection that leverage the characteristics of optimizer update rules to further boost the sample efficiency. We provide a diverse set of tasks to benchmark our algorithm and demonstrate that, with only 128 evaluations, the proposed framework can discover optimizers that surpass both human-designed counterparts and prior optimizer search methods.
