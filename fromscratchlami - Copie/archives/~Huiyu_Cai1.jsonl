Recently, data-driven methods based on deep learning techniques are attracting growing interest thanks to their efficiency during inference and promising performance. These methods usually either adopt a two-stage approach by first predicting the distances between proteins and ligands and then generating the final coordinates based on the predicted distances, or directly predicting the global roto-translation of ligands. In this paper, we take a different route. Inspired by the resounding success of AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction, we propose E3Bind, an end-to-end equivariant network that iteratively updates the ligand pose. E3Bind models the protein-ligand interaction through careful consideration of the geometric constraints in docking and the local context of the binding site. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our end-to-end trainable model compared to traditional and recently-proposed deep learning methods."}}

However, in contrast to other domains, the performance of multi-task learning in drug discovery is still not satisfying as the number of labeled data for each task is too limited, which calls for additional data to complement the data scarcity. In this paper, we study multi-task learning for molecule property prediction in a different setting, where a relation graph between different tasks is available. We first extract a dataset including ~400 tasks as well as a relation graph between different tasks. Then we systematically investigate modeling the relation between different tasks: (1) in the latent space by learning effective task representations on the task relation graph; (2) and in the output space via structured prediction methods (e.g., energy-based methods). Empirical results prove the effectiveness of our proposed approaches."}}

However, lacking domain knowledge (e.g., which tasks to work on), standard benchmarks and data preprocessing pipelines are the main obstacles for machine learning researchers to work in this domain. To facilitate the progress of machine learning for drug discovery, we develop TorchDrug, a powerful and flexible machine learning platform for drug discovery built on top of PyTorch. TorchDrug benchmarks a variety of important tasks in drug discovery, including molecular property prediction, pretrained molecular representations, de novo molecular design and optimization, retrosynthsis prediction, and biomedical knowledge graph reasoning. State-of-the-art techniques based on geometric deep learning (or graph machine learning), deep generative models, reinforcement learning and knowledge graph reasoning are implemented for these tasks. TorchDrug features a hierarchical interface that facilitates customization from both novices and experts in this domain.
