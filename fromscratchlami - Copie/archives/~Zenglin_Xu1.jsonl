Recently, large-scale mono-programming-lingual (MonoPL) pre-training models have been proposed to boost the performance of code completion. However, the code completion on low-resource programming languages (PL) is difficult for the data-driven paradigm, while there are plenty of developers using low-resource PLs. On the other hand, there are few studies exploring the effects of multi-programming-lingual (MultiPL) pre-training for the code completion, especially the impact on low-resource programming languages. To this end, we propose the MultiCoder to enhance the low-resource code completion via MultiPL pre-training and MultiPL Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers. We further propose a novel PL-level MoE routing strategy (PL-MoE) for improving the code completion on all PLs. Experimental results on CodeXGLUE and MultiCC demonstrate that 1) the proposed MultiCoder significantly outperforms the MonoPL baselines on low-resource programming languages, and 2) the PL-MoE module further boosts the performance on six programming languages. In addition, we analyze the effects of the proposed method in details and explore the effectiveness of our method in a variety of scenarios."}}

In real-world federated learning systems, these data samples are often decentralized and Non-Independently Identically Distributed (Non-IID), causing divergence and performance degradation in the federated learning process. As a new solution, clustered federated learning groups federated clients with similar data distributions to impair the Non-IID effects and train a better model for every cluster. This paper proposes StoCFL, a novel clustered federated learning approach for generic Non-IID issues. In detail, StoCFL implements a flexible CFL framework that supports an arbitrary proportion of client participation and newly joined clients for a varying FL system, while maintaining a great improvement in model performance. The intensive experiments are conducted by using four basic Non-IID settings and a real-world dataset. The results show that StoCFL could obtain promising cluster results even when the number of clusters is unknown. Based on the client clustering results, models trained with StoCFL outperform baseline approaches in a variety of contexts."}}

To fully and securely exploit the value of different data sources, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving GPR method based on secret sharing (SS), a secure multi-party computation (SMPC) technique. In contrast to existing studies that protect the data privacy of GPR via homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, or federated learning, our proposed method is more practical and can be used to preserve the data privacy of both the model inputs and outputs for various data-sharing scenarios (e.g., horizontally/vertically-partitioned data). However, it is non-trivial to directly apply SS on the conventional GPR algorithm, as it includes some operations whose accuracy and/or efficiency have not been well-enhanced in the current SMPC protocol. To address this issue, we derive a new SS-based exponentiation operation through the idea of \u201cconfusion-correction\u201d and constructing a privacy-preserving matrix inversion algorithm based on Cholesky decomposition. More importantly, we theoretically analyze the communication cost and the security of the proposed SS-based operations. Empirical evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that our proposed method can achieve reasonable accuracy and efficiency under the premise of preserving data privacy."}}

However, the huge sizes and computational burden of these models make it difficult for their deployment on edge devices. A practically effective approach is to reduce the overall storage and computation costs of RNNs by network pruning techniques. Despite their successful applications, those pruning methods based on Lasso either produce irregular sparse patterns in weight matrices, which is not helpful in practical speedup. To address these issues, we propose a structured pruning method through neuron selection which can remove the independent neuron of RNNs. More specifically, we introduce two sets of binary random variables, which can be interpreted as gates or switches to the input neurons and the hidden neurons, respectively. We demonstrate that the corresponding optimization problem can be addressed by minimizing the  norm of the weight matrix. Finally, experimental results on language modeling and machine reading comprehension tasks have indicated the advantages of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art pruning competitors. In particular, nearly 20 practical speedup during inference was achieved without losing performance for the language model on the Penn TreeBank dataset, indicating the promising performance of the proposed method."}}

However, existing initialization approaches do not simultaneously show robustness and universality. Specifically, even though the widely-used Xavier and Kaiming initialization approaches can generally fit a variety of networks, they fail to train residual networks without Batch Normalization for calculating an inappropriate scale on data-flow. On the other hand, some literature design stable initialization (e.g., Fixup and ReZero) based on dynamical isometry,  an efficient learning mechanism. Nonetheless, these methods are specifically designed for either a non-residual structure or a residual block only, and even include extra auxiliary components, limiting their applicable range. Intriguingly, we find that the identity matrix is a feasible and universal solution to the aforementioned problems, as it adheres to dynamical isometry while remaining applicable to a wide range of models. Motivated by this, we develop Identical Initialization (IDInit), a sufficiently robust, universal, and fast-converging approach on the identity matrix. Empirical results on a variety of benchmarks show that IDInit is universal to various network types, and practically useful with good performance and fast convergence."}}

Recently, contrastive learning and Transformer-based models have achieved good performance in many long-term series forecasting tasks. However, there are still several issues in existing methods. First, the training paradigm of contrastive learning and downstream prediction tasks are inconsistent, leading the accuracy of prediction not good enough. Second, existing Transformer-based models which learn similar patterns in historical time series data to predict future values always induces severe distribution shift problems, and does not fully leverage the sequence information compared to self-supervised methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework named Ti-MAE, in which the input time series are assumed to follow an integrate distribution. In detail, Ti-MAE randomly masks out embedded time series data and learns an autoencoder to reconstruct them at the point-level. Ti-MAE adopts mask modeling as the auxiliary task rather than contrastive learning and bridges the connection between existing representation learning and generative Transformer-based methods, reducing the difference between upstream and downstream forecasting tasks while maintaining the utilization of original time series data. Experiments on several public real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework of masked autoencoding could learn strong representations directly from the raw data, yielding better performance in time series forecasting and classification tasks. The code will be made public after this paper is accepted."}}

Generally, most existing GNNs depend on the implicit homophily assumption that nodes belonging to the same class are more likely to be connected. However, GNNs may fail to model heterophilious graphs where nodes with different labels tend to be linked, as shown in recent studies.  To address this issue, we propose a generic GNN applicable to both homophilious and heterophilious graphs, namely Low-Rank Graph Neural Network (LRGNN). In detail, we aim at computing a coefficient matrix such that the sign of each coefficient reveals whether the corresponding two nodes belong to the same class, which is similar to the sign inference problem. In Signed Social Networks (SSNs), the sign inference problem can be modeled as a low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF) problem due to the global low-rank structure described by the weak balance theory. In this paper, we show that signed graphs are naturally generalized weakly-balanced when considering node classification tasks. Motivated by this observation, we propose to leverage LRMF to recover a coefficient matrix from a partially observed signed adjacency matrix. To effectively capture the node similarity, we further incorporate the low-rank representation (LRR) method. Our theoretical result shows that under our update rule of node representations, LRR obtained by solving a subspace clustering problem can recover the subspace structure of node representations. To solve the corresponding optimization problem, we utilize an iterative optimization algorithm with a convergence guarantee and develop a neural-style initialization manner that enables fast convergence. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic graphs has validated the superior performance of LRGNN over various state-of-the-art GNNs. In particular, LRGNN can offer clear performance gains in a scenario when the node features are not informative enough."}}

Our model seamlessly integrates multiple affinity graphs into a consensus one with the topological relevance considered. Meanwhile, we manipulate the consensus graph by a connectivity constraint such that the connected components precisely indicate different clusters. Hence our model is able to directly obtain the final clustering result without reliance on any label discretization strategy as previous methods do. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, compared to the state-of-the-art competitors over the clustering performance."}}

Despite the emergence of a number of few-shot learning methods, the sample selection bias problem, i.e., the sensitivity to the limited amount of support data, has not been well understood. In this paper, we find that this problem usually occurs when the positions of support samples are in the vicinity of task centroid\u2014the mean of all class centroids in the task. This motivates us to propose an extremely simple feature transformation to alleviate this problem, dubbed Task Centroid Projection Removing (TCPR). TCPR is applied directly to all image features in a given task, aiming at removing the dimension of features along the direction of the task centroid. While the exact task centoid cannot be accurately obtained from limited data, we estimate it using base features that are each similar to one of the support features. Our method effectively prevents features from being too close to the task centroid. Extensive experiments over ten datasets from different domains show that TCPR can reliably improve classification accuracy across various feature extractors, training algorithms and datasets.

In practical FL applications, local data from each data silo reflect local usage patterns. Therefore, there exists heterogeneity of data distributions among data owners (a.k.a. FL clients). If not handled properly, this can lead to model performance degradation. This challenge has inspired the research field of heterogeneous federated learning, which currently remains open. In this paper, we propose a data heterogeneity-robust FL approach, FedGSP, to address this challenge by leveraging on a novel concept of dynamic Sequential-to-Parallel (STP) collaborative training. FedGSP\u00a0assigns FL clients to homogeneous groups to minimize the overall distribution divergence among groups, and increases the degree of parallelism by reassigning more groups in each round. It is also incorporated with a novel Inter-Cluster Grouping (ICG) algorithm to assist in group assignment, which uses the centroid equivalence theorem to simplify the NP-hard grouping problem to make it solvable. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the non-i.i.d. FEMNIST dataset. The results show that FedGSP\u00a0improves the accuracy by 3.7% on average compared with seven state-of-the-art approaches, and reduces the training time and communication overhead by more than 90%."}}
