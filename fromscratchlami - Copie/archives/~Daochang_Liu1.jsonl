The benefits of guaranteed privacy come at the costs of generated images\u2019 quality and utility due to the privacy budget constraints. The utility is currently measured by the gen2real accuracy (g2r%), i.e., the accuracy on real data of a downstream classifier trained using generated data. However, apart from this standard utility, we identify the \u201creversed utility\u201d as another crucial aspect, which computes the accuracy on generated data of a classifier trained using real data, dubbed as real2gen accuracy (r2g%). Jointly considering these two views of utility, the standard and the reversed, could help the generation model better improve transferability between fake and real data. Therefore, we propose a novel private image generation method that incorporates a dual-purpose auxiliary classifier, which alternates between learning from real data and fake data, into the training of differentially private GANs. Additionally, our deliberate training strategies such as sequential training contributes to accelerating the generator\u2019s convergence and further boosting the performance upon exhausting the privacy budget. Our results achieve new state-of-the-arts over all metrics on three benchmarks: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA."}}

Within the pretraining-finetuning paradigm, the MIM framework trains an encoder by reconstructing masked image patches with the help of a decoder which would be abandoned when the encoder is used for finetuning. Despite its state-of-the-art performance on clean images, MIM models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting its real-world application, and few studies have focused on this issue. In this paper, we have discovered that noisy image modeling (NIM), a variant of MIM that uses denoising as the pre-text task, provides not only good pretrained visual features, but also effective adversarial defense for downstream models. To achieve a better accuracy-robustness trade-off, we further propose to sample the hyperparameter that controls the reconstruction difficulty from random distributions instead of setting it globally, and fine-tune downstream networks with denoised images. Experimental results demonstrate that our pre-trained denoising autoencoders are effective against different white-box, gray-box, and black-box attacks without being trained with adversarial images, while not harming the clean accuracy of fine-tuned models. Source code and models will be made available."}}

Prior works show that by mining both spatial and frequency information the forgery detection performance of deep learning models can be vastly improved. However, leveraging multiple types of information usually requires more than one branch in the neural network, which makes the model heavy and cumbersome. Knowledge distillation, as an important technique for efficient modelling, could be a possible remedy. We find that existing knowledge distillation methods have difficulties distilling a dual-branch model into a single-branch model. More specifically, knowledge distillation on both the spatial and frequency branches has degraded performance than distillation only on the spatial branch. To handle such problem, we propose a novel two-in-one knowledge distillation framework which can smoothly merge the information from a large dual-branch network into a small single-branch network, with the help of different dedicated feature projectors and the gradient homogenization technique. Experimental analysis on two datasets, FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF, shows that our proposed framework achieves superior performance for facial forgery detection with much fewer parameters."}}

Previous works on this task commonly adopt an iterative refinement paradigm by using multi-stage models. We propose a novel framework via denoising diffusion models, which nonetheless shares the same inherent spirit of such iterative refinement. In this framework, action predictions are iteratively generated from random noise with input video features as conditions. To enhance the modeling of three striking characteristics of human actions, including the position prior, the boundary ambiguity, and the relational dependency, we devise a unified masking strategy for the conditioning inputs in our framework. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., GTEA, 50Salads, and Breakfast, are performed and the proposed method achieves superior or comparable results to state-of-the-art methods, showing the effectiveness of a generative approach for action segmentation."}}

Recent works verify the link between mis-calibration and overfitting. However, early stopping, as a well-known technique to mitigate overfitting, fails to calibrate networks. In this work, we study the limitions of early stopping and comprehensively analyze the overfitting problem of a network considering each individual block. We then propose a novel regularization method, predecessor combination search (PCS), to improve calibration by searching a combination of best-fitting block predecessors, where block predecessors are the corresponding network blocks with weight parameters from earlier training stages. PCS achieves the state-of-the-art calibration performance on multiple datasets and architectures. In addition, PCS improves model robustness under dataset distribution shift."}}

Existing VSR techniques usually recover HR frames by extracting pertinent textures from nearby frames with known degradation processes. Despite significant progress, grand challenges are remained to effectively extract and transmit high-quality textures from high-degraded low-quality sequences, such as blur, additive noises, and compression artifacts. In this work, a novel Frequency-Transformer (FTVSR) is proposed for handling low-quality videos that carry out self-attention in a combined space-time-frequency domain. First, video frames are split into patches and each patch is transformed into spectral maps in which each channel represents a frequency band. It permits a fine-grained self-attention on each frequency band, so that real visual texture can be distinguished from artifacts. Second, a novel dual frequency attention (DFA) mechanism is proposed to capture the global frequency relations and local frequency relations, which can handle different complicated degradation processes in real-world scenarios. Third, we explore different self-attention schemes for video processing in the frequency domain and discover that a ``divided attention'' which conducts a joint space-frequency attention before applying temporal-frequency attention, leads to the best video enhancement quality. Extensive experiments on three widely-used VSR datasets show that FTVSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on different low-quality videos with clear visual margins.
