MedMNIST (v2) includes a large number of small-sized (28 $\\times$ 28 or 28 $\\times$ 28 $\\times$ 28) medical samples and the corresponding expert annotations (class label). The existing baseline model (Google AutoML Vision, ResNet-50+3D) can reach an average accuracy of over 70\\% on MedMNIST (v2) datasets, which is comparable to the performance of expert decision-making. Nevertheless, we note that there are two insurmountable obstacles to modeling on MedMNIST (v2): 1) the raw images are cropped to low scales may cause effective recognition information to be dropped and the classifier to have difficulty in tracing accurate decision boundaries; 2) the labelers' subjective insight may cause many uncertainties in the label space. To address these issues, we develop a Complex Mixer (C-Mixer) with a pre-training framework to alleviate the problem of insufficient information and uncertainty in the label space by introducing an incentive imaginary matrix and a self-supervised scheme with random masking. Our method (incentive learning and self-supervised learning with masking) shows surprising potential on both the standard MedMNIST (v2) dataset, the customized weakly supervised datasets, and other image enhancement tasks."}}

The absence of large-scale 4K benchmark datasets hampers progress in this area, especially for dehazing. The challenges in building ultra-high-definition (UHD) dehazing datasets are the absence of estimation methods for UHD depth maps, high-quality 4K depth estimation datasets, and migration strategies for UHD haze images from synthetic to real domains. To address these problems, we develop a novel synthetic method to simulate 4K hazy images (including nighttime and daytime scenes) from clear images, which first estimates the scene depth, simulates the light rays and object reflectance, then migrates the synthetic images to real domains by using a GAN, and finally yields the hazy effects on 4K resolution images. We wrap these synthesized images into a benchmark called the 4K-HAZE dataset. Specifically, we design the CS-Mixer (an MLP-based model that integrates \\textbf{C}hannel domain and \\textbf{S}patial domain) to estimate the depth map of 4K clear images, the GU-Net to migrate a 4K synthetic image to the real hazy domain. The most appealing aspect of our approach (depth estimation and domain migration) is the capability to run a 4K image on a single GPU with 24G RAM in real-time (33fps). Additionally, this work presents an objective assessment of several state-of-the-art single-image dehazing methods that are evaluated using the 4K-HAZE dataset. At the end of the paper, we discuss the limitations of the 4K-HAZE dataset and its social implications."}}

They are not effective to generate plausible textures and colors in the reconstructed results, especially for high-density pixels in ultra-high-definition (UHD) images. To address these problems, we propose a new HDR reconstruction network for UHD images by collaboratively learning color and texture details. First, we propose a dual-path network to extract content and chromatic features at a reduced resolution of the low dynamic range (LDR) input. These two types features are used to fit bilatera-space affine models for real-time HDR reconstruction. To extract the main data structure of the LDR input, we propose to use 3D Tucker decomposition and reconstruction to prevents false edges and noise amplification in the learned bilateral grid. As a result, the high-quality content and chromatic features can be reconstructed capitalized on guided bilateral upsampling. Finally, we fuse these two full-resolution feature maps into the HDR reconstructed results. Our proposed method can achieve real-time processing for UHD image (about 160 fps). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art HDR reconstruction approaches on public benchmarks and real-world UHD images."}}

Unfortunately, most existing deep dehazing models have high computational complexity, which hinders their application to high-resolution images, especially for UHD (ultra-high-definition) or 4K resolution images. To address the problem, we propose a novel network capable of real-time dehazing of 4K images on a single GPU, which consists of three deep CNNs. The first CNN extracts haze-relevant features at a reduced resolution of the hazy input and then fits locally-affine models in the bilateral space. Another CNN is used to learn multiple full-resolution guidance maps corresponding to the learned bilateral model. As a result, the feature maps with high-frequency can be reconstructed by multi-guided bilateral upsampling. Finally, the third CNN fuses the high-quality feature maps into a dehazed image.In addition, we create a large-scale 4K image dehazing dataset to support the training and testing of compared models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art dehazing approaches on various benchmarks."}}

In the learning process of label distribution, the training data is collected mainly by manual annotation or label enhancement algorithms to generate label distribution. Unfortunately, the complexity of the manual annotation task or the inaccuracy of the label enhancement algorithm leads to noise and uncertainty in the label distribution training set. To alleviate this problem, we introduce the implicit distribution in the label distribution learning framework to characterize the uncertainty of each label value. Specifically, we use deep implicit representation learning to construct a label distribution matrix with Gaussian prior constraints, where each row component corresponds to the distribution estimate of each label value, and this row component is constrained by a prior Gaussian distribution to moderate the noise and uncertainty interference of the label distribution dataset. Finally, each row component of the label distribution matrix is transformed into a standard label distribution form by using the self-attention algorithm. In addition, some approaches with regularization characteristics are conducted in the training phase to improve the performance of the model."}}

To address the problem, we introduce the principle of infinite approximation of Taylor's theorem with the Laplace pyramid pattern to build a model which is capable of handling 4K hazy images in real-time. The N branch networks of the pyramid network correspond to the N constraint terms in Taylor's theorem. Low-order polynomials reconstruct the low-frequency information of the image (e.g. color, illumination). High-order polynomials regress the high-frequency information of the image (e.g. texture). In addition, we propose a Tucker reconstruction-based regularization term that acts on each branch network of the pyramid model. It further constrains the generation of anomalous signals in the feature space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can not only run 4K images with haze in real-time on a single GPU (80FPS) but also has unparalleled interpretability. The developed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two benchmarks (O/I-HAZE) and our updated 4KID dataset while providing the reliable groundwork for subsequent optimization schemes."}}
