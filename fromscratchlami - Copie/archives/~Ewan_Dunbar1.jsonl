These algorithms, however, remain largely implausible: they require (1) extraordinarily large amounts of data, (2) unobtainable supervised labels, (3) textual rather than raw sensory input, and / or (4) implausibly large memory (e.g. thousands of contextual words). These elements highlight the need to identify algorithms that, under these limitations, would suffice to account for both behavioral and brain responses. Focusing on speech processing, we here hypothesize that self-supervised algorithms trained on the raw waveform constitute a promising candidate. Specifically, we compare a recent self-supervised model, wav2vec 2.0, to the brain activity of 412 English, French, and Mandarin individuals recorded with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), while they listened to approximately one hour of audio books. First, we show that this algorithm learns brain-like representations with as little as 600 hours of unlabelled speech -- a quantity comparable to what infants can be exposed to during language acquisition. Second, its functional hierarchy aligns with the cortical hierarchy of speech processing. Third, different training regimes reveal a functional specialization akin to the cortex: wav2vec 2.0 learns sound-generic, speech-specific and language-specific representations similar to those of the prefrontal and temporal cortices. Fourth, we confirm the similarity of this specialization with the behavior of 386 additional participants. These elements, resulting from the largest neuroimaging benchmark to date, show how self-supervised learning can account for a rich organization of speech processing in the brain, and thus delineate a path to identify the laws of language acquisition which shape the human brain."}}

The benchmark consists of ABX stimuli along with the responses of 91 American English-speaking listeners. The stimuli test discrimination of a large number of English and French phonemic contrasts. They are extracted directly from corpora of read speech, making them appropriate for evaluating statistical acoustic models (such as those used in automatic speech recognition) trained on typical speech data sets. We show that phone discrimination is correlated with several types of models, and give recommendations for researchers seeking easily calculated norms of acoustic distance on experimental stimuli. We show that DeepSpeech, a standard English speech recognizer, is more specialized on English phoneme discrimination than English listeners, and is poorly correlated with their behaviour, even though it yields a low error on the decision task given to humans."}}

Although the ABX task has been used for acoustic model evaluation in previous research, the results have not, until now, been compared directly with human behaviour in an experiment. We show that a standard, well-performing model (DPGMM) has better accuracy at predicting human responses than the acoustic baseline. The model also shows a native language effect, better resem- bling native listeners of the language on which it was trained. However, the native language effect shown by the models is different than the one shown by the human listeners, and, notably, the models do not show the same overall patterns of vowel confusions."}}

However, to be useful in these settings, articulatory reconstruction must be speaker independent. Furthermore, as most research focuses on single, small datasets with few speakers, robust articulatory reconstrucion could profit from combining datasets. Standard evaluation measures such as root mean square error and Pearson correlation are inappropriate for evaluating the speaker-independence of models or the usefulness of combining datasets. We present a new evaluation for articulatory reconstruction which is independent of the articulatory data set used for training: the phone discrimination ABX task. We use the ABX measure to evaluate a Bi-LSTM based model trained on 3 datasets (14 speakers), and show that it gives information complementary to the standard measures, and enables us to evaluate the effects of dataset merging, as well as the speaker independence of the model."}}

Here we investigate the role of combining different speech modalities, i.e. audio and visual information representing the lips movements, in a weakly supervised way using Siamese networks and lexical same-different side information. In particular, we ask whether one modality can benefit from the other to provide a richer representation for phone recognition in a weakly supervised setting. We introduce mono-task and multi-task methods for merging speech and visual modalities for phone recognition. The mono-task learning consists in applying a Siamese network on the concatenation of the two modalities, while the multi-task learning receives several different combinations of modalities at train time. We show that multi-task learning enhances discriminability for visual and multimodal inputs while minimally impacting auditory inputs. Furthermore, we present a qualitative analysis of the obtained phone embeddings, and show that cross-modal visual input can improve the discriminability of phonological features which are visually discernable (rounding, open/close, labial place of articulation), resulting in representations that are closer to abstract linguistic features than those based on audio only."}}
