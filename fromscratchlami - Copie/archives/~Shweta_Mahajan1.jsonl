However, all such approaches rely on conditional sentences that contain unambiguous descriptions of scenes and main actors in them. Therefore employing such models for more complex task of story visualization, where naturally references and co-references exist, and one requires to reason about when to maintain consistency of actors and backgrounds across frames/scenes, and when not to, based on story progression, remains a challenge. In this work, we address the aforementioned challenges and propose a novel autoregressive diffusion-based framework with a visual memory module that implicitly captures the actor and background context across the generated frames. Sentence-conditioned soft attention over the memories enables effective reference resolution and learns to maintain scene and actor consistency when needed. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we extend the MUGEN dataset and introduce additional characters, backgrounds and referencing in multi-sentence storylines. Our experiments for story generation on the MUGEN, the PororoSV and the FlintstonesSV dataset show that our method not only outperforms prior state-of-the-art in generating frames with high visual quality, which are consistent with the story, but also models appropriate correspondences between the characters and the background."}}

Multimodal representation learning has emerged as one of the demanding areas to draw meaningful information from the input data and achieve human-like performance. The challenges in learning representations can be ascribed to the heterogeneity of the available datasets where the information comes from various modalities or domains such as visual signals in the form of images and videos or textual signals in form of sentences. Moreover, one encounters far more unlabeled data in the form of highly multimodal, complex image distributions. In this thesis, we advance the field of multimodal representation learning for diverse synthesis with applications in vision and language; and complex imagery. We take a probabilistic approach and leverage deep generative models to capture the multimodality of the underlying true data distribution offering a strong advantage of learning from unlabeled data. To this end, in the first part, we focus on cross-domain data of images and text. We develop joint deep generative frameworks to encode the joint representations of the two distributions following distinct generative processes. The latent spaces are structured to encode semantic information available from the paired training data and even the domain-specific variations in the data. Furthermore, we introduce intricate data-dependent priors to capture the multimodality of the two distributions. The benefits of our presented frameworks are manifold. The semi-supervised techniques preserve the structural information of input representations in each modality with the potential to include any information that may be missing in other modalities, resulting in embeddings that generalize across datasets. The approaches consequently resolve the ambiguities of the joint distribution and allow for many-to-many mappings. In this thesis, we also introduce a novel factorization in the latent space that encodes contextual information independently of the object information and can leverage diverse contextual descriptions from the annotations of images that share similar contextual information leading to enriched multimodal latent space and thus increased diversity in the generated captions. Perception plays a vital role in human understanding of the environment. As image data becomes abundant and complex, it is inevitable for AI systems to learn the underlying structure of these multimodal distributions for general scene understanding. Even though popular deep generative models like GANs and VAEs for image distributions have made advancements, there are still gaps in capturing the underlying true data distribution. GANs are not designed to provide density estimates and VAEs only approximate the underlying data generating distribution with intractable likelihoods, posing challenges in both training and inference. To resolve the limitations, in the second part of the thesis, we construct powerful normalizing flows and autoregressive approaches for image distributions. Normalizing flows and autoregressive generative methods belong to the class of exact inference models that optimize the exact log-likelihood of the data. Our first approach enhances the representational power of flow-based models which are constrained due to the invertibility of the flow layers by introducing channel-wise dependencies in their latent space through multi-scale autoregressive priors. The scrupulously designed prior can better capture dependencies in complex multimodal data and achieves state-of-the-art density estimation results and improved image generation quality. Our second method concentrates on autoregressive models with their highly flexible functional forms. The sequential ordering of the dimensions makes these models computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a block-autoregressive approach employing a lossless pyramid decomposition with scale-specific representations. The sparse dependency structure makes it easier to encode the joint distribution of image pixels. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results for density estimation on various image datasets, especially for high-resolution data, and exhibits sampling speeds superior even to easily parallelizable flow-based models."}}

Owing to the efficiency constraints on the design of the flow layers, e.g. split coupling flow layers in which approximately half the pixels do not undergo further transformations, they have limited expressiveness for modeling long-range data dependencies compared to autoregressive models that rely on conditional pixel-wise generation. In this work, we improve the representational power of flow-based models by introducing channel-wise dependencies in their latent space through multi-scale autoregressive priors (mAR). Our mAR prior for models with split coupling flow layers (mAR-SCF) can better capture dependencies in complex multimodal data. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art density estimation results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. Furthermore, we show that mAR-SCF allows for improved image generation quality, with gains in FID and Inception scores compared to state-of-the-art flow-based models."}}
