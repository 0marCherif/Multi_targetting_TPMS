Under the lookup table setting, its convergence is well established. However, its behavior is known to be unstable with the linear function approximation case. This paper develops a new Q-learning algorithm, called RegQ, that converges when linear function approximation is used. We prove that simply adding an appropriate regularization term ensures convergence of the algorithm. We prove its stability using a recent analysis tool based on switching system models. Moreover, we experimentally show that RegQ converges in environments where Q-learning with linear function approximation has known to diverge. We also provide an error bound on the solution where the algorithm converges."}}

However, even one of the most elementary RL algorithms, temporal-difference (TD) learning, is known to suffer form divergence issue when the off-policy scheme is used together with linear function approximation. To overcome the divergent behavior, several off-policy TD learning algorithms have been developed until now. In this work, we provide a unified view of such algorithms from a purely control-theoretic perspective. Our method relies on the backstepping technique, which is widely used in nonlinear control theory."}}
