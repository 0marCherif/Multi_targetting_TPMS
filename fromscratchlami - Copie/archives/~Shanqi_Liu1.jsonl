Therefore, reasonable credit assignment is crucial for multi-agent cooperation. Although existing work uses value decomposition algorithms to mitigate the credit assignment problem, since they decompose the global value function at multi-agents\u2019 local value function level, the overall evaluation of the value function can easily lead to approximation errors. Moreover, such strategies are vulnerable to sparse reward scenarios. In this paper, we propose to use expert demonstrations to guide the team reward decomposition at each time step, rather than value decomposition. The proposed method computes the reward ratio of each agent according to the similarity between the state-action pair of the agent and the expert demonstrations. In addition, under this setting, each agent can independently train its value function and evaluate its behavior, which makes the algorithm highly robust to team rewards. Moreover, the proposed method constrains the policy to collect data with similar distribution to the expert data during the exploration, which makes policy update more robust. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our proposed method in various MARL environments, the results show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in most scenarios; our method is robust to various reward functions; and the trajectories by our policy is closer to that of the expert policy."}}

Many works propose to abstract teammate instances into high-level representation of types and then pre-train the best response for each type. However, most of them do not consider the distribution of teammate instances within a type. This could expose the agent to the hidden risk of \\emph{type confounding}. In the worst case, the best response for an abstract teammate type could be the worst response for all specific instances of that type. This work addresses the issue from the lens of causal inference. We first theoretically demonstrate that this phenomenon is due to the spurious correlation brought by uncontrolled teammate distribution. Then, we propose our solution, CTCAT, which disentangles such correlation through an instance-wise teammate feedback rectification. This operation reweights the interaction of teammate instances within a shared type to reduce the influence of type confounding. The effect of CTCAT is evaluated in multiple domains, including classic ad hoc teamwork tasks and real-world scenarios. Results show that CTCAT is robust to the influence of type confounding, a practical issue that directly hazards the robustness of our trained agents but was unnoticed in previous works."}}

While value decomposition methods in MARL have been popular, they have limitations in solving tasks with non-monotonic returns, restricting their general application. Our work highlights the significance of joint intentions in cooperation, which can overcome non-monotonic problems and increase the interpretability of the learning process. To this end, we present a novel MARL method that leverages learnable joint intentions. Our method employs a hierarchical framework consisting of a joint intention policy and a behavior policy to formulate the optimal cooperative policy. The joint intentions are autonomously learned in a latent space through unsupervised learning and enable the method adaptable to different agent configurations. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements in both the StarCraft micromanagement benchmark and challenging MAgent domains, showcasing the effectiveness of our method in learning meaningful joint intentions."}}

This task has been extensively studied within the framework of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), and value decomposition methods are among those cutting-edge solutions. However, traditional methods that learn the value function as a monotonic mixing of per-agent utilities cannot solve the tasks with non-monotonic returns. This hinders their application in generic scenarios. Recent methods tackle this problem from the perspective of implicit credit assignment by learning value functions with complete expressiveness or using additional structures to improve cooperation. However, they are either difficult to learn due to large joint action spaces or insufficient to capture the complicated interactions among agents which are essential to solving tasks with non-monotonic returns. To address these problems, we propose a novel explicit credit assignment method to address the non-monotonic problem. Our method, Adaptive Value decomposition with Greedy Marginal contribution (AVGM), is based on an adaptive value decomposition that learns the cooperative value of a group of dynamically changing agents. We first illustrate that the proposed value decomposition can consider the complicated interactions among agents and is feasible to learn in large-scale scenarios. Then, our method uses a greedy marginal contribution computed from the value decomposition as an individual credit to incentivize agents to learn the optimal cooperative policy. We further extend the module with an action encoder to guarantee the linear time complexity for computing the greedy marginal contribution.

The core of our network is a novel mechanism called appearance adaptive normalization, which can effectively integrate the appearance information from the input image into our face generator by modulating the feature maps of the generator using the learned adaptive parameters. Furthermore, we specially design a local net to reenact the local facial components (i.e., eyes, nose and mouth) first, which is a much easier task for the network to learn and can in turn provide explicit anchors to guide our face generator to learn the global appearance and pose-and-expression. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the significant efficacy of our model compared with prior one-shot methods."}}

However, previous multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods hardly take formation into consideration. Further-more, they are usually centralized planners and require the whole state of the environment. Other decentralized partially observable approaches to MAPF are reinforcement learning (RL) methods. However, these RL methods encounter difficulties when learning path finding and formation problems at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized partially observable RL algorithm that uses a hierarchical structure to decompose the multi-objective task into unrelated ones. It also calculates a theoretical weight that makes each tasks reward has equal influence on the final RL value function. Additionally, we introduce a communication method that helps agents cooperate with each other. Experiments in simulation show that our method outperforms other end-to-end RL methods and our method can naturally scale to large world sizes where centralized planner struggles. We also deploy and validate our method in a real-world scenario."}}

However, most current multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms improve the communication capabilities of agents for cooperation, but the overall communication is costly and even harmful due to bandwidth limitations. In addition, de-centralized execution cannot generate joint actions, which is not conducive to cooperation. Therefore, we proposed the Hierarchical Group Cooperation Network (HGCN). Advanced strategy, Group Network (GroNet), learns to group all agents based on their state rather than their location. The Low-level strategy, Group Cooperation Network (GCoNet), is a method of centralized training and centralized execution within a group, which effectively promotes agent collaboration. Finally, we validated our method in various experiments."}}
