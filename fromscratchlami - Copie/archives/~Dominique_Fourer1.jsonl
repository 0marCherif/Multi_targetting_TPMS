Hence, this paper aims at providing answers through an intensive and comprehensive comparison between several promising neural network architectures. Our study leads us to three approaches which are respectively based on 2D U-Net, 3D U-Net and cascaded neural networks, that are compared together and with another unsupervised technique based on k-mean clustering. We also consider several enhancement techniques such as data augmentation, curriculum learning and an original boosting method based on majority voting. We achieve to improve the results of the baseline methods in terms of Dice score when the suitable combination of techniques is used."}}

NILM methods can be roughly categorized into event-based and non event-based approaches, depending on whether or not they rely on the detection of HEAs' significant state transitions (e.g. On/Off or state change). In this paper, we focus on event-based methods and describe a test bench to statistically assess three abrupt change detectors. Then, we define several evaluation metrics for judging on performance and quality of the detection algorithms in order to carry out a comparison. Finally, the three abrupt change detectors are applied to real data coming from a scenario of HEAs switched on and off by hand."}}

First, the investigated BASS methods are reworded with the same formalism and we investigate their respective hyperparameters by numerical simulations. Second, we propose an extension of the KAM method for which we propose a novel training algorithm used to compute a source-specific kernel from a given isolated source signal. Second, the BASS methods are compared together in terms of source separation accuracy and in terms of singing voice detection accuracy when they are used in our new singing voice detection framework. Finally, we do an exhaustive singing voice detection evaluation for which we compare both supervised and unsupervised singing voice detection methods. Our comparison explores different combination of the proposed BASS methods with new features such as the new proposed KAM features and the scattering transform through a machine learning framework and also considers convolutional neural networks methods."}}

Recently, synchrosqueezing was introduced as a promising signal disentangling method which allows to compute reversible and sharpen time-frequency representations. Thus, it can be used to reduce overlaps between the sources in the time-frequency plane and to improve the sources' sparsity which is often exploited by source separation techniques. Furthermore, synchrosqueezing can also be extended using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to allow a user to adjust the energy concentration of a time-frequency representation which can be efficiently implemented without the FFT algorithm. Hence, we show that our approach can improve the quality of the source separation process while remaining suitable for real-time applications."}}

Second, the detailed automatic SSA method is used to design an approach based on a sliding analysis window, which provides better results than the classical SSA method when analyzing nonstationary signals with a time-varying number of components. Finally, the proposed sliding SSA method is compared to the empirical mode decomposition and to the synchrosqueezed short-time Fourier transform, applied on both synthetic and real-world signals."}}

Abstract In this paper, a novel approach for time-frequency analysis and detection, based on the chirplet transform and dedicated to non-stationary as well as multi-component signals, is presented. Its main purpose is the estimation of spectral energy, instantaneous frequency (IF), spectral delay (SD), and chirp rate (CR) with a high time-frequency resolution (separation ability) achieved by adaptive fitting of the transform kernel. We propose two efficient implementations of this idea, which allow to use the fast Fourier transform (FFT). In the first one, referred to as \u201cself-tuning\u201d, a previously proposed CR estimation is used for a local fitting of the chirplet kernel over time. For this purpose, we use the CR associated with the dominant (prominent) component. In the second one, we define a new measure for evaluating at each time-frequency point, how the used analyzing window is matched to the signal. This measure is defined as the absolute difference between the estimated CR and the CR parameter associated to the used analysis window. Our method is able to produce combined time-frequency distributions of the spectral energy, IF, SD, and CR. They are obtained using several classical chirplet transforms with analysis windows of various CRs. The compositions are made by finding the lowest fitting measure for every time-frequency points over all transforms. Finally, we assess the robustness of the methods by a detection application and time-frequency localization, both in the presence of high additive white Gaussian noise (additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)) as well as we present many time-frequency (TF) images of synthetic and real-world signals.

Using this new transform, we propose to compute a sharpened time-frequency representation by rewording the reassigned scalogram and the (first and second-order) synchrosqueezed CWT. We also propose an extension of the CWT reassignment operators, using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which can control the energy concentration of a reassigned scalogram through a damping parameter. Thus, our methods provide tools which pave the way of the real-time computation of reversible and almost-ideal time-frequency representations."}}
