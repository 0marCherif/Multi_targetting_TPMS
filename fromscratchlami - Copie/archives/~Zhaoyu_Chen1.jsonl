As a complementary type of adversary, patch attacks that introduce perceptible perturbations to the images have attracted the interest of researchers. Existing patch attacks rely on the architecture of the model or the probabilities of predictions and perform poorly in the decision-based setting, which can still construct a perturbation with the minimal information exposed -- the top-1 predicted label. In this work, we first explore the decision-based patch attack. To enhance the attack efficiency, we model the patches using paired key-points and use targeted images as the initialization of patches, and parameter optimizations are all performed on the integer domain. Then, we propose a differential evolutionary algorithm named DevoPatch for query-efficient decision-based patch attacks. Experiments demonstrate that DevoPatch outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box patch attacks in terms of patch area and attack success rate within a given query budget on image classification and face verification. Additionally, we conduct the vulnerability evaluation of ViT and MLP on image classification in the decision-based patch attack setting for the first time. Using DevoPatch, we can evaluate the robustness of models to black-box patch attacks. We believe this method could inspire the design and deployment of robust vision models based on various DNN architectures in the future."}}

Moreover, the existing Adversarial Training (AT) can further improve the robustness of these large models. However, these large models are difficult to deploy to mobile devices, and the effect of AT on small models is very limited. In addition, the data privacy issue (e.g., face data and diagnosis report) may lead to the original data being unavailable, which relies on data-free knowledge distillation technology for training. To tackle these issues, we propose a challenging novel task called Data-Free Adversarial Robustness Distillation (DFARD), which tries to train small, easily deployable, robust models without relying on the original data. We find the combination of existing techniques resulted in degraded model performance due to fixed training objectives and scarce information content. First, an interactive strategy is designed for more efficient knowledge transfer to find more suitable training objectives at each epoch. Then, we explore an adaptive balance method to suppress information loss and obtain more data information than previous methods. Experiments show that our method improves baseline performance on the novel task."}}

Despite the success of augmentation combination in the supervised learning generalization, naively applying it to visual RL algorithms may damage the training efficiency, suffering from serve performance degradation. In this paper, we first conduct qualitative analysis and illuminate the main causes: (i) high-variance gradient magnitudes and (ii) gradient conflicts existed in various augmentation methods. To alleviate these issues, we propose a general policy gradient optimization framework, named Conflict-aware Gradient Agreement Augmentation (CG2A), and better integrate augmentation combination into visual RL algorithms to address the generalization bias. In particular, CG2A develops a Gradient Agreement Solver to adaptively balance the varying gradient magnitudes, and introduces a Soft Gradient Surgery strategy to alleviate the gradient conflicts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CG2A significantly improves the generalization performance and sample efficiency of visual RL algorithms."}}

Compared to the original video instance segmentation, OpenVIS enables users to identify objects of desired categories, regardless of whether those categories were included in the training dataset. To achieve this goal, we propose a two-stage pipeline for proposing high-quality class-agnostic object masks and predicting their corresponding categories via pre-trained VLM. Specifically, we first employ a query-based mask proposal network to generate masks of all potential objects, where we replace the original class head with an instance head trained with a binary object loss, thereby enhancing the class-agnostic mask proposal ability. Then, we introduce a proposal post-processing approach to adapt the proposals better to the pre-trained VLMs, avoiding distortion and unnatural proposal inputs. Meanwhile, to facilitate research on this new task, we also propose an evaluation benchmark that utilizes off-the-shelf datasets to comprehensively assess its performance. Experimentally, the proposed OpenVIS exhibits a remarkable 148\\% improvement compared to the full-supervised baselines on BURST, which have been trained on all categories."}}

Previous methods require a lot of extra computational costs to update one or more generators and their naive imitate-learning lead to lower distillation efficiency. Based on these observations, we first propose an efficient unlabeled sample selection method to replace high computational generators and focus on improving the training efficiency of the selected samples. Then, a class-dropping mechanism is designed to suppress the label noise caused by the data domain shifts. Finally, we propose a distillation method that incorporates explicit features and implicit structured relations to improve the effect of distillation. Experimental results show that our method can quickly converge and obtain higher accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods."}}

Unlike general adversarial training, its robust knowledge transfer can be less easily restricted by the model capacity. However, the teacher model that provides the robustness of knowledge does not always make correct predictions, interfering with the student's robust performances. Besides, in the previous ARD methods, the robustness comes entirely from one-to-one imitation, ignoring the relationship between examples. To this end, we propose a novel structured ARD method called Contrastive Relationship DeNoise Distillation (CRDND). We design an adaptive compensation module to model the instability of the teacher. Moreover, we utilize the contrastive relationship to explore implicit robustness knowledge among multiple examples. Experimental results on multiple attack benchmarks show CRDND can transfer robust knowledge efficiently and achieves state-of-the-art performances."}}

Moreover, knowledge is transferred through each example, ignoring the implicit relationship among multiple examples. To this end, we propose a novel Open-world Data Sampling Distillation (ODSD) method without a redundant generation process. First, we try to sample open-world data close to the original data's distribution by an adaptive sampling module. Then, we introduce a low-noise representation to alleviate the domain shifts and build a structured relationship of multiple data examples to exploit data knowledge. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, NYUv2, and ImageNet show that our ODSD method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, current works usually sacrifice unrestricted degrees and subjectively select some image content to guarantee the photorealism of unrestricted adversarial examples, which limits its attack performance. To ensure the photorealism of adversarial examples and boost attack performance, we propose a novel unrestricted attack framework called Content-based Unrestricted Adversarial Attack. By leveraging a low-dimensional manifold that represents natural images, we map the images onto the manifold and optimize them along its adversarial direction. Therefore, within this framework, we implement Adversarial Content Attack based on Stable Diffusion and can generate high transferable unrestricted adversarial examples with various adversarial contents. Extensive experimentation and visualization demonstrate the efficacy of ACA, particularly in surpassing state-of-the-art attacks by an average of 13.3-50.4% and 16.8-48.0% in normally trained models and defense methods, respectively."}}

AIDE facilitates holistic driver monitoring through three distinctive characteristics, including multi-view settings of driver and scene, multi-modal annotations of face, body, posture, and gesture, and four pragmatic task designs for driving understanding. To thoroughly explore AIDE, we provide experimental benchmarks on three kinds of baseline frameworks via extensive methods. Moreover, two fusion strategies are introduced to give new insights into learning effective multi-stream/modal representations. We also systematically investigate the importance and rationality of the key components in AIDE and benchmarks. The project link is https://github.com/ydk122024/AIDE."}}
