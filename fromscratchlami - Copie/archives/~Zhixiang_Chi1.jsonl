The goal is to continually discover novel classes while maintaining the performance in known classes. We name the setting Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD). Existing methods for novel class discovery cannot directly handle the C-GCD setting due to some unrealistic assumptions, such as the unlabeled data only containing novel classes. Furthermore, they fail to discover novel classes in a continual fashion. In this work, we lift all these assumptions and propose an approach, called MetaGCD, to learn how to incrementally discover with less forgetting. Our proposed method uses a meta-learning framework and leverages the offline labeled data to simulate the testing incremental learning process. A meta-objective is defined to revolve around two conflicting learning objectives to achieve novel class discovery without forgetting. Furthermore, a soft neighborhood-based contrastive network is proposed to discriminate uncorrelated images while attracting correlated images. We build strong baselines and conduct extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of our method."}}

Given a sequence of observed frames in a video, the goal is to predict the depth map of a future frame that has not been observed yet. Depth estimation plays a vital role for scene understanding and decision-making in intelligent systems. Predicting future depth maps can be valuable for autonomous vehicles to anticipate the behaviours of their surrounding objects. Our proposed model for this problem has a two-branch architecture. One branch is for the primary task of future depth prediction. The other branch is for an auxiliary task of image reconstruction. The auxiliary branch can act as a regularization. Inspired by some recent work on test-time adaption, we use the auxiliary task during testing to adapt the model to a specific test video. We also propose a novel meta-auxiliary learning that learns the model specifically for the purpose of effective test-time adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms other alternative methods."}}

Both approaches have their pros and cons. For example, per-frame methods are generally more accurate, but they are often slow. Warping-based approaches are more efficient, but the performance is usually not good. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel fast framework for human pose estimation to meet the real-time inference with controllable accuracy degradation in compressed video domain. Our approach takes advantage of the motion representation (called \u201cmotion vector\u201d) that is readily available in a compressed video. Pose joints in a frame are obtained by directly warping the pose joints from the previous frame using the motion vectors. We also propose modules to correct possible errors introduced by the pose warping when needed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework for accelerating the speed of top-down human pose estimation in videos."}}

Furthermore, expecting single-model training to learn extensive knowledge from multiple source domains is counterintuitive. The model is more biased toward learning only domain-invariant features and may result in negative knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel framework for unsupervised test-time adaptation, which is formulated as a knowledge distillation process to address domain shift. Specifically, we incorporate Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) as teachers, where each expert is separately trained on different source domains to maximize their specialty. Given a test-time target domain, a small set of unlabeled data is sampled to query the knowledge from MoE. As the source domains are correlated to the target domains, a transformer-based aggregator then combines the domain knowledge by examining the interconnection among them. The output is treated as a supervision signal to adapt a student prediction network toward the target domain. We further employ meta-learning to enforce the aggregator to distill positive knowledge and the student network to achieve fast adaptation.

FSCIL aims to incrementally learn new classes with only a few samples in each class. Most existing methods only consider the incremental steps at test time. The learning objective of these methods is often hand-engineered and is not directly tied to the objective (i.e. incrementally learning new classes) during testing. Those methods are sub-optimal due to the misalignment between the training objectives and what the methods are expected to do during evaluation. In this work, we proposed a bi-level optimization based on meta-learning to directly optimize the network to learn how to incrementally learn in the setting of FSCIL. Concretely, we propose to sample sequences of incremental tasks from base classes for training to simulate the evaluation protocol. For each task, the model is learned using a meta-objective such that it is capable to perform fast adaptation without forgetting. Furthermore, we propose a bi-directional guided modulation, which is learned to automatically modulate the activations to reduce catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline and achieves the state-of-the-art results on CIFARIOO, MiniImageNet, and CUB200 datasets."}}

Recently, a pioneer claims that the commonly used replay-based method in class-incremental learning (CIL) is ineffective and thus not preferred for FSCIL. This has, if truth, a significant influence on the fields of FSCIL. In this paper, we show through empirical results that adopting the data replay is surprisingly favorable. However, storing and replaying old data can lead to a privacy concern. To address this issue, we alternatively propose using data-free replay that can synthesize data by a generator without accessing real data. In observing the effectiveness of uncertain data for knowledge distillation, we impose entropy regularization in the generator training to encourage more uncertain examples. Moreover, we propose to relabel the generated data with one-hot-like labels. This modification allows the network to learn by solely minimizing the cross-entropy loss, which mitigates the problem of balancing different objectives in the conventional knowledge distillation approach. Finally, we show extensive experimental results and analysis on CIFAR-100, miniImageNet and CUB-200 to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed one."}}

Most existing deep end-to-end learning approaches adopt the same generic model for all unseen test images. These solutions are sub-optimal, as they fail to utilize the internal information within a specific image. On the other hand, a self-supervised approach, SelfDeblur, enables internal-training within a test image from scratch, but it does not fully take advantages of large external dataset. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised meta-auxiliary learning to improve the performance of deblurring by integrating both external and internal learning. Concretely, we build a self-supervised auxiliary reconstruction task which shares a portion of the network with the primary deblurring task. The two tasks are jointly trained on an external dataset. Furthermore, we propose a meta-auxiliary training scheme to further optimize the pre-trained model as a base learner which is applicable for fast adaptation at test time. During training, the performance of both tasks is coupled. Therefore, we are able to exploit the internal information at test time via the auxiliary task to enhance the performance of deblurring. Extensive experimental results across evaluation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of test-time adaptation of the proposed method."}}
