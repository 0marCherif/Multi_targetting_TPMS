The task of predicting structural changes in communities over time is known as community evolution prediction. Existing work in this area has focused on the development of frameworks for defining events while using traditional classification methods to perform the actual prediction. We present a novel graph neural network for predicting community evolution events from structural and temporal information. The model (GNAN) includes a group-node attention component which enables support for variable-sized inputs and learned representation of groups\nbased on member and neighbor node features. A comparative evaluation with standard baseline methods is performed and\nwe demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines. Additionally, we show the effects of network trends on model performance."}}

We argue that using the k-neighborhoods of all data points as regularization constraints can negatively affect the quality of the factorization, and propose an unsupervised and selective regularized matrix factorization algorithm to tackle this problem. Our approach jointly learns a sparse set of representatives and their neighbor affinities, and the data factorization. We further propose a fast approximation of our approach by relaxing the selectivity constraints on the data. Our proposed algorithms are competitive against baselines and state-of-the-art manifold regularization and clustering algorithms."}}

However, neural networks are known to be vulnerable to overfitting, and therefore have limited potential in the unsupervised outlier detection setting. The majority of existing deep learning methods for anomaly detection is sensitive to contamination of the training data to anomalous instances. To overcome the aforementioned limitations we develop a Boosting-based Autoencoder Ensemble approach (BAE). BAE is an unsupervised ensemble method that, similarly to boosting, builds an adaptive cascade of autoencoders to achieve improved and robust results. BAE trains the autoencoder components sequentially by performing a weighted sampling of the data, aimed at reducing the amount of outliers used during training, and at injecting diversity in the ensemble. We perform extensive experiments and show that the proposed methodology outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under a variety of conditions."}}

However, most existing hashing methods are based on hand-crafted or raw level features of objects, which may not be optimally compatible with the coding process. Besides, these hashing methods are mainly designed to handle simple pairwise similarity. The complex multilevel ranking semantic structure of instances associated with multiple labels has not been well explored yet. In this paper, we propose a ranking-based deep cross-modal hashing approach (RDCMH). RDCMH firstly uses the feature and label information of data to derive a semi-supervised semantic ranking list. Next, to expand the semantic representation power of hand-crafted features, RDCMH integrates the semantic ranking information into deep cross-modal hashing and jointly optimizes the compatible parameters of deep feature representations and of hashing functions. Experiments on real multi-modal datasets show that RDCMH outperforms other competitive baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal retrieval applications."}}

Existing M3L solutions only partially explore the inter or intra relations between objects (or bags), instances, and labels, which can convey important contextual information for M3L. As such, they may have a compromised performance. In this paper, we propose a collaborative matrix factorization based solution called M3Lcmf. M3Lcmf first uses a heterogeneous network composed of nodes of bags, instances, and labels, to encode different types of relations via multiple relational data matrices. To preserve the intrinsic structure of the data matrices, M3Lcmf collaboratively factorizes them into low-rank matrices, explores the latent relationships between bags, instances, and labels, and selectively merges the data matrices. An aggregation scheme is further introduced to aggregate the instance-level labels into bag-level and to guide the factorization. An empirical study on benchmark datasets show that M3Lcmf outperforms other related competitive solutions both in the instance-level and bag-level prediction."}}

Despite the progress made, it\u2019s still a challenge for users to analyze and understand the distinctive structure of each output clustering. To ease this process, we consider diverse clusterings embedded in different subspaces, and analyze the embedding subspaces to shed light into the structure of each clustering. To this end, we provide a two-stage approach called MISC (Multiple Independent Subspace Clusterings). In the first stage, MISC uses independent subspace analysis to seek multiple and statistical independent (i.e. non-redundant) subspaces, and determines the number of subspaces via the minimum description length principle. In the second stage, to account for the intrinsic geometric structure of samples embedded in each subspace, MISC performs graph regularized semi-nonnegative matrix factorization to explore clusters. It additionally integrates the kernel trick into matrix factorization to handle non-linearly separable clusters. Experimental results on synthetic datasets show that MISC can find different interesting clusterings from the sought independent subspaces, and it also outperforms other related and competitive approaches on real-world datasets."}}

There are two main challenges of this learning task: incomplete views and missing (weak) labels. The former assumes that views may not include all data objects. The weak label setting implies that only a subset of relevant labels are provided for training objects while other labels are missing. Both incomplete views and weak labels can lead to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model (iMVWL) to jointly address the two challenges. iMVWL simultaneously learns a shared subspace from incomplete views with weak labels, the local label structure and the predictor in this subspace, which can not only capture cross-view relationships but also weak-label information of training samples. We further develop an alternative solution to optimize our model, this solution can avoid suboptimal results and reinforce their reciprocal effects, and thus further improve the performance. Extensive experimental results on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our model against other competitive algorithms."}}

To utilize the information spread across multiple sources in a combined fashion, these data sources are transformed into kernels. Several protein function prediction methods follow a two-phased approach: they first optimize the weights on individual kernels to produce a composite kernel, and then train a classifier on the composite kernel. As such, these methods result in an optimal composite kernel, but not necessarily in an optimal classifier. On the other hand, some methods optimize the loss of binary classifiers, and learn weights for the different kernels iteratively. A protein has multiple functions, and each function can be viewed as a label. These methods solve the problem of optimizing weights on the input kernels for each of the labels. This is computationally expensive and ignores inter-label correlations.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a method called Protein Function Prediction by Integrating Multiple Kernels (ProMK). ProMK iteratively optimizes the phases of learning optimal weights and reducing the empirical loss of a multi-label classifier for each of the labels simultaneously, using a combined objective function. ProMK can assign larger weights to smooth kernels and downgrade the weights on noisy kernels. We evaluate the ability of ProMK to predict the function of proteins using several standard benchmarks. We show that our approach performs better than previously proposed protein function prediction approaches that integrate data from multiple networks, and multi-label multiple kernel learning methods."}}

Integrating these heterogeneous data sources, to automatically infer the function of proteins, is a fundamental challenge in computational biology. Several approaches represent each data source with a kernel (similarity) function. The resulting kernels are then integrated to determine a composite kernel, which is used for developing a function prediction model. Proteins are also found to have multiple roles and functions. As such, several approaches cast the protein function prediction problem within a multi-label learning framework. In our work we develop an approach that takes advantage of several unlabeled proteins, along with multiple data sources and multiple functions of proteins. We develop a graph-based transductive multi-label classifier (TMC) that is evaluated on a composite kernel, and also propose a method for data integration using the ensemble framework, called transductive multi-label ensemble classifier (TMEC). The TMEC approach trains a graph-based multi-label classifier for each individual kernel, and then combines the predictions of the individual models. Our contribution is the use of a bi-relational directed graph that captures relationships between pairs of proteins, between pairs of functions, and between proteins and functions. We evaluate the ability of TMC and TMEC to predict the functions of proteins by using two yeast datasets. We show that our approach performs better than recently proposed protein function prediction methods on composite and multiple kernels."}}
