Here we discuss various ways of building learning curves from empirical data for the Additive Factor model (AFM) and highlight their limitations. We focus on the impact of student attrition, a.k.a. attrition bias. We propose a new way to build learning curves, by combining empirical observations and AFM predictions. We validate this proposition on simulated data, and test it on real datasets."}}

The sys- tems mainly based on this supervised approach perform well in the WMT18 Parallel Corpus Filtering shared task (4th place in 100-million- word evaluation, 8th place in 10-million-word evaluation, and 6th place overall, out of 48 submissions). In fact, our best performing system\u2014NRC-yisi-bicov is one of the only four submissions ranked top 10 in both evaluations. Our submitted systems also in- clude some initial filtering steps for scaling down the size of the test corpus and a fi- nal redundancy removal step for better seman- tic and token coverage of the filtered corpus. In this paper, we also describe our unsuc- cessful attempt in automatically synthesizing a noisy parallel development corpus for tuning the weights to combine different parallelism and fluency features."}}

We compare a state-of-the-art baseline relying on character n-grams and a traditional statistical classifier, a voting ensemble of classifiers, and a deep learning approach using a Transformer network. We describe how these systems were trained, and analyze the impact of some preprocessing and model estimation decisions. The deep neural network achieved 77% accuracy on the test data, which turned out to be the best performance at the CLI evaluation, establishing a new state-of-the-art for cuneiform language identification."}}
