This paper proposes a Dynamic Sample Selection (DSS) method for CTDA. DSS consists of dynamic thresholding, positive learning, and negative learning processes. Traditionally, models learn from unlabeled unknown environment data and equally rely on all samples' pseudo-labels to update their parameters through self-training. However, noisy predictions exist in these pseudo-labels, so all samples are not equally trustworthy. Therefore, in our method, a dynamic thresholding module is first designed to select suspected low-quality from high-quality samples. The selected low-quality samples are more likely to be wrongly predicted. Therefore, we apply joint positive and negative learning on both high- and low-quality samples to reduce the risk of using wrong information. We conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for CTDA in the image domain, outperforming the state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, our approach is also evaluated in the 3D point cloud domain, showcasing its versatility and potential for broader applicability."}}

However, recent studies reveal that modern object detectors suffer a considerable performance drop in an open-set setting and tend to incorrectly detect unknown objects and mislabel them as belonging to known categories with a high degree of confidence. We observe that the \u2018catch-all background\u2019 approach with limited training data from the detection dataset is insufficient to equip a detector with the ability to reject all unknown objects as background. Based on this observation, we propose to augment the detection dataset by reusing a subset of ImageNet that does not contain any object categories predefined by the detection task. The augmented training on a held-in background dataset allows the detector to reject unknown object instances as background instead of mislabelling them. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed simple yet effective REusing ImageNet (REIN) technique improves the performance of object detectors in an open-set setting. Given the promising results, we hope that our method can encourage our community to pay more attention to open-set object detection and to rethink the data augmentation in detection."}}

This is a combination of two equally challenging tasks where one tries to perform video classification from two different modalities of inputs, and the other pushes to achieve this in a zero-shot setting. The natural alignment between audio and visual modalities is the key to addressing this relatively unexplored task. The predominant approach in AV-GZSL has been to learn better cross-modal attention between the two input domains and leverage large language pretraining. However, for better attention and pretraining, there exists a semantic gap between the embedding of different modalities that requires a more diverse and less sparse representation of the joint embedding space. To overcome this, we propose a complementary approach to the existing research direction, where we simulate unseen audio-visual features using a generative model, and regulate it by combining contrastive and discriminative loss. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we benchmark our model on VGGSound-GZSL, ActivityNet-GZSL, and UCF-GZSL and report state-of-the-art performance, and qualitatively show that unseen classes are better clustered together with our generative approach."}}

An analysis of the audio-visual data reveals a large degree of hyperbolicity, indicating the potential benefit of using a hyperbolic transformation to achieve curvature-aware geometric learning, with the aim of exploring more complex hierarchical data structures for this task. The proposed approach employs a novel loss function that incorporates cross-modality alignment between video and audio features in the hyperbolic space. Additionally, we explore the use of multiple adaptive curvatures for hyperbolic projections. The experimental results on this very challenging task demonstrate that our proposed hyperbolic approach for zero-shot learning outperforms the SOTA method on three datasets: VGGSound-GZSL, UCF-GZSL, and ActivityNet-GZSL achieving a harmonic mean (HM) improvement of around 3.0%, 7.0%, and 5.3%, respectively."}}

Previously, with the well-known open-set semantic segmentation (OSS), the intelligent agent only detects the unknown regions without further processing, limiting their perception of the environment. It stands to reason that a further analysis of the detected unknown pixels would be beneficial. Therefore, we propose GOSS, which unifies the abilities of two well-defined segmentation tasks, OSS and generic segmentation (GS), in a holistic way. Specifically, GOSS classifies pixels as belonging to known classes, and clusters (or groups) of pixels of unknown class are labelled as such. To evaluate this new expanded task, we further propose a metric which balances the pixel classification and clustering aspects. Moreover, we build benchmark tests on top of existing datasets and propose a simple neural architecture as a baseline, which jointly predicts pixel classification and clustering under open-set settings. Our experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our baseline. We believe our new GOSS task can produce an expressive image understanding for future research. Code will be made available."}}

However, an issue with the current setting is that all the predicted unknown objects share the same category as \"unknown\", which require incremental learning via a human-in-the-loop approach to label novel classes. In order to address this problem, we present a new task, namely Open-Set Object Detection and Discovery (OSODD). This new task aims to extend the ability of open-set object detectors to further discover the categories of unknown objects based on their visual appearance without human effort. We propose a two-stage method that first uses an open-set object detector to predict both known and unknown objects. Then, we study the representation of predicted objects in an unsupervised manner and discover new categories from the set of unknown objects. With this method, a detector is able to detect objects belonging to known classes and define novel categories for objects of unknown classes with minimal supervision. We show the performance of our model on the MS-COCO dataset under a thorough evaluation protocol. We hope that our work will promote further research towards a more robust real-world detection system."}}

For example, rain may consist of multiple components, such as rain streaks, raindrops, snow, and haze. Rainy images can be treated as an arbitrary combination of these components, some of them or all of them. How to decompose superimposed images, like rainy images, into distinct source components is a crucial step toward real-world vision systems. To facilitate research on this new task, we construct multiple benchmark datasets, including mixed image decomposition across multiple domains, real-scenario deraining, and joint shadow/reflection/watermark removal. Moreover, we propose a simple yet general Blind Image Decomposition Network (BIDeN) to serve as a strong baseline for future work. Experimental results demonstrate the tenability of our benchmarks and the effectiveness of BIDeN. Codes and datasets are available at GitHub ."}}

However, the success of the geometry constraints, posed in the embedding space, indicates that curved spaces might encode more structural information, leading to better discriminative power and hence richer representations. In this work, we investigate benefits of the curved space for analyzing anomalies or out-of-distribution objects in data. This is achieved by considering embeddings via three geometry constraints, namely, spherical geometry (with positive curvature), hyperbolic geometry (with negative curvature) or mixed geometry (with both positive and negative curvatures). Three geometric constraints can be chosen interchangeably in a unified design given the task at hand. Tailored for the embeddings in the curved space, we also formulate functions to compute the anomaly score. Two types of geometric modules (i.e., Geometric-in-One and Geometric-in-Two models) are proposed to plug in the original Euclidean classifier, and anomaly scores are computed from the curved embeddings. We evaluate the resulting designs under a diverse set of visual recognition scenarios, including image detection (multi-class OOD detection and one-class anomaly detection) and segmentation (multi-class anomaly segmentation and one-class anomaly segmentation). The empirical results show the effectiveness of our proposal through the consistent improvement over various scenarios."}}

The policy gradient algorithm is employed to train the agent towards adaptively localizing the representative regions on feature maps over time. We further design a reward function based on the prediction of the held-out data, thus helping the attention mechanism to generalize better across the unseen classes. The extensive experiments show, with the help of the reinforced attention, that our embedding network has the capability to progressively generate a more discriminative representation in few-shot learning. Moreover, experiments on the task of image classification also show the effectiveness of the proposed design."}}
