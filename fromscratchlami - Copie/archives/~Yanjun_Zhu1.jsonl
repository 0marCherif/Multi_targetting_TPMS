However, high computation cost and memory usage hinder their deployment on resource-constrained environment. To deal with the issue, in this paper, we introduce two novel progressive binary graph convolutional network for skeleton-based action recognition PB-GCN and PB-GCN, which can obtain significant speed-up and memory saving. In PB-GCN, the filters are binarized, and in PB-GCN, both filters and activations are binary. Specifically, we propose a progressive optimization, i.e., employing ternary models as the initialization of binary GCNs (BGCN) to improve the representational capability of binary models. Moreover, the center loss is exploited to improve the training procedure for better performance. Experimental results on two public benchmarks (i.e., Skeleton-Kinetics and NTU RGB + D) demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed PB-GCN and PB-GCN are comparable to their full-precision counterparts and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, such as BWN, XNOR-Net, and Bi-Real Net."}}

However, the most widely used memory-replay approach often suffers from memory overfitting. To mitigate the memory overfitting, we propose a continuous and reversible memory transformation method so that the memory data is hard to overfit, thus improving generalization. The transformation is achieved by optimizing a bi-level optimization objective that jointly learns the CL model and memory transformer. Specifically, we propose a deterministic continuous memory transformer (DCMT) modeled by an ordinary differential equation, allowing for infinite memory transformation and generating diverse and hard memory data. Furthermore, we inject uncertainty into the transformation function and propose a stochastic continuous memory transformer (SCMT) modeled by a stochastic differential equation, which substantially enhances the diversity of the transformed memory buffer. The proposed neural transformation approaches have significant advantages over existing ones: (1) we can obtain infinite many transformed data, thus significantly increasing the memory buffer diversity; (2) the proposed continuous transformations are reversible, i.e., the original raw memory data could be restored from the transformed memory data without the need to make a replica of the memory data. Extensive experiments on both task-aware and task-free CL show significant improvement with our approach compared to strong baselines.  "}}

It provides accurate evidence for agricultural management as well as early evaluation of yield. However, the observation of critical growth stages mainly relies on manual labour at present. This has some limitations because it is time-consuming, discontinuous and non-objective. Computer vision technology can help to alleviate these difficulties when monitoring growth status. This paper describes a novel automatic observation system for wheat heading stage based on computer vision. Images compliant with statistical requirements are taken in natural conditions where illumination changes frequently. Wheat plants with low spatial resolution overlap substantially, which increases observational difficulties. To adapt to the complex environment, a two-step coarse-to-fine wheat ear detection mechanism is proposed. In the coarse-detection step, machine learning technology is used to emphasise the candidate ear regions. In the fine-detection step, non-ear areas are eliminated through higher-level features. For that purpose, scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is densely extracted as the low-level visual descriptor, then Fisher vector (FV) encoding is employed to generate the mid-level representation. Based on three consecutive year's data of seven image sequences, a series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposition. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms other existing methods with an average value of absolute error of 1.14 days on the test dataset. The results indicate that automatic observation is quite acceptable compared to manual observations."}}

Deep learning techniques have boosted the performance of hyperspectral image analysis. Compared with traditional machine learning, deep learning architectures exploit both spatial and spectral information of hyperspectral image analysis. To scrutinize thoroughly the current efforts, provide insights, and identify potential research directions on deep learning for hyperspectral image analysis in agriculture, this paper presents a systematic and comprehensive review. Firstly, its applications in agriculture are summarized, include ripeness and component prediction, different classification themes, and plant disease detection. Then, the recent achievements are reviewed in hyperspectral image analysis from the aspects of the deep learning models and the feature networks. Finally, the existing challenges of hyperspectral image analysis based on deep learning are summarized and the prospects of future works are put forward."}}

Given 42 frequently used individual words and 30 meaningful sentences, SonicASL can achieve an accuracy of 93.8% and 90.6% for word-level and sentence-level recognition, respectively. The proposed system is tested in two real-world scenarios: indoor (apartment, office, and corridor) and outdoor (sidewalk) environments with pedestrians walking nearby.
