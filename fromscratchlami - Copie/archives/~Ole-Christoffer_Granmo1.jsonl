While obtaining accurate, medical domain interpretable results is crucial, it is demanding because real-world EHRs contain many inconsistencies and inaccuracies. Further, testing of such machine learning-based systems in clinical practice has received limited attention and are yet to be accepted by clinicians for regular use. Methods We present our results from the evaluation of an NLP-driven CDSS developed and implemented in a Norwegian Hospital. The system incorporates unsupervised and supervised machine learning combined with rule-based algorithms for clinical concept-based searching to identify and classify allergies of concern for anesthesia and intensive care. The system also implements a semi-supervised machine learning approach to automatically annotate medical concepts in the narrative. Results Evaluation of system adoption was performed by a mixed methods approach applying The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as a theoretical lens. Most of the respondents demonstrated a high degree of system acceptance and expressed a positive attitude towards the system in general and intention to use the system in the future. Increased detection of patient allergies, and thus improved quality of practice and patient safety during surgery or ICU stays, was perceived as the most important advantage of the system. Conclusions Our combined machine learning and rule-based approach benefits system performance, efficiency, and interpretability. The results demonstrate that the proposed CDSS increases detection of patient allergies, and that the system received high-level acceptance by the clinicians using it. Useful recommendations for further system improvements and implementation initiatives are reducing the quantity of alarms, expansion of the system to include more clinical concepts, closer EHR system integration, and more workstations available at point of care."}}

Although numerous papers explore the TM empirically, many of its properties have not yet been analyzed mathematically. In this article, we analyze the convergence of the TM when input is non-linearly related to output by the XOR-operator. Our analysis reveals that the TM, with just two conjunctive clauses, can converge almost surely to reproducing XOR, learning from training data over an infinite time horizon. Furthermore, the analysis shows how the hyper-parameter <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$T$</tex-math></inline-formula> guides clause construction so that the clauses capture the distinct sub-patterns in the data. Our analysis of convergence for XOR thus lays the foundation for analyzing other more complex logical expressions. These analyses altogether, from a mathematical perspective, provide new insights on why TMs have obtained the state-of-the-art performance on several pattern recognition problems."}}

Typical NLP solutions employ pre-defined vector representations to improve generalization by co-locating similar words in vector space. For instance, Word2Vec is a self-supervised predictive model that captures the context of words using a neural network. Similarly, GLoVe is a popular unsupervised model incorporating corpus-wide word co-occurrence statistics. Such word embedding has significantly boosted important NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, document classification, and machine translation. However, the embeddings are dense floating-point vectors, making them expensive to compute and difficult to interpret. In this paper, we instead propose to represent the semantics of words with a few defining words that are related using propositional logic. To produce such logical embeddings, we introduce a Tsetlin Machine-based autoencoder that learns logical clauses self-supervised. The clauses consist of contextual words like \"black,\" \"cup,\" and \"hot\" to define other words like \"coffee,\" thus being human-understandable. We evaluate our embedding approach on several intrinsic and extrinsic benchmarks, outperforming GLoVe on six classification tasks. Furthermore, we investigate the interpretability of our embedding using the logical representations acquired during training. We also visualize word clusters in vector space, demonstrating how our logical embedding co-locate similar words."}}

Indeed, NLP performance highly depends upon the effectiveness of the preprocessing pipeline that builds the data representation. Many representation learning frameworks, such as Word2Vec, encode input data based on local contextual information that interconnects words. Such approaches can be computationally intensive, and their encoding is hard to explain. We here propose an interpretable representation learning framework utilizing Tsetlin Machine (TM). The TM is an interpretable logic-based algorithm that has exhibited competitive performance in numerous NLP tasks. We employ the TM clauses to build a sparse propositional (boolean) representation of natural language text. Each clause is a class-specific propositional rule that links words semantically and contextually. Through visualization, we illustrate how the resulting data representation provides semantically more distinct features, better separating the underlying classes. As a result, the following classification task becomes less demanding, benefiting simple machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). We evaluate our approach using six NLP classification tasks and twelve domain adaptation tasks. Our main finding is that the accuracy of our proposed technique significantly outperforms the vanilla TM, approaching the competitive accuracy of deep neural network (DNN) baselines. Furthermore, we present a case study showing how the representations derived from our framework are interpretable.

However, such black box models are inadequate for analysing physiological signals where credibility and interpretability are crucial. Indeed, how to make ECG analysis transparent is still an open problem. In this study, we develop a Tsetlin machine (TM) based architecture for premature ventricular contraction (PVC) identification by analysing long-term ECG signals. The architecture is transparent by describing patterns directly with logical AND rules. To validate the accuracy of our approach, we compare the TM performance with those of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our numerical results demonstrate that TM provides comparable performance with CNNs on the MIT-BIH database. To validate interpretability, we provide explanatory diagrams that show how TM makes the PVC identification from confirming and invalidating patterns. We argue that these are compatible with medical knowledge so that they can be readily understood and verified by a medical doctor. Accordingly, we believe this study paves the way for machine learning (ML) for ECG analysis in clinical practice."}}

While TMs match or surpass deep learning accuracy for an increasing number of applications, large clause pools tend to produce clauses with many literals (long clauses). As such, they become less interpretable. Further, longer clauses increase the switching activity of the clause logic in hardware, consuming more power. This paper introduces a novel variant of TM learning - Clause Size Constrained TMs (CSC-TMs) - where one can set a soft constraint on the clause size. As soon as a clause includes more literals than the constraint allows, it starts expelling literals. Accordingly, oversized clauses only appear transiently. To evaluate CSC-TM, we conduct classification, clustering, and regression experiments on tabular data, natural language text, images, and board games. Our results show that CSC-TM maintains accuracy with up to 80 times fewer literals. Indeed, the accuracy increases with shorter clauses for TREC, IMDb, and BBC Sports. After the accuracy peaks, it drops gracefully as the clause size approaches a single literal. We finally analyze CSC-TM power consumption and derive new convergence properties."}}

We propose the CaiRL Environment Toolkit as an efficient, compatible, and more sustainable alternative for training learning agents and propose methods to develop more efficient environment simulations. There is an increasing focus on developing sustainable artificial intelligence. However, little effort has been made to improve the efficiency of running environment simulations. The most popular development toolkit for reinforcement learning, OpenAI Gym, is built using Python, a powerful but slow programming language. We propose a toolkit written in C++ with the same flexibility level but works orders of magnitude faster to make up for Python's inefficiency. This would drastically cut climate emissions. CaiRL also presents the first reinforcement learning toolkit with a built-in JVM and Flash support for running legacy flash games for reinforcement learning research. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CaiRL in the classic control benchmark, comparing the execution speed to OpenAI Gym. Furthermore, we illustrate that CaiRL can act as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI Gym to leverage significantly faster training speeds because of the reduced environment computation time."}}
