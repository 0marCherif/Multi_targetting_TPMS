However, the highest-performing approaches use token-based transformer models, which do not leverage domain knowledge. Classical program analysis techniques such as dataflow analysis can detect many types of bugs and are the most commonly used methods in practice. Motivated by the causal relationship between bugs and dataflow analysis, we present DeepDFA, a dataflow analysis-guided graph learning framework and embedding that use program semantic features for vulnerability detection. We show that DeepDFA is performant and efficient. DeepDFA ranked first in recall, first in generalizing over unseen projects, and second in F1 among all the state-of-the-art models we experimented with. It is also the smallest model in terms of the number of parameters, and was trained in 9 minutes, 69x faster than the highest-performing baseline. DeepDFA can be used with other models. By integrating LineVul and DeepDFA, we achieved the best vulnerability detection performance of 96.4 F1 score, 98.69 precision, and 94.22 recall."}}

Recently, a line of theoretical works established the global convergences for first-order methods such as gradient descent if the implicit networks are over-parameterized. However, as they train all layers together, their analyses are equivalent to only studying the evolution of the output layer. It is unclear how the implicit layer contributes to the training. Thus, in this paper, we restrict ourselves to only training the implicit layer. We show that global convergence is guaranteed, even if only the implicit layer is trained. On the other hand, the theoretical understanding of when and how the training performance of an implicit neural network can be generalized to unseen data is still under-explored. Although this problem has been studied in standard feed-forward networks, the case of implicit neural networks is still intriguing since implicit networks theoretically have infinitely many layers. Therefore, this paper investigates the generalization error for implicit neural networks. Specifically, we study the generalization of an implicit network activated by the ReLU function over random initialization. We provide a generalization bound that is initialization sensitive. As a result, we show that gradient flow with proper random initialization can train a sufficient over-parameterized implicit network to achieve arbitrarily small generalization errors."}}

Most existing GNN explanation methods identify the most important edges or nodes but fail to consider substructures, which are more important for graph data. One method considering subgraphs tries to search all possible subgraphs and identifies the most significant ones. However, the subgraphs identified may not be recurrent or statistically important for interpretation. This work proposes a novel method, named MotifExplainer, to explain GNNs by identifying important motifs, which are recurrent and statistically significant patterns in graphs. Our proposed motif-based methods can provide better human-understandable explanations than methods based on nodes, edges, and regular subgraphs. Given an instance graph and a pre-trained GNN model, our method first extracts motifs in the graph using domain-specific motif extraction rules. Then, a motif embedding is encoded by feeding motifs into the pre-trained GNN. Finally, we employ an attention-based method to identify the most influential motifs as explanations for the prediction results. The empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}}

Its prediction rule is provided implicitly based on the solution of an equilibrium equation. Although a line of recent empirical studies has demonstrated its superior performances, the theoretical understanding of implicit neural networks is limited. In general, the equilibrium equation may not be well-posed during the training. As a result, there is no guarantee that a vanilla (stochastic) gradient descent (SGD) training nonlinear implicit neural networks can converge. This paper fills the gap by analyzing the gradient flow of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activated implicit neural networks. For an $m$ width implicit neural network with ReLU activation and $n$ training samples, we show that a randomly initialized gradient descent converges to a global minimum at a linear rate for the square loss function if the implicit neural network is over-parameterized. It is worth noting that, unlike existing works on the convergence of (S)GD on finite-layer over-parameterized neural networks, our convergence results hold for implicit neural networks, where the number of layers is infinite."}}

Graph Neural Networks have been widely used in feature representation learning of molecular graphs. However, most proposed methods focus on the individual molecular graph while neglecting their connections, such as motif-level relationships. We propose a novel molecular graph representation learning method by constructing a Heterogeneous Motif graph (HM-graph) to address this issue. In particular, we build an HM-graph that contains motif nodes and molecular nodes. Each motif node corresponds to a motif extracted from molecules. Then, we propose a Heterogeneous Motif Graph Neural Network (HM-GNN) to learn feature representations for each node in the HM-graph. Our HM-graph also enables effective multi-task learning, especially for small molecular datasets. To address the potential efficiency issue, we propose an edge sampler, which significantly reduces computational resources usage. The experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art models. Under multi-task settings, the promising performances of our methods on combined datasets shed light on a new learning paradigm for small molecular datasets. Finally, we show that our model achieves similar performances with significantly less computational resources by using our edge sampler."}}

These methods either ignore word morphologies or word boundaries. To overcome these limitations, we propose to convert texts into 2-D representations and develop the Sent2Matrix method. Our method allows for the explicit incorporation of both word morphologies and boundaries. When coupled with a novel serpentine padding method, our Sent2Matrix method leads to an interesting visualization in which 1-D character sequences are folded into 2-D serpentine manifolds. Notably, our method is the first attempt to represent texts in 2-D formats.

However, the increasing model size has raised challenges in employing them in resource-limited applications. In this work, we propose to compress deep models by using channel-wise convolutions, which replace dense connections among feature maps with sparse ones in CNNs. Based on this novel operation, we build light-weight CNNs known as ChannelNets. ChannelNets use three instances of channel-wise convolutions; namely group channel-wise convolutions, depth-wise separable channel-wise convolutions, and the convolutional classification layer. Compared to prior CNNs designed for mobile devices, ChannelNets achieve a significant reduction in terms of the number of parameters and computational cost without loss in accuracy. Notably, our work represents an attempt to compress the fully-connected classification layer, which usually accounts for about 25 percent of total parameters in compact CNNs. Along this new direction, we investigate the behavior of our proposed convolutional classification layer and conduct detailed analysis. Based on our in-depth analysis, we further propose convolutional classification layers without weight-sharing. This new classification layer achieves a good trade-off between fully-connected classification layers and the convolutional classification layer. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ChannelNets achieve consistently better performance compared to prior methods."}}

In message-passing operations, each node aggregates information from its neighboring nodes. To enlarge the receptive field, graph neural networks need to stack multiple message-passing graph convolution layers, which leads to the over-fitting issue and over-smoothing issue. To address these limitations, we propose a teleport graph convolution layer (TeleGCL) that uses teleport functions to enable each node to aggregate information from a much larger neighborhood. For each node, teleport functions select relevant nodes beyond the local neighborhood, thereby resulting in a larger receptive field. To apply our structure-aware teleport function, we propose a novel method to construct structural features for nodes in the graph. Based on our TeleGCL, we build a family of teleport graph convolutional networks. The empirical results on graph and node classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods."}}

Graph convolutions perform neighborhood aggregation and represent one of the most important graph operations. Nevertheless, one layer of these neighborhood aggregation methods only consider immediate neighbors, and the performance decreases when going deeper to enable larger receptive fields. Several recent studies attribute this performance deterioration to the over-smoothing issue, which states that repeated propagation makes node representations of different classes indistinguishable. In this work, we study this observation systematically and develop new insights towards deeper graph neural networks. First, we provide a systematical analysis on this issue and argue that the key factor compromising the performance significantly is the entanglement of representation transformation and propagation in current graph convolution operations. After decoupling these two operations, deeper graph neural networks can be used to learn graph node representations from larger receptive fields. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the above observation when building very deep models, which can serve as a rigorous and gentle description of the over-smoothing issue. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we propose Deep Adaptive Graph Neural Network (DAGNN) to adaptively incorporate information from large receptive fields. A set of experiments on citation, co-authorship, and co-purchase datasets have confirmed our analysis and insights and demonstrated the superiority of our proposed methods.\n"}}
