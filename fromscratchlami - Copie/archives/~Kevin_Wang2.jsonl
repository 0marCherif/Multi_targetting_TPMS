PSRO is based on the tabular double oracle (DO) method, an algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium, but may increase exploitability from one iteration to the next. We propose anytime double oracle (ADO), a tabular double oracle algorithm for 2-player zero-sum games that is guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium while decreasing exploitability from one iteration to the next. Unlike DO, in which the restricted distribution is based on the restricted game formed by each player's strategy sets, ADO finds the restricted distribution for each player that minimizes its exploitability against any policy in the full, unrestricted game. We also propose a method of finding this restricted distribution via a no-regret algorithm updated against best responses, called RM-BR DO. Finally, we propose anytime PSRO (APSRO), a version of ADO that calculates best responses via reinforcement learning. In experiments on Leduc poker and random normal form games, we show that our methods achieve far lower exploitability than DO and PSRO and decrease exploitability monotonically."}}

Although PSRO is guaranteed to converge to an approximate Nash equilibrium and can handle continuous actions, it may take an exponential number of iterations as the number of information states (infostates) grows. We propose Extensive-Form Double Oracle (XDO), an extensive-form double oracle algorithm for two-player zero-sum games that is guaranteed to converge to an approximate Nash equilibrium linearly in the number of infostates. Unlike PSRO, which mixes best responses at the root of the game, XDO mixes best responses at every infostate. We also introduce Neural XDO (NXDO), where the best response is learned through deep RL. In tabular experiments on Leduc poker, we find that XDO achieves an approximate Nash equilibrium in a number of iterations an order of magnitude smaller than PSRO. Experiments on a modified Leduc poker game and Oshi-Zumo show that tabular XDO achieves a lower exploitability than CFR with the same amount of computation. We also find that NXDO outperforms PSRO and NFSP on a sequential multidimensional continuous-action game. NXDO is the first deep RL method that can find an approximate Nash equilibrium in high-dimensional continuous-action sequential games."}}
