Machine learning models can alleviate this by helping automate graph completion. Recently, there has been growing interest in completing knowledge bases that are dynamic, where previously unseen entities may be added to the KG with many missing links. In this paper, we present \\textbf{StATIK}--\\textbf{St}ructure \\textbf{A}nd \\textbf{T}ext for \\textbf{I}nductive \\textbf{K}nowledge Completion. \\texttt{StATIK} uses Language Models to extract the semantic information from text descriptions, while using Message Passing Neural Networks to capture the structural information. \\texttt{StATIK} achieves state of the art results on three challenging inductive baselines. We further analyze our hybrid model through detailed ablation studies. "}}

However, their algorithmic implementations are specialized to specific use-cases e.g. \"message passing\" methods are run differently from \"node embedding\" ones. Despite their apparent differences, all these methods utilize the graph structure, and therefore, their learning can be approximated with stochastic graph traversals. We propose Graph Traversal via Tensor Functionals (GTTF), a unifying meta-algorithm framework for easing the implementation of diverse graph algorithms and enabling transparent and efficient scaling to large graphs. GTTF is founded upon a data structure (stored as a sparse tensor) and a stochastic graph traversal algorithm (described using tensor operations). The algorithm is a functional that accept two functions, and can be specialized to obtain a variety of GRL models and objectives, simply by changing those two functions. We show for a wide class of methods, our algorithm learns in an unbiased fashion and, in expectation, approximates the learning as if the specialized implementations were run directly. With these capabilities, we scale otherwise non-scalable methods to set state-of-the-art on large graph datasets while being more efficient than existing GRL libraries -- with only a handful of lines of code for each method specialization."}}
