This paper proposes a novel approach to generate and impute mixed-type (continuous and categorical) tabular data using score-based diffusion and conditional flow matching. Contrary to previous work that relies on neural networks as function approximators, we instead utilize XGBoost, a popular Gradient-Boosted Tree (GBT) method. In addition to being elegant, we empirically show on various datasets that our method i) generates highly realistic synthetic data when the training dataset is either clean or tainted by missing data and ii) generates diverse plausible data imputations. Our method often outperforms deep-learning generation methods and can trained in parallel using CPUs without the need for a GPU. To make it easily accessible, we release our code through a Python library on PyPI and an R package on CRAN."}}

To avoid these costs, multiple neural networks can be combined into one by averaging their weights. However, this usually performs significantly worse than ensembling. Weight averaging is only beneficial when different enough to benefit from combining them, but similar enough to average well. Based on this idea, we propose PopulAtion Parameter Averaging (PAPA): a method that combines the generality of ensembling with the efficiency of weight averaging. PAPA leverages a population of diverse models (trained on different data orders, augmentations, and regularizations) while slowly pushing the weights of the networks toward the population average of the weights. PAPA reduces the performance gap between averaging and ensembling, increasing the average accuracy of a population of models by up to 0.8% on CIFAR-10, 1.9% on CIFAR-100, and 1.6% on ImageNet when compared to training independent (non-averaged) models."}}

We wanted to determine which noise distribution (Gaussian or non-Gaussian) led to better generated data in DMs. Since DMs do not work by design with non-Gaussian noise, we built a framework that allows reversing a diffusion process with non-Gaussian location-scale noise. We use that framework to show that the Gaussian distribution performs the best over a wide range of other distributions (Laplace, Uniform, t, Generalized-Gaussian)."}}

This approach consists in conditioning the model on a noisy version of the target(s) (e.g., actions in imitation learning or labels in classification) at a random noise level (from small to large noise). At inference time, since we do not know the target, we run the network with only noise in place of the noisy target. CNT provides hints through the noisy label (with less noise, we can more easily infer the true target). This give two main benefits: 1) the top-down feedback allows the model to focus on simpler and more digestible sub-problems and 2) rather than learning to solve the task from scratch, the model will first learn to master easy examples (with less noise), while slowly progressing toward harder examples (with more noise)."}}

Existing approaches rely on the Euler-Maruyama (EM) solver, which uses a fixed step size. We found that naively replacing it with other SDE solvers fares poorly - they either result in low-quality samples or become slower than EM. To get around this issue, we carefully devise an SDE solver with adaptive step sizes tailored to score-based generative models piece by piece. Our solver requires only two score function evaluations, rarely rejects samples, and leads to high-quality samples. Our approach generates data 2 to 10 times faster than EM while achieving better or equal sample quality.

The approach works by first training a neural network to estimate the score of a distribution, and then using Langevin dynamics to sample from the data distribution assumed by the score network. Despite the convincing visual quality of samples, this method appears to perform worse than Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) under the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance, a standard metric for generative models. We show that this apparent gap vanishes when denoising the final Langevin samples using the score network. In addition, we propose two improvements to DSM-ALS: 1) Consistent Annealed Sampling as a more stable alternative to Annealed Langevin Sampling, and 2) a hybrid training formulation, composed of both Denoising Score Matching and adversarial objectives. By combining these two techniques and exploring different network architectures, we elevate score matching methods and obtain results competitive with state-of-the-art image generation on CIFAR-10."}}
