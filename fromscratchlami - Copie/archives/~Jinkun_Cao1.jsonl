We employ a Reversed-Furthest-Voxel-Sampling strategy to address the uneven distribution of LiDAR points and propose MV-JAR, which combines two techniques for modeling the aforementioned distributions, resulting in superior performance. Our experiments reveal limitations in previous data-efficient experiments, which uniformly sample fine-tuning splits with varying data proportions from each LiDAR sequence, leading to similar data diversity across splits. To address this, we propose a new benchmark that samples scene sequences for diverse fine-tuning splits, ensuring adequate model convergence and providing a more accurate evaluation of pre-training methods. Experiments on our Waymo benchmark and the KITTI dataset demonstrate that MV-JAR consistently and significantly improves 3D detection performance across various data scales, achieving up to a 6.3% increase in mAPH compared to training from scratch."}}

Despite this, little work has been done to incorporate appearance cues beyond simple heuristic models that lack robustness to feature degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel way to leverage objects' appearances to adaptively integrate appearance matching into existing high-performance motion-based methods. Building upon the pure motion-based method OC-SORT, we achieve 1st place on MOT20 and 2nd place on MOT17 with 63.9 and 64.9 HOTA, respectively. We also achieve 61.3 HOTA on the challenging DanceTrack benchmark as a new state-of-the-art even compared to more heavily-designed methods.

Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

This is aligned with our intuition that we usually only need to compare a little region of the body of target objects to distinguish them from other objects. We build the hierarchical representation in levels of (1) target body parts, (2) the whole target body, and  (3) the union area of the target and other objects of overlap.  Furthermore, with the spatio-temporal attention mechanism by transformer, we can solve the tracking in a global fashion and keeps the process online.  We design our method by combining the representation with the transformer and name it Hierarchical Part-Whole Attention, or HiPWA for short. The experiments on multiple datasets suggest its good effectiveness.  Moreover, previous methods mostly focus on leveraging transformers to exploit long temporal context during association which requires heavy computation resources. But HiPWA focuses on a more informative representation of objects on every single frame instead. So it is more robust with the length of temporal context and more computationally economic. "}}

The motion model is a key component of many MOT methods and is commonly used to predict an object's future position. However, mainstream motion models in MOT naively assume that object motion is linear. They rely on detections on each frame as the observation value to supervise motion models. However, in practice, the observations can be noisy and even missing, especially in crowded scenes, which greatly degrade the performance of existing MOT methods. In this work, we show that a simple filtering-based motion model can still obtain state-of-the-art tracking performance if proper care is given to missing observations and noisy estimates. We emphasize the role of observations when recovering tracks from being lost and reducing the error accumulated by the assumption of linear motion when the target is lost. In contrast to the popular motion-based method SORT, which is estimation-centric, we name our method Observation-Centric SORT (OC-SORT). It remains simple, online, and real-time but improves robustness over occlusion and non-linear motion. It achieves state-of-the-art on multiple MOT benchmarks, including MOT17, MOT20, KITTI, head tracking, and especially DanceTrack where the object motion is highly non-linear."}}

However, its disentanglement property remains unexplored. In this paper, we examine negative-free contrastive learning methods to study the disentanglement property empirically. We find that existing disentanglement metrics fail to make meaningful measurements for high-dimensional representation models, so we propose a new disentanglement metric based on Mutual Information between latent representations and data factors. With this proposed metric, we benchmark the disentanglement property of negative-free contrastive learning on both popular synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset CelebA. Our study shows that the investigated methods can learn a well-disentangled subset of representation. As far as we know, we are the first to extend the study of disentangled representation learning to high-dimensional representation space and introduce negative-free contrastive learning methods into this area.

It builds up a novel joint-detection-and-tracking paradigm by accomplishing object detection and object association in a single shot, simplifying complicated multi-step settings in tracking-by-detection methods. On MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark, TransTrack achieves 74.5\\% and 64.5\\% MOTA, respectively, competitive to the state-of-the-art methods. We expect TransTrack to provide a novel perspective for multiple object tracking. The code is available at: \\url{this https URL}."}}
