The majority of approaches in the literature aiming for this task consider constrained scenarios with fully observed variables or data from stationary time-series. \nIn this work we aim for causal discovery in a more general class of scenarios, scenes with non-stationary behavior over time. For our purposes we here regard a scene as a composition objects interacting with each other over time. Non-stationarity is modeled as stationarity conditioned on an underlying variable, a state, which can be of varying dimension, more or less hidden given observations of the scene, and also depend more or less directly on these observations.\nWe propose a probabilistic deep learning approach called State-Dependent Causal Inference (SDCI) for causal discovery in such conditionally stationary time-series data. Results in two different synthetic scenarios show that this method is able to recover the underlying causal dependencies with high accuracy even in cases with hidden states."}}

Furthermore, we also investigated the existence of confirmation errors in FixMatch by reconstructing the batch structure during the training process.\n\nMethodology\n\nAll the experiments in this work were conducted on CIFAR-10 using the same network architecture, Wide ResNet28-2.  A single V100 is used for each experiment with an average training time of 70 hours.  We re-implemented FixMatch mainly based on the paper using Pytorch and refer to the official implementation (in Tensorflow)for details and replicated similar results shown in the second-last row of Table 2 of column CIFAR-10 in Sohn et al.[2020]. Ablation studies were focused on two key factors of FixMatch, the ratio of unlabeled data, and confidence threshold, as shown in Figure 3 (a) & (b) in Sohn et al. [2020].\n\nResults\n\nCompared with the average error rate reported in Table 2 in Sohn et al. [2020], our implementation achieves similar error rates by3.77lower on CIFAR-10 with 40 labels,0.22higher on CIFAR-10 with 250 labels, and0.1higheron CIFAR-10 with 4000 labels. Thus it is supported that FixMatch outperforms semi-supervised learning benchmarks. And the results of ablation studies exhibit almost the same trends as Figure 3 (a) & (b) show in the paper, which demonstrated that the author\u2019s choices with respect to those ablations were experimentally sound. We also confirmed the existence of confirmation errors in pseudo labels by checking the confusion matrix of the prediction of unlabeled data in different training stages. \n\nWhat was easy.\nIt is generally easy to re-implement FixMatch given all the experimental settings in the paper, with key parameters clearly stated in each experimental section and detailed lists of hyperparameters in the appendix. Compared with CTAugment, RandAugment is relatively easy to implement since it requires no parameters tuning during training, and coefficients representing the severity of all distortions are given in appendix.  Besides, it converges faster than augment. \n\nWhat was difficult\n\nThe official implementation is complicated thus not easy to follow. And there are some details missing in the paper compared to the code: 1. the official implementation actually uses leaky ReLU instead of ReLUfor ResNet; 2. The exponential moving average is only mentioned for experiments on ImageNet but actually also used onCIFAR-10; 3. the details on how to update the weights of the magnitude bins of CTAugment are not given in the paper, and our implementation achieves slightly worse results than the average error rate reported (1.14 higher with 250labels).\n\nCommunication with original authors\n\nAll the confusing parts mentioned in the previous section are clarified by the original authors via email and in the issues of their Github repository\u3002\n"}}

In this work, we study the dynamics of population qualification and algorithmic decisions under a partially observed Markov decision problem setting. By characterizing the equilibrium of such dynamics, we analyze the long-term impact of static fairness constraints on the equality and improvement of group well-being. Our results show that static fairness constraints can either promote equality or exacerbate disparity depending on the driving factor of qualification transitions and the effect of sensitive attributes on feature distributions. We also consider possible interventions that can effectively improve group qualification or promote equality of group qualification. Our theoretical results and experiments on static real-world datasets with simulated dynamics show that our framework can be used to facilitate social science studies."}}

However, unlike traditional machine learning algorithms, whose developments have been greatly fostered by a large amount of available benchmark datasets, causal discovery algorithms are notoriously difficult to be systematically evaluated due to the fact that few datasets with known ground-truth causal relations are available. In this work, we handle the problem of evaluating causal discovery algorithms by building a flexible simulator in the medical setting. We develop a neuropathic pain simulator, inspired by the fact that the biological processes of neuropathic pathophysiology are well studied with well-understood causal influences. Our simulator exploits the causal graph of the neuropathic pain pathology, and its parameters in the generator are estimated from real-life patient cases. We show that data generated from our simulator have the same statistics as real-world data. As a clear advantage, the simulator can produce infinite samples without jeopardizing the privacy of real-world patients. Our simulator provides a natural tool for evaluating various types of causal discovery algorithms, including those to deal with practical issues in causal discovery, such as unknown confounders, selection bias, and missing data. Using our simulator, we have evaluated extensively causal discovery algorithms under various settings."}}
