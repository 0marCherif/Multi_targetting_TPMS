We show that this type of regularization improves robustness on a range of benchmarks such as Imagenet-C and Stylized Imagenet. It adds little computational overhead and furthermore does not require a priori knowledge of a large set of image transformations. We find that this approach further complements recent advances in model architecture and data augmentation attaining a state-of-the-art mCE of 44.8 with an EfficientNet-B8 model and RandAugment, which is a reduction of 16 mCE compared to the baseline."}}

This seemingly implies that high-performing models share similar biases regardless of training methodology, which would limit ensembling benefits and render low-accuracy models as having little practical use. Against this backdrop, recent work has developed quite different training techniques, such as large-scale contrastive learning, yielding competitively high accuracy on generalization and robustness benchmarks. This motivates us to revisit the assumption that models necessarily learn similar functions. We conduct a large-scale empirical study of models across hyper-parameters, architectures, frameworks, and datasets. We find that model pairs that diverge more in training methodology display categorically different generalization behavior, producing increasingly uncorrelated errors. We show these models specialize in subdomains of the data, leading to higher ensemble performance: with just 2 models (each with ImageNet accuracy \\~76.5\\%), we can create ensembles with 83.4\\% (+7\\% boost). Surprisingly, we find that even significantly low-accuracy models can be used to improve high-accuracy models. Finally, we show diverging training methodology yield representations that capture overlapping (but not supersetting) feature sets which, when combined, lead to increased downstream performance."}}

In this case,\ncareful consideration is needed to select tasks and model parameterizations such that updates from\nthe auxiliary tasks actually help the primary task. We seek to alleviate this burden by formulating a model-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained manipulation of the auxiliary task gradients. We propose to decompose auxiliary updates into directions which help, damage or leave the primary task loss unchanged. This allows weighting the update directions \ndifferently depending on their impact on the problem of interest. We present a novel and efficient algorithm for that\npurpose and show its advantage in practice. Our method leverages efficient automatic differentiation \nprocedures and randomized singular value decomposition for scalability. We show that our framework is \ngeneric and encompasses some prior work as particular cases. Our approach consistently outperforms strong and widely used baselines when leveraging out-of-distribution data for Text and Image classification tasks."}}

Its popularity is in no small part due to its often positive effect on generalization. Despite this success, the regularization effect of the technique is still poorly understood. This study aims to decompose BatchNorm into separate mechanisms that are much simpler. We identify three effects of BatchNorm and assess their impact directly with ablations and interventions. Our experiments show that preventing explosive growth at the final layer at initialization and during training can recover a large part of BatchNorm's generalization boost. This regularization mechanism can lift accuracy by $2.9\\%$ for Resnet-50 on Imagenet without BatchNorm. We show it is linked to other methods like Dropout and recent initializations like Fixup. Surprisingly, this simple mechanism matches the improvement of $0.9\\%$ of the more complex Dropout regularization for the state-of-the-art Efficientnet-B8 model on Imagenet. This demonstrates the underrated effectiveness of simple regularizations and sheds light on directions to further improve generalization for deep nets."}}

The softmax function is defined by a lone hyperparameter, the temperature, that is commonly set to one or regarded as a way to tune model confidence after training; however, less is known about how the temperature impacts training dynamics or generalization performance. In this work we develop a theory of early learning for models trained with softmax-cross-entropy loss and show that the learning dynamics depend crucially on the inverse-temperature $\\beta$ as well as the magnitude of the logits at initialization, $||\\beta\\bf{z}||_{2}$. We follow up these analytic results with a large-scale empirical study of a variety of model architectures trained on CIFAR10, ImageNet, and IMDB sentiment analysis. We find that generalization performance depends strongly on the temperature, but only weakly on the initial logit magnitude. We provide evidence that the dependence of generalization on $\\beta$ is not due to changes in model confidence, but is a dynamical phenomenon. It follows that the addition of $\\beta$ as a tunable hyperparameter is key to maximizing model performance. Although we find the optimal $\\beta$ to be sensitive to the architecture, our results suggest that tuning $\\beta$ over the range $10^{-2}$ to $10^1$  improves performance over all architectures studied. We find that smaller $\\beta$ may lead to better peak performance at the cost of learning stability."}}

However, naively training unstructured sparse NNs from random initialization results in significantly worse generalization, with the notable exception of Lottery Tickets (LTs) and Dynamic Sparse Training (DST). In this work, we attempt to answer: (1) why training unstructured sparse networks from random initialization performs poorly and; and (2) what makes LTs and DST the exceptions? We show that sparse NNs have poor gradient flow at initialization and propose a modified initialization for unstructured connectivity. Furthermore, we find that DST methods significantly improve gradient flow during training over traditional sparse training methods. Finally, we show that LTs do not improve gradient flow, rather their success lies in re-learning the pruning solution they are derived from \u2014 however, this comes at the cost of learning novel solutions."}}

However, this measure of performance conceals significant differences in how different classes and images are impacted by pruning. We find that certain individual data points, which we term pruning identified exemplars (PIEs), and classes are systematically more impacted by the introduction of sparsity. Removing PIE images from the test-set greatly improves top-1 accuracy for both sparse and non-sparse models. These hard-to-generalize-to images tend to be of lower image quality, mislabelled, entail abstract representations, require fine-grained classification or depict atypical class examples."}}

This has created new domains of expertise in the training of deep networks, such as how to initialize learning. In this work, we introduce an algorithm called MetaInit as a step towards automating the search for good initializations using meta-learning. To guide the search, we hypothesize that a good inductive bias for initializations is to make first order gradient descent easier by starting learning in regions where gradient descent is less affected by second order effects. This is a generic criterion that does not make assumptions about the architecture and that can be minimized efficiently using gradient descent to tune the scales of the initial weight matrices. Our experiments on plain and residual networks show that the algorithm can automatically recover from a class of bad initializations and can train networks competitive to state-of-the-art results without normalization. While applying the method to large scale problems is more difficult, we show our algorithm can also apply to Resnet-50 models on Imagenet."}}

We explore coarse-to-fine models for creating narrative texts of several hundred words, and introduce new models which decompose stories by abstracting over actions and entities. The model first generates the predicate-argument structure of the text, where different mentions of the same entity are marked with placeholder tokens. It then generates a surface realization of the predicate-argument structure, and finally replaces the entity placeholders with context-sensitive names and references. Human judges prefer the stories from our models to a wide range of previous approaches to hierarchical text generation. Extensive analysis shows that our methods can help improve the diversity and coherence of events and entities in generated stories."}}
