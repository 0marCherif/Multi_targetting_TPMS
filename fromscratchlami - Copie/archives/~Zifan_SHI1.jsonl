Establishing such a connection facilitates a more convenient local control of GAN generation, where users can alter image content only within a spatial area simply by partially resampling the latent codes. Experimental results confirm four appealing properties of our regularizer, which we call LinkGAN. (1) Any image region can be linked to the latent space, even if the region is pre-selected before training and fixed for all instances. (2) Two or multiple regions can be independently linked to different latent axes, surprisingly allowing tokenized control of synthesized images. (3) Our regularizer can improve the spatial controllability of both 2D and 3D GAN models, barely sacrificing the synthesis performance. (4) The models trained with our regularizer are compatible with GAN inversion techniques and maintain editability on real images"}}

Extensive experiments on various generator architectures and training datasets verify the superiority of GeoD over state-of-the-art alternatives.

Along with the rise of neural networks, deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial network (GANs), have made tremendous progress in 2D image synthesis. Recently, researchers switch their attentions from the 2D space to the 3D space considering that 3D data better aligns with our physical world and hence enjoys great potential in practice. However, unlike a 2D image, which owns an efficient representation (i.e., pixel grid) by nature, representing 3D data could face far more challenges. Concretely, we would expect an ideal 3D representation to be capable enough to model shapes and appearances in details, and to be highly efficient so as to model high-resolution data with fast speed and low memory cost. However, existing 3D representations, such as point clouds, meshes, and recent neural fields, usually fail to meet the above requirements simultaneously. In this survey, we make a thorough review of the development of 3D generation, including 3D shape generation and 3D-aware image synthesis, from the perspectives of both algorithms and more importantly representations. We hope that our discussion could help the community track the evolution of this field and further spark some innovative ideas to advance this challenging task."}}

We argue that indoor scenes do not have a shared intrinsic structure, and hence only using 2D images cannot adequately guide the model with the 3D geometry. In this work, we fill in this gap by introducing depth as a 3D prior (Depth is essentially a 2.5D prior, but in this paper we use 3D for simplicity). Compared with other 3D data formats, depth better fits the convolution-based generation mechanism and is more easily accessible in practice. Specifically, we propose a dual-path generator, where one path is responsible for depth generation, whose intermediate features are injected into the other path as the condition for appearance rendering. Such a design eases the 3D-aware synthesis with explicit geometry information. Meanwhile, we introduce a switchable discriminator both to differentiate real v.s. fake domains and to predict the depth from a given input. In this way, the discriminator can take the spatial arrangement into account and advise the generator to learn an appropriate depth condition. Extensive experimental results suggest that our approach is capable of synthesizing indoor scenes with impressively good quality and 3D consistency, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives.

This work presents DisCoScene: a 3Daware generative model for high-quality and controllable scene synthesis. The key ingredient of our method is a very abstract object-level representation (i.e., 3D bounding boxes without semantic annotation) as the scene layout prior, which is simple to obtain, general to describe various scene contents, and yet informative to disentangle objects and background. Moreover, it serves as an intuitive user control for scene editing. Based on such a prior, the proposed model spatially disentangles the whole scene into object-centric generative radiance fields by learning on only 2D images with the global-local discrimination. Our model obtains the generation fidelity and editing flexibility of individual objects while being able to efficiently compose objects and the background into a complete scene. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on many scene datasets, including the challenging Waymo outdoor dataset. Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/discoscene/"}}

Most recent waterdrop removal approaches take a single image as input and often fail to recover the missing content behind waterdrops faithfully.

To better detect and remove waterdrops from stereo images, we propose a novel row-wise dilated attention module to enlarge attention\u2019s receptive field for effective information propagation between the two stereo images. In addition, we propose an attention consistency loss between the ground-truth disparity map and attention scores to enhance the left-right consistency in stereo images.

To facilitate the learning of a simulator model, we collect a dataset of the 10,000 raw images of 450 scenes with different exposure settings. Quantitative experiments and qualitative comparisons show that our approach outperforms relevant baselines in raw data synthesize on multiple cameras. Furthermore, the camera simulator enables various applications, including large-aperture enhancement, HDR, auto exposure, and data augmentation for training local feature detectors.
