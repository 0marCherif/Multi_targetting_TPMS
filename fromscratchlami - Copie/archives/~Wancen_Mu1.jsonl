A challenge in collecting these datasets is that there are often entire views or individual features missing, which can significantly limit the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as, predicting a patient phenotype. Here, we propose a multiview based deep generative adversarial data imputation model (MultImp). MultImp improves imputation quality and disease subtype classification accuracy in comparison to several baseline methods across two multiomics datasets. MultImp is now publicly available at https: //github.com/multimp/multimp."}}

Measuring AI in bulk data lacking time or spatial resolution has the limitation that cell-type-specific (CTS), spatial- or time-dependent AI signals may be dampened or not detected."}}
