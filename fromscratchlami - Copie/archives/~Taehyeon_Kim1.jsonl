With the advent of advanced depth models, various methods of exploiting pre-trained depth models at a large scale have come into the limelight. However, for multi-label classification tasks, TL approaches suffer from performance degradation in correctly predicting multiple objects in an image with significant size differences. Since such a hard instance contains imperceptible objects, most pre-trained models lose their ability during downsampling. For the hard instance, this paper proposes a simple but effective classifier for multiple predictions by using the hidden representations from the fixed backbone. To this end, we mix the pre-logit with the intermediate representation with a learnable scale. We show that our method is effective as fine-tuning with few additional parameters and is particularly advantageous for hard instances."}}

Conventional approaches have evolved to either improve a single global model while keeping each local heterogeneous training data decentralized (i.e. data heterogeneity; Federated Learning (FL)) or to train an overarching network that supports diverse architectural settings to address heterogeneous systems equipped with different computational capabilities (i.e. system heterogeneity; Neural Architecture Search). However, few studies have considered both directions simultaneously. This paper proposes the federation of supernet training (FedSup) framework to consider both scenarios simultaneously, i.e., where clients send and receive a supernet that contains all possible architectures sampled from itself. The approach is inspired by observing that averaging parameters during model aggregation for FL is similar to weight-sharing in supernet training. Thus, the proposed FedSup framework combines a weight-sharing approach widely used for training single shot models with FL averaging (FedAvg). Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm (E-FedSup) by sending the sub-model to clients on the broadcast stage to reduce communication costs and training overhead, including several strategies to enhance supernet training in the FL environment. We verify the proposed approach with extensive empirical evaluations. The resulting framework also ensures data and model heterogeneity robustness on several standard benchmarks."}}

Therefore, automation on hyperparameter optimization to exclude human intervention is a great appeal, especially for the black-box functions. Recently, there have been increasing demands of solving such concealed tasks for better generalization, though the task-dependent issue is not easy to solve. The Black-Box Optimization challenge (NeurIPS 2020) required competitors to build a robust black-box optimizer across different domains of standard machine learning problems. This paper describes the approach of team KAIST OSI in a step-wise manner, which outperforms the baseline algorithms by up to +20.39%. We first strengthen the local Bayesian search under the concept of region reliability. Then, we design a combinatorial kernel for a Gaussian process kernel. In a similar vein, we combine the methodology of Bayesian and multi-armed bandit (MAB) approach to select the values with the consideration of the variable types; the real and integer variables are with Bayesian, while the boolean and categorical variables are with MAB. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing methods across different tasks."}}

Such mixed-space optimization possesses the primary challenge of modeling complex interactions between the inputs. In this work, we propose a novel yet simple approach that entails exploiting the graph data structure to model the underlying relationship between variables, i.e., variables as nodes and interactions defined by edges. Then, a variational graph autoencoder is used to naturally take the interactions into account. We first provide empirical evidence of the existence of such graph structures and then suggest a joint framework of graph structure learning and latent space optimization to adaptively search for optimal graph connectivity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method shows remarkable performance, exceeding the existing approaches with significant computational efficiency for a number of synthetic and real-world tasks."}}

To mitigate such issues, there have been studies for a variety of neural architecture search methods that automatically search for optimal architectures, achieving models with impressive performance that outperform human-designed counterparts. This survey aims to provide an overview of existing works in this field of research and specifically focus on the supernet optimization that builds a neural network that assembles all the architectures as its sub models by using weight sharing. We aim to accomplish that by categorizing supernet optimization by proposing them as solutions to the common challenges found in the literature: data-side optimization, poor rank correlation alleviation, and transferable NAS for a number of deployment scenarios."}}

Generally, the objective function of KD is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss between the softened probability distributions of the teacher model and the student model with the temperature scaling hyperparameter \u03c4. Despite its widespread use, few studies have discussed how such softening influences generalization. Here, we theoretically show that the KL divergence loss focuses on the logit matching when \u03c4 increases and the label matching when \u03c4 goes to 0 and empirically show that the logit matching is positively correlated to performance improvement in general. From this observation, we consider an intuitive KD loss function, the mean squared error (MSE) between the logit vectors, so that the student model can directly learn the logit of the teacher model. The MSE loss outperforms the KL divergence loss, explained by the penultimate layer representations difference between the two losses. Furthermore, we show that sequential distillation can improve performance and that KD, using the KL divergence loss with small \u03c4 particularly, mitigates the label noise.
