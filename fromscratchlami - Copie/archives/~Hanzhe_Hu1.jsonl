Existing approaches almost all neglect this problem, and treat categories equally. Some popular approaches such as consistency regularization or pseudo-labeling may even harm the learning of under-performing categories, that the predictions or pseudo labels of these categories could be too inaccurate to guide the learning on the unlabeled data. In this paper, we look into this problem, and propose a novel framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, named adaptive equalization learning (AEL). AEL adaptively balances the training of well and badly performed categories, with a confidence bank to dynamically track category-wise performance during training. The confidence bank is leveraged as an indicator to tilt training towards under-performing categories, instantiated in three strategies: 1) adaptive Copy-Paste and CutMix data augmentation approaches which give more chance for under-performing categories to be copied or cut; 2) an adaptive data sampling approach to encourage pixels from under-performing category to be sampled; 3) a simple yet effective re-weighting method to alleviate the training noise raised by pseudo-labeling. Experimentally, AEL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on the Cityscapes and Pascal VOC benchmarks under various data partition protocols.

However, from the holistic view of the whole dataset, semantic relations not only exist inside one single image, but also prevail in the whole training data, which makes solely considering intra-image correlations insufficient. Inspired by recent progress in unsupervised contrastive learning, we propose the region-aware contrastive learning (RegionContrast) for semantic segmentation in the supervised manner. In order to enhance the similarity of semantically similar pixels while keeping the discrimination from others, we employ contrastive learning to realize this objective. With the help of memory bank, we explore to store all the representative features into the memory. Without loss of generality, to efficiently incorporate all training data into the memory bank while avoiding taking too much computation resource, we propose to construct region centers to represent features from different categories for every image. Hence, the proposed region-aware contrastive learning is performed in a region level for all the training data, which saves much more memory than methods exploring the pixel-level relations. The proposed RegionContrast brings little computation cost during training and requires no extra overhead for testing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets including Cityscapes, ADE20K and COCO Stuff."}}

In this paper, we present a novel Context-Aware Graph Convolution Network (CAGCN), where the probe-gallery relations are encoded into the graph nodes and the graph edge connections are well controlled by the gallery-gallery relations. In this way, hard samples can be addressed with the context information flows among other easy samples during the graph reasoning. Specifically, we adopt an effective hard gallery sampler to obtain high recall for positive samples while keeping a reasonable graph size, which can also weaken the imbalanced problem in training process with low computation complexity. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both person and vehicle re-identification datasets in a plug and play fashion with limited overhead."}}

Few-shot object detection, which learns to adapt to novel classes with only a few annotated examples, is very challenging since the fine-grained feature of novel object can be easily overlooked with only a few data available. In this work, aiming to fully exploit features of annotated novel object and capture fine-grained features of query object, we propose Dense Relation Distillation with Context-aware Aggregation (DCNet) to tackle the few-shot detection problem. Built on the meta-learning based framework, Dense Relation Distillation module targets at fully exploiting support features, where support features and query feature are densely matched, covering all spatial locations in a feed-forward fashion. The abundant usage of the guidance information endows model the capability to handle common challenges such as appearance changes and occlusions. Moreover, to better capture scale-aware features, Context-aware Aggregation module adaptively harnesses features from different scales for a more comprehensive feature representation.

However, few works have focused on harvesting boundary information to improve the segmentation performance. In order to enhance the feature similarity within the object and keep discrimination from other objects, we propose a boundary-aware graph convolution (BGC) module to propagate features within the object. The graph reasoning is performed among pixels of the same object apart from the boundary pixels. Based on the proposed BGC module, we further introduce the Boundary-aware Graph Convolution N et-work(BGCN et), which consists of two main components including a basic segmentation network and the BGC module, forming a coarse-to-fine paradigm. Specifically, the BGC module takes the coarse segmentation feature map as node features and boundary prediction to guide graph construction. After graph convolution, the reasoned feature and the input feature are fused together to get the refined feature, producing the refined segmentation result. We conduct extensive experiments on three popular semantic segmentation benchmarks including Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO Stuff, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on all three benchmarks."}}
