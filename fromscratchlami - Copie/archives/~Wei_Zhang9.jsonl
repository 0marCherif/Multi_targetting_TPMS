The problem is generally solved by learning an embedding, such that the samples of the same category are close (compact) while samples from different categories are far away (spread-out) in the embedding space. One popular way of generating such embeddings is to use the second-to-last layer of a deep neural network trained as a classifier with the softmax cross-entropy loss. In this paper, we show that training classifiers with different temperatures of the softmax function lead to different distributions of the embedding space. And finding a balance between the compactness, 'spread-out' and the generalization ability of the feature is critical in metric learning. Leveraging these insights, we propose a 'heating-up' strategy to train a classifier with increasing temperatures. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art embeddings on a variety of metric learning benchmarks. "}}
