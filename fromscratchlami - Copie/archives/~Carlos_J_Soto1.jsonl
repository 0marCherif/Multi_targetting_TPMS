The utility of a mechanism to produce sanitized differentially private estimates from such data is intimately linked to how compatible it is with the underlying structure and geometry of the space. In particular, as recently shown, utility of the Laplace mechanism on a positively curved manifold, such as Kendall\u2019s 2D shape space, is significantly influenced by the curvature. Focusing on the problem of sanitizing the Fr\\'echet mean of a sample of points on a manifold, we exploit the characterization of the mean as the minimizer of an objective function comprised of the sum of squared distances and develop a K-norm gradient mechanism on Riemannian manifolds that favors values that produce gradients close to the the zero of the objective function. For the case of positively curved manifolds, we describe how using the gradient of the squared distance function offers better control over sensitivity than the Laplace mechanism, and demonstrate this numerically on a dataset of shapes of corpus callosa. Further illustrations of the mechanism\u2019s utility on a sphere and the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices are also presented."}}

Segmenting 3D conformations of chromosomes into their topologically associated domains (TADs) \u2013 structurally homogeneous parts of a chromosome \u2013 is an essential tool in shape analysis. TAD segmentation allows one to divide complex chromosomal structures into smaller, simpler geometries and facilitates statistical analysis of their shapes. There are several TAD segmentation procedures in the current literature, but they often lack consistency and interpretability. We propose a novel algorithm for determining TADs, called TADBay, directly from contact matrices, which avoids the difficult step of estimating 3D conformations. While consistent with some current top-performing existing callers, it has an added ability to provide a hierarchical organization of TADs and subTADs. To validate TADBay, we utilize simulated contact matrices with ground truth TADs which can be used to benchmark TAD callers. We demonstrate the strengths of our caller through both simulated data and the IMR90 real dataset."}}

We present an extension of the Laplace or K-norm mechanism that utilizes intrinsic distances and volumes on the manifold.  We also consider in detail the specific case where the summary is the Fr\\'echet mean of data residing on a manifold.  We demonstrate that our mechanism is rate optimal and depends only on the dimension of the manifold, not on the dimension of any ambient space, while also showing how ignoring the manifold structure can decrease the utility of the sanitized summary.  We illustrate our framework in two examples of particular interest in statistics: the space of symmetric positive definite matrices, which is used for covariance matrices, and the sphere, which can be used as a space for modeling discrete distributions.

Here, we develop a novel representation of 3D chromosome structures, as sequences of shape letters from a finite shape alphabet, which provides a compact and efficient way to analyze ensembles of chromosome shape data, akin to the analysis of texts in a language by using letters. We construct a Chromosome Shape Alphabet from an ensemble of chromosome 3D structures inferred from Hi-C data\u2014via SIMBA3D or other methods\u2014by segmenting curves based on topologically associating domains (TADs) boundaries, and by clustering all TADs' 3D structures into groups of similar shapes. The median shapes of these groups, with some pruning and processing, form the Chromosome Shape Letters (CSLs) of the alphabet. We provide a proof of concept for these CSLs by reconstructing independent test curves by using only CSLs (and corresponding transformations) and comparing these reconstructions with the original curves. Finally, we demonstrate how CSLs can be used to summarize shapes in an ensemble of chromosome 3D structures by using generalized sequence logos."}}

It utilizes a two-sample test for comparing shapes of KO chromosomes with wild type (WT) at two levels: (1) Coarse shape analysis, where one compares shapes of full or large parts of chromosomes, and (2) Fine shape analysis, where chromosomes are first segmented into (TAD-based) pieces and then the corresponding pieces are compared across populations. The shape comparisons \u2013 coarse and fine \u2013 are based on an elastic shape metric for comparing shapes of 3D curves. The experiments show that the KO populations, RKO and CKO, have statistically significant differences from WT at both coarse and fine levels. Furthermore, this framework highlights local regions where these differences are most prominent."}}

We hypothesize that chromosomal conformations are representable as concatenations of a handful of prototypical shapelets, termed shape letters. This is akin to expressing complicated sentences in a language using only a small set of letters. Our goal is to organize the vast variability of 3D chromosomal conformation by constructing a set of predominant shape letters, termed a shape alphabet, using statistical shape analysis of curvelets taken from training conformations. This paper utilizes conformations generated from Integrative Genome Modeling to develop a shape alphabet as follows: it first segments 3D conformations into curvelets according to their Topologically Associated Domains. It then clusters these segments, estimates mean shapes, and refines and reorders these shapes into a Chromosome Shape Alphabet. The paper demonstrates effectiveness of this construction by successfully representing independent test conformations taken from IGM and other methods such as SIMBA3D, both symbolically and structurally, using the constructed alphabet."}}

The combined amplitude and phase distance metric is achieved on a function space from the Fisher-Rao elastic registration. We utilize an exhaustive search method for selecting the optimal parameter that captures the amplitude and phase distance contribution in FRAPD when performing a clustering process. The proposed incremental learning structure based on the shape preserving FRAPD distance metric utilizes continuously updated fault shape templates with the Karcher mean. The seamless updating of abnormal events enhances the clustering performance for power systems fault detection. The algorithm is validated using the actual data from real-time hardware-in-the-loop testbed."}}
