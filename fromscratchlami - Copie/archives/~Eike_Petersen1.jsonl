While such decisions are often based on risk score models, the fairness of the risk models themselves has received considerably less attention. Risk models are of interest for a number of reasons, including the fact that they communicate uncertainty about the potential outcomes to users, thus representing a way to enable meaningful human oversight. Here, we address fairness desiderata for risk score models. We identify the provision of similar epistemic value to different groups as a key desideratum for risk score fairness, and we show how even fair risk scores can lead to unfair risk-based rankings. Further, we address how to assess the fairness of risk score models quantitatively, including a discussion of metric choices and meaningful statistical comparisons between groups. In this context, we also introduce a novel calibration error metric that is less sample size-biased than previously proposed metrics, enabling meaningful comparisons between groups of different sizes. We illustrate our methodology \u2013 which is widely applicable in many other settings \u2013 in two case studies, one in recidivism risk prediction, and one in risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) prediction."}}

Here, we ask whether requiring models not to encode demographic attributes is desirable. We point out that marginal and class-conditional representation invariance imply the standard group fairness notions of demographic parity and equalized odds, respectively, while additionally requiring risk distribution matching, thus potentially equalizing away important group differences. Enforcing the traditional fairness notions directly instead does not entail these strong constraints. Moreover, representationally invariant models may still take demographic attributes into account for deriving predictions. The latter can be prevented using counterfactual notions of (individual) fairness or invariance. We caution, however, that properly defining medical image counterfactuals with respect to demographic attributes is highly challenging. Finally, we posit that encoding demographic attributes may even be advantageous if it enables learning a task-specific encoding of demographic features that does not rely on social constructs such as 'race' and 'gender.' We conclude that demographically invariant representations are neither necessary nor sufficient for fairness in medical imaging. Models may need to encode demographic attributes, lending further urgency to calls for comprehensive model fairness assessments in terms of predictive performance across diverse patient groups."}}

However, in practice these annotations can differ systematically in the way they are generated, for example through the use of different labeling tools. This results in datasets that contain both data variability and differing label styles. In this paper, we demonstrate that applying state-of-the-art segmentation uncertainty models on such datasets can lead to model bias caused by the different label styles. We present an updated modelling objective conditioning on labeling style for aleatoric uncertainty estimation, and modify two state-of-the-art-architectures for segmentation uncertainty accordingly. We show with extensive experiments that this method reduces label style bias, while improving segmentation performance, increasing the applicability of segmentation uncertainty models in the wild. We curate two datasets, with annotations in different label styles, which we will make publicly available along with our code upon publication."}}

To ensure that fundamental principles such as beneficence, respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, justice, privacy, and transparency are respected, medical machine learning systems must be developed responsibly. Many high-level declarations of ethical principles have been put forth for this purpose, but there is a severe lack of technical guidelines explicating the practical consequences for medical machine learning. Similarly, there is currently considerable uncertainty regarding the exact regulatory requirements placed upon medical machine learning systems. This survey provides an overview of the technical and procedural challenges involved in creating medical machine learning systems responsibly and in conformity with existing regulations, as well as possible solutions to address these challenges. First, a brief review of existing regulations affecting medical machine learning is provided, showing that properties such as safety, robustness, reliability, privacy, security, transparency, explainability, and nondiscrimination are all demanded <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">already</i> by existing law and regulations\u2014albeit, in many cases, to an uncertain degree. Next, the key technical obstacles to achieving these desirable properties are discussed, as well as important techniques to overcome these obstacles in the medical context. We notice that distribution shift, spurious correlations, model underspecification, uncertainty quantification, and data scarcity represent severe challenges in the medical context. Promising solution approaches include the use of large and representative datasets and federated learning as a means to that end, the careful exploitation of domain knowledge, the use of inherently transparent models, comprehensive out-of-distribution model testing and verification, as well as algorithmic impact assessments."}}
