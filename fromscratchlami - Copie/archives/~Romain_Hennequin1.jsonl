We evaluated the human NER linguistic behaviour in these challenging conditions and compared it with the most common NER systems nowadays, fine-tuned transformers. Our goal was to learn about the task to guide the design of better evaluation methods and NER algorithms. The results showed that NER in our context was quite hard for both human and algorithms under a strict evaluation schema; humans had higher precision, while the model higher recall because of entity exposure especially during pre-training; and entity types had different error patterns (e.g. frequent typing errors for artists). The released corpus goes beyond predefined frames of interaction and can support future work in conversational music recommendation."}}

An Exploration of Search Intent in the Musical Domain", "abstract": "The search engine of music streaming platforms is a high-control method for navigating the catalog. If one is to study users\u2019 search behavior in this context, one can leverage the vast body of research on general information behavior while challenging previously well validated models with the domain-specific differences. Due to the nature of musical content, users present a series of different needs and behaviors than on traditional web search. For instance, some users employ the search engine as a means to drive their listening session, inputting many queries in close succession not related to the same information goal. In this paper, we investigate users\u2019 search goals and how they modulate information behavior in the context of streaming platforms. To this end, we explore real search sessions of users looking for musical content in the context of a major streaming service. We introduce a data-driven method for identifying classes of information needs by aggregating both low-level activity patterns and relative query specificity. We show that, when combined, these features provide an approach not only for isolating classes of user search intent, but for understanding human-music relationship as a whole."}}

In computer vision, concept learning was therein proposed to adjust explanations to the right abstraction level (e.g. detect clinical concepts from radiographs). These methods have yet to be used for MIR. In this paper, we adapt concept learning to the realm of music, with its particularities. For instance, music concepts are typically non-independent and of mixed nature (e.g. genre, instruments, mood), unlike previous work that assumed disentangled concepts. We propose a method to learn numerous music concepts from audio and then automatically hierarchise them to expose their mutual relationships. We conduct experiments on datasets of playlists from a music streaming service, serving as a few annotated examples for diverse concepts. Evaluations show that the mined hierarchies are aligned with both ground-truth hierarchies of concepts -- when available -- and with proxy sources of concept similarity in the general case."}}

It is notably more frequent when compared to the consumption of other media, such as books and movies. In this paper, we show that one particularly interesting repetitive behavior arises when users are consuming new items. Users' interest tends to rise with the first repetitions and attains a peak after which interest will decrease with subsequent exposures, resulting in an inverted-U shape. This behavior, which has been extensively studied in psychology, is called the mere exposure effect. In this paper, we show how a number of factors, both content and user-based, well documented in the literature on the mere exposure effect, modulate the magnitude of the effect. Due to the vast availability of data of users discovering new songs everyday in music streaming platforms, these findings enable new ways to characterize both the music, users and their relationships. Ultimately, it opens up the possibility of developing new recommender systems paradigms based on these characterizations."}}

To assist users in effectively browsing these large catalogs, the integration of Music Recommender Systems (MRSs) has become essential. Current real-world MRSs are often quite complex and optimized for recommendation accuracy. They combine several building blocks based on collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. This complexity can hinder the ability to explain recommendations to end users, which is particularly important for recommendations perceived as unexpected or inappropriate. While pure recommendation performance often correlates with user satisfaction, explainability has a positive impact on other factors such as trust and forgiveness, which are ultimately essential to maintain user loyalty. In this article, we discuss how explainability can be addressed in the context of MRSs. We provide perspectives on how explainability could improve music recommendation algorithms and enhance user experience. First, we review common dimensions and goals of recommenders' explainability and in general of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and elaborate on the extent to which these apply -- or need to be adapted -- to the specific characteristics of music consumption and recommendation. Then, we show how explainability components can be integrated within a MRS and in what form explanations can be provided. Since the evaluation of explanation quality is decoupled from pure accuracy-based evaluation criteria, we also discuss requirements and strategies for evaluating explanations of music recommendations. Finally, we describe the current challenges for introducing explainability within a large-scale industrial music recommender system and provide research perspectives."}}
