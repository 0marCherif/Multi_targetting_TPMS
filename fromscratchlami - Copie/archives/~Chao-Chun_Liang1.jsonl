It first analyzes the text, transforms both body and question parts into their corresponding logic forms, and then performs inference on them. The associated context of each quantity is represented with proposed role-tags (e.g., nsubj, verb, etc.), which provides the flexibility for annotating an extracted math quantity with its associated context information (i.e., the physical meaning of this quantity). Statistical models are proposed to select the operator and operands. A noisy dataset is designed to assess if a solver solves MWPs mainly via understanding or pattern matching. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing systems on both benchmark datasets and the noisy dataset, which demonstrates that the proposed approach more understands the meaning of each quantity in the text."}}

It first analyzes and transforms sentences into their meaning-based logical forms, which represent the associated context of each quantity with role-tags (e.g., nsubj, verb, etc.). Logic forms with role-tags provide a flexible and simple way to specify the physical meaning of a quantity. Afterwards, the main-goal of the problem is decomposed recursively into its associated sub-goals. For each given sub-goal, the associated operator and operands are selected with statistical models. Lastly, it performs inference on logic expressions to get the answer and explains how the answer is obtained in a human comprehensible way. This process thus resembles the human cognitive understanding of the problem and produces a more meaningful problem solving interpretation."}}

It analyzes the text and transforms both body and question parts into their tag-based logic forms, and then performs inference on them. The proposed tag (e.g., Agent, Verb, etc.) provides the flexibility for annotating an extracted math quantity with its associated syntactic and semantic information, which can be used to identify the desired operand and filter out irrelevant quantities (so that the answer can be obtained precisely). Since the physical meaning of each quantity is explicitly represented with those tags and used in the inference process, the proposed approach could explain how the answer is obtained in a human comprehensible way."}}
