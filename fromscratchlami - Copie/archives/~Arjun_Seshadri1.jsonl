Whether shopping for clothes, scrolling YouTube for exciting videos, or searching for restaurants in a new city, the recommender systems at the back-end power these services. Most large-scale recommender systems are huge models trained on extensive datasets and are black-boxes to both their developers and end-users. Prior research has shown that providing recommendations along with their reason enhances trust, scrutability, and persuasiveness of the recommender systems. Recent literature in explainability has been inundated with works proposing several algorithms to this end. Most of these works provide item-style explanations, i.e., 'We recommend item A because you bought item B.' We propose a novel approach, RecXplainer, to generate more fine-grained explanations based on the user's preference over the attributes of the recommended items. We perform experiments using real-world datasets and demonstrate the efficacy of RecXplainer in capturing users' preferences and using them to explain recommendations. We also propose ten new evaluation metrics and compare RecXplainer to six baseline methods. "}}

However, existing dataset generation methods do not sufficiently leverage existing images with high quality labels, which often limits either the practicality of the system or the complexity of generated labels. We propose the HandsOff framework, which is capable of producing an unlimited number of synthetic images and corresponding labels after being trained on a small of number of pre-existing labeled images. Our framework avoids the practical drawbacks of similar frameworks while retaining the ability to generate rich, pixel-wise labels, such as segmentation masks. This capability is achieved by unifying the field of GAN inversion with synthetic dataset generation, providing a new application for GAN inversion techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on semantic segmentation tasks by generating labeled image datasets, and training and evaluating the performance of a downstream task. We also qualitatively assess the performance of GAN inversion techniques used in our framework. Finally, we explore directions for making the framework more lightweight from a computational resource perspective. "}}
