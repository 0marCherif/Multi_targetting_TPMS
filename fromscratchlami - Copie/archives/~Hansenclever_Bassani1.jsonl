By combining representation learning and clustering, traditional approaches have been shown to build latent representations that capture essential features of the data while preserving topological characteristics. In this sense, models based on Self-Organizing Maps models with relevance learning (SOMRL) were considered as they perform well in clustering besides being able to create a map that learns the relevance of each input dimension for each cluster, preserving the original relations and topology of the data. We hypothesize that this type of model can produce a more intuitive and disentangled representation in the latent space by promoting smoother transitions between cluster points over time. This work proposes a representation learning framework that combines a new gradient-based SOMRL model and autoencoders. The SOMRL learns the relevance weights for each input dimension of each cluster. It creates a tendency to separate the information into subspaces. To achieve this, we designed a new loss function term that weighs these learned relevances and provides an estimated unsupervised error to be used in combination with a reconstruction loss. The model is evaluated in terms of clustering performance and quality of the learned representations and then compared with start-of-the-art models, showing competitive results."}}

It is like searching for needles in a haystack, and in many cases, there is no better algorithm than a random search, which might not be viable. Previously proposed algorithms for efficient database access are made for particular applications such as finding the min/max, finding all points within a range or finding the k-nearest neighbours. Consequently, there is a lack of versatility concerning what we can search when it comes to a gigantic database. In this work, we propose Search Data Structure Learning (SDSL), a generalization of the standard Search Data Structure (SDS) in which the machine has to learn how to search in the database. To evaluate approaches in this field, we propose a novel metric called Sequential Search Work Ratio (SSWR), a natural way of measuring a search's efficiency and quality. Finally, we inaugurate the field with the Efficient Learnable Binary Access (ELBA), a family of models for Search Data Structure Learning. It requires a means to train two parametric functions and a search data structure for binary codes. For the training, we developed a novel loss function, the F-beta Loss. For the SDS, we describe the Multi-Bernoulli Search (MBS), a novel approach for probabilistic binary codes. Finally, we exhibit the F-beta Loss and the MBS synergy by experimentally showing that it is at least twice as better than using the alternative loss functions of MIHash and HashNet and twenty times better than with another SDS based on the Hamming radius."}}

However, it is a painful job to label and organize it. Labeling is an expensive, time-consuming, and difficult task. It is usually done manually, which collaborates with the incorporation of noise and errors to the data. Hence, it is of great importance to developing intelligent models that can benefit from both labeled and unlabeled data. Currently, works on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning are still being overshadowed by the successes of purely supervised learning. However, it is expected that they become far more important in the longer term. This article presents a semi-supervised model, called Batch Semi-Supervised Self-Organizing Map (Batch SS-SOM), which is an extension of a SOM incorporating some advances that came with the rise of Deep Learning, such as batch training. The results show that Batch SS-SOM is a good option for semi-supervised classification and clustering. It performs well in terms of accuracy and clustering error, even with a small number of labeled samples, as well as when presented to unsupervised data, and shows competitive results in transfer learning scenarios in traditional image classification benchmark datasets."}}

A set of uniformly distributed weights usually leads to well-distributed solutions on a Pareto front. However, there are two main difficulties with this approach. Firstly, it may fail depending on the problem geometry. Secondly, the population size becomes not flexible as the number of objectives increases. In this paper, we propose the MOEA/D with Uniformly Randomly Adaptive Weights (MOEA/DURAW) which uses the Uniformly Randomly method as an approach to subproblems generation, allowing a flexible population size even when working with many objective problems. During the evolutionary process, MOEA/D-URAW adds and removes subproblems as a function of the sparsity level of the population. Moreover, instead of requiring assumptions about the Pareto front shape, our method adapts its weights to the shape of the problem during the evolutionary process. Experimental results using WFG41-48 problem classes, with different Pareto front shapes, shows that the present method presents better or equal results in 77.5% of the problems evaluated from 2 to 6 objectives when compared with state-of-the-art methods in the literature."}}

Therefore, in this article, we propose the Variable Input Length Map (VILMAP) for Motif Discovery and Word Segmentation. The model is based on the Self-Organizing Maps and can identify Motifs with different lengths in time series. In our experiments, we show that VILMAP presents good results in finding Motifs in a standard Motif discovery dataset and can avoid catastrophic forgetting when trained with datasets with increasing values of input size. We also show that VILMAP achieves results similar or superior to other methods in the literature developed for the task of word segmentation."}}

Hence, Semi-Supervised learning models can benefit from both types of data to improve the obtained performance. Also, it is important to develop methods that are easy to parameterize in a way that is robust to the different characteristics of the data at hand. This article presents a new method based on Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for clustering and classification, called Adaptive Local Thresholds Semi-Supervised Self-Organizing Map (ALTSS-SOM). It can dynamically switch between two forms of learning at training time, according to the availability of labels, as in previous models, and can automatically adjust itself to the local variance observed in each data cluster. The results show that the ALTSS-SOM surpass the performance of other semi-supervised methods in terms of classification, and other pure clustering methods when there are no labels available, being also less sensitive than previous methods to the parameters values."}}

Abstract In this paper, the task of unsupervised visual object categorization (UVOC) is addressed. We utilize a variant of Self-organizing Map (SOM) to cluster images in two different scenarios: disjoint (images from Caltech256) and non-disjoint (images from MSRC2) sets. First, we ran several tests to evaluate different image representation techniques: features obtained by a deep convolutional network were compared with those obtained by handcrafted methods, such as SIFT combined with a set of interest point detectors. As expected, we found that deep convolutional network features significantly outperformed its handcrafted counterparts. After choosing the best image representation technique, we compared the state-of-the-art image clustering algorithms with a SOM-based subspace clustering method that identifies automatically the relevant features in the high-dimensional image representations. The results have shown that our method achieves substantially lower clustering error than all competitors in several challenging testing settings."}}
