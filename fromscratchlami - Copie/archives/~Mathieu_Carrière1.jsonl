One of the most important shape descriptors is persistent homology, which studies the topological variations as a filtration parameter changes; a typical parameter is the feature scale.\n\nFor many data sets, it is useful to consider varying multiple filtration parameters at once, for example scale and density.  While the theoretical properties of one-parameter persistent homology are well understood, less is known about the multiparameter case.  Of particular interest is the problem of representing multiparameter persistent homology by elements of a vector space for integration with traditional machine learning.\n\nExisting approaches to this problem either ignore most of the multiparameter information to reduce to the one-parameter case or are heuristic and potentially unstable in the face of noise.  In this article, we introduce a general representation framework for multiparameter persistent homology that encompasses previous approaches. We establish theoretical stability guarantees under this framework  as well as efficient algorithms for practical computation, making this framework an applicable and versatile tool for TDA practitioners. We validate our stability results and algorithms with numerical experiments that demonstrate statistical convergence, prediction accuracy, and fast running times on several real data sets. "}}

In this work, we propose to bypass these two burdens in a data-driven setting by entrusting the estimation of (vectorization of) PDs built on top of point clouds to a neural network architecture that we call RipsNet. Once trained on a given data set, RipsNet can estimate topological descriptors on test data very efficiently with generalization capacity. Furthermore, we prove that RipsNet is robust to input perturbations in terms of the 1-Wasserstein distance, a major improvement over the standard computation of PDs that only enjoys Hausdorff stability, yielding RipsNet to substantially outperform exactly-computed PDs in noisy settings. We showcase the use of RipsNet on both synthetic and real-world data. Our implementation will be made freely and publicly available as part of an open-source library."}}

In this article, we present a novel application of persistent homology to characterize the spatial arrangement of immune and epithelial (tumor) cells within the breast cancer immune microenvironment. More specifically, quantitative and robust characterizations are built by computing persistence diagrams out of a staining technique (quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence) which allows us to obtain spatial coordinates and stain intensities on individual cells. The resulting persistence diagrams are evaluated as characteristic biomarkers of cancer subtype and prognostic biomarker of overall survival. For a cohort of approximately 700 breast cancer patients with median 8.5-year clinical follow-up, we show that these persistence diagrams outperform and complement the usual descriptors which capture spatial relationships with nearest neighbor analysis. This provides new insights and possibilities on the general problem of building (topology-based) biomarkers that are characteristic and predictive of cancer subtype, overall survival and response to therapy."}}

We introduce and study MREC, a recursive decomposition algorithm for computing matchings between data sets. The basic idea is to partition the data, match the partitions, and then recursively match the points within each pair of identified partitions. The matching itself is done using black box matching procedures that are too expensive to run on the entire data set. Using an absolute measure of the quality of a matching, the framework supports optimization over parameters including partitioning procedures and matching algorithms. By design, MREC can be applied to extremely large data sets. We analyze the procedure to describe when we can expect it to work well and demonstrate its flexibility and power by applying it to a number of alignment problems arising in the analysis of single cell molecular data."}}

A central theme in the area is the idea of persistence, which in its most basic form studies how measures of shape change as a scale parameter varies. There are now a number of frameworks that support statistics and machine learning in this context. However, in many applications there are several different parameters one might wish to vary: for example, scale and density. In contrast to the one-parameter setting, techniques for applying statistics and machine learning in the setting of multiparameter persistence are not well understood due to the lack of a concise representation of the results. We introduce a new descriptor for multiparameter persistence, which we call the Multiparameter Persistence Image, that is suitable for machine learning and statistical frameworks, is robust to perturbations in the data, has finer resolution than existing descriptors based on slicing, and can be efficiently computed on data sets of realistic size. Moreover, we demonstrate its efficacy by comparing its performance to other multiparameter descriptors on several classification tasks."}}

However, the approaches proposed in the literature are usually anchored to a specific application and/or topological construction, and do not come with theoretical guarantees. To address this issue, we study the differentiability of a general map associated with the most common topological construction, that is, the persistence map. Building on real analytic geometry arguments, we propose a general framework that allows us to define and compute gradients for persistence-based functions in a very simple way. We also provide a simple, explicit and sufficient condition for convergence of stochastic subgradient methods for such functions. This result encompasses all the constructions and applications of topological optimization in the literature. Finally, we provide associated code, that is easy to handle and to mix with other non-topological methods and constraints, as well as some experiments showcasing the versatility of our approach."}}
