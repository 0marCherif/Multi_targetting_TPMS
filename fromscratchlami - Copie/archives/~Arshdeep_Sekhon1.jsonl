This paper proposes PatchMix, a data augmentation method that creates new samples by composing patches from pairs of images in a grid-like pattern. These new samples are assigned label scores that are proportional to the number of patches borrowed from each image. We then add a set of additional losses at the patch-level to regularize and to encourage good representations at both the patch and image levels. A ResNet-50 model trained on ImageNet using PatchMix exhibits superior transfer learning capabilities across a wide array of benchmarks. Although PatchMix can rely on random pairings and random grid-like patterns for mixing, we explore evolutionary search as a guiding strategy to jointly discover optimal grid-like patterns and image pairings. For this purpose, we conceive a fitness function that bypasses the need to re-train a model to evaluate each possible choice. In this way, PatchMix outperforms a base model on CIFAR-10 (+1.91), CIFAR-100 (+5.31), Tiny Imagenet (+3.52), and ImageNet (+1.16). "}}

However, experimental methods to find protein interactions are inadequate: large scale experiments are noisy, and small scale experiments are slow and expensive. Inspired by the recent successes of deep neural networks, we hypothesize that deep learning methods are well-positioned to aid and augment biological experiments, hoping to help identify more accurate virus-host protein interaction maps. Moreover, computational methods can quickly adapt to predict how virus mutations change protein interactions with the host proteins.\n\nWe propose DeepVHPPI, a novel deep learning framework combining a self-attention-based transformer architecture and a transfer learning training strategy to predict interactions between human proteins and virus proteins that have novel sequence patterns. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly in predicting Virus-Human protein interactions for SARS-CoV-2, H1N1, and Ebola. In addition, we demonstrate how our framework can be used to predict and interpret the interactions of mutated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequences."}}

Handling tasks from multiple distributions is challenging for meta-learning because it adds ambiguity to task identities. This paper proposes a novel method, ST-MAML, that empowers model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to learn from multiple task distributions. ST-MAML encodes tasks using a stochastic neural network module, that summarizes every task with a stochastic representation. The proposed Stochastic Task (ST) strategy learns a distribution of solutions for an ambiguous task and allows a meta-model to self-adapt to the current task. ST-MAML also propagates the task representation to enhance input variable encodings. Empirically, we demonstrate that ST-MAML outperforms the state-of-the-art on two few-shot image classification tasks, one curve regression benchmark, one image completion problem, and a real-world temperature prediction application.

In this paper, we propose a novel differential network estimator that allows integrating various sources of knowledge beyond data samples. The proposed estimator is scalable to a large number of variables and achieves a sharp asymptotic convergence rate. Empirical experiments on extensive simulated data and four real-world applications (one on neuroimaging and three from functional genomics) show that our approach achieves improved differential network estimation and provides better supports to downstream tasks like classification. Our results highlight significant benefits of integrating group, spatial and anatomic knowledge during differential genetic network identification and brain connectome change discovery."}}

Modeling the combinatorial label interactions in MLC has been a long-haul challenge. Recurrent neural network (RNN) based encoder-decoder models have shown state-of-the-art performance for solving MLC. However, the sequential nature of modeling label dependencies through an RNN limits its ability in parallel computation, predicting dense labels, and providing interpretable results. In this paper, we propose Message Passing Encoder-Decoder (MPED) Networks,  aiming to provide fast, accurate, and interpretable MLC. MPED networks model the joint prediction of labels by replacing all RNNs in the encoder-decoder architecture with message passing mechanisms and dispense with autoregressive inference entirely.  The proposed models are simple, fast, accurate, interpretable, and structure-agnostic (can be used on known or unknown structured data). Experiments on seven real-world MLC datasets show the proposed models outperform autoregressive RNN models across five different metrics with a significant speedup during training and testing time."}}

On a reference TFBS dataset with 2.1 million genomic sequences, PMN significantly outperforms baselines and validates our design choices empirically.
