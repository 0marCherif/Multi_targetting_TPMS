This paper describes a 3-step procedure to develop a conversational model that satisfies these criteria and can efficiently scale to rank a large set of response candidates. First, we provide a simple algorithm to semi-automatically create a high-coverage template set from historic conversations without any annotation. Second, we propose a neural architecture that encodes the dialogue context and applicable business constraints as profile features for ranking the next turn. Third, we describe a two-stage learning strategy with self-supervised training, followed by supervised fine-tuning on limited data collected through a human-in-the-loop platform. Finally, we describe offline experiments and present results of deploying our model with human-in-the-loop to converse with live customers online."}}

Until now, categorical posteriors have been argued to be one of the main drivers of performance. In this work we revisit Gaussian variational posteriors for latent-action RL and show that they can yield even better performance than categoricals. We achieve this by simplifying the training procedure and propose ways to regularize the latent dialogue policy to retain good response coherence. Using continuous latent representations our model achieves state of the art dialogue success rate on the MultiWOZ benchmark, and also compares well to categorical latent methods in response coherence."}}

In particular, music streaming services have large catalogs, often containing millions of songs, artists, and albums and several thousands of custom playlists and stations. In many cases there is ambiguity and little structural difference between carrier phrases and entity names. In this work, we describe how we leveraged multi-armed bandits in combination with implicit customer feedback to improve accuracy and personalization of responses to voice request in the music domain. Our models are tested in a large-scale industrial system containing several other components. In particular, we focused on using this technology to correct errors made by upstream NLU models and personalize responses based on customer preferences and music provider functionality. The models resulted in significant improvement of playback rate for Amazon Music and are deployed in systems serving several countries and languages. We further used the implicit feedback of the customers to generate weakly labeled training data for the NLU models. This improved the experience for customers using other music providers on all Alexa devices."}}

Most notably, users turn to health forums to seek advice from doctors and from peers with similar cases. However, the benefit of forums mostly lies in community QA and browsing. Expressive querying for patient-centric needs is poorly supported by search engines. This paper overcomes this issue by enriching user queries with judiciously chosen entities and classes from a large knowledge graph. Candidate entities are extracted from the full text of user posts. To counter topical drift that would arise from picking all entities, we devise ECO, a novel method that computes a focused entity core for query expansion. Experiments with contents from health forums and clinical trials demonstrate substantial gains that ECO achieves over state-of-the-art baselines."}}

However, in advanced domains such as health, it is often crucial to consider ternary and higher-arity relations. An example is to capture which drug is used for which disease at which dosage (e.g. 2.5 mg/day) for which kinds of patients (e.g., children vs. adults). In this work, we present an approach to harvest higher-arity facts from textual sources. Our method is distantly supervised by seed facts, and uses the fact-pattern duality principle to gather fact candidates with high recall. For high precision, we devise a constraint-based reasoning method to eliminate false candidates. A major novelty is in coping with the difficulty that higher-arity facts are often expressed only partially in texts and strewn across multiple sources. For example, one sentence may refer to a drug, a disease and a group of patients, whereas another sentence talks about the drug, its dosage and the target group without mentioning the disease. Our methods cope well with such partially observed facts, at both pattern-learning and constraint-reasoning stages. Experiments with health-related documents and with news articles demonstrate the viability of our method."}}

BioNex takes biomedical queries such as \"Ebola virus disease\" and retrieves the k most relevant news events for them. To achieve this we first mine the generic news events by clustering them on a daily basis using general named entities and textual features. These clusters are also tagged with disambiguated biomedical entities which aid in biomedical news event exploration. The clusters are then used to compute the importance scores for the event clusters based on a combination of textual, semantic, popularity and historical importance features. BioNex also visualizes the retrieved event clusters to highlight the top news events and corresponding news articles for the given query. The visualization also provides the context for news events using (1) a chain of historically relevant news event clusters, and (2) other non-biomedical events from the same day."}}
