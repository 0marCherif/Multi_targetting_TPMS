The motion forecasting task aims at predicting future trajectories of vehicles by incorporating spatial and temporal information from the past. A key design of MISC is the proposed Dual Consistency Constraints that regularize the predicted trajectories under spatial and temporal perturbation during training. Also, to model the multi-modality in motion forecasting,  we design a novel self-ensembling scheme to obtain accurate teacher targets to enforce the self-constraints with multi-modality supervision. With explicit constraints from multiple teacher targets, we observe a clear improvement in the prediction performance. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse motion forecasting benchmark show that MISC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. As the proposed strategies are general and can be easily incorporated into other motion forecasting approaches, we also demonstrate that our proposed scheme consistently improves the prediction performance of several existing methods."}}

However, most image operators often smooth out details or generate textures after the processing, which removes the original content and raises challenges for restoring the original image. To resolve this issue, we propose a quasi-invertible model that learns common image processing operators in a restorable fashion: the learned image operators can generate visually pleasing results with the original content embedded. Our model is trained on input-output pairs that represent an image processing operator's behavior and uses a network that consists of an invertible branch and a non-invertible branch to increase our model's approximation capability. We evaluate the proposed model on ten image operators, including detail enhancement, abstraction, blur, photographic style, and non-photorealistic style. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms relevant baselines in the restoration quality, and the learned restorable operator is fast in inference and robust to compression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the invertible operator can be easily applied to practical applications such as restorable human face retouching and highlight preserved exposure adjustment."}}

A significant challenge in generating such avatars is that the memory and processing costs in 3D are prohibitive for producing the rich details required for high-quality avatars. To tackle this problem we propose the roll-out diffusion network (Rodin), which represents a neural radiance field as multiple 2D feature maps and rolls out these maps into a single 2D feature plane within which we perform 3D-aware diffusion. The Rodin model brings the much-needed computational efficiency while preserving the integrity of diffusion in 3D by using 3D-aware convolution that attends to projected features in the 2D feature plane according to their original relationship in 3D. We also use latent conditioning to orchestrate the feature generation for global coherence, leading to high-fidelity avatars and enabling their semantic editing based on text prompts. Finally, we use hierarchical synthesis to further enhance details. The 3D avatars generated by our model compare favorably with those produced by existing generative techniques. We can generate highly detailed avatars with realistic hairstyles and facial hair like beards. We also demonstrate 3D avatar generation from image or text as well as text-guided editability."}}

Prior image-to-image translation methods usually need dedicated architectural design and train individual translation models from scratch, struggling for high-quality generation of complex scenes, especially when paired training data are not abundant. In this paper, we regard each image-to-image translation problem as a downstream task and introduce a simple and generic framework that adapts a pretrained diffusion model to accommodate various kinds of image-to-image translation. We also propose adversarial training to enhance the texture synthesis in the diffusion model training, in conjunction with normalized guidance sampling to improve the generation quality. We present extensive empirical comparison across various tasks on challenging benchmarks such as ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and DIODE, showing the proposed pretraining-based image-to-image translation (PITI) is capable of synthesizing images of unprecedented realism and faithfulness."}}

It is natural to associate 3D GANs with GAN inversion methods to project a real image into the generator's latent space, allowing free-view consistent synthesis and editing, referred as 3D GAN inversion. Although with the facial prior preserved in pre-trained 3D GANs, reconstructing a 3D portrait with only one monocular image is still an ill-pose problem. The straightforward application of 2D GAN inversion methods focuses on texture similarity only while ignoring the correctness of 3D geometry shapes. It may raise geometry collapse effects, especially when reconstructing a side face under an extreme pose. Besides, the synthetic results in novel views are prone to be blurry. In this work, we propose a novel method to promote 3D GAN inversion by introducing facial symmetry prior. We design a pipeline and constraints to make full use of the pseudo auxiliary view obtained via image flipping, which helps obtain a robust and reasonable geometry shape during the inversion process. To enhance texture fidelity in unobserved viewpoints, pseudo labels from depth-guided 3D warping can provide extra supervision. We design constraints aimed at filtering out conflict areas for optimization in asymmetric situations. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on image reconstruction and editing demonstrate the superiority of our method."}}

We first analyze the challenges of highfidelity GAN inversion from the perspective of lossy data compression. With a low bitrate latent code, previous works have difficulties in preserving highfidelity details in reconstructed and edited images. Increasing the size of a latent code can improve the accuracy of GAN inversion but at the cost of inferior editability. To improve image fidelity without compromising editability, we propose a distortion consultation approach that employs a distortion map as a reference for highfidelity reconstruction. In the distortion consultation inversion (DCI), the distortion map is first projected to a high-rate latent map, which then complements the basic low-rate latent code with more details via consultation fusion. To achieve high-fidelity editing, we propose an adaptive distortion alignment (ADA) module with a self-supervised training scheme, which bridges the gap between the edited and inversion images. Extensive experiments in the face and car domains show a clear improvement in both inversion and editing quality. The project page is https://tengfei-wang.github.io/HFGI/."}}

To address these issues, we propose an external-internal inpainting scheme with a monochromic bottleneck that helps image inpainting models remove these artifacts. In the external learning stage, we reconstruct missing structures and details in the monochromic space to reduce the learning dimension. In the internal learning stage, we propose a novel internal color propagation method with progressive learning strategies for consistent color restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme helps image inpainting models produce more structure-preserved and visually compelling results."}}

Unlike previous methods that use optical flow for cross-frame context propagation to inpaint unknown regions, we show that this can be achieved implicitly by fitting a convolutional neural network to known regions. Moreover, to handle challenging sequences with ambiguous backgrounds or long-term occlusion, we design two regularization terms to preserve high-frequency details and long-term temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art inpainting quality quantitatively and qualitatively. We further extend the proposed method to another challenging task: learning to remove an object from a video giving a single object mask in only one frame in a 4K video.
