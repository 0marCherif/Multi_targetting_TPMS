Most of the previous TTA methods have achieved great success on simple test data streams such as independently sampled data from single or multiple distributions. However, these attempts may fail in dynamic scenarios of real-world applications like autonomous driving, where the environments gradually change and the test data is sampled correlatively over time. In this work, we explore such practical test data streams to deploy the model on the fly, namely practical test-time adaptation (PTTA). To do so, we elaborate a Robust Test-Time Adaptation (RoTTA) method against the complex data stream in PTTA. More specifically, we present a robust batch normalization scheme to estimate the normalization statistics. Meanwhile, a memory bank is utilized to sample category-balanced data with consideration of timeliness and uncertainty. Further, to stabilize the training procedure, we develop a time-aware reweighting strategy with a teacher-student model. Extensive experiments prove that RoTTA enables continual testtime adaptation on the correlatively sampled data streams. Our method is easy to implement, making it a good choice for rapid deployment.

However, realistic segmentation datasets are highly imbalanced, pseudo labels are typically biased to the majority classes and basically noisy, leading to an error-prone and suboptimal model. In this paper, we propose a simple region-based active learning approach for semantic segmentation under a domain shift, aiming to automatically query a small partition of image regions to be labeled while maximizing segmentation performance. Our algorithm, Region Impurity and Prediction Uncertainty (RIPU), introduces a new acquisition strategy characterizing the spatial adjacency of image regions along with the prediction confidence. We show that the proposed region-based selection strategy makes more efficient use of a limited budget than image-based or point-based counterparts. Further, we enforce local prediction consistency between a pixel and its nearest neighbors on a source image. Alongside, we develop a negative learning loss to make the features more discriminative. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method only requires very few annotations to almost reach the supervised performance and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

EVA is a vanilla ViT pre-trained to reconstruct the masked out image-text aligned vision features conditioned on visible image patches. Via this pretext task, we can efficiently scale up EVA to one billion parameters, and sets new records on a broad range of representative vision downstream tasks, such as image recognition, video action recognition, object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation without heavy supervised training. Moreover, we observe quantitative changes in scaling EVA result in qualitative changes in transfer learning performance that are not present in other models. For instance, EVA takes a great leap in the challenging large vocabulary instance segmentation task: our model achieves almost the same state-of-the-art performance on LVISv1.0 dataset with over a thousand categories and COCO dataset with only eighty categories. Beyond a pure vision encoder, EVA can also serve as a vision-centric, multi-modal pivot to connect images and text. We find initializing the vision tower of a giant CLIP from EVA can greatly stabilize the training and outperform the training from scratch counterpart with much fewer samples and less compute, providing a new direction for scaling up and accelerating the costly training of multi-modal foundation models.

One prevalent solution is to bridge the domain gap between clear- and adverse-condition images to make satisfactory prediction on the target. However, previous methods often reckon on additional reference images of the same scenes taken from normal conditions, which are quite tough to collect in reality. Furthermore, most of them mainly focus on individual adverse condition such as nighttime or foggy, weakening the model versatility when encountering other adverse weathers. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a novel framework, Visibility Boosting and Logit-Constraint learning (VBLC), tailored for superior normal-to-adverse adaptation. VBLC explores the potential of getting rid of reference images and resolving the mixture of adverse conditions simultaneously. In detail, we first propose the visibility boost module to dynamically improve target images via certain priors in the image level. Then, we figure out the overconfident drawback in the conventional cross-entropy loss for self-training method and devise the logit-constraint learning, which enforces a constraint on logit outputs during training to mitigate this pain point. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new perspective for tackling such a challenging task. Extensive experiments on two normal-to-adverse domain adaptation benchmarks, i.e., Cityscapes -> ACDC and Cityscapes -> FoggyCityscapes + RainCityscapes, verify the effectiveness of VBLC, where it establishes the new state of the art.

Recent advances in DA mainly proceed by aligning the source and target distributions. Despite the significant success, the adaptation performance still degrades accordingly when the source and target domains encounter a large distribution discrepancy. We consider this limitation may attribute to the insufficient exploration of domain-specialized features because most studies merely concentrate on domain-general feature learning in task-specific layers and integrate totally-shared convolutional networks (convnets) to generate common features for both domains. In this paper, we relax the completely-shared convnets assumption adopted by previous DA methods and propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Domain Conditioned Adaptation Network (DCAN)</i> , which introduces domain conditioned channel attention module with a multi-path structure to separately excite channel activation for each domain. Such a partially-shared convnets module allows domain-specialized features in low-level to be explored appropriately. Further, given the knowledge transferability varying along with convolutional layers, we develop <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Generalized Domain Conditioned Adaptation Network (GDCAN)</i> to automatically determine whether domain channel activations should be separately modeled in each attention module. Afterward, the critical domain-specialized knowledge could be adaptively extracted according to the domain statistic gaps. As far as we know, this is the first work to explore the domain-wise convolutional channel activations separately for deep DA networks. Additionally, to effectively match high-level feature distributions across domains, we consider deploying feature adaptation blocks after task-specific layers, which can explicitly mitigate the domain discrepancy. Extensive experiments on four cross-domain benchmarks, including DomainNet, Office-Home, Office-31, and ImageCLEF, demonstrate the proposed approaches outperform the existing methods by a large margin, especially on the large-scale challenging dataset.

However, there is still enormous potential to be tapped to reach the fully supervised performance. In this paper, we present a novel active learning strategy to assist knowledge transfer in the target domain, dubbed active domain adaptation. We start from an observation that energy-based models exhibit free energy biases when training (source) and test (target) data come from different distributions. Inspired by this inherent mechanism, we empirically reveal that a simple yet efficient energy-based sampling strategy sheds light on selecting the most valuable target samples than existing approaches requiring particular architectures or computation of the distances. Our algorithm, Energy-based Active Domain Adaptation (EADA), queries groups of target data that incorporate both domain characteristic and instance uncertainty into every selection round. Meanwhile, by aligning the free energy of target data compact around the source domain via a regularization term, domain gap can be implicitly diminished. Through extensive experiments, we show that EADA surpasses state-of-the-art methods on well-known challenging benchmarks with substantial improvements, making it a useful option in the open world.

One solution is self-training, which retrains models with target pseudo labels. Many methods tend to alleviate noisy pseudo labels, however, they ignore intrinsic connections among cross-domain pixels with similar semantic concepts. Thus, they would struggle to deal with the semantic variations across domains, leading to less discrimination and poor generalization. In this work, we propose Semantic-Guided Pixel Contrast (SePiCo), a novel one-stage adaptation framework that highlights the semantic concepts of individual pixel to promote learning of class-discriminative and class-balanced pixel embedding space across domains. Specifically, to explore proper semantic concepts, we first investigate a centroid-aware pixel contrast that employs the category centroids of the entire source domain or a single source image to guide the learning of discriminative features. Considering the possible lack of category diversity in semantic concepts, we then blaze a trail of distributional perspective to involve a sufficient quantity of instances, namely distribution-aware pixel contrast, in which we approximate the true distribution of each semantic category from the statistics of labeled source data. Moreover, such an optimization objective can derive a closed-form upper bound by implicitly involving an infinite number of (dis)similar pairs. Extensive experiments show that SePiCo not only helps stabilize training but also yields discriminative features, making significant progress in both daytime and nighttime scenarios. Most notably, SePiCo establishes excellent results on tasks of GTAV/SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes and Cityscapes-to-Dark Zurich, improving by 12.8, 8.8, and 9.2 mIoUs compared to the previous best method, respectively."}}

In this paper, we propose a Simultaneous Semantic Alignment Network (SSAN) to simultaneously exploit correlations among categories and align the centroids for each category across domains. In particular, we propose an implicit semantic correlation loss to transfer the correlation knowledge of source categorical prediction distributions to target domain. Meanwhile, by leveraging target pseudo-labels, a robust triplet-centroid alignment mechanism is explicitly applied to align feature representations for each category. Notably, a pseudo-label refinement procedure with geometric similarity involved is introduced to enhance the target pseudo-label assignment accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on various HDA tasks across text-to-image, image-to-image and text-to-text successfully validate the superiority of our SSAN against state-of-the-art HDA methods.

It has raised significant interest in multimedia analysis. Existing researches mainly focus on learning domain-wise transferable representations via statistical moment matching or adversarial adaptation techniques, while ignoring the class-wise mismatch across domains, resulting in inaccurate distribution alignment. To address this issue, we propose a Joint Adversarial Domain Adaptation (JADA) approach to simultaneously align domain-wise and class-wise distributions across source and target in a unified adversarial learning process. Specifically, JADA attempts to solve two complementary minimax problems jointly. The feature generator aims to not only fool the well-trained domain discriminator to learn domain-invariant features, but also minimize the disagreement between two distinct task-specific classifiers' predictions to synthesize target features near the support of source class-wisely. As a result, the learned transferable features will be equipped with more discriminative structures, and effectively avoid mode collapse. Additionally, JADA enables an efficient end-to-end training manner via a simple back-propagation scheme. Extensive experiments on several real-world cross-domain benchmarks, including VisDA-2017, ImageCLEF, Office-31 and digits, verify that JADA can gain remarkable improvements over other state-of-the-art deep domain adaptation approaches."}}
