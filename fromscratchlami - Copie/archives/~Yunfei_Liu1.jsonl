Such videos record information from different perspectives than the traditional third-person view, and thus show a wide range of potential usages. However, techniques for analyzing videos from different views can be fundamentally different, not to mention co-analyzing on both views to explore the shared information. In this paper, we take the challenge of cross-view video co-analysis and deliver a novel learning-based method. At the core of our method is the notion of \u201cjoint attention\u201d, indicating the shared attention regions that link the corresponding views, and eventually guide the shared representation learning across views. To this end, we propose a multi-branch deep network, which extracts cross-view joint attention and shared representation from static frames with spatial constraints, in a self-supervised and simultaneous manner. In addition, by incorporating the temporal transition model of the joint attention, we obtain spatial-temporal joint attention that can robustly capture the essential information extending through time. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the standard cross-view video matching tasks on public datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the learnt joint information can benefit various applications through a set of qualitative and quantitative experiments."}}

Animating high-fidelity and multimodal video portraits has a variety of applications. Previous methods have attempted to capture different motion modes and generate high-fidelity portrait videos by training different models or sampling signals from given videos. However, lacking correlation learning between lip-sync and other movements (e.g., head pose/eye blinking) usually leads to unnatural results. In this paper, we propose a unified system for multi-person, diverse, and high-fidelity talking portrait generation. Our method contains three stages, i.e., 1) Mapping-Once network with Dual Attentions (MODA) generates talking representation from given audio. In MODA, we design a dual-attention module to encode accurate mouth movements and diverse modalities. 2) Facial composer network generates dense and detailed face landmarks, and 3) temporal-guided renderer syntheses stable videos. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed system produces more natural and realistic video portraits compared to previous methods."}}

In this paper, we discover the rotation-consistency property in gaze estimation and introduce the `sub-label' for unsupervised domain adaptation. Consequently, we propose the Rotation-enhanced Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (RUDA) for gaze estimation. First, we rotate the original images with different angles for training. Then we conduct domain adaptation under the constraint of rotation consistency. The target domain images are assigned with sub-labels, derived from relative rotation angles rather than untouchable real labels. With such sub-labels, we propose a novel distribution loss that facilitates the domain adaptation. We evaluate the RUDA framework on four cross-domain gaze estimation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that it improves the performance over the baselines with gains ranging from 12.2% to 30.5%. Our framework has the potential to be used in other computer vision tasks with physical constraints."}}

Given an input image, recovering the physical scene properties is ill-posed. Several physically motivated priors have been used to restrict the solution space of the optimization problem for intrinsic image decomposition. This work takes advantage of deep learning, and shows that it can solve this challenging computer vision problem with high efficiency. The focus lies in the feature encoding phase to extract discriminative features for different intrinsic layers from an input image. To achieve this goal, we explore the distinctive characteristics of different intrinsic components in the high dimensional feature embedding space. We define feature distribution divergence to efficiently separate the feature vectors of different intrinsic components. The feature distributions are also constrained to fit the real ones through a feature distribution consistency. In addition, a data refinement approach is provided to remove data inconsistency from the Sintel dataset, making it more suitable for intrinsic image decomposition. Our method is also extended to intrinsic video decomposition based on pixel-wise correspondences between adjacent frames. Experimental results indicate that our proposed network structure can outperform the existing state-of-the-art."}}

While recent deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated excellent performance, they usually assume one calibrated face in each input image and cannot output multi-person gaze in real time. However, simultaneous gaze estimation for multiple people in the wild is necessary for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose the first one-stage end-to-end gaze estimation method, GazeOnce, which is capable of simultaneously predicting gaze directions for multiple faces (> 10) in an image. In addition, we design a sophisticated data generation pipeline and propose a new dataset, MPSGaze, which contains full images of multiple people with 3D gaze ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only offers a faster speed, but also provides a lower gaze estimation error compared with state-of-the-art methods. This technique can be useful in real-time applications with multiple users."}}

However, due to variations in person, illuminations, and background, performance degrades dramatically when applying the model to a new domain. In this paper, we discover an interesting gaze jitter phenomenon in cross-domain gaze estimation, i.e., the gaze predictions of two similar images can be severely deviated in target domain. This is closely related to cross-domain gaze estimation tasks, but surprisingly, it has not been noticed yet previously. Therefore, we innovatively propose to utilize the gaze jitter to analyze and optimize the gaze domain adaptation task. We find that the high-frequency component (HFC) is an important factor that leads to jitter. Based on this discovery, we add high-frequency components to input images using the adversarial attack and employ contrastive learning to encourage the model to obtain similar representations between original and perturbed data, which reduces the impacts of HFC. We evaluate the proposed method on four cross-domain gaze estimation tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that it significantly reduces the gaze jitter and improves the gaze estimation performance in target domains."}}

However, many deep learning-based methods suffer from the vulnerability property, i.e., perturbing the raw image using noise confuses the gaze estimation models. Although the perturbed image visually looks similar to the original image, the gaze estimation models output the wrong gaze direction. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of appearance-based gaze estimation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the vulnerability of gaze estimation to be found. We systematically characterized the vulnerability property from multiple aspects, the pixel-based adversarial attack, the patch-based adversarial attack and the defense strategy. Our experimental results demonstrate that the CA-Net shows superior performance against attack among the four popular appearance-based gaze estimation networks, Full-Face, Gaze-Net, CA-Net and RT-GENE. This study draws the attention of researchers in the appearance-based gaze estimation community to defense from adversarial attacks."}}

In this paper, we propose to separate the content code and style code simultaneously in a unified framework. Based on the correlation between the latent features and the high-level domain-invariant tasks, the proposed framework demonstrates superior performance in multimodal translation, interpretability and manipulation of the translated image. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing unsupervised image translation methods in terms of visual quality and diversity."}}

Instead of directly extracting representative features using expert-designed descriptors or end-to-end deep neural networks, this paper is dedicated to discovering distinctive information from the shape formation process. Concretely, a spherical point cloud served as the template is progressively deformed to fit the target shape in a coarse-to-fine manner. During the shape formation process, several checkpoints are inserted to facilitate recording and investigating the intermediate stages. For each stage, the offset field is evaluated as a stage-aware description. The summation of the offsets throughout the shape formation process can completely define the target shape in terms of geometry. In this perspective, one can derive the point-wise shape correspondence from the template inexpensively, which benefits various graphic applications. In this paper, the Progressive Deformation-based Auto-Encoder (PDAE) is proposed to learn the stage-aware description through a coarse-to-fine shape fitting task. Experimental results show that the proposed PDAE has the ability to reconstruct 3D shapes with high fidelity, and consistent topology is preserved in the multi-stage deformation process. Additional applications based on the stage-aware description are performed, demonstrating its universality."}}
