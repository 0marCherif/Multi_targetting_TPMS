The WSI datasets are also\nimbalanced in categories. These unique characteristics,\nsignificantly different from the ones in natural images, pose\nthe challenge of classifying WSI images as a kind of weakly\nsupervise learning problems. In this study, we propose,\nRankMix, a data augmentation method of mixing ranked\nfeatures in a pair of WSIs. RankMix introduces the concepts\nof pseudo labeling and ranking in order to extract key\nWSI regions in contributing to the WSI classification task. A\ntwo-stage training is further proposed to boost stable training\nand model performance.\nTo our knowledge, the study of weakly supervised learning\nfrom the perspective of data augmentation to deal with\nthe WSI classification problem that suffers from lack of\ntraining data and imbalance of categories is relatively unexplored."}}
