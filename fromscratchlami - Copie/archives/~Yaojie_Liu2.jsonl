In this chapter, we introduce a novel two-stream CNN-based approach for the presentation attack detection, by extracting the patch-based features and holistic depth maps from the face images. We also introduce a two-stream CNN v2 with model optimization, compression and a strategy of continuous updating. The CNN v2 shows great performances of both generalization and efficiency.

Those approaches often regard the image as an indivisible unit, and process it holistically, without explicit modeling of the spoofing process. In this work, motivated by the noise modeling and denoising algorithms, we identify a new problem of face de-spoofing, for the purpose of anti-spoofing: inversely decomposing a spoof face into a spoof noise and a live face, and then utilizing the spoof noise for classification. A CNN architecture with proper constraints and supervisions is proposed to overcome the problem of having no ground truth for the decomposition. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple face anti-spoofing databases. The results show promising improvements due to our spoof noise modeling. Moreover, the estimated spoof noise provides a visualization which helps to understand the added spoof noise by each spoof medium."}}

Previous works mostly focus on sparse alignment with a limited number of facial landmark points, i.e., facial landmark detection. In this paper, for the first time, we aim at providing a very dense 3D alignment for large pose face images. To achieve this, we train a CNN to estimate the 3D face shape, which not only aligns limited facial landmarks but also fits face contours and SIFT feature points. Moreover, we also address the bottleneck of training CNN with multiple datasets, due to different landmark markups on different datasets, such as 5, 34, 68. Experimental results show our method not only provides high quality, dense 3D face fitting but also outperforms the state-of-the-art facial landmark detection methods on challenging datasets. Our model can run at real time during testing and it\u2019s available at http:///cvlab.cse.msu.edu/project-pifa.html.\n"}}

Previous deep learning approaches formulate face anti-spoofing as a binary classification problem. Many of them struggle to grasp adequate spoofing cues and generalize poorly. In this paper, we argue the importance of auxiliary supervision to guide the learning toward discriminative and generalizable cues. A CNN-RNN model is learned to estimate the face depth with pixel-wise supervision, and to estimate rPPG signals with sequence-wise supervision. The estimated depth and rPPG are fused to distinguish live vs. spoof faces. Further, we introduce a new face anti-spoofing database that covers a large range of illumination, subject, and pose variations. Experiments show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art results on both intra- and cross-database testing.\n"}}

With the growing online person-to-person shopping (e.g., Ebay and Craigslist), such attacks also threaten those services, where the online photo illustration might not be captured from real items but from paper or digital screen. Thus, the study of anti-spoofing should be extended from modality-specific solutions to generic-object-based ones. In this work, we define and tackle the problem of Generic Object Anti-Spoofing (GOAS) for the first time. One significant cue to detect these attacks is the noise patterns introduced by the capture sensors and spoof mediums. Different sensor/medium combinations can result in diverse noise patterns. We propose a GAN-based architecture to synthesize and identify the noise patterns from seen and unseen medium/sensor combinations. We show that the procedure of synthesis and identification are mutually beneficial. We further demonstrate the learned GOAS models can directly contribute to modality-specific anti-spoofing without domain transfer. The code and GOSet dataset are available at cvlab.cse.msu.edu/project-goas.html."}}
