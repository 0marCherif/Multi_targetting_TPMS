The more convolution-like inductive bias is included in the model, the smaller the data scale is required where the ViT-like model outperforms the ResNet performance. To obtain a model with flexible inductive bias on the data scale, we show reparameterization can interpolate inductive bias between convolution and self-attention. By adjusting the number of epochs the model stays in the convolution, we show that reparameterization from convolution to self-attention interpolates the Fourier analysis pattern between CNNs and ViTs. Adapting these findings, we propose Progressive Reparameterization Scheduling (PRS), in which reparameterization adjusts the required amount of convolution-like or self-attention-like inductive bias per layer. For small-scale datasets, our PRS performs reparameterization from convolution to self-attention linearly faster at the late stage layer.

Their guidance formulation allows an external model to plug-and-play control the generation process for various tasks without finetuning the diffusion model. However, the direct use of publicly available off-the-shelf models for guidance fails due to their poor performance on noisy inputs. For that, the existing practice is to fine-tune the guidance models with labeled data corrupted with noises. In this paper, we argue that this practice has limitations in two aspects: (1) performing on inputs with extremely various noises is too hard for a single guidance model; (2) collecting labeled datasets hinders scaling up for various tasks. To tackle the limitations, we propose a novel strategy that leverages multiple experts where each expert is specialized in a particular noise range and guides the reverse process of the diffusion at its corresponding timesteps. However, as it is infeasible to manage multiple networks and utilize labeled data, we present a practical guidance framework termed Practical Plug-And-Play (PPAP), which leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning and data-free knowledge transfer. We exhaustively conduct ImageNet class conditional generation experiments to show that our method can successfully guide diffusion with small trainable parameters and no labeled data. Finally, we show that image classifiers, depth estimators, and semantic segmentation models can guide publicly available GLIDE through our framework in a plug-and-play manner.

Unfortunately, simply solving ERM on a complex, non-convex loss function can easily lead to sub-optimal generalizability by seeking sharp minima. In this paper, we theoretically show that finding flat minima results in a smaller domain generalization gap.

SWAD shows state-of-the-art performances on five DG benchmarks, namely PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet, with consistent and large margins of +1.6% averagely on out-of-domain accuracy. We also compare SWAD with conventional generalization methods, such as data augmentation and consistency regularization methods, to verify that the remarkable performance improvements are originated from by seeking flat minima, not from better in-domain generalizability. Last but not least, SWAD is readily adaptable to existing DG methods without modification; the combination of SWAD and an existing DG method further improves DG performances.

Nevertheless, their image-level self-supervisions lead the learned representation to sub-optimal for dense prediction tasks, such as object detection, instance segmentation, etc. To tackle this issue, several recent self-supervised learning methods have extended image-level single embedding to pixel-level dense embeddings. Unlike image-level representation learning, due to the spatial deformation of augmentation, it is difficult to sample pixel-level positive pairs. Previous studies have sampled pixel-level positive pairs using the winner-takes-all among similarity or thresholding warped distance between dense embeddings. However, these naive methods can be struggled by background clutter and outliers problems. In this paper, we introduce Hough Contrastive Learning (HoughCL), a Hough space based method that enforces geometric consistency between two dense features. HoughCL achieves robustness against background clutter and outliers. Furthermore, compared to baseline, our dense positive pairing method has no additional learnable parameters and has a small extra computation cost. Compared to previous works, our method shows better or comparable performance on dense prediction fine-tuning tasks."}}

The baseline pre-trained short-term tracker is SuperDiMP which combines the bounding-box regressor of PrDiMP with the standard DiMP classifier. Our tracker RLT-DiMP improves SuperDiMP in the following three aspects: (1) Uncertainty reduction using random erasing: To make our model robust, we exploit an agreement from multiple images after erasing random small rectangular areas as a certainty. And then, we correct the tracking state of our model accordingly. (2) Random search with spatio-temporal constraints: we propose a robust random search method with a score penalty applied to prevent the problem of sudden detection at a distance. (3) Background augmentation for more discriminative feature learning: We augment various backgrounds that are not included in the search area to train a more robust model in the background clutter. In experiments on the VOT-LT2020 benchmark dataset, the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art long-term trackers.
