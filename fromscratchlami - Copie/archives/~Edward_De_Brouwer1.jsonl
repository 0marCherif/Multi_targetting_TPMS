These models provide a continuous-time latent representation of the underlying dynamical system where new observations at arbitrary time points can be used to update the latent representation of the dynamical system. Existing parameterizations for the dynamics functions of Neural ODEs limit the ability of the model to retain global information about the time series; specifically, a piece-wise integration of the latent process between observations can result in a loss of memory on the dynamic patterns of previously observed data points. We propose PolyODE, a Neural ODE that models the latent continuous-time process as a projection onto a basis of orthogonal polynomials. This formulation enforces long-range memory and preserves a global representation of the underlying dynamical system. Our construction is backed by favourable theoretical guarantees and in a series of experiments, we demonstrate that it outperforms previous works in the reconstruction of past and future data, and in downstream prediction tasks."}}

Such supervision is unfortunately not always available and, more often, only image-level information is provided, also known as weak supervision. \nRecent works have addressed this limitation by leveraging knowledge from a richly annotated domain. However, the scope of weak supervision supported by these approaches has been very restrictive, preventing them to use all available information. In this work, we propose ProbKT, a framework based on probabilistic logical reasoning to train object detection models with arbitrary types of weak supervision. We empirically show on different datasets that using all available information is beneficial as our ProbKT leads to significant improvement on target domain and better generalisation compared to existing baselines. We also showcase the ability of our approach to handle complex logic statements as supervision signal."}}

The standard approach to estimate counterfactuals resides in using a structural equation model that accurately reflects the underlying data generating process. However, such models are seldom available in practice and one usually wishes to infer them from observational data alone. Unfortunately, the correct structural equation model is in general not identifiable from the observed factual distribution. Nevertheless, in this work, we show that under the assumption that the main latent contributors to the treatment responses are categorical, the counterfactuals can be still reliably predicted.\n Building upon this assumption, we introduce CounterFactual Query Prediction (\\method), a novel method to infer counterfactuals from continuous observations when the background variables are categorical. We show that our method significantly outperforms previously available deep-learning-based counterfactual methods, both theoretically and empirically on time series and image data.

Despite beneficial theoretical and practical properties, such as a general utility for outlier detection, and a close connection to Laplace radial basis kernels, magnitude has received little attention by the machine learning community so far. In this work, we investigate the properties of magnitude on individual images, with each image forming its own metric space. We show that the known properties of outlier detection translate to edge detection in images and we give supporting theoretical justifications. In addition, we provide a proof of concept of its utility by using a novel magnitude layer to defend against adversarial attacks. Since naive magnitude calculations may be computationally prohibitive, we introduce an algorithm that leverages the regular structure of images to dramatically reduce the computational cost."}}

Augmenting GNNs with TOGL leads to improved predictive performance for graph and node classification tasks, both on synthetic data sets, which can be classified by humans using their topology but not by ordinary GNNs, and on real-world data."}}

Indeed, this type of data usually consists in short time series with missing or noisy values for which causal inference is increasingly difficult. In this work, we propose a method to uncover causal relations in chaotic dynamical systems from short, noisy and sporadic time series (that is, incomplete observations at infrequent and irregular intervals) where the classical convergent cross mapping (CCM) fails. Our method works by learning a Neural ODE latent process modeling the state-space dynamics of the time series and by checking the existence of a continuous map between the resulting processes. We provide theoretical analysis and show empirically that Latent-CCM can reliably uncover the true causal pattern, unlike traditional methods."}}
