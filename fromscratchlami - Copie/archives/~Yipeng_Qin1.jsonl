The majority of existing works require multiple (often $>$10) frames as input, which are not always accessible. Our work deals with a focused yet challenging problem: to generate the transition when given exactly two frames (only the first and last). To cope with this challenging scenario, we implement our bi-directional scheme which generates forward and backward transitions from the start and end frames with two adversarial autoregressive networks, and stitches them in the middle of the transition where there is no strict ground truth. The autoregressive networks based on conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE) are optimized by searching for a pair of optimal latent codes that minimize a novel stitching loss between their outputs. Results show that our method achieves higher motion quality and more diverse results than existing methods on both the LaFAN1 and Human3.6m datasets."}}

We further propose a novel dual-level motion constrastive learning method to learn the motion representation space in a more informative way. Thanks to its high efficiency, our method is particularly responsive to frequent requirements change and enables agile development of motion annotation models. Experimental results on the HDM05 dataset against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of our method."}}

In contrast to image-based methods that measure the quality of downscaled images, ours is process-based that draws ideas from the rate-distortion theory to measure the distortion incurred during downscaling. Our main idea is that downscaling and super-resolution (SR) can be viewed as the encoding and decoding processes in the rate-distortion model, respectively, and that a downscaling algorithm that preserves more details in the resulting low-resolution (LR) images should lead to less distorted high-resolution (HR) images in SR. In other words, the distortion should increase as the downscaling algorithm deteriorates. However, it is non-trivial to measure this distortion as it requires the SR algorithm to be blind and stochastic. Our key insight is that such requirements can be met by recent SR algorithms based on deep generative models that can find all matching HR images for a given LR image on their learned image manifolds. Empirically, we first validate our IDA-RD measure with synthetic downscaling algorithms which simulate distortions by adding various types and levels of degradations to the downscaled images. We then test our measure on traditional downscaling algorithms such as bicubic, bilinear, nearest neighbor interpolation as well as state-of-the-art downscaling algorithms such as DPID, L0-regularized downscaling, and Perceptual downscaling. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our IDA-RD in evaluating image downscaling algorithms."}}

In this paper, we propose a Multi-level Consistency Learning (MCL) framework for SSDA. Specifically, our MCL regularizes the consistency of different views of target domain samples at three levels: (i) at inter-domain level, we robustly and accurately align the source and target domains using a prototype-based optimal transport method that utilizes the pros and cons of different views of target samples; (ii) at intra-domain level, we facilitate the learning of both discriminative and compact target feature representations by proposing a novel class-wise contrastive clustering loss; (iii) at sample level, we follow standard practice and improve the prediction accuracy by conducting a consistency-based self-training. Empirically, we verified the effectiveness of our MCL framework on three popular SSDA benchmarks, i.e., VisDA2017, DomainNet, and Office-Home datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our MCL framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance."}}

Most previous works restore such missing details in the image space. To cope with the high diversity of natural images, they either rely on the unstable GANs that are difficult to train and prone to artifacts, or resort to explicit references from high-resolution (HR) images that are usually unavailable. In this work, we propose Feature Matching SR (FeMaSR), which restores realistic HR images in a much more compact feature space.

While there already exist various input modalities (e.g., voice, mid-air gesture), the diverse demands required by different input scenarios can hardly be met by the small number of fixed input postures offered by existing solutions. In this paper, we present Handwriting Velcro, a novel text input solution for AR glasses based on flexible touch sensors. The distinct advantage of our system is that it can easily stick to different body parts, thus endowing AR glasses with posture-adaptive handwriting input. We explored the design space of on-body device positions and identified the best interaction positions for various user postures. To flatten users' learning curves, we adapt our device to the established writing habits of different users by training a 36-character (i.e., A-Z, 0-9) recognition neural network in a human-in-the-loop manner. Such a personalization attempt ultimately achieves a low error rate of 0.005 on average for users with different writing styles. Subjective feedback shows that our solution has a good performance in system practicability and social acceptance. Empirically, we conducted a heuristic study to explore and identify the best interaction Position-Posture Correlation. Experimental results show that our Handwriting Velcro excels similar work [6] and commercial product in both practicality (12.3 WPM) and user-friendliness in different contexts."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel GAN latent sampling method by exploring and exploiting the hubness priors of GAN latent distributions. Our key insight is that the high dimensionality of the GAN latent space will inevitably lead to the emergence of hub latents that usually have much larger sampling densities than other latents in the latent space. As a result, these hub latents are better trained and thus contribute more to the synthesis of high-quality images. Unlike the a posterior \"cherry-picking\", our method is highly efficient as it is an a priori method that identifies high-quality latents before the synthesis of images. Furthermore, we show that the well-known but purely empirical truncation trick is a naive approximation to the central clustering effect of hub latents, which not only uncovers the rationale of the truncation trick, but also indicates the superiority and fundamentality of our method. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}
