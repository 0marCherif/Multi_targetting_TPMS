However, applying RL to safety-critical systems in the real-world is not easy as many algorithms are sample-inefficient and maximising the standard RL objective comes with no guarantees on worst-case performance. In this paper we propose approximate model-based shielding (AMBS), a principled look-ahead shielding algorithm for verifying the performance of learned RL policies w.r.t. a set of given safety constraints. Our algorithm differs from other shielding approaches in that it does not require prior knowledge of the safety-relevant dynamics of the system. We provide a strong theoretical justification for AMBS and demonstrate superior performance to other safety-aware approaches on a set of Atari games with state-dependent safety-labels."}}

In this paper, we propose a principled algorithm for safe exploration based on the concept of shielding. Previous approaches to shielding assume access to a safety-relevant abstraction of the environment or a high-fidelity simulator. Instead, our work is based on latent shielding - another approach that leverages world models to verify policy roll-outs in the latent space of a learned dynamics model. Our novel algorithm builds on this previous work, using safety critics and other additional features to improve the stability and farsightedness of the algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by running experiments on a small set of Atari games with state dependent safety labels. We present preliminary results that show our approximate shielding algorithm effectively reduces the rate of safety violations, and in some cases improves the speed of convergence and quality of the final agent."}}
