We decompose this problem into three easier subtasks, and provide candidate solutions for each of them. Inspired by the Common Fate Principle of Gestalt Psychology, we first extract (noisy) masks of moving objects via unsupervised motion segmentation. Second, generative models are trained on the masks of the background and the moving objects, respectively. Third, background and foreground models are combined in a conditional \u201cdead leaves\u201d scene model to sample novel scene configurations where occlusions and depth layering arise naturally. To evaluate the individual stages, we introduce the FISHBOWL dataset positioned between complex real-world scenes and common object-centric benchmarks of simplistic objects. We show that our approach learns generative models that generalize beyond occlusions present in the input videos and represents scenes in a modular fashion, allowing generation of plausible scenes outside the training distribution by permitting, for instance, object numbers or densities not observed during training."}}

In this work, we test this assumption by quantifying to which extent gaze on recent video saliency benchmarks can be predicted by a static baseline model. On the recent LEDOV dataset, we find that at least 75% of the explainable information as defined by a gold standard model can be explained using static features. Our baseline model \u201cDeepGaze MR\u201d even outperforms state-of-the-art video saliency models, despite deliberately ignoring all temporal patterns. Visual inspection of our static baseline\u2019s failure cases shows that clear temporal effects on human gaze placement exist, but are both rare in the dataset and not captured by any of the recent video saliency models. To focus the development of video saliency models on better capturing temporal effects we construct a meta-dataset consisting of those examples requiring temporal information."}}
