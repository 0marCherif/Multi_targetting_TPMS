The overwhelming majority of the literature focuses on small graph problems, while several real-world problems are devoted to large graphs. Here, we focus on two such problems: influence estimation, a #P-hard counting problem, and influence maximization, an NP-hard problem. We develop Glie, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that inherently parameterizes an upper bound of influence estimation and train it on small simulated graphs. Experiments show that Glie provides accurate influence estimation for real graphs up to 10 times larger than the train set. More importantly, it can be used for influence maximization on considerably larger graphs, as the predictions ranking is not affected by the drop of accuracy. We develop a version of Cost Effective Lazy Forward optimization with Glie instead of simulated influence estimation, surpassing the benchmark for influence maximization, although with a computational overhead. To balance the time complexity and quality of influence, we propose two different approaches. The first is a Q-network that learns to choose seeds sequentially using Glie's predictions. The second defines a provably submodular function based on Glie's representations to rank nodes fast while building the seed set. The latter provides the best combination of time efficiency and influence spread, outperforming SOTA benchmarks."}}

Real-time bidding (RTB) allows the automated trading of ad impressions between advertisers and publishers through real-time auctions. In order to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns, advertisers should deliver ads to the users who are highly likely to be converted (i.e., purchase, registration, website visit, etc.) in the near future. In this study, we introduce and examine different models for estimating the probability of a user converting, given their history of visited URLs. Inspired by natural language processing, we introduce three URL embedding models to compute semantically meaningful URL representations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the different proposed representation and conversion prediction models, we have conducted experiments on real logged events collected from an advertising platform."}}

Data dimensionality reduction arises as a key factor to transform and select only the most relevant features from those streams in order to reduce algorithm space and time demands. In that context, Compressed Sensing (CS) encodes an input signal into lower-dimensional space, guaranteeing its reconstruction up to some distortion factor \u03f5. This paper employs CS on data streams as a pre-processing step to support a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification algorithm, one of the most often used algorithms in the data stream mining area \u2013 all this while ensuring the key properties of CS hold. Based on topological properties, we show that our classification algorithm also preserves the neighborhood (withing an \u03f5 factor) of kNN after reducing the stream dimensionality with CS. As a consequence, end-users can set an acceptable error margin while performing such projections for kNN. For further improvements, we incorporate this method into an ensemble classifier, Leveraging Bagging, by combining a set of different CS matrices which increases the diversity inside the ensemble. An extensive set of experiments is performed on various datasets, and the results were compared against those yielded by current state-of-the-art approaches, confirming the good performance of our approaches."}}

Having algorithms that optimize the presence and message diffusion on social media is indeed crucial to all actors (media companies, political parties, corporations, etc.) who advertise on the Web. Motivated by the need for effective viral marketing strategies, influence estimation and influence maximization have therefore become important research problems, leading to a plethora of methods. However, the majority of these methods are non-adaptive, and therefore not appropriate for scenarios in which influence campaigns may be ran and observed over multiple rounds, nor for scenarios which cannot assume full knowledge over the diffusion networks and the ways information spreads in them. In this tutorial we intend to present the recent research on adaptive influence maximization,which aims to address these limitations. This can be seen as a particular case of the influence maximization problem (seeds in a social graph are selected to maximize information spread), one in which the decisions are taken as the influence campaign unfolds, over multiple rounds, and where knowledge about the graph topology and the influence process may be partial or even entirely missing. This setting, depending on the underlying assumptions, leads to variate and original approaches and algorithmic techniques, as we have witnessed in recent literature. We will review the most relevant research in this area, by organizing it along several key dimensions, and by discussing the methods' advantages and shortcomings, along with open research questions and the practical aspects of their implementation. Tutorial slides will become publicly available on https://sites.google.com/view/aim-tutorial/home."}}

An online variant of BLSPI has been also proposed, called randomised BLSPI (RBLSPI), that improves its policy based on an incomplete policy evaluation step. In online setting, the exploration-exploitation dilemma should be addressed as we try to discover the optimal policy by using samples collected by ourselves. RBLSPI exploits the advantage of BLSTD to quantify our uncertainty about the value function. Inspired by Thompson sampling, RBLSPI first samples a value function from a posterior distribution over value functions, and then selects actions based on the sampled value function. The effectiveness and the exploration abilities of RBLSPI are demonstrated experimentally in several environments."}}

A broad selection of efficient learning algorithms exists which may be applied to data streams, but they typically do not take into account the temporal nature of the data. We motivate and design a method which creates an efficient representation of a data stream, where temporal information is embedded into each instance via the error space of forecasting models. Unlike many other methods in the literature, our approach can be rapidly initialized and does not require iterations over the full data sequence, thus it is suitable for a streaming scenario. This allows the application of off-the-shelf data-stream methods, depending on the application domain. In this paper, we investigate classification. We compare to a large variety of methods (auto-encoders, HMMs, basis functions, clustering methodologies, and PCA) and find that our proposed methods perform very competitively, and offers much promise for future work."}}

As adaptive decision making is a time-critical task, a realistic feedback model has been considered, called myopic. In this direction, we propose the myopic adaptive greedy policy that is guaranteed to provide a (1 - 1/e) -approximation of the optimal policy under a variant of the independent cascade diffusion model. This strategy maximizes an alternative utility function that has been proven to be adaptive monotone and adaptive submodular. The proposed utility function considers the cumulative number of active nodes through the time, instead of the total number of the active nodes at the end of the diffusion. Our empirical analysis on real-world social networks reveals the benefits of the proposed myopic strategy, validating our theoretical results."}}

In this paper, we apply a greedy variable selection algorithm, called Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, for the text classification task. We also extend standard group OMP by introducing overlapping Group OMP to handle overlapping groups of features. Empirical analysis verifies that both OMP and overlapping GOMP constitute powerful regularizers, able to produce effective and very sparse models.
