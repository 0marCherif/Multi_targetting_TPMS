We consider a specific case of this: approximating the function space distance (FSD) over the training set, i.e. the average distance between the outputs of two neural networks. We propose an efficient approximation to FSD for ReLU neural networks based on approximating the architecture as a linear network with stochastic gating. Despite requiring only one parameter per unit of the network, our approach outcompetes other parametric approximations with larger memory requirements. Applied to continual learning, our parametric approximation is competitive with state-of-the-art nonparametric approximations which require storing many training examples. Furthermore, we show its efficacy in influence function estimation, allowing influence functions to be accurately estimated without iterating over the full dataset."}}

Because of their versatility in downstream applications, they are increasingly used as a service exposed via public APIs. At the same time, these encoder models are particularly vulnerable to model stealing attacks due to the high dimensionality of vector representations they output. Yet, encoders remain undefended: existing mitigation strategies for stealing attacks focus on supervised learning. We introduce a new dataset inference defense, which uses the private training set of the victim encoder model to attribute its ownership in the event of stealing. The intuition is that the log-likelihood of an encoder's output representations is higher on the victim's training data than on test data if it is stolen from the victim, but not if it is independently trained. We compute this log-likelihood using density estimation models. As part of our evaluation, we also propose measuring the fidelity of stolen encoders and quantifying the effectiveness of the theft detection without involving downstream tasks; instead, we leverage mutual information and distance measurements. Our extensive empirical results in the vision domain demonstrate that dataset inference is a promising direction for defending self-supervised models against model stealing."}}

However, this assumption is violated in almost all practical applications: machine learning systems are regularly tested under distribution shift, due to changing temporal correlations, atypical end users, or other factors. In this work, we consider the problem setting of domain generalization, where the training data are structured into domains and there may be multiple test time shifts, corresponding to new domains or domain distributions. Most prior methods aim to learn a single robust model or invariant feature space that performs well on all domains. In contrast, we aim to learn models that adapt at test time to domain shift using unlabeled test points. Our primary contribution is to introduce the framework of adaptive risk minimization (ARM), in which models are directly optimized for effective adaptation to shift by learning to adapt on the training domains. Compared to prior methods for robustness, invariance, and adaptation, ARM methods provide performance gains of 1-4% test accuracy on a number of image classification problems exhibiting domain shift."}}

However, this assumption is violated in almost all practical applications: machine learning systems are regularly tested under distribution shift, due to temporal correlations, particular end users, or other factors. In this work, we consider the setting where the training data are structured into groups and test time shifts correspond to changes in the group distribution. Prior work has approached this problem by attempting to be robust to all possible test time distributions, which may degrade average performance. In contrast, we propose to use ideas from meta-learning to learn models that are adaptable, such that they can adapt to shift at test time using a batch of unlabeled test points. We acquire such models by learning to adapt to training batches sampled according to different distributions, which simulate structural shifts that may occur at test time. Our primary contribution is to introduce the framework of adaptive risk minimization (ARM), a formalization of this setting that lends itself to meta-learning. We develop meta-learning methods for solving the ARM problem, and compared to a variety of prior methods, these methods provide substantial gains on image classification problems in the presence of shift."}}
