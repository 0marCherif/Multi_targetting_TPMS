A major cause of model unfairness is the imbalanced representation of different groups in training data. Recently, several works aim to alleviate this issue using generated data. However, these approaches often use generated data to obtain similar amounts of data across groups, which is not optimal for achieving high fairness due to different learning difficulties and generated data qualities across groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel adaptive sampling approach that leverages both real and generated data for fairness. We design a bilevel optimization that finds the optimal data sampling ratios among groups and between real and generated data while training a model. The ratios are dynamically adjusted considering both the model's accuracy as well as its fairness. To efficiently solve our non-convex bilevel optimization, we propose a simple approximation to the solution given by the implicit function theorem. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy on the CelebA and ImageNet People Subtree datasets. We also observe that our method adaptively relies less on the generated data when it has poor quality."}}

While many techniques for model fairness have been proposed, most of them assume that the training and deployment data distributions are identical, which is often not true in practice. In particular, when the bias between labels and sensitive groups changes, the fairness of the trained model is directly influenced and can worsen. We make two contributions for solving this problem. First, we analytically show that existing in-processing fair algorithms have fundamental limits in accuracy and fairness. We introduce the notion of correlation shifts, which can explicitly capture the change of the above bias. Second, we propose a novel pre-processing step that samples the input data to reduce correlation shifts and thus enables the in-processing approaches to overcome their limitations. We formulate an optimization problem for adjusting the data ratio among labels and sensitive groups to reflect the shifted correlation. A key advantage of our approach lies in decoupling the roles of pre-processing and in-processing approaches: correlation adjustment via pre-processing and unfairness mitigation on the processed data via in-processing. Experiments show that our framework effectively improves existing in-processing fair algorithms w.r.t. accuracy and fairness, both on synthetic and real datasets."}}

In this work, we propose a sample selection-based algorithm for fair and robust training. To this end, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem for the unbiased selection of samples in the presence of data corruption. Observing that solving this optimization problem is strongly NP-hard, we propose a greedy algorithm that is efficient and effective in practice. Experiments show that our method obtains fairness and robustness that are better than or comparable to the state-of-the-art technique, both on synthetic and benchmark real datasets. Moreover, unlike other fair and robust training baselines, our algorithm can be used by only modifying the sampling step in batch selection without changing the training algorithm or leveraging additional clean data."}}

Many companies that deploy AI publicly state that when training a model, we not only need to improve its accuracy, but also need to guarantee that the model does not discriminate against users (fairness), is resilient to noisy or poisoned data (robustness), is explainable, and more. In addition, these objectives are not only relevant to model training, but to all steps of end-to-end machine learning, which include data collection, data cleaning and validation, model training, model evaluation, and model management and serving. Finally, responsible AI is conceptually challenging, and supporting all the objectives must be as easy as possible. We thus propose three key research directions towards this vision - depth, breadth, and usability - to measure progress and introduce our ongoing research. First, responsible AI must be deeply supported where multiple objectives like fairness and robust must be handled together. To this end, we propose FR-Train, a holistic framework for fair and robust model training in the presence of data bias and poisoning. Second, responsible AI must be broadly supported, preferably in all steps of machine learning. Currently we focus on the data pre-processing steps and propose Slice Tuner, a selective data acquisition framework for training fair and accurate models, and MLClean, a data cleaning framework that also improves fairness and robustness. Finally, responsible AI must be usable where the techniques must be easy to deploy and actionable. We propose FairBatch, a batch selection approach for fairness that is effective and simple to use, and Slice Finder, a model evaluation tool that automatically finds problematic slices. We believe we scratched the surface of responsible AI for end-to-end machine learning and suggest research challenges moving forward."}}

There are largely two reasons data collection has recently become a critical issue. First, as machine learning is becoming more widely-used, we are seeing new applications that do not necessarily have enough labeled data. Second, unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning techniques automatically generate features, which saves feature engineering costs, but in return may require larger amounts of labeled data. Interestingly, recent research in data collection comes not only from the machine learning, natural language, and computer vision communities, but also from the data management community due to the importance of handling large amounts of data. In this survey, we perform a comprehensive study of data collection from a data management point of view. Data collection largely consists of data acquisition, data labeling, and improvement of existing data or models. We provide a research landscape of these operations, provide guidelines on which technique to use when, and identify interesting research challenges. The integration of machine learning and data management for data collection is part of a larger trend of Big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration and opens many opportunities for new research."}}

Traditionally, the two topics have been studied by different communities for different applications. Robust training is designed for noisy or poisoned data where image data is typically considered. In comparison, fair training primarily deals with biased data where structured data is typically considered. Nevertheless, robust training and fair training are fundamentally similar in considering that both of them aim at fixing the inherent flaws of real-world data. In this tutorial, we first cover state-of-the-art robust training techniques where most of the research is on combating various label noises. In particular, we cover label noise modeling, robust training approaches, and real-world noisy data sets. Then, proceeding to the related fairness literature, we discuss pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing unfairness mitigation techniques, depending on whether the mitigation occurs before, during, or after the model training. Finally, we cover the recent trend emerged to combine robust and fair training in two flavors: the former is to make the fair training more robust (i.e., robust fair training), and the latter is to consider robustness and fairness as two equals to incorporate them into a holistic framework. This tutorial is indeed timely and novel because the convergence of the two topics is increasingly common, but yet to be addressed in tutorials. The tutors have extensive experience publishing papers in top-tier machine learning and data mining venues and developing machine learning platforms."}}
