Recent works have parameterized the Hamiltonian by machine learning models (e.g., neural networks), allowing Hamiltonian dynamics to be obtained from state trajectories without explicit mathematical modeling. However, the performance of existing models is limited as we can observe only noisy and sparse trajectories in practice. This paper proposes a probabilistic model that can learn the dynamics of conservative or dissipative systems from noisy and sparse data. We introduce a Gaussian process that incorporates the symplectic geometric structure of Hamiltonian systems, which is used as a prior distribution for estimating Hamiltonian systems with additive dissipation. We then present its spectral representation, Symplectic Spectrum Gaussian Processes (SSGPs), for which we newly derive random Fourier features with symplectic structures. This allows us to construct an efficient variational inference algorithm for training the models while simulating the dynamics via ordinary differential equation solvers. Experiments on several physical systems show that SSGP offers excellent performance in predicting dynamics that follow the energy conservation or dissipation law from noisy and sparse data."}}

Although Gaussian processes (GPs), or kriging, have been successfully used for spatial regression, they require many observations in the target task to achieve a high predictive performance. Our model is trained using spatial datasets on various attributes in various regions, and predicts values on unseen attributes in unseen regions given a few observed data. With our model, a task representation is inferred from given small data using a neural network. Then, spatial values are predicted by neural networks with a GP framework, in which task-specific properties are controlled by the task representations. The GP framework allows us to analytically obtain predictions that are adapted to small data. By using the adapted predictions in the objective function, we can train our model efficiently and effectively so that the test predictive performance improves when adapted to newly given small data. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better predictive performance than existing meta-learning methods using spatial datasets."}}

The aggregate data are associated not with points but with supports (e.g., spatial regions in a city). Since the supports may have various granularities depending on attributes (e.g., poverty rate and crime rate), modeling such data is not straightforward. This article offers a multi-output Gaussian process (MoGP) model that infers functions for attributes using multiple aggregate datasets of respective granularities. In the proposed model, the function for each attribute is assumed to be a dependent GP modeled as a linear mixing of independent latent GPs. We design an observation model with an aggregation process for each attribute; the process is an integral of the GP over the corresponding support. We also introduce a prior distribution of the mixing weights, which allows a knowledge transfer across domains (e.g., cities) by sharing the prior. This is advantageous in such a situation where the spatially aggregated dataset in a city is too coarse to interpolate; the proposed model can still make accurate predictions of attributes by utilizing aggregate datasets in other cities. The inference of the proposed model is based on variational Bayes, which enables one to learn the model parameters using the aggregate datasets from multiple domains. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms in the task of refining coarse-grained aggregate data on real-world datasets: Time series of air pollutants in Beijing and various kinds of spatial datasets from New York City and Chicago."}}

Predicting such events and revealing the underlying triggering patterns are a crucial task for many applications, ranging from disease control to global politics. Traditional event prediction models based on Hawkes processes capture the spatio-temporal relationships between events, but cannot incorporate complex and heterogeneous external features, including population distribution, weather and terrain. This paper proposes an event prediction method that effectively utilizes the rich external information present in sets of unstructured data (e.g., map images, satellite images and weather map). Specifically, we extend a convolutional neural network (CNN) by combining it with continuous kernel convolution; and design the conditional intensity of Hawkes process based on the extended neural network model that accepts images as its input. Our approach of using the continuous convolution kernel provides a flexible way to discover the complex effect of external factors on the triggering process, as well as yielding tractable optimization algorithms. We use real-world event data from different domains (i.e., disease outbreaks, armed conflicts and protests) to demonstrate that the proposed method has better prediction performance than existing methods."}}

Hawkes processes offer a central tool for modeling the diffusion processes, in which the influence from the past events is described by the triggering kernel. However, the triggering kernel parameters, which govern how each community is influenced by the past events, are assumed to be static over time. In the real world, the diffusion processes depend not only on the influences from the past, but also the current (time-evolving) states of the communities, e.g., people's awareness of the disease and people's current interests.

Location information is often aggregated due to privacy and/or cost concerns. The aggregated data we use as input consist of the numbers of incoming and outgoing people at each location and at each time step. Since the aggregated data lack tracking information of individuals, determining the flow of people between locations is not straightforward. In this article, we address the problem of inferring latent people flows, that is, transition populations between locations, from just aggregated population data gathered from observed locations. Existing models assume that everyone is always in one of the observed locations at every time step; this, however, is an unrealistic assumption, because we do not always have a large enough number of sensor devices to cover the large-scale spaces targeted. To overcome this drawback, we propose a probabilistic model with flow conservation constraints that incorporate travel duration distributions between observed locations. To handle noisy settings, we adopt noisy observation models for the numbers of incoming and outgoing people, where the noise is regarded as a factor that may disturb flow conservation, e.g., people may appear in or disappear from the predefined space of interest. We develop an approximate expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that simultaneously estimates transition populations and model parameters. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on real-world datasets of pedestrian data in exhibition halls, bike trip data and taxi trip data in New York City."}}

In previous studies, OT has been defined as the minimum cost to transport probability mass from one probability distribution to another. In this study, we propose a new framework in which OT is considered as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution of a probabilistic generative model. With the proposed framework, we show that OT with entropic regularization is equivalent to maximizing a posterior probability of a probabilistic model called Collective Graphical Model (CGM), which describes aggregated statistics of multiple samples generated from a graphical model. Interpreting OT as a MAP solution of a CGM has the following two advantages: (i) We can calculate the discrepancy between noisy histograms by modeling noise distributions. Since various distributions can be used for noise modeling, it is possible to select the noise distribution flexibly to suit the situation. (ii) We can construct a new method for interpolation between histograms, which is an important application of OT. The proposed method allows for intuitive modeling based on the probabilistic interpretations, and a simple and efficient estimation algorithm is available. Experiments using synthetic and real-world spatio-temporal population datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed interpolation method."}}

Unfortunately, existing approaches fail to offer exact MAP inferences, only approximate versions, and take a lot of computation time when applied to large scale problems. In this paper, we propose an exact and efficient method for MAP inference in CFDM. Our key idea is formulating the MAP inference problem as a combinatorial optimization problem called Minimum Convex Cost Flow Problem (C-MCFP) with no approximation or continuous relaxation. On the basis of this formulation, we propose an efficient inference method that employs the C-MCFP algorithm as a subroutine. Our experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed method is effective both in single MAP inference and people flow estimation with EM algorithm."}}
