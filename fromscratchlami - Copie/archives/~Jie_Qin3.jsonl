We find that existing knowledge distillation techniques pay more attention to pixel-level concepts from labeled data, which fails to take more informative cues within unlabeled data into account. Consequently, we offer the first attempt to provide lightweight SSSS models via a novel multi-granularity distillation (MGD) scheme, where multi-granularity is captured from three aspects: i) complementary teacher structure; ii) labeled-unlabeled data cooperative distillation; iii) hierarchical and multi-levels loss setting. Specifically, MGD is formulated as a labeled-unlabeled data cooperative distillation scheme, which helps to take full advantage of diverse data characteristics that are essential in the semi-supervised setting. Image-level semantic-sensitive loss, region-level content-aware loss, and pixel-level consistency loss are set up to enrich hierarchical distillation abstraction via structurally complementary teachers. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC2012 and Cityscapes reveal that MGD can outperform the competitive approaches by a large margin under diverse partition protocols. For example, the performance of ResNet-18 and MobileNet-v2 backbone is boosted by 11.5% and 4.6% respectively under 1/16 partition protocol on Cityscapes. Although the FLOPs of the model backbone is compressed by 3.4-5.3x (ResNet-18) and 38.7-59.6x (MobileNetv2), the model manages to achieve satisfactory segmentation results."}}

Most existing methods resort to classification-based Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to play as the initial pseudo labels, which tend to focus on the discriminative image regions and lack customized characteristics for the segmentation task. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel activation modulation and recalibration (AMR) scheme, which leverages a spotlight branch and a compensation branch to obtain weighted CAMs that can provide recalibration supervision and task-specific concepts. Specifically, an attention modulation module (AMM) is employed to rearrange the distribution of feature importance from the channel-spatial sequential perspective, which helps to explicitly model channel-wise interdependencies and spatial encodings to adaptively modulate segmentation-oriented activation responses. Furthermore, we introduce a cross pseudo supervision for dual branches, which can be regarded as a semantic similar regularization to mutually refine two branches. Extensive experiments show that AMR establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, surpassing not only current methods trained with the image-level of supervision but also some methods relying on stronger supervision, such as saliency label. Experiments also reveal that our scheme is plug-and-play and can be incorporated with other approaches to boost their performance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jieqin-ai/AMR."}}

Recent data mixing based augmentation strategies have achieved great success. Especially, CutMix uses a simple but effective method to improve the classifiers by randomly cropping a patch from one image and pasting it on another image. To further promote the performance of CutMix, a series of works explore to use the saliency information of the image to guide the mixing. We systematically study the importance of the saliency information for mixing data, and find that the saliency information is not so necessary for promoting the augmentation performance. Furthermore, we find that the cutting based data mixing methods carry two problems of label misallocation and object information missing, which cannot be resolved simultaneously. We propose a more effective but very easily implemented method, namely ResizeMix. We mix the data by directly resizing the source image to a small patch and paste it on another image. The obtained patch preserves more substantial object information compared with conventional cut-based methods. ResizeMix shows evident advantages over CutMix and the saliency-guided methods on both image classification and object detection tasks without additional computation cost, which even outperforms most costly search-based automatic augmentation methods."}}
