To classify query instances from novel classes encountered at test-time, they only require a support set composed of a few labelled samples. FSL benchmarks commonly assume that those queries come from the same distribution as instances in the support set. However, in a realistic set-ting, data distribution is plausibly subject to change, a situation referred to as Distribution Shift (DS). The present work addresses the new and challenging problem of Few-Shot Learning under Support/Query Shift (FSQS) i.e., when support and query instances are sampled from related but different distributions. Our contributions are the following. First, we release a testbed for FSQS, including datasets, relevant baselines and a protocol for a rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Second, we observe that well-established FSL algorithms unsurprisingly suffer from a considerable drop in accuracy when facing FSQS, stressing the significance of our study. Finally, we show that transductive algorithms can limit the inopportune effect of DS. In particular, we study both the role of Batch-Normalization and Optimal Transport (OT) in aligning distributions, bridging Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with FSL. This results in a new method that efficiently combines OT with the celebrated Prototypical Networks. We bring compelling experiments demonstrating the advantage of our method. Our work opens an exciting line of research by providing a testbed and strong baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/ebennequin/meta-domain-shift."}}

If domain invariant representations have dramatically improved the adaptability of models, to guarantee their good transferability remains a challenging problem. This paper addresses this problem by using active learning to annotate a small budget of target data. Although this setup, called Active Domain Adaptation (ADA), deviates from UDA's standard setup, a wide range of practical applications are faced with this situation. To this purpose, we introduce \\textit{Stochastic Adversarial Gradient Embedding} (SAGE), a framework that makes a triple contribution to ADA. First, we select for annotation target samples that are likely to improve the representations' transferability by measuring the variation, before and after annotation, of the transferability loss gradient. Second, we increase sampling diversity by promoting different gradient directions. Third, we introduce a novel training procedure for actively incorporating target samples when learning invariant representations. SAGE is based on solid theoretical ground and validated on various UDA benchmarks against several baselines. Our empirical investigation demonstrates that SAGE takes the best of uncertainty \\textit{vs} diversity samplings and improves representations transferability substantially."}}

By investigating the robustness of such methods under the prism of the cluster assumption, we bring new evidence that invariance with a low source risk does not guarantee a well-performing target classifier. More precisely, we show that the cluster assumption is violated in the target domain despite being maintained in the source domain, indicating a lack of robustness of the target classifier. To address this problem, we demonstrate the importance of enforcing the cluster assumption in the target domain, named Target Consistency (TC), especially when paired with Class-Level InVariance (CLIV). Our new approach results in a significant improvement, on both image classification and segmentation benchmarks, over state-of-the-art methods based on invariant representations. Importantly, our method is flexible and easy to implement, making it a complementary technique to existing approaches for improving transferability of representations."}}

Such resources may not be available in many practical cases, limiting the adoption and the application of many deep learning methods. In a search for more data-efficient deep learning methods to overcome the need for large annotated datasets, there is a rising research interest in semi-supervised learning and its applications to deep neural networks to reduce the amount of labeled data required, by either developing novel methods or adopting existing semi-supervised learning frameworks for a deep learning setting. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of deep semi-supervised learning, starting with an introduction to the field, followed by a summarization of the dominant semi-supervised approaches in deep learning."}}

In PR trees, an observation is associated to all regions of a tree through a probability distribution that reflects how far the observation is to a region. We show that such trees are consistent, meaning that their error tends to 0 when the sample size tends to infinity, a property that has not been established for similar, previous proposals as Soft trees and Smooth Transition Regression trees. We further explain how PR trees can be used in different ensemble methods, namely Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees. Lastly, we assess their performance through extensive experiments that illustrate their benefits in terms of performance, interpretability and robustness to noise."}}
