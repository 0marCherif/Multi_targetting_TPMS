Each buyer is interested in exactly one pair of items and purchases this pair if and only if, upon arrival, both items are still available and the sum of the item prices does not exceed the budget. The goal of the seller is to set prices to the items such that the number of transactions is maximized when buyers arrive in adversarial order. Formally, we are given an undirected graph where vertices represent items and edges represent buyers. Once prices are set to the vertices, edges with a total price exceeding the buyers' budgets are evicted. Any arrival order of the buyers leads to a set of transactions that forms a maximal matching in this subgraph, and an adversarial arrival order results in a minimum maximal matching. In order to measure the performance of a pricing strategy, we compare the size of such a matching to the size of a maximum matching in the original graph. It was shown by Correa et al. [IPCO 2022] that the best ratio any pricing strategy can guarantee lies within $[1/2, 2/3]$. Our contribution to the problem is two-fold: First, we provide several characterizations of subgraphs that may result from pricing schemes. Second, building upon these, we show an improved upper bound of $3/5$ and a lower bound of $1/2 + 2/n$, where $n$ is the number of items."}}

The size of our matching is more important than node preferences\u2013thus, we are interested in maximum matchings only. Any pair of maximum matchings in G (equivalently, perfect matchings or assignments) can be compared by holding a head-to-head election between them where agents are voters. The goal is to compute an assignment such that there is no better or \u201cmore popular\u201d assignment. This is the popular assignment problem and it generalizes the well-studied popular matching problem (Abraham et al., 2007). Popular assignments need not exist in every input instance. We show a polynomial-time algorithm that decides if the given instance admits one or not, and computes one, if so. In instances with no popular assignment, we consider the problem of finding an almost popular assignment, i.e., an assignment with minimum unpopularity margin. We show an O\u2217 (|E|k) time algorithm for deciding if there exists an assignment with unpopularity margin at most k. We then show that this algorithm is essentially optimal by proving that the problem is NP-complete and Wl[1]-hard with parameter k. We also consider the minimum-cost popular assignment problem when there are edge costs, and show this problem to be NP-hard. This hardness holds even when all edge costs are in {0,1} and agents have strict preferences. By contrast, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to the problem of deciding if there exists a popular assignment with a given set of forced/forbidden edges (this tractability holds even for partially ordered preferences). Our algorithms are combinatorial and based on LP duality. They search for an appropriate witness or dual certificate, and when a certificate cannot be found, we prove that the desired assignment does not exist in G."}}

We consider a generalization of the standard liquid democracy setting by allowing agents to specify multiple potential delegates, together with a preference ranking among them. This generalization increases the number of possible delegation paths and enables higher participation rates because fewer votes are lost due to delegation cycles or abstaining agents. In order to implement this generalization of liquid democracy, we need to find a principled way of choosing between multiple delegation paths. In this paper, we provide a thorough axiomatic analysis of the space of delegation rules, i.e., functions assigning a feasible delegation path to each delegating agent. In particular, we prove axiomatic characterizations as well as an impossibility result for delegation rules. We also analyze requirements on delegation rules that have been suggested by practitioners, and introduce novel rules with attractive properties. By performing an extensive experimental analysis on synthetic as well as real-world data, we compare delegation rules with respect to several quantitative criteria relating to the chosen paths and the resulting distribution of voting power. Our experiments reveal that delegation rules can be aligned on a spectrum reflecting an inherent trade-off between competing objectives."}}

A well-studied concept of proportionality in this context is the justified representation (JR) axiom, which demands that no large cohesive group of voters remains unrepresented. However, the JR axiom may conflict with other desiderata, such as coverage (maximizing the number of voters who approve at least one committee member) or social welfare (maximizing the number of approvals obtained by committee members). In this work, we investigate the impact of imposing the JR axiom (as well as the more demanding EJR axiom) on social welfare and coverage. Our approach is threefold: we derive worst-case bounds on the loss of welfare/coverage that is caused by imposing JR, study the computational complexity of finding 'good' committees that provide JR (obtaining a hardness result, an approximation algorithm, and an exact algorithm for one-dimensional preferences), and examine this setting empirically on several synthetic datasets."}}

Not only does a JR committee always exist, but previous work has also shown through experiments that the JR condition can typically be fulfilled by groups of fewer than k candidates, where k is the target size of the committee. In this paper, we study such groups\u2014known as n/k-justifying groups\u2014both theoretically and empirically. First, we show that under the impartial culture model, n/k-justifying groups of size less than k/2 are likely to exist, which implies that the number of JR committees is usually large. We then present efficient approximation algorithms that compute a small n/k-justifying group for any given instance, and a polynomial-time exact algorithm when the instance admits a tree representation. In addition, we demonstrate that small n/k-justifying groups can often be useful for obtaining a gender-balanced JR committee even though the problem is NP-hard."}}

The preferences of a node extend naturally to preferences over branchings, i.e., directed forests; a branching B is popular if B does not lose a head-to-head election (where nodes cast votes) against any branching. Such popular branchings have a natural application in liquid democracy. The popular branching problem is to decide if G admits a popular branching or not. We give a characterization of popular branchings in terms of dual certificates and use this characterization to design an efficient combinatorial algorithm for the popular branching problem. When preferences are weak rankings, we use our characterization to formulate the popular branching polytope in the original space and also show that our algorithm can be modified to compute a branching with least unpopularity margin.

For the stochastic setting, we provide a reduction to the classical dueling bandits setting, yielding an algorithm that identifies a Condorcet winning team within $\\mathcal{O}((n + k \\log (k)) \\frac{\\max(\\log\\log n, \\log k)}{\\Delta^2})$ duels, where $\\Delta$ is a gap parameter.
