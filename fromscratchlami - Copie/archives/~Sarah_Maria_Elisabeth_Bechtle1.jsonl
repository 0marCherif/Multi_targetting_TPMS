These capabilities are, at least partially, a result of humans having internal models of their bodies and any grasped object. How to learn such body representations for robots remains an open problem. In this work, we present a self-supervised learning approach that extends a robot's kinematic model for object manipulation from visual latent representations. Our framework comprises two components: First, we present our multimodal keypoint detector: A neural network autoencoder architecture that fuses proprioception and vision during learning to predict visual key points on an object; second, we show how we can learn an extension of the kinematic chain of the robot by regressing virtual joints from the visual keypoints predicted by our multimodal keypoint detector. Our evaluation shows that our approach learns to consistently predict visual keypoints on objects in the manipulator's hand and, thus, can easily facilitate learning an extended kinematic chain to include the object grasped in various configurations, from a few seconds of visual data. Finally, we show that this extended kinematic chain lends itself for object manipulation tasks such as placing a grasped object and present experiments in simulation and on hardware."}}

However, learning representations that generalize quickly to new scenarios is still an open research problem in reinforcement learning. In this paper we present a framework to meta-learn the critic for gradient-based policy learning. Concretely, we propose a model-based bi-level optimization algorithm that updates the critics parameters such that the policy that is learned with the updated critic gets closer to solving the meta-training tasks. We illustrate that our algorithm leads to learned critics that resemble the ground truth Q function for a given task. Finally, after meta-training, the learned critic can be used to learn new policies for new unseen task and environment settings via model-free policy gradient optimization, without requiring a model. We present results that show the generalization capabilities of our learned critic to new tasks and dynamics when used to learn a new policy in a new scenario."}}

Yet the notion of generality for learnt costs is often evaluated in terms of robustness to various spatial perturbations only, assuming deployment at fixed speeds of execution. However, this is impractical in the context of robotics and building, time-invariant solutions is of crucial importance. In this work, we propose a formulation that allows us to 1) vary the length of execution by learning time-invariant costs, and 2) relax the temporal alignment requirements for learning from demonstration. We apply our method to two different types of cost formulations and evaluate their performance in the context of learning reward functions for simulated placement and peg in hole tasks executed on a 7DoF Kuka IIWA arm. Our results show that our approach enables learning temporally invariant rewards from misaligned demonstration that can also generalise spatially to out of distribution tasks."}}

We develop a pipeline for \u201cmeta-training\u201d such loss functions, targeted at maximizing the performance of the model trained under them. The loss landscape produced by our learned losses significantly improves upon the original task-specific losses in both supervised and reinforcement learning tasks. Furthermore, we show that our meta-learning framework is flexible enough to incorporate additional information at meta-train time. This information shapes the learned loss function such that the environment does not need to provide this information during meta-test time.
