Meanwhile, publishing those models trained on sensitive datasets, such as medical records, could pose serious privacy concerns. To counter these issues, one of the current state-of-the-art approaches is the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles, or PATE, which achieved promising results in preserving the utility of the model while providing a strong privacy guarantee. PATE combines an ensemble of \"teacher models\" trained on sensitive data and transfers the knowledge to a \"student\" model through the noisy aggregation of teachers' votes for labeling unlabeled public data which the student model will be trained on. However, the knowledge or voted labels learned by the student are noisy due to private aggregation. Learning directly from noisy labels can significantly impact the accuracy of the student model. In this paper, we propose the PATE++ mechanism, which combines the current advanced noisy label training mechanisms with the original PATE framework to enhance its accuracy. A novel structure of Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) is developed in order to integrate them effectively. In addition, we develop a novel noisy label detection mechanism for semi-supervised model training to further improve student model performance when training with noisy labels. We evaluate our method on Fashion-MNIST and SVHN to show the improvements on the original PATE on all measures."}}

Despite the superior performance of GNNs in learning graph representations, serious privacy concerns have been raised for the trained models which could expose the sensitive information of graphs. We conduct the first formal study of training GNN models to ensure utility while satisfying the rigorous node-level differential privacy considering the private information of both node features and edges. We adopt the training framework utilizing personalized PageRank to decouple the message-passing process from feature aggregation during training GNN models and propose differentially private PageRank algorithms to protect graph topology information formally. Furthermore, we analyze the privacy degradation caused by the sampling process dependent on the differentially private PageRank results during model training and propose a differentially private GNN (DPGNN) algorithm to further protect node features and achieve rigorous node-level differential privacy. Extensive experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for providing node-level differential privacy while preserving good model utility."}}

To extract meaningful medical concepts (i.e., phenotypes) from such higher-arity relational healthcare data, tensor factorization has been proven to be an effective approach and received increasing research attention, due to their intrinsic capability to represent the high-dimensional data. Recently, federated learning offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for collaborative learning among different entities, which seemingly provides an ideal potential to further enhance the tensor factorization-based collaborative phenotyping to handle sensitive personal health data. However, existing attempts to federated tensor factorization come with various limitations, including restrictions to the classic tensor factorization, high communication cost and reduced accuracy. We propose a communication efficient federated generalized tensor factorization, which is flexible enough to choose from a variate of losses to best suit different types of data in practice. We design a three-level communication reduction strategy tailored to the generalized tensor factorization, which is able to reduce the uplink communication cost up to 99.90%. In addition, we theoretically prove that our algorithm does not compromise convergence speed despite the aggressive communication compression. Extensive experiments on two real-world electronics health record datasets demonstrate the efficiency improvements in terms of computation and communication cost."}}

While the excess risks are extensively studied for convex optimization, they are rarely studied for nonconvex optimization, especially the expected population risk. For the convex case, recent studies show that it is possible for private optimization to achieve the same order of excess population risk as to the nonprivate optimization under certain conditions. It still remains an open question for the nonconvex case whether such ideal excess population risk is achievable. In this paper, we progress towards an affirmative answer to this open problem: DP nonconvex optimization is indeed capable of achieving the same excess population risk as to the nonprivate algorithm in most common parameter regimes, under certain conditions (i.e., well-conditioned nonconvexity). We achieve such improved utility rates compared to existing results by designing and analyzing the stagewise DP-SGD with early momentum algorithm. We obtain both excess empirical risk and excess population risk to achieve differential privacy. Our algorithm also features the first known results of excess and population risks for DP-SGD with momentum. Experiment results on both shallow and deep neural networks when respectively applied to simple and complex real datasets corroborate the theoretical results."}}

The tensor representation can be used to capture the correlation between space and time and simultaneously exploit the latent structure of the spatial and temporal patterns in an unsupervised fashion. However, the increasing volume of spatio-temporal data has made it prohibitively expensive to store and analyze using tensor factorization. In this paper, we propose SkeTenSmooth, a novel tensor factorization framework that uses adaptive sampling to compress the tensor in a temporally streaming fashion and preserves the underlying global structure. SkeTenSmooth adaptively samples incoming tensor slices according to the detected data dynamics. Thus, the sketches are more representative and informative of the tensor dynamic patterns. In addition, we propose a robust tensor factorization method that can deal with the sketched tensor and recover the original patterns. Experiments on the New York City Yellow Taxi data show that SkeTenSmooth greatly reduces the memory cost and outperforms random sampling and fixed rate sampling method in terms of retaining the underlying patterns."}}
