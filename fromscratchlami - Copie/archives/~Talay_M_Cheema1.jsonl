Most previous approaches have either\nassumed independence between the posterior dynamics and latent states (the mean-field (MF) approximation), or optimised free parameters for\nboth, leading to limited scalability. We use our\nframework to prove that (i) there is a theoretical\nimperative to use non-MF approaches, to avoid\nexcessive bias in the process noise hyperparameter estimate, and (ii) we can parameterise only\nthe posterior dynamics without any less of performance. Our approach suggests further approximations, based on the existing rich literature on filtering and smoothing for nonlinear systems, and\nunifies approaches for discrete and continuous\ntime models."}}
