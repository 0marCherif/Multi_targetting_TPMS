In this paper, we try to understand FSL by exploring two key questions: (1) How to quantify the relationship between \\emph{ training} and \\emph{novel} tasks? (2) How does the relationship affect the \\emph{adaptation difficulty} on novel tasks for different models? To answer the first question, we propose Task Attribute Distance (TAD) as a metric to quantify the task relatedness via attributes. Unlike other metrics, TAD is independent of models, making it applicable to different FSL models. To address the second question, we utilize TAD metric to establish a theoretical connection between task relatedness and task adaptation difficulty. By deriving the generalization error bound on a novel task, we discover how TAD measures the adaptation difficulty on novel tasks for different models. To validate our theoretical results, we conduct experiments on three benchmarks. Our experimental results confirm that TAD metric effectively quantifies the task relatedness and reflects the adaptation difficulty on novel tasks for various FSL methods, even if some of them do not learn attributes explicitly or human-annotated attributes are not provided.

However, diverse normal patterns are consequently not well reconstructed as well. Although some efforts have been made to alleviate this problem by modeling sample diversity, they suffer from shortcut learning due to undesired transmission of abnormal information. In this paper, to better handle the tradeoff problem, we propose Diversity-Measurable Anomaly Detection (DMAD) framework to enhance reconstruction diversity while avoid the undesired generalization on anomalies. To this end, we design Pyramid Deformation Module (PDM), which models diverse normals and measures the severity of anomaly by estimating multi-scale deformation fields from reconstructed reference to original input. Integrated with an information compression module, PDM essentially decouples deformation from prototypical embedding and makes the final anomaly score more reliable. Experimental results on both surveillance videos and industrial images demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In addition, DMAD works equally well in front of contaminated data and anomaly-like normal samples."}}

However, it only cares about the hardest samples within the batch. For any probe, there are massive mismatched samples (crucial samples) outside the batch which are closer than the matched samples. To reduce the disruptive influence of crucial samples, we propose a novel isosceles contraint for triplet. Theoretically, we show that if a matched pair has equal distance to any one of mismatched sample, the matched pair should be infinitely close. Motivated by this, the isosceles constraint is designed for the two mismatched pairs of each triplet, to restrict some matched pairs with equal distance to different mismatched samples. Meanwhile, to ensure that the distance of mismatched pairs are larger than the matched pairs, margin constraints are necessary. Minimizing the isosceles and margin constraints with respect to the feature extraction network makes the matched pairs closer and the mismatched pairs farther away than the matched ones. By this way, crucial samples are effectively reduced and the performance on ReID is improved greatly. Likewise, our isosceles contraint can be applied to quadruplet as well. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 datasets demonstrate the advantages of our isosceles constraint over the related state-ofthe-art approaches."}}

In this paper, we investigate an essential but rarely noticed issue in long-tailed recognition, Class-Conditional Distribution (CCD) shift due to scarce instances, which exhibits a significant discrepancy between the empirical CCDs for training and test data, especially for tail classes. We observe empirical evidence that the shift is a key factor that limits the performance of existing long-tailed learning methods, and provide novel understanding of these methods in the\ncourse of our analysis. Motivated by this, we propose an adaptive data augmentation method, Distributionally Robust Augmentation (DRA), to learn models more robust to CCD shift. The convergence and generalization of DRA are theoretically guaranteed. Experimental results verify that DRA outperforms related data augmentation methods without extra training cost and significantly improves the performance of some existing long-tailed recognition methods."}}

Although great effort has been made to design proper positive pairs through data augmentation, few works attempt to generate optimal positives for each instance. Inspired by semantic consistency and computational advantage in latent space of pretrained generative models, this paper proposes to learn instance-specific latent transformations to generate Contrastive Optimal Positives (COP-Gen) for self-supervised contrastive learning. Specifically, we formulate COP-Gen as an instance-specific latent space navigator which minimizes the mutual information between the generated positive pair subject to the semantic consistency constraint. Theoretically, the learned latent transformation creates optimal positives for contrastive learning, which removes as much nuisance information as possible while preserving the semantics. Empirically, using generated positives by COP-Gen consistently outperforms other latent transformation methods and even real-image-based methods in self-supervised contrastive learning."}}

To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel one-stream tracking (OSTrack) framework that unifies feature learning and relation modeling by bridging the template-search image pairs with bidirectional information flows. In this way, discriminative target-oriented features can be dynamically extracted by mutual guidance. Since no extra heavy relation modeling module is needed and the implementation is highly parallelized, the proposed tracker runs at a fast speed. To further improve the inference efficiency, an in-network candidate early elimination module is proposed based on the strong similarity prior calculated in the one-stream framework. As a unified framework, OSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, in particular, it shows impressive results on the one-shot tracking benchmark GOT-10k, i.e.,, achieving 73.7% AO, improving the existing best result (SwinTrack) by 4.3%. Besides, our method maintains a good performance-speed trade-off and shows faster convergence. The code and models are available at https://github.com/botaoye/OSTrack ."}}

It is challenging due to the non-differentiable discrete graph structure and lack of ground-truth. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel graph structure learning framework for GNNs. Firstly, we directly model the continuous graph structure with dual-normalization, which implicitly imposes sparse constraint and reduces the influence of noisy edges. Secondly, we formulate the whole training process as a bilevel programming problem, where the inner objective is to optimize the GNNs given learned graphs, while the outer objective is to optimize the graph structure to minimize the generalization error of downstream task. Moreover, for bilevel optimization, we propose an improved Neumann-IFT algorithm to obtain an approximate solution, which is more stable and accurate than existing optimization methods. Besides, it makes the bilevel optimization process memory-efficient and scalable to large graphs. Experiments on node classification and scene graph generation show that our method can outperform related methods, especially with noisy graphs."}}

With proper manifold alignment, the correspondences between data sets will assist us with comprehensive study of data processes and analyses. Despite the several progresses in semi-supervised and unsupervised scenarios, potent manifold alignment methods in generalized and realistic circumstances remain in absence. Besides, theretofore unsupervised algorithms seldom prove themselves mathematically. In this paper, we devise an efficient method to properly solve the unsupervised manifold alignment problem and denominate it as extending generalized unsupervised manifold alignment (EGUMA) method. More specifically, an explicit relaxed integer programming method is adopted to solve the unsupervised manifold alignment problem, which reconciles three factors covering the updated local structure matching, the the feature comparability and geometric preservation. An additional effort is retained on extending the Frank Wolfe algorithm to tacking our optimization problem. Besides our previous endeavors we adopt a new strategy for neighborhood discovery in the manifolds. The main advantages over previous methods accommodate (1) simultaneous alignment and discovery of manifolds; (2) complete unsupervised learning structure without any prerequisite correspondence; (3) more concise local geometry for the embedding space; (4) efficient alternative optimization; (5) strict mathematical analysis on the convergence and efficiency issues. Experiments on real-world applications verify the high accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method."}}
