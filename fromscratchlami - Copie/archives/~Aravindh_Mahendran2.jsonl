For object detection, pre-training and scaling approaches are less well established, especially in the long-tailed and open-vocabulary setting, where training data is relatively scarce. In this paper, we propose a strong recipe for transferring image-text models to open-vocabulary object detection. We use a standard Vision Transformer architecture with minimal modifications, contrastive image-text pre-training, and end-to-end detection fine-tuning. Our analysis of the scaling properties of this setup shows that increasing image-level pre-training and model size yield consistent improvements on the downstream detection task. We provide the adaptation strategies and regularizations needed to attain very strong performance on zero-shot text-conditioned and one-shot image-conditioned object detection.

Slot-based neural networks have recently shown promise at discovering and representing objects in visual scenes in a self-supervised fashion. While they make use of permutation symmetry of objects to drive learning of abstractions, they largely ignore other spatial symmetries present in the visual world. In this work, we introduce a simple, yet effective, method for incorporating spatial symmetries in attentional slot-based methods. We incorporate equivariance to translation and scale into the attention and generation mechanism of Slot Attention solely via translating and scaling positional encodings. Both changes result in little computational overhead, are easy to implement, and can result in large gains in data efficiency and scene decomposition performance."}}

However, training neural networks on such images is computationally challenging and easily leads to out-of-memory errors even on modern GPUs. We propose a simple method, Iterative Patch Selection (IPS), which decouples the memory usage from the input size and thus enables the processing of arbitrarily large images under tight hardware constraints. IPS achieves this by selecting only the most salient patches, which are then aggregated into a global representation for image recognition. For both patch selection and aggregation, a cross-attention based transformer is introduced, which exhibits a close connection to Multiple Instance Learning. Our method demonstrates strong performance and has wide applicability across different domains, training regimes and image sizes while using minimal accelerator memory. For example, we are able to finetune our model on whole-slide images consisting of up to 250k patches (>16 gigapixels) with only 5 GB of GPU VRAM at a batch size of 16."}}

Discovering this compositional structure in dynamic visual scenes has proven challenging for end-to-end computer vision approaches unless explicit instance-level supervision is provided. Slot-based models leveraging motion cues have recently shown great promise in learning to represent, segment, and track objects without direct supervision, but they still fail to scale to complex real-world multi-object videos. In an effort to bridge this gap, we take inspiration from human development and hypothesize that information about scene geometry in the form of depth signals can facilitate object-centric learning. We introduce SAVi++, an object-centric video model which is trained to predict depth signals from a slot-based video representation. By further leveraging best practices for model scaling, we are able to train SAVi++ to segment complex dynamic scenes recorded with moving cameras, containing both static and moving objects of diverse appearance on naturalistic backgrounds, without the need for segmentation supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that by using sparse depth signals obtained from LiDAR, SAVi++ is able to learn emergent object segmentation and tracking from videos in the real-world Waymo Open dataset."}}

Facilitating the learning of such a representation in neural networks holds promise for substantially improving labeled data efficiency. As a key step in this direction, we make progress on the problem of learning 3D-consistent decompositions of complex scenes into individual objects in an unsupervised fashion. We introduce Object Scene Representation Transformer (OSRT), a 3D-centric model in which individual object representations naturally emerge through novel view synthesis. OSRT scales to significantly more complex scenes with larger diversity of objects and backgrounds than existing methods. At the same time, it is multiple orders of magnitude faster at compositional rendering thanks to its light field parametrization and the novel Slot Mixer decoder. We believe this work will not only accelerate future architecture exploration and scaling efforts, but it will also serve as a useful tool for both object-centric as well as neural scene representation learning communities."}}
