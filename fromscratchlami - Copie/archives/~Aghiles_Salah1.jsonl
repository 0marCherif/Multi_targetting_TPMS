Among existing approaches to alleviate this problem, cross-domain recommendation consists in leveraging knowledge from a source domain or category (e.g., Movies) to improve item recommendation in a target domain (e.g., Books). In this work, we advocate a probabilistic approach to cross-domain recommendation and rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) as our latent variable models. More precisely, we assume that we have access to a VAE trained on the source domain that we seek to leverage to improve preference modeling in the target domain. To this end, we propose a model which learns to fit the target observations and align its hidden space with the source latent space jointly. Since we model the latent spaces by the variational posteriors, we operate at this level, and in particular, we investigate two approaches, namely rigid and soft alignments. In the former scenario, the variational model in the target domain is set equal to the source variational model. That is, we only learn a generative model in the target domain. In the soft-alignment scenario, the target VAE has its variational model, but which is encouraged to look like its source counterpart. We analyze the proposed objectives theoretically and conduct extensive experiments to illustrate the benefit of our contribution. Empirical results on six real-world datasets show that the proposed models outperform several comparable cross-domain recommendation models."}}

These are users and items, as well as their interactions, e.g., ratings. We are interested in learning representations for both sets of objects, i.e., users and items, to predict unknown pairwise interactions. Motivated by the recent successes of deep latent variable models, we propose Bilateral Variational Autoencoder (BiVAE), which arises from a combination of a generative model of dyadic data with two inference models, user- and item-based, parameterized by neural networks. Interestingly, our model can take the form of a Bayesian variational autoencoder either on the user or item side. As opposed to the vanilla VAE model, BiVAE is \"bilateral'', in that users and items are treated similarly, making it more apt for two-way or dyadic data. While theoretically sound, we formally show that, similarly to VAE, our model might suffer from an over-regularized latent space. This issue, known as posterior collapse in the VAE literature, may appear due to assuming an over-simplified prior (isotropic Gaussian) over the latent space. Hence, we further propose a mitigation of this issue by introducing constrained adaptive prior (CAP) for learning user- and item-dependent prior distributions. Empirical results on several real-world datasets show that the proposed model outperforms conventional VAE and other comparative collaborative filtering models in terms of item recommendation. Moreover, the proposed CAP further boosts the performance of BiVAE. An implementation of BiVAE is available on Cornac recommender library."}}

When dealing with high dimensional sparse data, co-clustering turns out to be more beneficial than one-sided clustering even if one is interested in clustering along one dimension only. Aside from being high dimensional and sparse, some datasets, such as document-term matrices, exhibit directional characteristics, and the $$L_2$$ L 2 normalization of such data, so that it lies on the surface of a unit hypersphere, is useful. Popular co-clustering assumptions such as Gaussian or Multinomial are inadequate for this type of data. In this paper, we extend the scope of co-clustering to directional data. We present Diagonal Block Mixture of Von Mises\u2013Fisher distributions (dbmovMFs), a co-clustering model which is well suited for directional data lying on a unit hypersphere. By setting the estimate of the model parameters under the maximum likelihood (ML) and classification ML approaches, we develop a class of EM algorithms for estimating dbmovMFs from data. Extensive experiments, on several real-world datasets, confirm the advantage of our approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms."}}

However, most existing work in this context focuses primarily on modeling user-item interactions, which tend to be very sparse. We propose to further leverage the item-item relationships that may reflect various aspects of items that guide users' choices. Intuitively, items that occur within the same \"context\" (e.g., browsed in the same session, purchased in the same basket) are likely related in some latent aspect. Therefore, accounting for the item's context would complement the sparse user-item interactions by extending a user's preference to other items of similar aspects. To realize this intuition, we develop Collaborative Context Poisson Factorization (C2PF), a new Bayesian latent variable model that seamlessly integrates contextual relationships among items into a personalized recommendation approach. We further derive a scalable variational inference algorithm to fit C2PF to preference data. Empirical results on real-world datasets show evident performance improvements over strong factorization models."}}

This approach has proven to be more useful than traditional one-sided clustering when dealing with sparsity. Among the wide range of co-clustering approaches, Non-Negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (NMTF) is recognized for its high performance, flexibility and theoretical foundations. One important aspect when dealing with text data, is to capture the semantic relationships between words since documents that are about the same topic may not necessarily use exactly the same vocabulary. However, this aspect has been overlooked by previous co-clustering models, including NMTF. To address this issue, we rely on the distributional hypothesis stating that words which co-occur frequently within the same context, e.g., a document or sentence, are likely to have similar meanings. We then propose a new NMTF model that maps frequently co-occurring words roughly to the same direction in the latent space to reflect the relationships between them. To infer the factor matrices, we derive a scalable alternating optimization algorithm, whose convergence is guaranteed. Extensive experiments, on several real-world datasets, provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in terms of co-clustering."}}

Among existing models, non-negative-matrix factorization (NMF) approaches have proven effective for this task. However, NMF approaches, like other models in this context, exhibit a major drawback, namely they use the bag-of-word representation and, thus, do not account for the sequential order in which words occur in documents. This is an important issue since it may result in a significant loss of semantics. In this paper, we aim to address the above issue and propose a new model which successfully integrates a word embedding model, word2vec, into an NMF framework so as to leverage the semantic relationships between words. Empirical results, on several real-world datasets, demonstrate the benefits of our model in terms of text document clustering as well as document/word embedding."}}
