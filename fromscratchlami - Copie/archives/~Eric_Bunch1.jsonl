While useful, graph structures can be potentially limiting. Hypergraph structures in general do not account for higher order relations between their hyperedges. Simplicial complexes offer a middle ground, with a rich theory to draw on. We develop a convolutional neural network layer on simplicial 2-complexes."}}

The contribution of each point to a metric space\u2019s global magnitude, which is encoded by the {\\em weighting vector}, captures much of the underlying geometry of the original metric space. When the metric space is Euclidean, the weighting vector also serves as an effective tool for boundary detection. This allows the weighting vector to serve as the foundation of novel algorithms for classic machine learning tasks such as classification, outlier detection and active learning.   We demonstrate, using experiments and comparisons on classic benchmark datasets, the promise of the proposed magnitude and weighting vector-based approaches."}}
