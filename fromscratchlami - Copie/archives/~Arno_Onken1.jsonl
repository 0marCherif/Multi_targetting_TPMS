However, estimating stimulus or behavioral information that is encoded in high-dimensional neuronal populations is challenging. We propose a method based on parametric copulas which allows modeling joint distributions of neuronal and behavioral variables characterized by different statistics and timescales. To account for temporal or spatial changes in dependencies between variables, we model varying copula parameters by means of Gaussian Processes (GP). We validate the resulting Copula-GP framework on synthetic data and on neuronal and behavioral recordings obtained in awake mice. We show that the use of a parametric description of the high-dimensional dependence structure in our method provides better accuracy in mutual information estimation in higher dimensions compared to other non-parametric methods. Moreover, by quantifying the redundancy between neuronal and behavioral variables, our model exposed the location of the reward zone in an unsupervised manner (i.e., without using any explicit cues about the task structure). These results demonstrate that the Copula-GP framework is particularly useful for the analysis of complex multidimensional relationships between neuronal, sensory and behavioral variables."}}

Thanks to the recent advances in neural imaging technologies, high-quality recordings can be obtained from hundreds of neurons over multiple days or even weeks. However, the complexity and dimensionality of population responses pose significant challenges for analysis. Existing methods of studying neuronal adaptation and learning often impose strong assumptions on the data or model, resulting in biased descriptions that do not generalize. In this work, we use a variant of deep generative models called - cycle-consistent adversarial networks, to learn the unknown mapping between pre- and post-learning neuronal activities recorded $\\textit{in vivo}$. To do so, we develop an end-to-end pipeline to preprocess, train and evaluate calcium fluorescence signals, and a procedure to interpret the resulting deep learning models. To assess the validity of our method, we first test our framework on a synthetic dataset with known ground-truth transformation. Subsequently, we applied our method to neuronal activities recorded from the primary visual cortex of behaving mice, where the mice transition from novice to expert-level performance in a visual-based virtual reality experiment. We evaluate model performance on generated calcium imaging signals and their inferred spike trains. To maximize performance, we derive a novel approach to pre-sort neurons such that convolutional-based networks can take advantage of the spatial information that exists in neuronal activities. In addition, we incorporate visual explanation methods to improve the interpretability of our work and gain insights into the learning process as manifested in the cellular activities. Together, our results demonstrate that analyzing neuronal learning processes with data-driven deep unsupervised methods holds the potential to unravel changes in an unbiased way."}}

We propose a parametric copula model which separates the statistics of the individual variables from their dependence structure, and escapes the curse of dimensionality by using vine copula constructions. We use a Bayesian framework with Gaussian Process (GP) priors over copula parameters, conditioned on a continuous task-related variable. We improve the flexibility of this method by 1) using non-parametric conditional (rather than unconditional) marginals; 2) linearly mixing copula elements with qualitatively different tail dependencies. We validate the model on synthetic data and compare its performance in estimating mutual information against the commonly used non-parametric algorithms. Our model provides accurate information estimates when the dependencies in the data match the parametric copulas used in our framework. Moreover, even when the exact density estimation with a parametric model is not possible, our Copula-GP model is still able to provide reasonable information estimates, close to the ground truth and comparable to those obtained with a neural network estimator. Finally, we apply our framework to real neuronal and behavioral recordings obtained in awake mice. We demonstrate the ability of our framework to 1) produce accurate and interpretable bivariate models for the analysis of inter-neuronal noise correlations or behavioral modulations; 2) expand to more than 100 dimensions and measure information content in the whole-population statistics. These results demonstrate that the Copula-GP framework is particularly useful for the analysis of complex multidimensional relationships between neuronal, sensory and behavioral data."}}

The ability to artificially synthesize realistic neuronal calcium signals could greatly alleviate this problem by scaling up the number of trials.

(2014) have achieved high classification accuracy in distinguishing swim bouts of zebrafish using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have reached superior performance in various image recognition tasks over SVMs, but these powerful networks remain a black box. Reaching better transparency helps to build trust in their classifications and makes learned features interpretable to experts. Using a recently developed technique called Deep Taylor Decomposition, we generated heatmaps to highlight input regions of high relevance for predictions. We find that our CNN makes predictions by analyzing the steadiness of the tail's trunk, which markedly differs from the manually extracted features used by Semmelhack et al. (2014). We further uncovered that the network paid attention to experimental artifacts. Removing these artifacts ensured the validity of predictions. After correction, our best CNN beats the SVM by 6.12%, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.32%. Our work thus demonstrates the utility of AI explainability for CNNs."}}

Much research in neuroscience is devoted to understanding how different groups of neurons support specific brain functions by representing behaviorally relevant variables. In this respect, one important question is whether neuronal populations represent discrete sets of variables (categorical encoding) or random combinations of variables (non-categorical encoding). Here we developed a new algorithm to assess this general issue. We then used the algorithm to examine neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) recorded while non-human primates performed economic decisions. We found that the neuronal representation was categorical. Specifically, neurons in the OFC encoded the value of individual offers, the binary choice outcome, and the chosen value. The present results support the hypothesis that economic decisions are formed within the OFC."}}

This poses the question of how to compactly represent all the information that the population codes carry across all these dimensions. Here, we developed an analytical method to factorize a large number of retinal ganglion cells' spike trains into a robust low-dimensional representation that captures efficiently both their spatial and temporal information. In particular, we extended previously used single-trial space-by-time tensor decomposition based on non-negative matrix factorization to efficiently discount pre-stimulus baseline activity. On data recorded from retinal ganglion cells with strong pre-stimulus baseline, we showed that in situations were the stimulus elicits a strong change in firing rate, our extensions yield a boost in stimulus decoding performance. Our results thus suggest that taking into account the baseline can be important for finding a compact information-rich representation of neural activity."}}

Here we used the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework to simulate the concerted activity of a population of neurons.\nWe adapted the Wasserstein-GAN variant to facilitate the generation of unconstrained neural population activity patterns while still benefiting from parameter sharing in the temporal domain.\nWe demonstrate that our proposed GAN, which we termed Spike-GAN, generates spike trains that match accurately the first- and second-order statistics of datasets of tens of neurons and also approximates well their higher-order statistics. We applied Spike-GAN to a real dataset recorded from salamander retina and showed that it performs as well as state-of-the-art approaches based on the maximum entropy and the dichotomized Gaussian frameworks. Importantly, Spike-GAN does not require to specify a priori the statistics to be matched by the model, and so constitutes a more flexible method than these alternative approaches.\nFinally, we show how to exploit a trained Spike-GAN  to construct 'importance maps' to detect the most relevant statistical structures present in a spike train. \nSpike-GAN provides a powerful, easy-to-use technique for generating realistic spiking neural activity and for describing the most relevant features of the large-scale neural population recordings studied in modern systems neuroscience.\n"}}
