As a result, levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the atmosphere dropped. In this work, we use 550,134 NO2 data points from 237 stations in the UK to build a spatiotemporal Gaussian process capable of predicting NO2 levels across the entire UK. We integrate several covariate datasets to enhance the model's ability to capture the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of NO2. Our numerical analyses show that, within two weeks of a UK lockdown being imposed, UK NO2 levels dropped 36.8%. Further, we show that as a direct result of lockdown NO2 levels were 29-38% lower than what they would have been had no lockdown occurred. In accompaniment to these numerical results, we provide a software framework that allows practitioners to easily and efficiently fit similar models. "}}

Key to applying Gaussian process models is the availability of well-developed open source software, which is available in many programming languages. In this paper, we present a tutorial of the GaussianProcesses.jl package that has been developed for the Julia programming language. GaussianProcesses.jl utilises the inherent computational benefits of the Julia language, including multiple dispatch and just-in-time compilation, to produce a fast, flexible and user-friendly Gaussian processes package. The package provides many mean and kernel functions with supporting inference tools to fit exact Gaussian process models, as well as a range of alternative likelihood functions to handle non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary classification models) and sparse approximations for scalable Gaussian processes. The package makes efficient use of existing Julia packages to provide users with a range of optimization and plotting tools. "}}
{"id": "bCdMkYzI7h", "cdate": 1577836800000, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Stein Variational Gaussian Processes", "abstract": "We show how to use Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) to carry out inference in Gaussian process (GP) models with non-Gaussian likelihoods and large data volumes. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is extremely computationally intensive for these situations, but the parametric assumptions required for efficient variational inference (VI) result in incorrect inference when they encounter the multi-modal posterior distributions that are common for such models. SVGD provides a non-parametric alternative to variational inference which is substantially faster than MCMC. We prove that for GP models with Lipschitz gradients the SVGD algorithm monotonically decreases the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the sampling distribution to the true posterior. Our method is demonstrated on benchmark problems in both regression and classification, a multimodal posterior, and an air quality example with 550,134 spatiotemporal observations, showing substantial performance improvements over MCMC and VI."}}
