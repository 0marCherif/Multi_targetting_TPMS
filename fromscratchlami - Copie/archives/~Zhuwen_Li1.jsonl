One of the promising trends is to apply explicit structural constraint, e.g. 3D cost volume, into the network. In this work, we design a physical driven architecture, namely DeepSFM, inspired by traditional Bundle Adjustment (BA), which consists of two cost volume based architectures for depth and pose estimation respectively, iteratively running  to improve both. In each cost volume, we encode not only photo-metric consistency across multiple input images, but also geometric consistency to ensure that depths from multiple views agree with each other. The explicit constraints on both depth (structure) and pose (motion), when combined with the learning components, bring the merit from both traditional BA and emerging deep learning technology. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both depth and pose estimation with superior robustness against less number of inputs and the noise in initialization.\n"}}

When the user clicks on a door, do they intend to select the door or the whole house? We present an end-to-end learning approach to interactive image segmentation that tackles this ambiguity. Our architecture couples two convolutional networks. The first is trained to synthesize a diverse set of plausible segmentations that conform to the user's input. The second is trained to select among these. By selecting a single solution, our approach retains compatibility with existing interactive segmentation interfaces. By synthesizing multiple diverse solutions before selecting one, the architecture is given the representational power to explore the multimodal solution space. We show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods for interactive image segmentation, including prior work that applied convolutional networks to this problem, while being much faster."}}

In this paper, we address both problems in a joint manner by recovering an ideal affinity tensor from an imperfect input. By taking into account the relationship of the affinities induced by the cluster structures, we are able to significantly improve the affinity input, such as repairing those entries corrupted by gross outliers. More importantly, the recovered ideal affinity tensor also directly indicates the number of clusters and their membership, thus solving the model selection and clustering jointly. To enforce the requisite global consistency in the affinities demanded by the cluster structure, we impose a number of constraints, specifically, among others, the tensor should be low rank and sparse, and it should obey what we call the rank-1 sum constraint. To solve this highly non-smooth and non-convex problem, we exploit the mathematical structures, and express the original problem in an equivalent form amenable for numerical optimization and convergence analysis. To scale to large problem sizes, we also propose an alternative formulation, so that those problems can be efficiently solved via stochastic optimization in an online fashion. We evaluate our algorithm with different applications to demonstrate its superiority, and show it can adapt to a large variety of settings."}}

Our approach combines deep learning techniques with useful algorithmic elements from classic heuristics. The central component is a graph convolutional network that is trained to estimate the likelihood, for each vertex in a graph, of whether this vertex is part of the optimal solution. The network is designed and trained to synthesize a diverse set of solutions, which enables rapid exploration of the solution space via tree search. The presented approach is evaluated on four canonical NP-hard problems and five datasets, which include benchmark satisfiability problems and real social network graphs with up to a hundred thousand nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the presented approach substantially outperforms recent deep learning work, and performs on par with highly optimized state-of-the-art heuristic solvers for some NP-hard problems. Experiments indicate that our approach generalizes across datasets, and scales to graphs that are orders of magnitude larger than those used during training."}}

Limited by the nature of deep neural network, previous methods usually represent a 3D shape in volume or point cloud, and it is non-trivial to convert them to the more ready-to-use mesh model. Unlike the existing methods, our network represents 3D mesh in a graph-based convolutional neural network and produces correct geometry by progressively deforming an ellipsoid, leveraging perceptual features extracted from the input image. We adopt a coarse-to-fine strategy to make the whole deformation procedure stable, and define various of mesh related losses to capture properties of different levels to guarantee visually appealing and physically accurate 3D geometry. Extensive experiments show that our method not only qualitatively produces mesh model with better details, but also achieves higher 3D shape estimation accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art."}}

Even when we are confronted with a general scene-motion, the fundamental matrix approach as a model for motion segmentation still suffers from several defects, which we discuss in this paper. The full potential of the fundamental matrix approach could only be realized if we judiciously harness information from the simpler homography model. From these considerations, we propose a multi-view spectral clustering framework that synergistically combines multiple models together. We show that the performance can be substantially improved in this way. We perform extensive testing on existing motion segmentation datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all of them; we also put forth a more realistic and challenging dataset adapted from the KITTI benchmark, containing real-world effects such as strong perspectives and strong forward translations not seen in the traditional datasets."}}

In our formulation, the depth cues from stereo matching and fog information reinforce each other, and produce superior results than conventional stereo or defogging algorithms. We first improve the photo-consistency term to explicitly model the appearance change due to the scattering effects. The prior matting Laplacian constraint on fog transmission imposes a detail-preserving smoothness constraint on the scene depth. We further enforce the ordering consistency between scene depth and fog transmission at neighboring points. These novel constraints are formulated together in an MRF framework, which is optimized iteratively by introducing auxiliary variables. The experiment results on real videos demonstrate the strength of our method."}}

This paper addresses both problems in a joint manner with an indicator matrix formulation, in which the clustering cost is penalized by a Frobenius inner product term and the group number estimation is achieved by a rank minimization. As affinity graphs generally contain positive edge values, a sparsity term is further added to avoid the trivial solution. Rather than adopting the conventional convex relaxation approach wholesale, we represent the original problem more faithfully by taking full advantage of the particular structure present in the optimization problem and solving it efficiently using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. The highly constrained nature of the optimization provides our algorithm with the robustness to deal with the varying and often imperfect input affinity matrices arising from different applications and different group numbers. Evaluations on the synthetic data as well as two real world problems show the superiority of the method across a large variety of settings."}}

It first formulates the 3-D motion segmentation from two perspective views as a subspace clustering problem, utilizing the epipolar constraint of an image pair. It then combines the point correspondence information across multiple image frames via a collaborative clustering step, in which tight integration is achieved via a mixed norm optimization scheme. For model selection, we propose an over-segment and merge approach, where the merging step is based on the property of the ell_1-norm of the mutual sparse representation of two over-segmented groups. The resulting algorithm can deal with incomplete trajectories and perspective effects substantially better than state-of-the-art two-frame and multi-frame methods. Experiments on a 62-clip dataset show the significant superiority of the proposed idea in both segmentation accuracy and model selection."}}
