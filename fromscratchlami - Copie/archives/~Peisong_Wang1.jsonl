In this paper, we demonstrate that the architecture of DNNs has a significant impact on model utility in the context of private deep learning, whereas its effect is largely unexplored in previous studies. In light of this missing, we propose the very first framework that employs neural architecture search to automatic model design for private deep learning, dubbed as DPNAS. To integrate private learning with architecture search, a DP-aware approach is introduced for training candidate models composed on a delicately defined novel search space. We empirically certify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The searched model DPNASNet achieves state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs, eg, for the privacy budget of (epsilon, delta)=(3, 1e-5), our model obtains test accuracy of 98.57% on MNIST, 88.09% on FashionMNIST, and 68.33% on CIFAR-10. Furthermore, by studying the generated architectures, we provide several intriguing findings of designing private-learning-friendly DNNs, which can shed new light on model design for deep learning with differential privacy."}}

To automate prompt engineering, prompt learning is proposed to automatically learn the optimal task-relevant prompts. In this paper, we make some surprising observations that contradict common beliefs about prompts. We observe that even random prompts can achieve pretty good performance for zero-shot recognition. We also find that prompt learning gives comparable or worse performance than directly fine-tuning of the linear classifier. Moreover, prompt learning is no more than parameter-efficient learning, and is a trade-off between optimality and generalization. Our results highlight the need for the rethinking of existing prompt learning, more careful baseline evaluations in future research on prompt learning methods in vision-language models. "}}

Meanwhile, problems including the storage and computing overheads arise along with these breakthroughs. To solve these problems, network quantization has received increasing attention due to its high efficiency and hardware-friendly property. Nonetheless, most existing quantization approaches rely on the full training dataset and the time-consuming fine-tuning process to retain accuracy. Post-training quantization does not have these problems, however, it has mainly been shown effective for 8-bit quantization. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the effect of network quantization and show that the quantization loss in the final output layer is bounded by the layer-wise activation reconstruction error. Based on this analysis, we propose an Optimization-based Post-training Quantization framework and a novel Bit-split optimization approach to achieve minimal accuracy degradation. The proposed framework is validated on a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, with various network architectures. Specifically, we achieve near-original model performance even when quantizing FP32 models to 3-bit without fine-tuning."}}

Recent works mainly focus on inference speedup via 2:4 sparsity while training acceleration has been largely overwhelmed where backpropagation consumes around 70% of the training time. However, unlike inference, training speedup with structured pruning is nontrivial due to the need to maintain the fidelity of gradients and reduce the additional overhead of performing 2:4 sparsity online. For the first time, this article proposes fully sparse training (FST) where `fully' indicates that ALL matrix multiplications in forward/backward propagation are structurally pruned while maintaining accuracy. To this end, we begin with saliency analysis, investigating the sensitivity of different sparse objects to structured pruning. Based on the observation of spatial similarity among activations, we propose pruning activations with fixed 2:4 masks. Moreover, an Information Restoration block is proposed to retrieve the lost information, which can be implemented by efficient gradient-shift operation. Evaluation of accuracy and efficiency shows that we can achieve 2\u00d7 training acceleration with negligible accuracy degradation on challenging large-scale classification and detection tasks."}}

However, conventional quantization methods use the same bit-width for all (or most of) the layers, which often suffer significant accuracy degradation in the ultra-low precision regime and ignore the fact that emergent hardware accelerators begin to support mixed-precision computation. Consequently, we present a novel and principled framework to solve the mixed-precision quantization problem in this paper. Briefly speaking, we first formulate the mixed-precision quantization as a discrete constrained optimization problem. Then, to make the optimization tractable, we approximate the objective function with second-order Taylor expansion and propose an efficient approach to compute its Hessian matrix. Finally, based on the above simplification, we show that the original problem can be reformulated as a MultipleChoice Knapsack Problem (MCKP) and propose a greedy search algorithm to solve it efficiently. Compared with existing mixed-precision quantization works, our method is derived in a principled way and much more computationally efficient. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on the ImageNet dataset and various kinds of network architectures also demonstrate its superiority over existing uniform and mixed-precision quantization approaches."}}

However, extremely-low-bit representation usually causes large accuracy drop. Thus, how to train extremely-low-bit neural networks with high accuracy is of central importance. Most existing network quantization approaches learn transformations (low-bit weights) as well as encodings (low-bit activations) simultaneously. This tight coupling makes the optimization problem difficult, and thus prevents the network from learning optimal representations. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Two-Step Quantization (TSQ) framework, by decomposing the network quantization problem into two steps: code learning and transformation function learning based on the learned codes. For the first step, we propose the sparse quantization method for code learning. The second step can be formulated as a non-linear least square regression problem with low-bit constraints, which can be solved efficiently in an iterative manner. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC-12 datasets demonstrate that the proposed TSQ is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin. Especially, for 2-bit activation and ternary weight quantization of AlexNet, the accuracy of our TSQ drops only about 0.5 points compared with the full-precision counterpart, outperforming current state-of-the-art by more than 5 points."}}

Since the matrix product of binary matrices has more numerical values than binary matrix, the proposed semi-binary decomposition has more representation capacity. Besides, we propose an alternating optimization method to solve the semi-binary decomposition problem while keeping binary constraints. Extensive experiments on AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (5% higher in\u00a0top1 accuracy).

This motivates people to deploy CNNs to realworld applications. However, most of state-of-art CNNs require large memory and computational resources, which hinders the deployment on mobile devices. Recent studies show that low-bit weight representation can reduce much storage and memory demand, and also can achieve efficient network inference. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel approach named BWNH to train Binary Weight Networks via Hashing. In this paper, we first reveal the strong connection between inner-product preserving hashing and binary weight networks, and show that training binary weight networks can be intrinsically regarded as a hashing problem. Based on this perspective, we propose an alternating optimization method to learn the hash codes instead of directly learning binary weights. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet demonstrate that our proposed BWNH outperforms current state-of-art by a large margin."}}

To alleviate this problem, we introduce a novel Fixed-point Factorized Networks (FFN) for pretrained models to reduce the computational complexity as well as the storage requirement of networks. The resulting networks have only weights of -1, 0 and 1, which significantly eliminates the most resource-consuming multiply-accumulate operations (MACs). Extensive experiments on large-scale ImageNet classification task show the proposed FFN only requires one-thousandth of multiply operations with comparable accuracy."}}
