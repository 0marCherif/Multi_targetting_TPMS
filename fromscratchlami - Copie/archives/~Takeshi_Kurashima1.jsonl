Such time-inconsistent behavior is believed to be caused by present bias, a tendency to overestimate immediate rewards and underestimate future rewards. It is essential in behavioral economics to investigate the relationship between present bias and time-inconsistency. In this paper, we propose a model for analyzing agent behavior with present bias in tasks to make progress toward a goal over a specific period. Unlike previous models, the state sequence of the agent can be described analytically in our model. Based on this property, we analyze three crucial problems related to agents under present bias: task abandonment, optimal goal setting, and optimal reward scheduling. Extensive analysis reveals how present bias affects the condition under which task abandonment occurs and optimal intervention strategies. Our findings are meaningful for preventing task abandonment and intervening through incentives in the real world."}}

Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference of unobserved variables under given observations is one of the essential operations in CGM. Because the MAP inference problem is known to be NP-hard in general, the current mainstream approach is to solve an alternative problem obtained by approximating the objective function and applying continuous relaxation. However, this approach has two significant drawbacks. First, the quality of the solution deteriorates when the values in the count data are negligible due to the inaccuracy of Stirling\u2019s approximation. Second, the application of continuous relaxation causes the violation of integrality constraints. This paper proposes novel algorithms for MAP inference in CGMs on path graphs to overcome these problems. Our method is based on the discrete difference of convex algorithm (DCA); DCA is a general framework to minimize the sum of a convex function and a concave function by repeatedly minimizing surrogate functions. Utilizing the particular structure of path graphs, we efficiently solve the surrogate function minimization by minimum convex cost flow algorithms. Furthermore, our approach also leads to a new method of solving another important task; MAP inference of the sample size in CGM on path graphs. Our method is naturally applicable to this task, allowing us to design very efficient algorithms. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."}}

The aggregate data are associated not with points but with supports (e.g., spatial regions in a city). Since the supports may have various granularities depending on attributes (e.g., poverty rate and crime rate), modeling such data is not straightforward. This article offers a multi-output Gaussian process (MoGP) model that infers functions for attributes using multiple aggregate datasets of respective granularities. In the proposed model, the function for each attribute is assumed to be a dependent GP modeled as a linear mixing of independent latent GPs. We design an observation model with an aggregation process for each attribute; the process is an integral of the GP over the corresponding support. We also introduce a prior distribution of the mixing weights, which allows a knowledge transfer across domains (e.g., cities) by sharing the prior. This is advantageous in such a situation where the spatially aggregated dataset in a city is too coarse to interpolate; the proposed model can still make accurate predictions of attributes by utilizing aggregate datasets in other cities. The inference of the proposed model is based on variational Bayes, which enables one to learn the model parameters using the aggregate datasets from multiple domains. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms in the task of refining coarse-grained aggregate data on real-world datasets: Time series of air pollutants in Beijing and various kinds of spatial datasets from New York City and Chicago."}}

Predicting such events and revealing the underlying triggering patterns are a crucial task for many applications, ranging from disease control to global politics. Traditional event prediction models based on Hawkes processes capture the spatio-temporal relationships between events, but cannot incorporate complex and heterogeneous external features, including population distribution, weather and terrain. This paper proposes an event prediction method that effectively utilizes the rich external information present in sets of unstructured data (e.g., map images, satellite images and weather map). Specifically, we extend a convolutional neural network (CNN) by combining it with continuous kernel convolution; and design the conditional intensity of Hawkes process based on the extended neural network model that accepts images as its input. Our approach of using the continuous convolution kernel provides a flexible way to discover the complex effect of external factors on the triggering process, as well as yielding tractable optimization algorithms. We use real-world event data from different domains (i.e., disease outbreaks, armed conflicts and protests) to demonstrate that the proposed method has better prediction performance than existing methods."}}

Collective Graphical Model (CGM) is a probabilistic approach to the analysis of aggregated data. One of the most important operations in CGM is maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference of unobserved variables under given observations. Because the MAP inference problem for general CGMs has been shown to be NP-hard, an approach that solves an approximate problem has been proposed. However, this approach has two major drawbacks. First, the quality of the solution deteriorates when the values in the count tables are small, because the approximation becomes inaccurate. Second, since continuous relaxation is applied, the integrality constraints of the output are violated. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes a new method for MAP inference for CGMs on path graphs. Our method is based on the Difference of Convex Algorithm (DCA), which is a general methodology to minimize a function represented as the sum of a convex function and a concave function. In our algorithm, important subroutines in DCA can be efficiently calculated by minimum convex cost flow algorithms. Experiments show that the proposed method outputs higher quality solutions than the conventional approach. "}}

Modeling diffusion processes and predicting future events are crucial in many applications including epidemic control, viral marketing, and predictive policing. Hawkes processes offer a central tool for modeling the diffusion processes, in which the influence from the past events is described by the triggering kernel. However, the triggering kernel parameters, which govern how each community is influenced by the past events, are assumed to be static over time. In the real world, the diffusion processes depend not only on the influences from the past, but also the current (time-evolving) states of the communities, e.g., people's awareness of the disease and people's current interests. In this paper, we propose a novel Hawkes process model that is able to capture the underlying dynamics of community states behind the diffusion processes and predict the occurrences of events based on the dynamics. Specifically, we model the latent dynamic function that encodes these hidden dynamics by a mixture of neural networks. Then we design the triggering kernel using the latent dynamic function and its integral. The proposed method, termed DHP (Dynamic Hawkes Processes), offers a flexible way to learn complex representations of the time-evolving communities' states, while at the same time it allows to computing the exact likelihood, which makes parameter learning tractable. Extensive experiments on four real-world event datasets show that DHP outperforms five widely adopted methods for event prediction."}}

Previous research has explored how response rates are influenced by subjects\u2019 characteristics; however, few studies focused on temporal patterns of responses to EMA questions. In this study, we examined the relationship of personal characteristics with temporal response patterns by using StudentLife dataset. From this dataset, we adopted scales of personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness) and mental status (depression, stress, loneliness, life satisfaction) as subjects\u2019 personal characteristics, and analyzed how these characteristics relate to the subjects\u2019 temporal response patterns for EMA questions. Primary results of our analyses using regression models and latent growth curve models indicated that the subjects who reported high stress levels had a higher total number of EMA responses, but the number of responses from these subjects tended to decrease strongly throughout the experiment, especially after a stressful event such as the midterm examination. We also found that the subjects who reported low extraversion had a weak tendency to decrease the number of EMA responses throughout the experiment, but the number of EMA responses of these subjects decreased strongly after a social event such as the school festival. Based on our results, we discussed how the data collected with EMA studies are biased not only in terms of personal characteristics but also with timings."}}

Location information is often aggregated due to privacy and/or cost concerns. The aggregated data we use as input consist of the numbers of incoming and outgoing people at each location and at each time step. Since the aggregated data lack tracking information of individuals, determining the flow of people between locations is not straightforward. In this article, we address the problem of inferring latent people flows, that is, transition populations between locations, from just aggregated population data gathered from observed locations. Existing models assume that everyone is always in one of the observed locations at every time step; this, however, is an unrealistic assumption, because we do not always have a large enough number of sensor devices to cover the large-scale spaces targeted. To overcome this drawback, we propose a probabilistic model with flow conservation constraints that incorporate travel duration distributions between observed locations. To handle noisy settings, we adopt noisy observation models for the numbers of incoming and outgoing people, where the noise is regarded as a factor that may disturb flow conservation, e.g., people may appear in or disappear from the predefined space of interest. We develop an approximate expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that simultaneously estimates transition populations and model parameters. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on real-world datasets of pedestrian data in exhibition halls, bike trip data and taxi trip data in New York City."}}

To consider the requester\u2019s priorities, we introduce an individual requester\u2019s acceptance probability model for price and required time, which is widely used in transportation economics.
