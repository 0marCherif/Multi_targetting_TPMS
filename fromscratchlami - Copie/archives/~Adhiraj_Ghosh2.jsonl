This creates a challenge for embedding schemes that seek to map instances with the same object ID to locations that are as close as possible. This issue becomes significantly heightened in complex computer vision tasks such as re-identification(reID). In this paper, we suggest that these dramatic appearance changes are indications that an object ID is composed of multiple natural groups, and it is counterproductive to forcefully map instances from different groups to a common location. This leads us to introduce Relation Preserving Triplet Mining (RPTM), a feature matching guided triplet mining scheme, that ensures that triplets will respect the natural subgroupings within an object ID. We use this triplet mining mechanism to establish a pose-aware, well-conditioned triplet loss by implicitly enforcing view consistency. This allows a single network to be trained with fixed parameters across datasets, while providing state-of-the-art results. Code is available at https://github.com/adhirajghosh/RPTM_reid."}}

Most existing work on this subject has focused on irony detection in the English language. Since no public dataset is available for this task in the Bengali domain, we have created a Bengali irony detection dataset that contains a total of 1500 labeled Bengali tweets. This paper presents the description of the Bengali irony detection dataset developed by us and reports some results obtained on our Bengali irony dataset using several widely used machine learning algorithms such as Na\u00efve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest."}}
