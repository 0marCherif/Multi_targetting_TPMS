Inverse graphics is an appealing approach to 3D scene understanding that aims to infer the 3D scene structure from 2D images. In this paper, we introduce probabilistic modeling to the inverse graphics framework to quantify uncertainty and achieve robustness in 6D pose estimation tasks. Specifically, we propose 3D Neural Embedding Likelihood (3DNEL) as a unified probabilistic model over RGB-D images, and develop efficient inference procedures on 3D scene descriptions. 3DNEL effectively combines learned neural embeddings from RGB with depth information to improve robustness in sim-to-real 6D object pose estimation from RGB-D images. Performance on the YCB-Video dataset is on par with state-of-the-art yet is much more robust in challenging regimes. In contrast to discriminative approaches, 3DNEL's probabilistic generative formulation jointly models multi-object scenes, quantifies uncertainty in a principled way, and handles object pose tracking under heavy occlusion. Finally, 3DNEL provides a principled framework for incorporating prior knowledge about the scene and objects, which allows natural extension to additional tasks like camera pose tracking from video."}}

However, when applied to engineering design problems, evaluating the performance of these models can be challenging, as traditional statistical metrics based on likelihood may not fully capture the requirements of engineering applications. This paper doubles as a review and a practical guide to evaluation metrics for deep generative models (DGMs) in engineering design. We first summarize well-accepted `classic' evaluation metrics for deep generative models grounded in machine learning theory and typical computer science applications. Using case studies, we then highlight why these metrics seldom translate well to design problems but see frequent use due to the lack of established alternatives. Next, we curate a set of design-specific metrics which have been proposed across different research communities and can be used for evaluating deep generative models. These metrics focus on unique requirements in design and engineering, such as constraint satisfaction, functional performance, novelty, and conditioning. We structure our review and discussion as a set of practical selection criteria and usage guidelines. Throughout our discussion, we apply the metrics to models trained on simple 2-dimensional example problems. Finally, to illustrate the selection process and classic usage of the presented metrics, we evaluate three deep generative models on a multifaceted bicycle frame design problem considering performance target achievement, design novelty, and geometric constraints. We publicly release the code for the datasets, models, and metrics used throughout the paper at decode.mit.edu/projects/metrics/."}}

Calibrating dataset difficulty to viewing time", "abstract": "Humans outperform object recognizers despite the fact that models perform well on current datasets. Numerous efforts exist to make more challenging datasets by scaling up on the web, exploring distribution shift, or adding controls for biases. The difficulty of each image in each dataset is not independently evaluated, nor is the concept of dataset difficulty as a whole currently well defined. We develop a new dataset difficulty metric based on how long humans must view an image in order to classify a target object. Images whose objects can be recognized in 17ms are considered to be easier than those which require seconds of viewing time. Using 133,588 judgments on two major datasets, ImageNet and ObjectNet, we determine the distribution of image difficulties in those datasets, which we find varies wildly, but significantly undersamples hard images. Rather than hoping that distribution shift will lead to hard datasets, we should explicitly measure their difficulty. Analyzing model performance guided by image difficulty reveals that models tend to have lower performance and a larger generalization gap on harder images. We release a dataset of difficulty judgments as a complementary metric to raw performance and other behavioral/neural metrics. Such experiments with humans allow us to create a metric for progress in object recognition datasets. This metric can be used to both test the biological validity of models in a novel way, and develop tools to fill out the missing class of hard examples as datasets are being gathered."}}

We propose a novel 3D Neural Embedding Likelihood (3DNEL) over RGB-D images to address this gap. 3DNEL uses neural embeddings to predict 2D-3D correspondences from RGB and combines this with depth in a principled manner. 3DNEL is trained entirely from synthetic images and generalizes to real-world data. To showcase this capability, we develop a multi-stage inverse graphics pipeline that uses 3DNEL for 6D object pose estimation from real RGB-D images. Our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in sim-to-real pose estimation on the YCB-Video dataset, and improves robustness, with significantly fewer large-error predictions. Unlike existing bottom-up, discriminative approaches that are specialized for pose estimation, 3DNEL adopts a probabilistic generative formulation that jointly models multi-object scenes. This generative formulation enables easy extension of 3DNEL to additional tasks like object and camera tracking from video, using principled inference in the same probabilistic model without task specific retraining."}}

This sample-efficient intuitive physical reasoning is considered a core domain of human common sense knowledge. One hypothesis to explain this remarkable capacity, posits that humans quickly learn approximations to the laws of physics that govern the dynamics of the environment. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian-symbolic framework (BSP) for physical reasoning and learning that is close to human-level sample-efficiency and accuracy. In BSP, the environment is represented by a top-down generative model of entities, which are assumed to interact with each other under unknown force laws over their latent and observed properties. BSP models each of these entities as random variables, and uses Bayesian inference to estimate their unknown properties. For learning the unknown forces, BSP leverages symbolic regression on a novel grammar of Newtonian physics in a bilevel optimization setup. These inference and regression steps are performed in an iterative manner using expectation-maximization, allowing BSP to simultaneously learn force laws while maintaining uncertainty over entity properties. We show that BSP is more sample-efficient compared to neural alternatives on controlled synthetic datasets, demonstrate BSP's applicability to real-world common sense scenes and study BSP's performance on tasks previously used to study human physical reasoning.\n"}}

LINKS is made up of various components including 100 million mechanisms, the simulation data for each mechanism, normalized paths generated by each mechanism, a curated set of paths, the code used to generate the data and simulate mechanisms, and a live web demo for interactive design of linkage mechanisms. The curated paths are provided as a measure for removing biases in the paths generated by mechanisms that enable a more even design space representation. In this paper, we discuss the details of how we can generate such a large dataset and how we can overcome major issues with such scales. To be able to generate such a large dataset we introduce a new operator to generate 1-DOF mechanism topologies, furthermore, we take many steps to speed up slow simulations of mechanisms by vectorizing our simulations and parallelizing our simulator on a large number of threads, which leads to a simulation 800 times faster than the simple simulation algorithm. This is necessary given on average, 1 out of 500 candidates that are generated are valid~(and all must be simulated to determine their validity), which means billions of simulations must be performed for the generation of this dataset. Then we demonstrate the depth of our dataset through a bi-directional chamfer distance-based shape retrieval study where we show how our dataset can be used directly to find mechanisms that can trace paths very close to desired target paths."}}

Here we present a principled Bayesian solution to this benchmark, based on a hierarchically Bayesian Theory of Mind (HBToM). By including hierarchical priors on agent goals and dispositions, inference over our HBToM model enables few-shot learning of the efficiency and preferences of an agent, which can then be used in commonsense plausibility judgements about subsequent agent behavior. This approach achieves near-perfect accuracy on most benchmark tasks, outperforming deep learning and imitation learning baselines while producing interpretable human-like inferences, demonstrating the advantages of structured Bayesian models of human social cognition."}}
