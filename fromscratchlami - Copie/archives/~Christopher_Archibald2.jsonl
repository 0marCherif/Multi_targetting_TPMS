Determining this execution precision, or skill, for players is thus an important task. Knowledge of skill can be used for player feedback, computer-aided strategy decisions, game handicapping, and opponent modeling. Challenges to estimating player ability include getting precise feedback on executed actions as well as performing the estimation in a natural and user-friendly way. A previous method for estimating skill in darts overcomes the first challenge, but falls short on the second, requiring players to throw 50 darts at the center of the dartboard, which is not a common target in most darts games. In this paper we present an extension of this previous method that enables skill to be estimated when darts are aimed anywhere, not just the center of the dartboard. This method is then utilized to develop a much more efficient and adaptive skill estimation method which requires far fewer darts than the previous method. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach and additional possible applications are discussed."}}

This ability, which has been called an agent\u2019s execution skill, is an important characteristic of an agent which can have a significant impact on their success. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the execution skill of an agent given observations of that agent acting in a domain. Each observation includes the executed action and a description of the state in which the action was executed and the reward received, but notably excludes the action that the agent intended to execute. We previously introduced this problem and demonstrated that estimating an agent\u2019s execution skill is possible under certain conditions. Our previous method focused entirely on the reward that the agent received from executed actions and assumed that the agent was able to select the optimal action for each state. This paper addresses the execution skill estimation problem from an entirely different perspective, focusing instead on the action that was executed. We present a Bayesian framework for reasoning about action observations and show that it is able to outperform previous methods under the same conditions. We also show that the flexibility of this framework allows it to be applied in settings where the previous limiting assumptions are not met. The success of the proposed method is demonstrated experimentally in a toy domain as well as the domain of computational billiards."}}

An agent's execution skill significantly impacts their success as it determines how much executed actions deviate from intended actions. We introduce the problem of estimating an agent's execution skill level given only observations of their executed actions. The main difficulty is that while executed actions are observed, the intended actions are not, thus the amount of action deviation due to imperfect execution skill is not obvious. We introduce a simple experimental domain in which this problem can be studied and present a method that focuses on observed rewards to estimate execution skill. This method is experimentally evaluated and shown be able to estimate an agent's execution skill under certain conditions."}}

If there is no external knowledge about credibility then we can use the information provided by the sources to assess their credibility. In this paper, we propose a way to measure conflict in a multi-source environment as a normal measure. We examine our algorithm using three simulated examples of increasing conflict and one experimental example. The results demonstrate that the proposed measure can represent conflict in a meaningful way similar to what a human might expect and from it we can identify conflict within our sources."}}

Research has shown that novice programmers struggle with learning introductory concepts and find it difficult to monitor their own progress. Teachers often have hundreds of students and multiple sections of programming courses to teach, making it infeasible to provide the amount of independent feedback each student may need to flourish. With limited instructor feedback, students who can self-monitor and self-assess their programming metacognition have a higher chance of developing a process for solving programming challenges. In this paper, we expand on the literate programming paradigm by using natural language processing and machine learning methods to automatically analyze and classify student programming metacognition levels through their source code comments. Our intent is to ultimately integrate our classification models into an interactive developer environment to provide real-time feedback to students about their metacognition while learning to program."}}

Billiards, or pool, is one such domain that has been the focus of several research efforts aimed at designing AI agents to play successfully. Due to the continuous nature of the actions, it is natural to believe that the more time an agent has to investigate actions, the better it will perform. This paper gives a thorough description of a successful agent with a novel distributed architecture, designed for being able to grant further time for shot simulation and analysis through the utilization of many CPUs. A brief analysis of the distributed component of the agent is presented, as well as how much the extra time thus obtained contributed to its success, especially when compared to its other novel components. The described agent, CueCard, won the Computer Olympiad computational pool tournament held in 2008."}}
