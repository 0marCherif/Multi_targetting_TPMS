In this paper, we quantify the shooting pattern via the field goal attempts and percentages over twelve non-overlapping regions around the front court. A joint Bayesian nonparametric mixture model is developed to find latent clusters of players based on their shooting patterns. We apply our proposed model to learn the heterogeneity among selected players from the National Basketball Association (NBA) games over the 2018\u20132019 regular season and 2019\u20132020 bubble season. Thirteen clusters are identified for 2018\u20132019 regular season and seven clusters are identified for 2019\u20132020 bubble season. We further examine the shooting patterns of players in these clusters and discuss their relation to players\u2019 other available information. The results shed new insights on the effect of NBA COVID bubble and may provide useful guidance for player\u2019s shot selection and team\u2019s in-game and recruiting strategy planning.\n"}}
