To enable the efficient processing of hypergraph data, several hypergraph neural network platforms have been proposed for learning hypergraph properties and structure, with a special focus on node classification tasks. However, almost all existing methods use heuristic propagation rules and offer suboptimal performance on benchmarking datasets. We propose AllSet, a new hypergraph neural network paradigm that represents a highly general framework for (hyper)graph neural networks and for the first time implements hypergraph neural network layers as compositions of two multiset functions that can be efficiently learned for each task and each dataset. The proposed AllSet framework also for the first time integrates Deep Sets and Set Transformers with hypergraph neural networks for the purpose of learning multiset functions and therefore allows for significant modeling flexibility and high expressive power. To evaluate the performance of AllSet, we conduct the most extensive experiments to date involving ten known benchmarking datasets and three newly curated datasets that represent significant challenges for hypergraph node classification. The results demonstrate that our method has the unique ability to either match or outperform all other hypergraph neural networks across the tested datasets: As an example, the performance improvements over existing methods and a new method based on heterogeneous graph neural networks are close to $4\\%$ on the Yelp and Zoo datasets, and $3\\%$ on the Walmart dataset."}}

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to exploit both sources of evidence but they do not optimally trade-off their utility and integrate them in a manner that is also universal. Here, universality refers to independence on homophily or heterophily graph assumptions. We address these issues by introducing a new Generalized PageRank (GPR) GNN architecture that adaptively learns the GPR weights so as to jointly optimize node feature and topological information extraction, regardless of the extent to which the node labels are homophilic or heterophilic. Learned GPR weights automatically adjust to the node label pattern, irrelevant on the type of initialization, and thereby guarantee excellent learning performance for label patterns that are usually hard to handle. Furthermore, they allow one to avoid feature over-smoothing, a process which renders feature information nondiscriminative, without requiring the network to be shallow. Our accompanying theoretical analysis of the GPR-GNN method is facilitated by novel synthetic benchmark datasets generated by the so-called contextual stochastic block model. We also compare the performance of our GNN architecture with that of several state-of-the-art GNNs on the problem of node-classification, using well-known benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets. The results demonstrate that GPR-GNN offers significant performance improvement compared to existing techniques on both synthetic and benchmark data."}}

To enable data interpretability, a constrained version of MF, termed convex MF, was introduced in Ding et al., 2010. In the latter work, the basis vectors are required to lie in the convex hull of the data samples, thereby ensuring that every basis can be interpreted as a weighted combination of data samples. No current algorithmic solutions for online convex MF are known as it is challenging to find adequate convex bases without having access to the complete dataset. We address both problems by proposing the first online convex MF algorithm that maintains a collection of constant-size sets of representative data samples needed for interpreting each of the basis (Ding et al., 2010) and has the same almost sure convergence guarantees as the online learning algorithm of Mairal et al., 2010. Our proof techniques combine random coordinate descent algorithms with specialized quasi-martingale convergence analysis. Experiments on synthetic and real world datasets show significant computational savings of the proposed online convex MF method compared to classical convex MF. Since the proposed method maintains small representative sets of data samples needed for convex interpretations, it is related to a body of work in theoretical computer science, pertaining to generating point sets (Blum et al., 2016), and in computer vision, pertaining to archetypal analysis (Mei et al., 2018).
