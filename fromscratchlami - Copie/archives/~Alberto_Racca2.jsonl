We train the ESNs on small datasets that lack information about the extreme events. We asses whether the networks are able to extrapolate from the small imperfect datasets and predict the heavy-tail statistics that describe the events. We find that the networks correctly predict the events and improve the statistics of the system with respect to the training data in almost all cases analysed. This opens up new possibilities for the statistical prediction of extreme events in turbulence."}}

Echo State Networks (ESNs), which are a class of Reservoir Computing, can accurately predict the chaotic dynamics well beyond the predictability time. Existing studies, however, also showed that small changes in the hyperparameters may markedly affect the network\u2019s performance. The overarching aim of this paper is to improve the robustness in the selection of hyperparameters in Echo State Networks for the time-accurate prediction of chaotic solutions. We define the robustness of a validation strategy as its ability to select hyperparameters that perform consistently between validation and test sets. The goal is three-fold. First, we investigate routinely used validation strategies. Second, we propose the Recycle Validation, and the chaotic versions of existing validation strategies, to specifically tackle the forecasting of chaotic systems. Third, we compare Bayesian optimization with the traditional grid search for optimal hyperparameter selection. Numerical tests are performed on prototypical nonlinear systems that have chaotic and quasiperiodic solutions, such as the Lorenz and Lorenz-96 systems, and the Kuznetsov oscillator. Both model-free and model-informed Echo State Networks are analysed. By comparing the networks\u2019 performance in learning chaotic (unpredictable) versus quasiperiodic (predictable) solutions, we highlight fundamental challenges in learning chaotic solutions. The proposed validation strategies, which are based on the dynamical systems properties of chaotic time series, are shown to outperform the state-of-the-art validation strategies. Because the strategies are principled \u2013 they are based on chaos theory such as the Lyapunov time \u2013 they can be applied to other Recurrent Neural Networks architectures with little modification. This work opens up new possibilities for the robust design and application of Echo State Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks, to the time-accurate prediction of chaotic systems."}}
