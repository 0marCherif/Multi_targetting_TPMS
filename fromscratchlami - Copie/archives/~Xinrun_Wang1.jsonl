Various schemes are proposed to address the generalization issues, including transfer learning, multi-task learning, meta learning, as well as robust and adversarial reinforcement learning. However, there is not a unified formulation of various schemes and comprehensive comparisons of methods across different schemes. In this work, we propound GiRL, a game-theoretic framework for generalization in reinforcement learning, where a RL agent is trained against an adversary over a set of tasks, over which the adversary can manipulate the distributions within a given threshold. With different configurations, GiRL is capable of reducing the various schemes mentioned above. To solve GiRL, we adapt the widely-used method in game theory, policy space response oracle (PSRO) framework with three significant modifications as follows: i) we adopt model-agnostic meta learning (MAML) as the best-response oracle, ii) we propose a modified projected replicated dynamics, i.e., R-PRD, which ensures the computed meta-strategy for the adversary falls in the threshold, and iii) we also propose a protocol of few-shot learning for multiple strategies during testing. Extensive experiments on MuJoCo environments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, e.g., MAML."}}

In the commonly-used bilevel optimization formulation, the shared parameter is learned in the outer loop by minimizing the average loss over all tasks. However, the converged solution may be comprised in that it only focuses on optimizing on a small subset of tasks. To alleviate this problem, we consider meta-learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, in which each task is an objective. However, existing MOO solvers need to access all the objectives\u2019 gradients in each iteration, and cannot scale to the huge number of tasks in typical meta-learning settings. To alleviate this problem, we propose a scalable gradient-based solver with the use of mini-batch. We provide theoretical guarantees on the Pareto optimality or Pareto stationarity of the converged solution. Empirical studies on various machine learning settings demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient, and achieves better performance than the baselines, particularly on improving the performance of the poorly-performing tasks and thus alleviating the compromising phenomenon."}}

To this end, the premise is to obtain the optimal policies of a set of finite-agent games with different population sizes. However, either deriving the closed-form solution for each game is theoretically intractable, training a distinct policy for each game is computationally intensive, or directly applying the policy trained in a game to other games is sub-optimal. We address these challenges through the \\textbf{P}opulation-size-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization (PAPO). Our contributions are three-fold. First, to efficiently generate efficient policies for games with different population sizes, we propose PAPO, which unifies two natural options (augmentation and hypernetwork) and achieves significantly better performance. PAPO consists of three components: i) the population-size encoding which transforms the original value of population size to an equivalent encoding to avoid training collapse, ii) a hypernetwork to generate a distinct policy for each game conditioned on the population size, and iii) the population size as an additional input to the generated policy. Next, we construct a multi-task-based training procedure to efficiently train the neural networks of PAPO by sampling data from multiple games with different population sizes. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple environments show the significant superiority of PAPO over baselines, and the analysis of the evolution of the generated policies further deepens our understanding of the two fields of finite-agent and infinite-agent games.

Offline RL proved very successful, paving a path to solving previously intractable real-world problems, and we aim to generalize this paradigm to a multi-agent or multiplayer-game setting. To this end, we formally introduce a problem of offline equilibrium finding (OEF) and construct multiple datasets across a wide range of games using several established methods. To solve the OEF problem, we design a model-based method that can directly apply any online equilibrium finding algorithm to the OEF setting while making minimal changes. We focus on three most prominent contemporary online equilibrium finding algorithms and adapt them to the OEF setting, creating three model-based variants: OEF-PSRO and OEF-CFR, which generalize the widely-used algorithms PSRO and Deep CFR to compute Nash equilibria (NEs), and OEF-JPSRO, which generalizes the JPSRO to calculate (Coarse) Correlated equilibria ((C)CEs). We further improve their performance by combining the behavior cloning policy with the model-based policy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over multiple model-based and model-free offline RL algorithms and the necessity of the model-based method for solving OEF problems. We hope that our efforts may help to accelerate research in large-scale equilibrium finding. "}}

Recently, reinforcement learning in financial markets (FinRL) has emerged as a promising direction to train agents for making profitable investment decisions. However, the evaluation of most FinRL methods only focuses on profit-related measures, which are far from satisfactory for practitioners to deploy these methods into real-world financial markets. Therefore, we introduce PRUDEX-Compass, which has 6 axes, i.e., Profitability, Risk-control, Universality, Diversity, rEliability, and eXplainability, with a total of 17 measures for a systematic evaluation. Specifically, i) we propose AlphaMix+ as a strong FinRL baseline, which leverages mixture-of-experts (MoE) and risk-sensitive approaches to make diversified risk-aware investment decisions, ii) we evaluate 8 FinRL methods in 4 long-term real-world datasets of influential financial markets to demonstrate the usage of our PRUDEX-Compass, iii) PRUDEX-Compass1 together with 4 real-world datasets, standard implementation of 8 FinRL methods and a portfolio management RL environment is released as public resources to facilitate the design and comparison of new FinRL methods. We hope that PRUDEX-Compass can shed light on future FinRL research to prevent untrustworthy results from stagnating FinRL into successful industry deployment."}}

However, the indirect gradient terms are time-consuming to calculate, and the convergence rate is also relatively slow.  To alleviates these challenges, we find that in the Deterministic Policy Gradient family, by removing the terms that contain Hessian matrices and adopting the block diagonal approximation technique to approximate the remaining inverse matrices, we can construct an approximated Stackelberg AC learning scheme that is easy to compute and fast to converge.

Specifically, we first learn the return distributions of individuals to analytically calculate CVaR for decentralized execution. Then, to handle the temporal nature of the stochastic outcomes during executions, we propose a dynamic risk level predictor for risk level tuning. Finally, we optimize the CVaR policies with CVaR values used to estimate the target in TD error during centralized training and the CVaR values are used as auxiliary local rewards to update the local distribution via Quantile Regression loss.

GAN is essentially a two-player zero-sum game between the generator and the discriminator. Training GANs is challenging as a pure Nash equilibrium may not exist and even finding the mixed Nash equilibrium is difficult as GANs have a large-scale strategy space. In DO-GAN, we extend the double oracle framework to GANs. We first generalize the player strategies as the trained models of generator and discriminator from the best response oracles. We then compute the meta-strategies using a linear program. Next, we prune the weakly-dominated player strategies to keep the oracles from becoming intractable. We apply our framework to established architectures such as vanilla GAN, Deep Convolutional GAN, Spectral Normalization GAN and Stacked GAN. Finally, we conduct evaluations on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets and show that DO-GAN variants have significant improvements in both subjective qualitative evaluation and quantitative metrics, compared with their respective GAN architectures."}}

However, in many cases of the real world, agents are self-interested such as employees in a company and clubs in a league. Therefore, the leader, i.e., the manager of the company or the league, needs to provide bonuses to followers for efficient coordination, which we call expensive coordination. The main difficulties of expensive coordination are that i) the leader has to consider the long-term effect and predict the followers' behaviors when assigning bonuses and ii) the complex interactions between followers make the training process hard to converge, especially when the leader's policy changes with time. In this work, we address this problem through an event-based deep RL approach. Our main contributions are threefold. (1) We model the leader's decision-making process as a semi-Markov Decision Process and propose a novel multi-agent event-based policy gradient to learn the leader's long-term policy. (2) We exploit the leader-follower consistency scheme to design a follower-aware module and a follower-specific attention module to predict the followers' behaviors and make accurate response to their behaviors. (3) We propose an action abstraction-based policy gradient algorithm to reduce the followers' decision space and thus accelerate the training process of followers. Experiments in resource collections, navigation, and the predator-prey game reveal that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods dramatically."}}
