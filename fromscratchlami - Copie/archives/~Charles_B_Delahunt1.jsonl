However, as with other visualization-based diagnoses, accuracy depends on individual technician performance, making standardization difficult and reliability poor. Automated image recognition based on machine-learning, utilizing convolutional neural networks, offers potential to overcome these drawbacks. A prototype digital microscope device employing an algorithm based on machine-learning, the Autoscope, was assessed for its potential in malaria microscopy. Autoscope was tested in the Iquitos region of Peru in 2016 at two peripheral health facilities, with routine microscopy and PCR as reference standards. The main outcome measures include sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of malaria from Giemsa-stained blood films, using PCR as reference.\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional, observational trial was conducted at two peripheral primary health facilities in Peru. 700 participants were enrolled with the criteria: (1) age between 5 and 75 years, (2) history of fever in the last 3 days or elevated temperature on admission, (3) informed consent. The main outcome measures included sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of malaria from Giemsa-stained blood films, using PCR as reference.\n\nResults\nAt the San Juan clinic, sensitivity of Autoscope for diagnosing malaria was 72% (95% CI 64\u201380%), and specificity was 85% (95% CI 79\u201390%). Microscopy performance was similar to Autoscope, with sensitivity 68% (95% CI 59\u201376%) and specificity 100% (95% CI 98\u2013100%). At San Juan, 85% of prepared slides had a minimum of 600 WBCs imaged, thus meeting Autoscope\u2019s design assumptions. At the second clinic, Santa Clara, the sensitivity of Autoscope was 52% (95% CI 44\u201360%) and specificity was 70% (95% CI 64\u201376%). Microscopy performance at Santa Clara was 42% (95% CI 34\u201351) and specificity was 97% (95% CI 94\u201399). Only 39% of slides from Santa Clara met Autoscope\u2019s design assumptions regarding WBCs imaged.\n\nConclusions\nAutoscope\u2019s diagnostic performance was on par with routine microscopy when slides had adequate blood volume to meet its design assumptions, as represented by results from the San Juan clinic. Autoscope\u2019s diagnostic performance was poorer than routine microscopy on slides from the Santa Clara clinic, which generated slides with lower blood volumes. Results of the study reflect both the potential for artificial intelligence to perform tasks currently conducted by highly-trained experts, and the challenges of replicating the adaptiveness of human thought processes."}}

Their neural circuits need to maintain function despite injury, which in particular requires preserving key system outputs. In this work, we explore whether and how certain\nstructural and functional neuronal network motifs act as injury mitigation mechanisms. Specifically, we examine how (i) Hebbian learning, (ii) high levels of noise, and (iii) parallel inhibitory and excitatory connections contribute to the robustness of the olfactory system in the Manduca sexta moth. We simulate injuries on a detailed computational model of the moth olfactory network calibrated to data.\nThe injuries are modeled on focal axonal swellings, a ubiquitous form of axonal pathology observed in traumatic brain injuries and other brain disorders. Axonal swellings effectively compromise spike train propagation along the axon, reducing the effective neural firing rate delivered to downstream neurons. All three of the network motifs examined significantly mitigate the effects of injury on readout neurons, either by reducing injury\u2019s impact on readout neuron responses or by restoring these responses to pre-injury levels. These motifs may thus be partially explained by their value as adaptive mechanisms to minimize the functional effects of neural injury. More generally, robustness to injury is a vital design principle to consider when analyzing neural systems."}}

Automated parasite detection and quantification may address this issue.\n\nMethods\nA multi-centre, observational study was conducted during 2018 and 2019 at 11 sites to assess the performance of the EasyScan Go, a microscopy device employing machine-learning-based image analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of species detection and parasite density estimation were assessed with expert microscopy as the reference. Intra- and inter-device reliability of the device was also evaluated by comparing results from repeat reads on the same and two different devices. This study has been reported in accordance with the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic accuracy studies (STARD) checklist.\n\nResults\nIn total, 2250 Giemsa-stained blood films were prepared and read independently by expert microscopists and the EasyScan Go device. The diagnostic sensitivity of EasyScan Go was 91.1% (95% CI 88.9\u201392.7), and specificity 75.6% (95% CI 73.1\u201378.0). With good quality slides sensitivity was similar (89.1%, 95%CI 86.2\u201391.5), but specificity increased to 85.1% (95% CI 82.6\u201387.4). Sensitivity increased with parasitaemia rising from 57% at < 200 parasite/\u00b5L, to > 90% at 200\u2013200,000 parasite/\u00b5L. Species were identified accurately in 93% of Plasmodium falciparum samples (kappa = 0.76, 95% CI 0.69\u20130.83), and in 92% of Plasmodium vivax samples (kappa = 0.73, 95% CI 0.66\u20130.80). Parasite density estimates by the EasyScan Go were within +/- 25% of the microscopic reference counts in 23% of slides.\n\nConclusions\nThe performance of the EasyScan Go in parasite detection and species identification accuracy fulfil WHO-TDR Research Malaria Microscopy competence level 2 criteria. In terms of parasite quantification and false positive rate, it meets the level 4 WHO-TDR Research Malaria Microscopy criteria. All performance parameters were significantly affected by slide quality. Further software improvement is required to improve sensitivity at low parasitaemia and parasite density estimations."}}

However, current ML efforts largely neglect crucial use case constraints and are thus not clinically useful. Two factors in particular are crucial to developing algorithms translatable to clinical field settings: (i) Clear understanding of the clinical needs that ML solutions must accommodate; and (ii) task-relevant metrics for guiding and evaluating ML models. Neglect of these factors has seriously hampered past ML work on malaria, because the resulting algorithms do not align with clinical needs. In this paper we address these two issues in the context of automated malaria diagnosis via microscopy on Giemsa-stained blood films. First, we describe why domain expertise is crucial to effectively apply ML to malaria, and list technical documents and other resources that provide this domain knowledge. Second, we detail performance metrics tailored to the clinical requirements of malaria diagnosis, to guide development of ML models and evaluate model performance through the lens of clinical needs (versus a generic ML lens). We highlight the importance of a patient-level perspective, interpatient variability, false positive rates, limit of detection, and different types of error. We also discuss reasons why ROC curves, AUC, and F1, as commonly used in ML work, are poorly suited to this context. These findings also apply to other diseases involving parasite loads, including neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as schistosomiasis."}}

The library of candidate terms is extended for the identification of actuated systems, partial differential equations (PDEs), and implicit differential equations. Robust formulations, including the integral form of SINDy and ensembling techniques, are also implemented to improve performance for real-world data. Finally, we provide a range of new optimization algorithms, including several sparse regression techniques and algorithms to enforce and promote inequality constraints and stability.

(2014). They found that the preferences of the rich correlated strongly with policy outcomes, while the preferences of the general population did not, except via a linkage with rich people's preferences. Their analysis applied the tools of classical statistical inference, in particular logistic regression. In this paper we analyze the Gilens dataset using the complementary tools of Random Forest classifiers (RFs), from Machine Learning. We present two primary findings, concerning respectively prediction and inference: (i) Holdout test sets can be predicted with approximately 70% balanced accuracy by models that consult only the preferences of rich people and a small number of powerful interest groups, as well as policy area labels. These results include retrodiction, where models trained on pre-1997 cases predicted \"future\" (post-1997) cases. The 20% gain in accuracy over baseline (chance), in this detailed but noisy dataset, indicates the high importance of a few wealthy players in U.S. policy outcomes, and aligns with a body of research indicating that the U.S. government has significant plutocratic tendencies. (ii) The feature selection methods of RF models identify especially salient subsets of interest groups (economic players). These can be used to further investigate the dynamics of governmental policy making, and also offer an example of the potential value of RF feature selection methods for inference on datasets such as this."}}
