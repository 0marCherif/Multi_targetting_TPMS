However, due to the lack of depth information, existing volumetric-based techniques simply duplicate 2D image features of the object surface along the entire camera ray. We contend this duplication introduces noise in empty and occluded spaces, posing challenges for producing high-quality 3D geometry. Drawing inspiration from traditional multi-view stereo methods, we propose an end-to-end 3D neural reconstruction framework CVRecon, designed to exploit the rich geometric embedding in the cost volumes to facilitate 3D geometric feature learning. Furthermore, we present Ray-contextual Compensated Cost Volume (RCCV), a novel 3D geometric feature representation that encodes view-dependent information with improved integrity and robustness. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the reconstruction quality in various metrics and recovers clear fine details of the 3D geometries. Our extensive ablation studies provide insights into the development of effective 3D geometric feature learning schemes. Project page: https://cvrecon.ziyue.cool/"}}

We tackle this challenging problem with a scalable yet powerful approach, where we first optimize a latent representation that disentangles radiance fields and camera poses. This latent representation is then used to learn a generative model that enables both unconditional and conditional generation of 3D scenes. Our model generalizes previous works that focus on single objects by removing the assumption that the camera pose distribution can be shared across samples. We show that GAUDI obtains state-of-the-art performance in the unconditional generative setting across multiple datasets and allows for conditional generation of 3D scenes given conditioning variables like sparse image observations or text that describes the scene."}}

We propose a simple yet effective approach that is neither continuous nor implicit, challenging recent trends on view synthesis. Our approach explicitly encodes observations into a volumetric representation that enables amortized rendering. We demonstrate that although continuous radiance field representations have gained a lot of attention due to their expressive power, our simple approach obtains comparable or even better novel view reconstruction quality comparing with state-of-the-art baselines [49] while increasing rendering speed by over 400x. Our model is trained in a category-agnostic manner and does not require scene-specific optimization. Therefore, it is able to generalize novel view synthesis to object categories not seen during training. In addition, we show that with our simple formulation, we can use view synthesis as a self-supervision signal for efficient learning of 3D geometry without explicit 3D supervision."}}

Our method, named MetricOpt, operates in a black-box setting where the computational details of the target metric are unknown. We achieve this by learning a differentiable value function, which maps compact task-specific model parameters to metric observations. The learned value function is easily pluggable into existing optimizers like SGD and Adam, and is effective for rapidly finetuning a pre-trained model. This leads to consistent improvements since the value function provides effective metric supervision during finetuning, and helps to correct the potential bias of loss-only supervision. MetricOpt achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of metrics for (image) classification, image retrieval and object detection. Solid benefits are found over competing methods, which often involve complex loss design or adaptation. MetricOpt also generalizes well to new tasks and model architectures."}}

Unlike previous works which explicitly model environmental changes, we analyze the relationship between the value function and the optimal exploration for a Gaussian-parameterized policy and show that our theory leads to an effective strategy for adjusting the variance of the policy, enabling fast adapt to changes in a variety of sparse-reward environments."}}
