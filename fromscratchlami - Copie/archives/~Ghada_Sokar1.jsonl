Despite its superiority to classical methods, it requires many training iterations to converge and detect the informative features. For datasets with a large number of samples or a very high dimensional feature space, the computational time becomes prohibitively long. In this paper, we present a new efficient unsupervised method for feature selection based on sparse autoencoders. In particular, we propose a new sparse training algorithm that optimizes a model's sparse topology during training to quickly pay attention to informative features. The attention-based adaptation of the sparse topology enables fast detection of informative features after a few training iterations. We performed extensive experiments on 10 datasets of different types, including image, speech, text, artificial, and biological. They cover a wide range of characteristics, such as low and high-dimensional feature spaces, as well as few and large training samples. Our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the selection of informative features while reducing training iterations and computational costs substantially. Moreover, the experiments show the robustness of our method in extremely noisy environments."}}

Feature selection, which identifies the most relevant and informative attributes of a dataset, has been introduced as a solution to this problem. Most of the existing feature selection methods are computationally inefficient; inefficient algorithms lead to high energy consumption, which is not desirable for devices with limited computational and energy resources. In this paper, a novel and flexible method for unsupervised feature selection is proposed. This method, named QuickSelection (The code is available at: https://github.com/zahraatashgahi/QuickSelection), introduces the strength of the neuron in sparse neural networks as a criterion to measure the feature importance. This criterion, blended with sparsely connected denoising autoencoders trained with the sparse evolutionary training procedure, derives the importance of all input features simultaneously. We implement QuickSelection in a purely sparse manner as opposed to the typical approach of using a binary mask over connections to simulate sparsity. It results in a considerable speed increase and memory reduction. When tested on several benchmark datasets, including five low-dimensional and three high-dimensional datasets, the proposed method is able to achieve the best trade-off of classification and clustering accuracy, running time, and maximum memory usage, among widely used approaches for feature selection. Besides, our proposed method requires the least amount of energy among the state-of-the-art autoencoder-based feature selection methods."}}

Existing research largely focuses on alleviating the catastrophic forgetting problem. There, an agent is altered to prevent forgetting based solely on previous tasks. This hinders the balance between preventing forgetting and maximizing the forward transfer. In response to this, we investigate the stability-plasticity dilemma to determine which model components are eligible to be reused, added, fixed, or updated to achieve this balance. We address the class incremental learning scenario where the agent is prone to ambiguities between old and new classes. With our proposed Knowledge-Aware contiNual learner (KAN), we demonstrate that considering the semantic similarity between old and new classes helps in achieving this balance. We show that being aware of existing knowledge helps in: (1) increasing the forward transfer from similar knowledge, (2) reducing the required capacity by leveraging existing knowledge, (3) protecting dissimilar knowledge, and (4) increasing robustness to the class order in the sequence. We evaluated sequences of similar tasks, dissimilar tasks, and a mix of both constructed from the two commonly used benchmarks for class-incremental learning; CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100."}}

In this paper, we introduce for the first time a dynamic sparse training approach for deep reinforcement learning to accelerate the training process. The proposed approach trains a sparse neural network from scratch and dynamically adapts its topology to the changing data distribution during training. Experiments on continuous control tasks show that our dynamic sparse agents achieve higher performance than the equivalent dense methods, reduce the parameter count and floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 50%, and have a faster learning speed that enables reaching the performance of dense agents with 40-50% reduction in the training steps."}}
