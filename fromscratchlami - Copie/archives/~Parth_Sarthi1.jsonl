Considering\nthe growing trend of using these interventions on ADHD individuals and probable positive effects of these\ninterventions on ADHD symptoms, this review paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of these interventions on\nchildren and adolescents with ADHD through the review of earlier studies. Though findings suggest Yoga and\nmindfulness are effective in reducing ADHD symptoms, improving sleep, anxiety, and parent-child relationship,\nindicating that these treatments can be very economical and effective management tools for ADHD diagnosed\nchildren and adolescents and their families, these findings cannot be generalized due to significant methodological\nlimitations. Further extensive, methodologically rigorous research is needed to verify the effectiveness of these\nmodalities on ADHD children."}}

An individual\u2019s mental health affects his/her adaptation to the\ndisease. Mental health issues and TB both are inextricably connected and research into this area will provide an opportunity to develop\na more holistic model of TB treatment and prevention. Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of mental health\nissues in patients with TB and its influence on individual perception of well\u2011being with an emphasis on psychopathology as a major\nobstacle to treatment adherence. Research into this area will provide an opportunity to develop a more holistic model of TB treatment\nand prevention. Settings and Design: Primary data were collected with the help of ASHA workers, and primary survey\u2011based study\nwas designed. Methods and Material: A total of 249 diagnosed Tuberculosis cases were included in the study. A digitalized version\nof the PGIHQN\u20111 questionnaire was made and used to separate the psychiatric population from the normal group. Asha workers\nwere trained to use the digital version on tablets. Statistical Analysis Used: Using Microsoft Excel, Graphic Tables, and corelation\nwere done using SPSS Statistics. Results: Mental health issues were found in diagnosed TB cases, which required further evaluations.\nAlong with mental health issues, limited resources, gender, limited education, lack of proper knowledge about the disease, having\nresponsibilities (Marital status), locality were found to be the important factors that complicate TB outcomes, hence should be taken\ninto consideration while imparting psychological interventions. Conclusion: Mental health issues complicate TB outcome and hence\nneed to be properly addressed, and thorough psychoeducation, psychological first aid (listen, protect, connect, model& teach), and\ntimely intervention in the form of proper diagnosis and specific treatment and rehabilitation are needed."}}
