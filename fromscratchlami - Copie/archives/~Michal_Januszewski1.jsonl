The cost of storing such data is a significant barrier to broadening the use of connectomic approaches and scaling to even larger volumes. We present an image compression approach that uses machine learning-based denoising and standard image codecs to compress raw electron microscopy imagery of neuropil up to 17-fold with negligible loss of 3d reconstruction and synaptic detection accuracy."}}

Interpreting reconstructions at this scale demands advances in the automated analysis of neuronal morphologies, for example by identifying morphological and functional subcompartments within neurons. We present a method that for the first time uses full 3d input (voxels) to automatically classify reconstructed neuron fragments as axon, dendrite, or somal subcompartments. Based on 3d convolutional neural networks, this method achieves a mean f1-score of 0.972, exceeding the previous state of the art of 0.955. The resulting predictions can support multiple analysis and proofreading applications. In particular, we leverage finely localized subcompartment predictions for automated detection and correction of merge errors in the volume reconstruction, successfully detecting 90.6% of inter-class merge errors with a false positive rate of only 2.7%."}}

In this paper we present how to accelerate this kind of numerical calculations with popular NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units using the CUDA programming environment. We address general aspects of numerical programming on stream processors and illustrate them by two examples: the noisy phase dynamics in a Josephson junction and the noisy Kuramoto model. In presented cases the measured speedup can be as high as 675\u00d7 compared to a typical CPU, which corresponds to several billion integration steps per second. This means that calculations which took weeks can now be completed in less than one hour. This brings stochastic simulation to a completely new level, opening for research a whole new range of problems which can now be solved interactively."}}

We enhanced the training procedure of an unsupervised image-to-image translation method with additional components derived from an automated neuron segmentation approach. We show that this method, Segmentation-Enhanced CycleGAN (SECGAN), enables near perfect reconstruction accuracy on a benchmark connectomics segmentation dataset despite operating in a \"zero-shot\" setting in which the segmentation model was trained using only volumetric labels from a different dataset and imaging method. By reducing or eliminating the need for novel ground truth annotations, SECGANs alleviate one of the main practical burdens involved in pursuing automated reconstruction of volume electron microscopy data."}}

Automated approaches have been developed for tracing, but their error rates are too high to generate reliable circuit diagrams without extensive human proofreading. We present flood-filling networks, a method for automated segmentation that, similar to most previous efforts, uses convolutional neural networks, but contains in addition a recurrent pathway that allows the iterative optimization and extension of individual neuronal processes. We used flood-filling networks to trace neurons in a dataset obtained by serial block-face electron microscopy of a zebra finch brain. Using our method, we achieved a mean error-free neurite path length of 1.1\u2009mm, and we observed only four mergers in a test set with a path length of 97\u2009mm. The performance of flood-filling networks was an order of magnitude better than that of previous approaches applied to this dataset, although with substantially increased computational costs."}}

Prior work has varied the complexity and approach employed in these two steps, including the incorporation of multi-layer neural networks to perform boundary prediction, and the use of global optimizations during pixel clustering. We propose a unified and end-to-end trainable machine learning approach, flood-filling networks, in which a recurrent 3d convolutional network directly produces individual segments from a raw image. The proposed approach robustly segments images with an unknown and variable number of objects as well as highly variable object sizes. We demonstrate the approach on a challenging 3d image segmentation task, connectomic reconstruction from volume electron microscopy data, on which flood-filling neural networks substantially improve accuracy over other state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach can replace complex multi-step segmentation pipelines with a single neural network that is learned end-to-end."}}

In this work we show how this type of analysis can be significantly accelerated through the use of modern GPUs. We illustrate this with a concrete example of free energy calculation in multi-band iron-based superconductors, known to exhibit a superconducting state with oscillating order parameter (OP). Our approach can also be used for classical BCS-type superconductors. With a customized algorithm and compiler tuning we are able to achieve a 19\u00d7speedup compared to the CPU (119\u00d7compared to a single CPU core), reducing calculation time from minutes to mere seconds, enabling the analysis of larger systems and the elimination of finite size effects.
