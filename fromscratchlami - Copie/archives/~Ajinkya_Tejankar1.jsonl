It was shown that an adversary can poison a small part of the unlabeled data so that when a victim trains an SSL model on it, the final model will have a backdoor that the adversary can exploit. This work aims to defend self-supervised learning against such attacks. We use a three-step defense pipeline, where we first train a model on the poisoned data. In the second step, our proposed defense algorithm (PatchSearch) uses the trained model to search the training data for poisoned samples and removes them from the training set. In the third step, a final model is trained on the cleaned-up training set. Our results show that PatchSearch is an effective defense. As an example, it improves a model's accuracy on images containing the trigger from 38.2% to 63.7% which is very close to the clean model's accuracy, 64.6%. Moreover, we show that PatchSearch outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art defense approaches including those using additional clean, trusted data.

As their design is quite different compared to CNNs, it is interesting to study if transformers are vulnerable to backdoor attacks and how different transformer architectures affect attack success rates. Backdoor attacks happen when an attacker poisons a small part of the training images with a specific trigger or backdoor which will be activated later. The model performance is good on clean test images, but the attacker can manipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger on an image at test time. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of state-of-the-art architectures through the lens of backdoor robustness, specifically how attention mechanisms affect robustness. We show that the popular vision transformer architecture (ViT) is the least robust architecture and ResMLP, which belongs to a class called Feed Forward Networks (FFN), is the most robust one to backdoor attacks among state-of-the-art architectures. We also find an intriguing difference between transformers and CNNs \u2013 interpretation algorithms effectively highlight the trigger on test images for transformers but not for CNNs. Based on this observation, we find that a test-time image blocking defense reduces the attack success rate by a large margin for transformers. We also show that such blocking mechanisms can be incorporated during the training process to improve robustness even further. We believe our experimental findings will encourage the community to understand the building block components in  developing novel architectures robust to backdoor attacks."}}

State-of-the-art self-supervised methods for learning representations from images (e.g., MoCo, BYOL, MSF) use an inductive bias that random augmentations (e.g., random crops) of an image should produce similar embeddings. We show that such methods are vulnerable to backdoor attacks - where an attacker poisons a small part of the unlabeled data by adding a trigger (image patch chosen by the attacker) to the images. The model performance is good on clean test images, but the attacker can manipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger at test time. Backdoor attacks have been studied extensively in supervised learning and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study them for self-supervised learning. Backdoor attacks are more practical in self-supervised learning, since the use of large unlabeled data makes data inspection to remove poisons prohibitive. We show that in our targeted attack, the attacker can produce many false positives for the target category by using the trigger at test time. We also propose a defense method based on knowledge distillation that succeeds in neutralizing the attack. Our code is available here: https://github.com/UMBCvisionISSL-Backdoor"}}

Some recent self-supervised learning methods like mean-shift (MSF) cluster images by pulling the embedding of a query image to be closer to its nearest neighbors (NNs). Since most NNs are close to the query by design, the averaging may not affect the embedding of the query much. On the other hand, far away NNs may not be semantically related to the query. We generalize the mean-shift idea by constraining the search space of NNs using another source of knowledge so that NNs are far from the query while still being semantically related. We show that our method (1) outperforms MSF in SSL setting when the constraint utilizes a different augmentation of an image from the previous epoch, and (2) outperforms PAWS in semi-supervised setting with less training resources when the constraint ensures that the NNs have the same pseudo-label as the query.

Inspired by the recent success of self-supervised learning (SSL), we develop a non-contrastive representation learning method that can exploit additional knowledge. This additional knowledge may come from annotated labels in the supervised setting or an SSL model from another modality in the SSL setting. Our main idea is to generalize the mean-shift algorithm by constraining the search space of nearest neighbors, resulting in semantically purer representations.\nOur method simply pulls the embedding of an instance closer to its nearest neighbors in a search space that is constrained using the additional knowledge. By leveraging this non-contrastive loss, we show that the supervised ImageNet-1k pretraining with our method results in better transfer performance as compared to the baselines. Further, we demonstrate that our method is relatively robust to label noise. Finally, we show that it is possible to use the noisy constraint across modalities to train self-supervised video models."}}

We argue that not all negative images are equally negative. Hence, we introduce a self-supervised learning algorithm where we use a soft similarity for the negative images rather than a binary distinction between positive and negative pairs. We iteratively distill a slowly evolving teacher model to the student model by capturing the similarity of a query image to some random images and transferring that knowledge to the student. Specifically, our method should handle unbalanced and unlabeled data better than existing contrastive learning methods, because the randomly chosen negative set might include many samples that are semantically similar to the query image. In this case, our method labels them as highly similar while standard contrastive methods label them as negatives. Our method achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art models.

We introduce a simple mean-shift algorithm that learns representations by grouping images together without contrasting between them or adopting much of prior on the structure or number of the clusters. We simply \"shift\" the embedding of each image to be close to the \"mean\" of the neighbors of its augmentation. Since the closest neighbor is always another augmentation of the same image, our model will be identical to BYOL when using only one nearest neighbor instead of 5 used in our experiments. Our model achieves 72.4% on ImageNet linear evaluation with ResNet50 at 200 epochs outperforming BYOL. Also, our method outperforms the SOTA by a large margin when using weak augmentations only, facilitating adoption of SSL for other modalities.

Recent works have shown that larger models benefit more from self-supervised learning than smaller models. As a result, the gap between supervised and self-supervised learning has been greatly reduced for larger models. In this work, instead of designing a new pseudo task for self-supervised learning, we develop a model compression method to compress an already learned, deep self-supervised model (teacher) to a smaller one (student). We train the student model so that it mimics the relative similarity between the datapoints in the teacher's embedding space. For AlexNet, our method outperforms all previous methods including the fully supervised model on ImageNet linear evaluation (59.0% compared to 56.5%) and on nearest neighbor evaluation (50.7% compared to 41.4%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a self-supervised AlexNet has outperformed supervised one on ImageNet classification.
