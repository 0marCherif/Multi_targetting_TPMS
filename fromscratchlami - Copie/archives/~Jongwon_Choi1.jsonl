To prevent such harm, we propose an anti-spoofing method using the pairs of RGB images and depth maps provided by the mobile camera with a time-of-fight sensor. When images are recaptured on display screens, various patterns differing by the screens as known as the moire patterns can be also captured in spoof images. These patterns lead the anti-spoofing model to be overfitted and unable to detect spoof images recaptured on unseen media. To avoid the issue, we build a novel representation model composed of two embedding models, which can be trained without considering the recaptured images. Also, we newly introduce mToF dataset, the largest and most diverse object anti-spoofing dataset, and the first to utilize the time-of-flight (ToF) data. Experimental results confirm that our model achieves robust generalization even across unseen domains."}}

To prevent such cases, vigorous research is conducted on distinguishing the generated images from the real ones, but challenges still remain with detecting the unseen generated images outside of the training settings. To overcome this problem, we analyze the distinctive characteristic of the generated images called \u2018fingerprints,\u2019 and propose a new framework to reproduce diverse types of fingerprints generated by various generative models. By training the model with the real images only, our framework can avoid data dependency on particular generative models and enhance generalization. With the mathematical derivation that the fingerprint is emphasized at the frequency domain, we design a generated image detector for effective training of the fingerprints. Our framework outperforms the prior state-of-the-art detectors, even though only real images are used for training. We also provide new benchmark datasets to demonstrate the model\u2019s robustness using the images of the latest anti-artifact generative models for reducing the spectral discrepancies."}}

To prevent such cases, vigorous research is conducted to distinguish the generated images from the real images, but challenges still remain to distinguish the unseen generated images outside of the training settings. Such limitations occur due to data dependency arising from the model's overfitting issue to the training data generated by specific GANs. To overcome this issue, we adopt a self-supervised scheme to propose a novel framework. Our proposed method is composed of the artificial fingerprint generator reconstructing the high-quality artificial fingerprints of GAN images for detailed analysis, and the GAN detector distinguishing GAN images by learning the reconstructed artificial fingerprints. To improve the generalization of the artificial fingerprint generator, we build multiple autoencoders with different numbers of upconvolution layers. With numerous ablation studies, the robust generalization of our method is validated by outperforming the generalization of the previous state-of-the-art algorithms, even without utilizing the GAN images of the training dataset."}}

Despite the effort of many companies requiring their own mobile applications to capture images for online transactions, it is difficult to restrict users from taking a picture of other's images displayed on a screen. To detect such cases, we propose a novel approach using paired images with different depth of field (DoF) for distinguishing the real images and the display images. Also, we introduce a new dataset containing 2,752 pairs of images capturing real and display objects on various types of displays, which is the largest real dataset employing DoF with multi-focus. Furthermore, we develop a new framework to concentrate on the difference of DoF in paired images, while avoiding learning individual display artifacts. Since DoF lies on the optical fundamentals, the framework can be widely utilized with any camera, and its performance shows at least 23% improvement compared to the conventional classification models."}}

Thus, it is important to develop a generalized detector for synthesized images of any GAN model or object category, including those unseen during the training phase. However, the conventional methods heavily depend on the training settings, which cause a dramatic decline in performance when tested with unknown domains. To resolve the issue and obtain a generalized detection ability, we propose Bilateral High-Pass Filters (BiHPF), which amplify the effect of the frequency-level artifacts that are generally found in the synthesized images of generative models. Also, to find the properties of the general frequency-level artifacts, we develop an additional method to adversarially extract the artifact compression map. Numerous experimental results validate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, even when tested with unseen domains."}}

Using trainable links between the channel-wise spatial attention of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the attention head of Vision Transformers (ViT), we present a regularization technique to improve the training efficiency of Vision Transformers (ViT). The trainable links are referred to as the attention augmentation module, which is trained simultaneously with ViT, boosting the training of ViT and allowing it to avoid the overfitting issue caused by a lack of data. From the trained attention augmentation module, we can extract the relevant relationship between each CNN activation map and each ViT attention head, and based on this, we also propose an advanced attention augmentation module. Consequently, even with a small amount of data, the suggested method considerably improves the performance of ViT while achieving faster convergence during training."}}
