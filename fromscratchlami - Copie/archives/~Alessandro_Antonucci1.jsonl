After any interaction with the user, a probability mass function over the items is updated by the system. The conversational feature corresponds to a sequential discovery of the user preferences based on questions. Information-theoretic criteria are used to optimally shape the interactions and decide when the conversation ends. Most probable items are consequently recommended. Dedicated elicitation techniques for the prior probabilities of the parameters modelling the interactions are derived from basic structural judgements based on logical compatibility and symmetry assumptions. Such prior knowledge is combined with data for better item discrimination. Our Bayesian approach is validated against matrix factorization techniques for cold-start recommendations based on metadata using the popular benchmark data set MovieLens. Results show that the proposed approach allows to considerably reduce the number of interactions while maintaining good ranking performance."}}

Graphical models, such as Bayesian networks, are used for adaptive tests as they allow to model the uncertainty about the questions and the skills in an explainable fashion, especially when coping with multiple skills. A better elicitation of the uncertainty in the question/skills relations can be achieved by interval probabilities. This turns the model into a credal network, thus increasing the inferential complexity of the queries required to select questions. This is especially the case for the information-theoretic quantities used as scores to drive the adaptive mechanism. We present an alternative family of scores, based on the mode of the posterior probabilities, and hence easier to explain. This makes considerably simpler the evaluation in the credal case, without significantly affecting the quality of the adaptive process. Numerical tests on synthetic and real-world data are used to support this claim."}}

To adapt the classical LearnSPN scheme to learn the structure of these models, we propose a new scheme based on a partial closed-world assumption: data implicitly provide the logical base of the circuit. Sum nodes are thus learned by recursively clustering batches in the initial data base, while the partitioning of the variables obeys a given input vtree. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed approach might properly fit training data, and generalize well to test data, provided that these remain consistent with the underlying local base, that is a relaxation of the  training data base.

These perturbations are global, in the sense that simultaneous perturbations of all the parameters (or any chosen subset of them) are allowed. Our main contribution is an exact algorithm that can check whether the MAP configuration is robust with respect to given perturbations. Its complexity is essentially the same as that of obtaining the MAP configuration itself, so it can be promptly used with minimal effort. We use our algorithm to identify the largest global perturbation that does not induce a change in the MAP configuration, and we successfully apply this robustness measure in two practical scenarios: the prediction of facial action units with posed images and the classification of multiple real public data sets. A strong correlation between the proposed robustness measure and accuracy is verified in both scenarios."}}

The class variables are connected by a tree; each model of the ensemble uses a different class as root of the tree. We assume the features to be conditionally independent given the classes, thus generalizing the naive Bayes assumption to the multi-class case. This assumption allows us to optimally identify the correlations between classes and features; such correlations are moreover shared across all models of the ensemble. Inferences are drawn from the ensemble via logarithmic opinion pooling. To minimize Hamming loss, we compute the marginal probability of the classes by running standard inference on each Bayesian network in the ensemble, and then pooling the inferences. To instead minimize the subset 0/1 loss, we pool the joint distributions of each model and cast the problem as a MAP inference in the corresponding graphical model. Experiments show that the approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods for multilabel classification."}}
