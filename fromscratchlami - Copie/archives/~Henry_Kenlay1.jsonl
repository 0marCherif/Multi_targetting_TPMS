Current robustness certificates for graph classifiers guarantee output invariance with respect to the total number of node pair flips (edge addition or edge deletion), which amounts to an $l_{0}$ ball centred on the adjacency matrix. Although theoretically attractive, this type of isotropic structural noise can be too restrictive in practical scenarios where some node pairs are more critical than others in determining the classifier's output. The certificate, in this case, gives a pessimistic depiction of the robustness of the graph model. To tackle this issue, we develop a randomised smoothing method based on adding an anisotropic noise distribution to the input graph structure. We show that our process generates structural-aware certificates for our classifiers, whereby the magnitude of robustness certificates can vary across different pre-defined structures of the graph. We demonstrate the benefits of these certificates in both synthetic and real-world experiments."}}

Here, we report results from the CAGI 5 regulation saturation challenge where participants were asked to predict the impact of nucleotide substitution at every base pair within five disease-associated human enhancers and nine disease-associated promoters. A library of mutations covering all bases was generated by saturation mutagenesis and altered activity was assessed in a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) in relevant cell lines. Reporter expression was measured relative to plasmid DNA to determine the impact of variants. The challenge was to predict the functional effects of variants on reporter expression. Comparative analysis of the full range of submitted prediction results identifies the most successful models of transcription factor binding sites, machine learning algorithms, and ways to choose among or incorporate diverse datatypes and cell-types for training computational models. These results have the potential to improve the design of future studies on more diverse sets of regulatory elements and aid the interpretation of disease-associated genetic variation."}}

Networks designed to predict many functional characteristics of noncoding DNA in a multitask framework have to recognise a large number of motifs and as a result benefit from large numbers of convolutional filters in the first layer. The use of large first layers in turn motivates an exploration of strategies for addressing the sparsity of output and possibility for overfitting that result. To this end we propose the use of a dimensionality-reducing linear projection layer after the initial motif-recognising convolutions. In experiments with a reduced version of the DeepSEA dataset we find that inserting this layer in combination with dropout into convolutional and convolutional-recurrent architectures can improve predictive performance across a range of first layer sizes. We further validate our approach by incorporating the projection layer into a new convolutional-recurrent architecture which achieves state of the art performance on the full DeepSEA dataset. Analysis of the learned projection weights shows that the inclusion of this layer simplifies the network\u2019s internal representation of the occurrence of motifs, notably by projecting features representing forward and reverse-complement motifs to similar positions in the lower dimensional feature space output by the layer."}}

In many real-world applications, however, features are only partially available; for example, in social networks, age and gender are available only for a small subset of users. We present a general approach for handling missing features in graph machine learning applications that is based on minimization of the Dirichlet energy and leads to a diffusion-type differential equation on the graph. The discretization of this equation produces a simple, fast and scalable algorithm which we call Feature Propagation. We experimentally show that the proposed approach outperforms previous methods on seven common node-classification benchmarks and can withstand surprisingly high rates of missing features: on average we observe only around 4% relative accuracy drop when 99% of the features are missing. Moreover, it takes only 10 seconds to run on a graph with ~2.5M nodes and ~23M edges on a single GPU."}}
