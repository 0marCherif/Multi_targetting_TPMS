Coupled norms have been designed by combining low-rank inducing tensor norms with the matrix trace norm. Though coupled norms have shown good performances, they have two major limitations: they do not have a method to control the regularization of coupled modes and uncoupled modes, and they are not optimal for couplings among higher-order tensors. In this letter, we propose a method that scales the regularization of coupled components against uncoupled components to properly induce the low-rankness on the coupled mode. We also propose coupled norms for higher-order tensors by combining the square norm to coupled norms. Using the excess risk-bound analysis, we demonstrate that our proposed methods lead to lower risk bounds compared to existing coupled norms. We demonstrate the robustness of our methods through simulation and real-data experiments."}}

More specifically, we first propose a mixture of the overlapped trace norm and the latent norms with the matrix trace norm, and then, propose a completion model regularized using these norms to impute coupled tensors. A key advantage of the proposed norms is that they are convex and can be used to find a globally optimal solution, whereas existing methods for coupled learning are nonconvex. We also analyze the excess risk bounds of the completion model regularized using our proposed norms and show that they can exploit the low-rankness of coupled tensors, leading to better bounds compared to those obtained using uncoupled norms. Through synthetic and real-data experiments, we show that the proposed completion model compares favorably with existing ones."}}

A limitation with coupled norms is that they only induce low-rankness using the multilinear rank of coupled tensors. In this paper, we introduce a new set of coupled norms known as coupled nuclear norms by constraining the CP rank of coupled tensors. We propose new coupled completion models using the coupled nuclear norms as regularizers, which can be optimized using computationally efficient optimization methods. We derive excess risk bounds for proposed coupled completion models and show that proposed norms lead to better performance. Through simulation and real-data experiments, we demonstrate that proposed norms achieve better performance for coupled completion compared to existing coupled norms."}}
{"id": "rJbneHZ_Zr", "cdate": 1483228800000, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Convex Factorization Machine for Toxicogenomics Prediction", "abstract": "We introduce the convex factorization machine (CFM), which is a convex variant of the widely used Factorization Machines (FMs). Specifically, we employ a linear+quadratic model and regularize the linear term with the \u21132-regularizer and the quadratic term with the trace norm regularizer. Then, we formulate the CFM optimization as a semidefinite programming problem and propose an efficient optimization procedure with Hazan's algorithm. A key advantage of CFM over existing FMs is that it can find a globally optimal solution, while FMs may get a poor locally optimal solution since the objective function of FMs is non-convex. In addition, the proposed algorithm is simple yet effective and can be implemented easily. Finally, CFM is a general factorization method and can also be used for other factorization problems, including multi-view matrix factorization and tensor completion problems, in various domains including toxicogenomics and bioinformatics. Through synthetic and traditionally used movielens datasets, we first show that the proposed CFM achieves results competitive to FMs. We then show in a toxicogenomics prediction task that CFM predicts the toxic outcomes of a collection of drugs better than a state-of-the-art tensor factorization method."}}

The weight vectors can be collected into a tensor and the (multilinear-)rank of the tensor controls the amount of sharing of information among tasks. Two types of convex relaxations have recently been proposed for the tensor multilinear rank. However, we argue that both of them are not optimal in the context of multitask learning in which the dimensions or multilinear rank are typically heterogeneous. We propose a new norm, which we call the scaled latent trace norm and analyze the excess risk of all the three norms. The results apply to various settings including matrix and tensor completion, multitask learning, and multilinear multitask learning. Both the theory and experiments support the advantage of the new norm when the tensor is not equal-sized and we do not a priori know which mode is low rank."}}
