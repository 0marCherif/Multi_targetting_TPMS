Our gray-box approach builds on a physical model. At the same time, we use data to learn parameters of the dynamics model, of an extended Kalman filter, and of a neural model that infers the ball's initial condition. We demonstrate superior prediction performance of our approach over two black-box approaches, which are not supplied with physical prior knowledge. We demonstrate that initializing the spin from parameters of the ball launcher using a neural network drastically improves long-time prediction performance over estimating the spin purely from measured ball positions. An accurate prediction of the ball trajectory is crucial for successful returns. We therefore evaluate the return performance with a pneumatic artificial muscular robot and achieve a return rate of 29/30 (97.7%)."}}

We hypothesize that highly nonlinear muscle dynamics play a large role in providing inherent stability, which is favorable to learning. While recent advances have been made in applying modern learning techniques to muscle-actuated systems both in simulation as well as in robotics, so far, no detailed analysis has been performed to show the benefits of muscles in this setting. Our study closes this gap by investigating core robotics challenges and comparing the performance of different actuator morphologies in terms of data-efficiency, hyperparameter sensitivity, and robustness."}}
