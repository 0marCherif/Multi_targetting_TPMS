By merging information from multiple shifted images of a scene, burst super-resolution aims to recover details which otherwise cannot be obtained using a simple input image. This paper reviews the NTIRE 2022 challenge on burst super-resolution. In the challenge, the participants were tasked with generating a clean RGB image with 4\u00d7 higher resolution, given a RAW noisy burst as input. That is, the methods need to perform joint denoising, demosaicking, and super-resolution. The challenge consisted of 2 tracks. Track 1 employed synthetic data, where pixel-accurate high-resolution ground truths are available. Track 2 on the other hand used real-world bursts captured from a handheld camera, along with approximately aligned reference images captured using a DSLR. 14 teams participated in the final testing phase. The top performing methods establish a new state-of-the-art on the burst super-resolution task."}}

In this challenge, we proposed the LDV 2.0 dataset, which includes the LDV dataset (240 videos) and 95 additional videos. This challenge includes three tracks. Track 1 aims at enhancing the videos compressed by HEVC at a fixed QP. Track 2 and Track 3 target both the super-resolution and quality enhancement of HEVC compressed video. They require x2 and x4 super-resolution, respectively. The three tracks totally attract more than 600 registrations. In the test phase, 8 teams, 8 teams and 12 teams submitted the final results to Tracks 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
