However, accurate estimation of the displacement of myocardial tissue and hence LV strain has been challenging due to a variety of issues, including those related to deriving tracking tokens from images and following tissue locations over the entire cardiac cycle. In this work, we propose a point matching scheme where correspondences are modeled as flow through a graphical network. Myocardial surface points are set up as nodes in the network and edges define neighborhood relationships temporally. The novelty lies in the constraints that are imposed on the matching scheme, which render the correspondences one-to-one through the entire cardiac cycle, and not just two consecutive frames. The constraints also encourage motion to be cyclic, which is an important characteristic of LV motion. We validate our method by applying it to the estimation of quantitative LV displacement and strain estimation using 8 synthetic and 8 open-chested canine 4D echocardiographic image sequences, the latter with sonomicrometric crystals implanted on the LV wall. We were able to achieve excellent tracking accuracy on the synthetic dataset and observed a good correlation with crystal-based strains on the in-vivo data."}}

However, motion estimation is difficult due to the low-SNR that stems from the inherent image properties of 4DE, and intelligent regularization is critical for producing reliable motion estimates. In this work, we incorporated the notion of domain adaptation into a supervised neural network regularization framework. We first propose an unsupervised autoencoder network with biomechanical constraints for learning a latent representation that is shown to have more physiologically plausible displacements. We extended this framework to include a supervised loss term on synthetic data and showed the effects of biomechanical constraints on the network's ability for domain adaptation. We validated both the autoencoder and semi-supervised regularization method on in vivo data with implanted sonomicrometers. Finally, we showed the ability of our semi-supervised learning regularization approach to identify infarcted regions using estimated regional strain maps with good agreement to manually traced infarct regions from postmortem excised hearts."}}

Extension of 2-D methods to 3-D has been problematic because of the large computational load of 3-D tracking, as well as performance issues related to the low frame (volume) rates of 3-D images. To address both of these problems, we have developed an efficient two-pass tracking method suited to cardiac elasticity imaging. PatchMatch, originally developed for image editing, has been adapted for ultrasound to provide first-pass displacement estimates. Second-pass estimation uses conventional block matching within a much smaller search region. 3-D displacements are then obtained using correlation filtering previously shown to be effective against speckle decorrelation. Both simulated and in vivo canine cardiac results demonstrate that the proposed two-pass method reduces computational cost compared with conventional 3-D exhaustive search by a factor of 10. Moreover, it outperforms onepass tracking by a factor of about 3 in terms of root-mean-square error relative to available ground-truth displacements."}}

However, tracking methods are often unreliable due to inherent ultrasound imaging properties. In this work, we propose a new data-driven spatiotemporal regularization strategy. We generate 4D Lagrangian displacement patches from different input sources as training data and learn the regularization procedure via a multi-layered perceptron (MLP) network. The learned regularization procedure is applied to initial noisy tracking results. We further propose a framework for integrating tracking methods to produce better overall estimations. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on block-matching, surface tracking, and free-form deformation-based methods. Finally, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our performance on both tracking and strain accuracy using both synthetic and in vivo data."}}

The motion is subject to physiologically consistent constraints and solved using linear programming. An additional important contribution of our work is the use of a Siamese neural network to generate edge weights that guide the flow through the network. The Siamese network learns to detect and quantify similarity and dissimilarity between pairs of image patches corresponding to the graph nodes. Despite cardiac motion tracking being an inherently spatiotemporal problem, few methods reliably address it as such. Furthermore, many tracking algorithms depend on tedious feature engineering and metric refining. Our approach provides solutions to both of these problems. We benchmark our method against a few other approaches using a synthetic 4D echocardiography dataset and compare the performance of neural network based feature matching with other features. We also present preliminary results on data from 5 canine cases."}}

A typical exam records several minutes of real-time cardiac images. To enable complete analysis of 3D cardiac strains, 4-D (3-D+t) echocardiography is used. This results in a huge dataset and requires effective automated analysis. Ultrasound speckle tracking is an effective method for tissue motion analysis. It involves correlation of a 3D kernel (block) around a voxel with kernels in later frames. The search region is usually confined to a local neighborhood, due to biomechanical and computational constraints. For high strains and moderate frame-rates, however, this search region will remain large, leading to a considerable computational burden. Moreover, speckle decorrelation (due to high strains) leads to errors in tracking. To solve this, spatial motion coherency between adjacent voxels should be imposed, e.g., by averaging their correlation functions.<sup>1</sup> This requires storing correlation functions for neighboring voxels, thus increasing memory demands. In this work, we propose an efficient search using PatchMatch,<sup> 2</sup> a powerful method to find correspondences between images. Here we adopt PatchMatch for 3D volumes and radio-frequency signals. As opposed to an exact search, PatchMatch performs random sampling of the search region and propagates successive matches among neighboring voxels. We show that: 1) Inherently smooth offset propagation in PatchMatch contributes to spatial motion coherence without any additional processing or memory demand. 2) For typical scenarios, PatchMatch is at least 20 times faster than the exact search, while maintaining comparable tracking accuracy."}}

We used this method on 4D Echocardiography (4DE) images acquired from 7 canine subjects and validated the strains using a cuboidal array of 16 sonomicrometric crystals that were implanted on the LV wall. The 4DE based strains correlated well with the crystal based strains. We also created an ischemia on the LV wall and evaluated how strain values change across ischemic, non-ischemic remote and border regions (with the crystals planted accordingly) during baseline, severe occlusion and severe occlusion with dobutamine stress conditions. We were able to observe some interesting strain patterns for the different physiological conditions, which were in good agreement with the crystal based strains."}}

Although the benefits of single methods over alternative ones have been reported in separate publications, the intrinsic differences in the data and definitions used makes it hard to compare the relative performance of different solutions. To address this issue, we have recently proposed a framework to simulate realistic 3D echocardiographic recordings and used it to generate a common set of ground-truth data for 3D speckle tracking algorithms, which was made available online. The aim of this study was therefore to use the newly developed database to contrast non-commercial speckle tracking solutions from research groups with leading expertise in the field. The five techniques involved cover the most representative families of existing approaches, namely block-matching, radio-frequency tracking, optical flow and elastic image registration. The techniques were contrasted in terms of tracking and strain accuracy. The feasibility of the obtained strain measurements to diagnose pathology was also tested for ischemia and dyssynchrony."}}

In this paper we show how this multi-scale property can be extended to solve ill-posed problems under noisy conditions, such as image denoising. While clean patches are obscured by severe noise in the original scale of a noisy image, noise levels drop dramatically at coarser image scales. This allows for the unknown hidden clean patches to \"naturally emerge\" in some coarser scale of the noisy image. We further show that patch recurrence across scales is strengthened when using directional pyramids (that blur and sub sample only in one direction). Our statistical experiments show that for almost any noisy image patch (more than 99%), there exists a \"good\" clean version of itself at the same relative image coordinates in some coarser scale of the image. This is a strong phenomenon of noise-contaminated natural images, which can serve as a strong prior for separating the signal from the noise. Finally, incorporating this multi-scale prior into a simple denoising algorithm yields state-of-the-art denoising results."}}
