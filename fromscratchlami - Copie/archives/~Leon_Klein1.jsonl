The equilibrium distribution is usually defined by an energy function and\na thermodynamic state. Here we propose temperature-steerable flows (TSF) which are able to\ngenerate a family of probability densities parametrized by a choosable temperature parameter.\nTSFs can be embedded in a generalized ensemble sampling frameworks to sample a physical system\nacross thermodynamic states."}}

In order to scale and generalize these results, it is essential that the\nnatural symmetries of the probability density \u2013 in physics defined by the invariances\nof the energy function \u2013 are built into the flow. Here we develop theoretical tools for\nconstructing such equivariant flows and demonstrate that a BG that is equivariant\nwith respect to rotations and particle permutations can generalize to sampling\nnontrivially new configurations where a nonequivariant BG cannot."}}
