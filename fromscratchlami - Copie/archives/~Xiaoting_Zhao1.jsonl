One hallmark of the shopping experience in such online marketplaces is the many ways a user can interact with an item they are interested in: they can click it, favorite it, add it to cart, purchase it, etc. We hypothesize that the different ways in which a user interacts with an item indicates different kinds of intent. Consequently, a user\u2019s recommendations should be based not only on items from their past activity, but also the way in which they interacted with these items. Co-occurrence based methods have been successfully used to give recommendations that incorporate interaction types, such as the popular \u201cBecause you purchased X, you may also purchase Y\u201d. In this paper, we propose a novel method that generalizes upon the co-occurrence methods to learn interaction-based item embeddings that encode the co-occurrence patterns of not only the item itself, but also the interaction type. The learned embeddings provide a convenient way of approximating the likelihood that one item-interaction pair would co-occur with another by way of a simple inner product. To show their effectiveness, we deploy the interaction-based embeddings in an industry-scale recommendation system that serves live traffic on Etsy.com. We find that taking interaction types into account shows significant improvements in accurately modeling user shopping behavior for both online and offline metrics."}}

While convenient to collect, implicit feedback data inherently suffers from various types of bias since user feedback is limited to products they are exposed to by existing search ranking algorithms and impacted by how the products are displayed. In the literature, a vast majority of existing methods have been proposed towards unbiased learning to rank for list-based web search scenarios. However, such methods cannot be directly adopted by e-commerce websites mainly for two reasons. First, in e-commerce websites, search engine results pages (SERPs) are displayed in 2-dimensional grids. The existing methods have not considered the difference in user behavior between list-based web search and grid-based product search. Second, there can be multiple types of implicit feedback (e.g., clicks and purchases) on e-commerce websites. We aim to utilize all types of implicit feedback as the supervision signals. In this work, we extend unbiased learning to rank to the world of e-commerce search via considering a grid-based product search scenario. We propose a novel framework which (1) forms the theoretical foundations to allow multiple types of implicit feedback in unbiased learning to rank and (2) incorporates the row skipping and slower decay click models to capture unique user behavior patterns in grid-based product search for inverse propensity scoring. Through extensive experiments on real-world e-commerce search log datasets across browsing devices and product taxonomies, we show that the proposed framework outperforms the state of the art unbiased learning to rank algorithms. These results also reveal important insights on how user behavior patterns vary in e-commerce SERPs across browsing devices and product taxonomies."}}

One hallmark of Etsy's shopping experience is the multitude of ways in which a user can interact with an item they are interested in: they can view it, favorite it, add it to a collection, add it to cart, purchase it, etc. We hypothesize that the different ways in which a user interacts with an item indicates different kinds of intent.

The learned embeddings give us a convenient way of approximating the likelihood that one item-interaction pair would co-occur with another by way of a simple inner product. Because of its computational efficiency, our model lends itself naturally as a candidate set selection method, and we evaluate it as such in an industry-scale recommendation system that serves live traffic on Etsy.com. Our experiments reveal that taking interaction type into account shows promising results in improving the accuracy of modeling user shopping behavior."}}

Stochastic blockmodels, and other methods for community detection and clustering of bipartite graphs, can infer latent user communities and latent item clusters from this interaction data. These methods, however, typically ignore the items' contents and the information they provide about item clusters, despite the tendency of items in the same latent cluster to share commonalities in content. We introduce content-augmented stochastic blockmodels (CASB), which use item content together with user-item interaction data to enhance the user communities and item clusters learned. Comparisons to several state-of-the-art benchmark methods, on datasets arising from scientists interacting with scientific articles, show that content-augmented stochastic blockmodels provide highly accurate clusters with respect to metrics representative of the underlying community structure."}}

Such systems face the exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff, in which it may be beneficial to present an item despite a low probability of relevance, just to learn about future items with similar content. We present a Bayesian sequential decision-making model of this problem, show how it may be solved to optimality using a decomposition to a collection of two-armed bandit problems, and show structural results for the optimal policy. We show that the resulting method is especially useful when facing the cold start problem, i.e., when filtering items for new users without a long history of past interactions. We then present an application of this information filtering method to a historical dataset from the arXiv.org repository of scientific articles."}}

Forwarding decisions are made separately in a personalized way for each user. We focus on the cold-start setting for this problem, in which we have limited historical data on the user's preferences, and must rely on feedback from forwarded articles to learn which the fraction of items relevant to the user in each of several item categories. Performing well in this setting requires trading exploration vs. exploitation, forwarding items that are likely to be irrelevant, to allow learning that will improve later performance. In a Bayesian setting, and using Markov decision processes, we show how the Bayes-optimal forwarding algorithm can be computed efficiently when the user will examine each forwarded article, and how an upper bound on the Bayes-optimal procedure and a heuristic index policy can be obtained for the setting when the user will examine only a limited number of forwarded items. We present results from simulation experiments using parameters estimated using historical data from arXiv.org."}}
