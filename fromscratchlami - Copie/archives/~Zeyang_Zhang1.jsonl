However, the existing DHGNNs are hand-designed, requiring extensive human efforts and failing to adapt to diverse dynamic heterogeneous graph scenarios. In this paper, we propose to automate the design of DHGNN, which faces two major challenges: 1) how to design the search space to jointly consider the spatial-temporal dependencies and heterogeneous interactions in graphs; 2) how to design an efficient search algorithm in the potentially large and complex search space. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Attention Search (DHGAS) method. Our proposed method can automatically discover the optimal DHGNN architecture and adapt to various dynamic heterogeneous graph scenarios without human guidance. In particular, we first propose a unified dynamic heterogeneous graph attention (DHGA) framework, which enables each node to jointly attend its heterogeneous and dynamic neighbors. Based on the framework, we design a localization space to determine where the attention should be applied and a parameterization space to determine how the attention should be parameterized. Lastly, we design a multi-stage differentiable search algorithm to efficiently explore the search space. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for tasks including link prediction, node classification and node regression. To the best of our knowledge, DHGAS is the first dynamic heterogeneous graph neural architecture search method."}}

Existing learning-based TSP methods adopt a simple setting that the training and testing data are independent and identically distributed. However, the existing literature fails to solve TSP instances when training and testing data have different distributions. Concretely, we find that different training and testing distribution will result in more difficult TSP instances, i.e., the solution obtained by the model has a large gap from the optimal solution. To tackle this problem, in this work, we study learning-based TSP methods when training and testing data have different distributions using adaptive-hardness, i.e., how difficult a TSP instance can be for a solver. This problem is challenging because it is non-trivial to (1) define hardness measurement quantitatively; (2) efficiently and continuously generate sufficiently hard TSP instances upon model training; (3) fully utilize instances with different levels of hardness to learn a more powerful TSP solver. To solve these challenges, we first propose a principled hardness measurement to quantify the hardness of TSP instances. Then, we propose a hardness-adaptive generator to generate instances with different hardness. We further propose a curriculum learner fully utilizing these instances to train the TSP solver. Experiments show that our hardness-adaptive generator can generate instances ten times harder than the existing methods, and our proposed method achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art models in terms of the optimality gap. The codes are publicly available."}}

To save human efforts, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) recently has been used to automatically discover adequate GNN architectures for certain tasks in order to achieve competitive or even better performance compared with manually designed architectures. However, existing works utilizing NAS to search GNN structures fail to answer the question: how NAS is able to select the desired GNN architectures? In this paper, we investigate this question to solve the problem, for the first time. We conduct a measurement study with experiments to discover that gradient based NAS methods tend to select proper architectures based on the usefulness of different types of information with respect to the target task. Our explorations further show that gradient based NAS also suffers from noises hidden in the graph, resulting in searching suboptimal GNN architectures. Based on our findings, we propose a Graph differentiable Architecture Search model with Structure Optimization (GASSO), which allows differentiable search of the architecture with gradient descent and is able to discover graph neural architectures with better performance through employing graph structure learning as a denoising process in the search procedure. The proposed GASSO model is capable of simultaneously searching the optimal architecture and adaptively adjusting graph structure by jointly optimizing graph architecture search and graph structure denoising. Extensive experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our proposed GASSO model is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared with existing baselines."}}

One critical inductive bias is that the model can maintain invariance towards various transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling. The existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches can only maintain permutation-invariance, failing to guarantee invariance with respect to other transformations. Besides GNNs, other works design sophisticated transformation-invariant layers, which are computationally expensive and difficult to be extended. To solve this problem, we revisit why the existing neural networks cannot maintain transformation invariance when handling geometric data. Our findings show that transformation-invariant and distance-preserving initial representations are sufficient to achieve transformation invariance rather than needing sophisticated neural layer designs. Motivated by these findings, we propose Transformation Invariant Neural Networks (TinvNN), a straightforward and general framework for geometric data. Specifically, we realize transformation-invariant and distance-preserving initial point representations by modifying multi-dimensional scaling before feeding the representations into neural networks. We prove that TinvNN can strictly guarantee transformation invariance, being general and flexible enough to be combined with the existing neural networks. Extensive experimental results on point cloud analysis and combinatorial optimization demonstrate the effectiveness and general applicability of our proposed method. Based on the experimental results, we advocate that TinvNN should be considered a new starting point and an essential baseline for further studies of transformation-invariant geometric deep learning."}}
