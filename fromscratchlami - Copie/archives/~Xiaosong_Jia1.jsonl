Given the highly dynamic and variant nature of the input, the visuomotor driving task inherently lacks the view and translation invariance, and the visual input contains massive irrelevant information for decision making, resulting in predominant pre-training approaches from general vision less suitable for the autonomous driving task. To this end, we propose PPGeo (Policy Pre-training via Geometric modeling), an intuitive and straightforward fully self-supervised framework curated for the policy pre-training in visuomotor driving. We aim at learning policy representations as a powerful abstraction by modeling 3D geometric scenes on large-scale unlabeled and uncalibrated YouTube driving videos. The proposed PPGeo is performed in two stages to support effective self-supervised training. In the first stage, the geometric modeling framework generates pose and depth predictions simultaneously, with two consecutive frames as input. In the second stage, the visual encoder learns driving policy representation by predicting the future ego-motion and optimizing with the photometric error based on current visual observation only. As such, the pre-trained visual encoder is equipped with rich driving policy related representations and thereby competent for multiple visuomotor driving tasks. As a side product, the pre-trained geometric modeling networks could bring further improvement to the depth and odometry estimation tasks. Extensive experiments covering a wide span of challenging scenarios have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed approach, where improvements range from 2% to even over 100% with very limited data."}}

Recently, deep learning based methods dominate the field. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods usually follow an encoder-decoder paradigm. Specifically, the encoder is responsible for extracting information from agents' history states and HD-Map and providing a representation vector for each agent. Taking these vectors as input, the decoder predicts multi-step future positions for each agent, which is usually accomplished by a single multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to directly output a Tx2 tensor. Though models with adoptation of MLP decoder have dominated the leaderboard of multiple datasets, `the elephant in the room is that the temporal correlation among future time-steps is ignored since there is no direct relation among output neurons of a MLP. In this work, we examine this design choice and investigate several ways to apply the temporal inductive bias into the generation of future trajectories on top of a SOTA encoder. We find that simply using autoregressive RNN to generate future positions would lead to significant performance drop even with techniques such as history highway and teacher forcing. Instead, taking scratch trajectories generated by MLP as input, an additional refinement module based on structures with temporal prior such as RNN or 1D-CNN could remarkably boost the accuracy. Furthermore, we examine several objective functions to  emphasize the temporal priors. By the combination of aforementioned techniques to introduce the temporal prior, we improve the top-ranked method's performance by a large margin and achieve SOTA result on the Waymo Open Motion Challenge."}}

However, a common hypothesis of existing methods is that either the model development or experimental evaluation is mostly based on i.i.d. data across training and testing. Such a hypothesis can be violated in real-world applications where testing molecules could come from new environments, bringing about serious performance degradation or unexpected prediction. We propose a new representation learning framework entitled MoleOOD to enhance the robustness of MRL models against such distribution shifts, motivated by an observation that the (bio)chemical properties of molecules are usually invariantly associated with certain privileged molecular substructures across different environments (e.g., scaffolds, sizes, etc.). Specifically, We introduce an environment inference model to identify the latent factors that impact data generation from different distributions in a fully data-driven manner. We also propose a new learning objective to guide the molecule encoder to leverage environment-invariant substructures that more stably relate with the labels across environments. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets demonstrate that our model has a stronger generalization ability than existing methods under various out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, despite the absence of manual specifications of environments. Particularly, our method achieves up to 5.9\\% and 3.9\\% improvement over the strongest baselines on OGB and DrugOOD benchmarks in terms of ROC-AUC, respectively.

We use three features to predict cascades\u2019 virality: retweet sequence, follower number sequence, and timestamps of the first tweet which includes both the static and dynamic characteristics of cascades. Utilizing the theory that distributions of both viral and non-viral cascades are Gaussian, we get the boundary between these two kinds of cascades with sufficient proof to testify its rationality. To detect the virality more precisely and earlier, based on hazard functions in the survival theory, we propose two different hazard ceilings to capture the bursting of the cascades. We also provide a series of numerical experiments to analyze impacts of different factors to performance of our model measured by three practical metrics. The results shows that our model could stably outperforms several state-of-art baselines."}}

Conventional approaches for most autonomous driving algorithms perform detection, segmentation, tracking, etc., in a front or perspective view. As sensor configurations get more complex, integrating multi-source information from different sensors and representing features in a unified view come of vital importance. BEV perception inherits several advantages, as representing surrounding scenes in BEV is intuitive and fusion-friendly; and representing objects in BEV is most desirable for subsequent modules as in planning and/or control. The core problems for BEV perception lie in (a) how to reconstruct the lost 3D information via view transformation from perspective view to BEV; (b) how to acquire ground truth annotations in BEV grid; (c) how to formulate the pipeline to incorporate features from different sources and views; and (d) how to adapt and generalize algorithms as sensor configurations vary across different scenarios. In this survey, we review the most recent work on BEV perception and provide an in-depth analysis of different solutions. Moreover, several systematic designs of BEV approach from the industry are depicted as well. Furthermore, we introduce a full suite of practical guidebook to improve the performance of BEV perception tasks, including camera, LiDAR and fusion inputs. At last, we point out the future research directions in this area. We hope this report would shed some light on the community and encourage more research effort on BEV perception. We keep an active repository to collect the most recent work and provide a toolbox for bag of tricks at https://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/BEVPerception-Survey-Recipe."}}

The driving scene is complicated, and there exists heterogeneity within elements, where they own diverse types of information i.e., agent dynamics, map routing, road lines, etc. Meanwhile, there also exist relativity across elements - meaning they have spatial relations with each other; such relations should be canonically represented regarding the relative measurements since the absolute value of the coordinate is meaningless. Taking these two observations into consideration, we propose a novel backbone, namely Heterogeneous Driving Graph Transformer (HDGT), which models the driving scene as a heterogeneous graph with different types of nodes and edges. For graph construction, each node represents either an agent or a road element and each edge represents their semantics relations such as Pedestrian-To-Crosswalk, Lane-To-Left-Lane. As for spatial relation encoding, instead of setting a fixed global reference, the coordinate information of the node as well as its in-edges is transformed to the local node-centric coordinate system. For the aggregation module in the graph neural network (GNN), we adopt the transformer structure in a hierarchical way to fit the heterogeneous nature of inputs. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art on INTERACTION Prediction Challenge and Waymo Open Motion Challenge, in which we rank 1st and 2nd respectively regarding the minADE/minFDE metric."}}

Recently, graph neural network (GNN) is widely adopted to capture the social interactions among the agents. Many GNN-based models formulate the prediction task as a single-agent prediction problem where multiple inference is needed for multi-agent prediction (which is common in practice), which leads to fundamental inconsistency in terms of homotopy as well as inefficiency for the memory and time. Moreover, even for models that do perform joint prediction, typically one centric agent is selected and all other agents\u2019 information is normalized based on that. Such centric-only normalization leads to asymmetric encoding of different agents in GNN, which might harm its performance.  In this work, we propose a efficient multi-agent prediction framework that can predict all agents' trajectories jointly by normalizing and processing all agents' information symmetrically and homogeneously with combined egocentirc and allocentric views. Experiments are conducted on two interaction-rich behavior datasets: INTERACTION (vehicles) and TrajNet++ (pedestrian). The results show that the proposed framework can significantly boost the inference speed of the GNN-based model for multi-agent prediction and achieve better performance. In the INTERACTION dataset's challenge, the proposed model achieved the 1st place in the regular track and generalization track."}}

It is overwhelming and unnecessary to carefully interact with all observed agents, and AVs need to determine whether and when to interact with each surrounding agent. In order to facilitate the design and testing of prediction and planning modules of AVs, in-depth understanding of interactive behavior is expected with proper representation, and events in behavior data need to be extracted and categorized automatically. Answers to what are the essential patterns of interactions are also crucial for these motivations in addition to answering whether and when. Thus, learning to extract interactive driving events and patterns from human data for tackling the whether-when-what tasks is of critical importance for AVs. There is, however, no clear definition and taxonomy of interactive behavior, and most of the existing works are based on either manual labelling or hand-crafted rules and features. In this letter, we propose the Interactive Driving event and pattern Extraction Network (IDE-Net), which is a deep learning framework to automatically extract interaction events and patterns directly from vehicle trajectories. In IDE-Net, we leverage the power of multi-task learning and proposed three auxiliary tasks to assist the pattern extraction in an unsupervised fashion. We also design a unique spatial-temporal block to encode the trajectory data. Experimental results on the INTERACTION dataset verified the effectiveness of such designs in terms of better generalizability and effective pattern extraction. We find three interpretable patterns of interactions, bringing insights for driver behavior representation, modeling and comprehension. Both objective and subjective evaluation metrics are adopted in our analysis of the learned patterns."}}
