In the classical problem, there is a stream of requests released over time along the real line. The goal is to minimize the makespan of the algorithm. We distinguish between the open variant and the closed one, in which we additionally require the algorithm to return to the origin after serving all requests. The state of the art is a $1.64$-competitive algorithm and a $2.04$-competitive algorithm for the closed and open variants, respectively \\cite{Bjelde:1.64}. In both cases, a tight lower bound is known \\cite{Ausiello:1.75, Bjelde:1.64}. In both variants, our primary prediction model involves predicted positions of the requests. We introduce algorithms that (i) obtain a tight 1.5 competitive ratio for the closed variant and a 1.66 competitive ratio for the open variant in the case of perfect predictions, (ii) are robust against unbounded prediction error, and (iii) are smooth, i.e., their performance degrades gracefully as the prediction error increases. Moreover, we further investigate the learning-augmented setting in the open variant by additionally considering a prediction for the last request served by the optimal offline algorithm. Our algorithm for this enhanced setting obtains a 1.33 competitive ratio with perfect predictions while also being smooth and robust, beating the lower bound of 1.44 we show for our original prediction setting for the open variant. Also, we provide a lower bound of 1.25 for this enhanced setting."}}

Specifically, when the topology is known (i.e., the Supported-CONGEST model), we show that any Laplacian system on an n-node graph with shortcut quality SQ(G) can be solved after n^{o(1)} SQ(G) log(1/\u03b5) rounds, where \u03b5 is the required accuracy. This almost matches our lower bound that guarantees that any correct algorithm on G requires \u03a9\u0303(SQ(G)) rounds, even for a crude solution with \u03b5 \u2264 1/2. Several important implications hold in the unknown-topology (i.e., standard CONGEST) case: for excluded-minor graphs we get an almost universally optimal algorithm that terminates in D \u22c5 n^{o(1)} log(1/\u03b5) rounds, where D is the hop-diameter of the network; as well as n^{o(1)} log (1/\u03b5)-round algorithms for the case of SQ(G) \u2264 n^{o(1)}, which holds for most networks of interest. Conditioned on improvements in state-of-the-art constructions of low-congestion shortcuts, the CONGEST results will match the Supported-CONGEST ones. Moreover, following a recent line of work in distributed algorithms, we consider a hybrid communication model which enhances CONGEST with limited global power in the form of the node-capacitated clique (NCC) model. In this model, we show the existence of a Laplacian solver with round complexity n^{o(1)} log(1/\u03b5). The unifying thread of these results, and our main technical contribution, is the study of a novel \u03c1-congested generalization of the standard part-wise aggregation problem. We develop near-optimal algorithms for this primitive in the Supported-CONGEST model, almost-optimal algorithms in (standard) CONGEST (with the additional overhead due to standard barriers), as well as a simple algorithm for bounded-treewidth graphs with a quadratic dependence on the congestion \u03c1. This primitive can be readily used to accelerate the Laplacian solver of Forster, Goranci, Liu, Peng, Sun, and Ye, and we believe it will find further independent applications in the future."}}

In Online Facility Location (OFL), demands arrive one-by-one in a metric space and must be (irrevocably) assigned to an open facility upon arrival, without any knowledge about future demands.   We present an online algorithm for OFL that exploits potentially imperfect predictions on the locations of the optimal facilities. We prove that the competitive ratio decreases smoothly from sublogarithmic in the number of demands to constant, as the error, i.e., the total distance of the predicted locations to the optimal facility locations, decreases towards zero. We complement our analysis with a matching lower bound establishing that the dependence of the algorithm's competitive ratio on the error is optimal, up to constant factors. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on real world data and compare our learning augmented approach with the current best online algorithm for the problem."}}

First, we build on a recent result by \\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2006-04787} that showed noise tolerance of distribution-independently evolvable concept classes under Massart noise. Specifically, we extend their characterization to more general noise models, including the Tsybakov model which considerably generalizes the Massart condition by allowing the flipping probability to be arbitrarily close to $\\frac{1}{2}$ for a subset of the domain. As a corollary, we employ an evolutionary algorithm by \\cite{DBLP:conf/colt/KanadeVV10} to obtain the first polynomial time algorithm with arbitrarily small excess error for learning linear threshold functions over any spherically symmetric distribution in the presence of spherically symmetric Tsybakov noise. Moreover, we posit access to a stronger oracle, in which for every labeled example we additionally obtain its flipping probability. In this model, we show that every SQ learnable class admits an efficient learning algorithm with $\\opt + \\epsilon$ misclassification error for a broad class of noise models. This setting substantially generalizes the widely-studied problem of classification under RCN with known noise rate, and corresponds to a non-convex optimization problem even when the noise function \u2013 i.e. the flipping probabilities of all points \u2013 is known in advance."}}

In this work we provide several new insights on the power of hybrid networks for fundamental problems in distributed algorithms.
