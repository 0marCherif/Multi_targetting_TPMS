Specifically, we consider certain classes of copulas known as Archimedean and hierarchical Archimedean copulas, popular for their parsimonious representation and ability to model different tail dependencies. We consider their representation as mixture models with Laplace transforms of latent random variables from generative neural networks. This alternative representation allows for computational efficiencies and easy sampling, especially in high dimensions. We describe multiple methods for optimizing the network parameters. Finally, we present empirical results that demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method in learning multidimensional CDFs and its computational efficiency compared to existing methods."}}

We propose a point process construction that describes arrival time observations in terms of the state of a latent diffusion process. In this framework, we relate the return time of diffusion in a continuous path space to new arrivals of the point process. These models arise in many disciplines, such as financial settings where actions in a market are determined by a hidden continuous price or in neuroscience where a latent stimulus generates spike trains. Based on the developments in It\\^o's excursion theory, we describe computational methods for inferring and sampling from the point process derived from the diffusion process.  We provide numerical examples for the proposed method using both simulated and real data to illustrate the approach. The proposed methods and framework provide a basis for interpreting point processes through the lens of a diffusion. \n"}}

This in turn allows the application of the standard frameworks for solving ODEs, namely the adjoint method. Learning optimal characteristic curves for given tasks improves the performance and computational efficiency, compared to state of the art NODE models. We prove that the C-NODE framework extends the classical NODE on classification tasks by demonstrating explicit C-NODE representable functions not expressible by NODEs.  Additionally, we present C-NODE-based continuous normalizing flows, which describe the density evolution of latent variables along multiple dimensions.

Using the framework of variational autoencoders, we consider a conditional generative model for the data based on the Euler-Maruyama approximation of SDE solutions. Furthermore, we use recent results on identifiability of latent variable models to show that the proposed model can recover not only the underlying SDE coefficients, but also the original latent variables, up to an isometry, in the limit of infinite data. We validate the method through several simulated video processing tasks, where the underlying SDE is known, and through real world datasets."}}
