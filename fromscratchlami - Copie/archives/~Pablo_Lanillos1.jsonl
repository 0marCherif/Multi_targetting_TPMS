Here, we present a novel multisensory active inference (AIF) torque controller for industrial arms that shows how prediction can be used to resolve adaptation. Our controller, inspired by the predictive brain hypothesis, improves the capabilities of current AIF approaches by incorporating learning and multimodal integration of low- and high-dimensional sensor inputs (e.g., raw images) while simplifying the architecture. We performed a systematic evaluation of our model on a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot arm by comparing its behavior with previous AIF baselines and classic controllers, analyzing both qualitatively and quantitatively adaptation capabilities and control accuracy. The results showed improved control accuracy in goal-directed reaching with high noise rejection due to multimodal filtering, and adaptability to dynamical inertial changes, elasticity constraints, and human disturbances without the need to relearn the model or parameter retuning."}}

Their learning processes should be based on interactions with their physical and social world in the manner of human learning and cognitive development. Based on this context, in this paper, we focus on the two concepts of world models and predictive coding. Recently, world models have attracted renewed attention as a topic of considerable interest in artificial intelligence. Cognitive systems learn world models to better predict future sensory observations and optimize their policies, i.e., controllers. Alternatively, in neuroscience, predictive coding proposes that the brain continuously predicts its inputs and adapts to model its own dynamics and control behavior in its environment. Both ideas may be considered as underpinning the cognitive development of robots and humans capable of continual or lifelong learning. Although many studies have been conducted on predictive coding in cognitive robotics and neurorobotics, the relationship between world model-based approaches in AI and predictive coding in robotics has rarely been discussed. Therefore, in this paper, we clarify the definitions, relationships, and status of current research on these topics, as well as missing pieces of world models and predictive coding in conjunction with crucially related concepts such as the free-energy principle and active inference in the context of cognitive and developmental robotics. Furthermore, we outline the frontiers and challenges involved in world models and predictive coding toward the further integration of AI and robotics, as well as the creation of robots with real cognitive and developmental capabilities in the future."}}

However, in robot control, moving an arm's end-effector to a target position or along a target trajectory requires accurate forward and inverse models. Here we show that by learning the transition (forward) model from interaction, we can use it to drive the learning of an amortized policy. Hence, we revisit policy optimization in relation to the deep active inference framework and describe a modular neural network architecture that simultaneously learns the system dynamics from prediction errors and the stochastic policy that generates suitable continuous control commands to reach a desired reference position. We evaluated the model by comparing it against the baseline of a linear quadratic regulator, and conclude with additional steps to take toward human-like motor control."}}

For agents to interact with the world intelligently, they must translate sensory inputs into the bound-together features that describe each object. These object-based representations form a natural basis for planning behavior. Active inference (AIF) is an influential unifying account of perception and action, but existing AIF models have not leveraged this important inductive bias. To remedy this, we introduce 'object-based active inference' (OBAI), marrying AIF with recent deep object-based neural networks. OBAI represents distinct objects with separate variational beliefs, and uses selective attention to route inputs to their corresponding object slots. Object representations are endowed with independent action-based dynamics. The dynamics and generative model are learned from experience with a simple environment (active multi-dSprites). We show that OBAI learns to correctly segment the action-perturbed objects from video input, and to manipulate these objects towards arbitrary goals."}}

Whilst behaviour of biological agents is produced through sparse and irregular spiking patterns, which provide both robust and efficient control, the activity patterns in most artificial spiking neural networks used for control are dense and regular -- resulting in potentially less efficient codes. Additionally, for most existing control solutions network training or optimization is necessary, even for fully identified systems, complicating their implementation in on-chip low-power solutions. The neuroscience theory of Spike Coding Networks (SCNs) offers a fully analytical solution for implementing dynamical systems in recurrent spiking neural networks -- while maintaining irregular, sparse, and robust spiking activity -- but it's not clear how to directly apply it to control problems. Here, we extend SCN theory by incorporating closed-form optimal estimation and control. The resulting networks work as a spiking equivalent of a linear-quadratic-Gaussian controller. We demonstrate robust spiking control of simulated spring-mass-damper and cart-pole systems, in the face of several perturbations, including input- and system-noise, system disturbances, and neural silencing. As our approach does not need learning or optimization, it offers opportunities for deploying fast and efficient task-specific on-chip spiking controllers with biologically realistic activity."}}

However, several studies reveal that when we experience a multisensory conflict, such as for example during the rubber hand illusion or when we embody an avatar in virtual reality, we execute movements that are not intentional in the traditional sense, but aim to resolve the conflict (most often, without awareness). Nonetheless, the mechanisms of this second, \"conflict resolution\" imperative of motor control have received less attention so far. In this article, we advance a model of movement control grounded in the formal theory of active inference that integrates both intentional and conflict-resolution imperatives. Our simulations show that the same computational model can reproduce intentional and conflict-resolution components of action, or both simultaneously. Furthermore, these simulations highlight fundamental differences between movements that are guided by the two imperatives, which map to different error-correction mechanisms of active inference and might contribute to shed light on the reasons why movements guided by conflict-resolution are often executed without awareness."}}

These models account for the mutual information between the (current) visual information and its estimated causes. However, they fail to consider the circular causality between perception and action. In other words, they do not consider where to sample next, given current beliefs. Here, we reclaim salience as an active inference process that relies on two basic principles: uncertainty minimisation and rhythmic scheduling. For this, we make a distinction between attention and salience. Briefly, we associate attention with precision control, i.e., the confidence with which beliefs can be updated given sampled sensory data, and salience with uncertainty minimisation that underwrites the selection of future sensory data. Using this, we propose a new account of attention based on rhythmic precision-modulation and discuss its potential in robotics, providing numerical experiments that showcase advantages of precision-modulation for state and noise estimation, system identification and action selection for informative path planning."}}

Estimation and control are formalized as an inference problem where the body posterior state distribution is approximated by means of the variational free-energy bound, yielding to a minimization of the prediction error. Besides, our study forecasts reactive actions in the presence of sensorimotor conflicts, a mechanism that may be relevant in human body adaptation to uncertain situations."}}
