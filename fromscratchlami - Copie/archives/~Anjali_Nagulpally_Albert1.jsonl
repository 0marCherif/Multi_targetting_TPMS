The\nexpressiveness of the DNCB distribution is particularly\nuseful for modeling DNA methylation\ndatasets, which are typically highly dispersed and\nmulti-modal; however, the model structure is sufficiently\ngeneral that it can be adapted to many other\ndomains where latent representations of (0; 1)\nbounded-support data are of interest. Although\nthe DNCB distribution lacks a closed-form conjugate\nprior, several augmentations let us derive an\nefficient posterior inference algorithm composed\nentirely of analytic updates. Our model improves\nout-of-sample predictive performance on both real\nand synthetic DNA methylation datasets over stateof-\nthe-art methods in bioinformatics. In addition,\nour model yields meaningful latent representations\nthat accord with existing biological knowledge"}}
