Previous studies on the classification of limb movements have focused on the classification of left/right limbs; however, the classification of different types of upper limb movements has often been ignored despite that it provides more active-evoked control commands in the brain-computer interface. Nevertheless, few machine learning method can be used as the state-of-the-art method in the multi-class classification of limb movements. This work focuses on the multi-class classification of upper limb movements and proposes the multi-class filter bank task-related component analysis (mFBTRCA) method, which consists of three steps: spatial filtering, similarity measuring and filter bank selection. The spatial filter, namely the task-related component analysis, is first used to remove noise from EEG signals. The canonical correlation measures the similarity of the spatial-filtered signals and is used for feature extraction. The correlation features are extracted from multiple low-frequency filter banks. The minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance selects the essential features from all the correlation features, and finally, the support vector machine is used to classify the selected features. The proposed method compared against previously used models is evaluated using two datasets. mFBTRCA achieved a classification accuracy of 0.4193 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.0780 (7 classes) and 0.4032 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.0714 (5 classes), respectively, which improves on the best accuracies achieved using the compared methods (0.3590 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.0645 and 0.3159 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.0736, respectively).

To reconstruct images from incomplete and distorted data, it is necessary to create algorithms that can take into account both, the physical mechanisms responsible for generating these measurements and the intrinsic characteristics of the images being analyzed. In this work, the sparse representation of images is reviewed, which is a realistic, compact and effective generative model for natural images inspired by the visual system of mammals. It enables us to address ill-posed linear inverse problems by training the model on a vast collection of images. Moreover, we extend the application of sparse coding to solve the non-linear and ill-posed problem in microwave tomography imaging, which could lead to a significant improvement of the state-of-the-arts algorithms."}}

The recent approach TNLS~\\cite{li2022permutation} showed promising results for this task, however, its computational efficiency is still unaffordable, requiring too many evaluations of the objective function. We propose TnALE, a new algorithm that updates each structure-related variable alternately by local enumeration, \\emph{greatly} reducing the number of evaluations compared to TNLS. We theoretically investigate the descent steps for TNLS and TnALE, proving that both algorithms can achieve linear convergence up to a constant if a sufficient reduction of the objective is \\emph{reached} in each neighborhood. We also compare the evaluation efficiency of TNLS and TnALE, revealing that $\\Omega(2^N)$ evaluations are typically required in TNLS for \\emph{reaching} the objective reduction in the neighborhood, while ideally $O(N^2R)$ evaluations are sufficient in TnALE, where $N$ denotes the tensor order and $R$ reflects the \\emph{``low-rankness''} of the neighborhood. Experimental results verify that TnALE can find practically good TN-ranks and permutations with vastly fewer evaluations than the state-of-the-art algorithms."}}

The objectives of this research are twofold: (1) providing a feasible brain-controlled vehicle (BCV) mode; (2) providing a human-vehicle cooperative control mode. For the first aim, through a brain-computer interface (BCI), we can analyse the EEG signal and get the driving intentions of the driver. For the second aim, the human-vehicle cooperative control is manifested in the BCV combined with the obstacle detection assistance. Considering the potential dangers of driving a real motor vehicle in the outdoor, an obstacle detection module is essential in the human-vehicle cooperative driving system. Obstacle detection and emergency braking can ensure the safety of the driver and the vehicle during driving. EEG system based on steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is used in the BCI. Simulation and real vehicle driving experiment platform are designed to verify the feasibility of the proposed human-vehicle cooperative driving system. Five subjects participated in the simulation experiment and real the vehicle driving experiment. The outdoor experimental results show that the average accuracy of intention recognition is 90.68\u2009\u00b1\u20092.96% on the real vehicle platform. In this paper, we verified the feasibility of the SSVEP-based BCV mode and realised the human-vehicle cooperative driving system."}}

Movement-related cortical potential is a kind of brain activity associated with pre-movement decoding. In current studies, patterns decoded from movement are mainly applied to the binary classification between movement state and resting state, such as elbow flexion and rest. The classifications between two movement states and among multiple movement states are still challenging. This study proposes a new method, the star-arrangement spectral filtering (SASF), to solve the multi-class pre-movement classification problem. We first design a referenced task-related component analysis (RTRCA) framework that consists of two modules. This first module is the classification between movement state and resting state; the second module is the classification of multiple movement states. SASF is developed by optimizing the features in RTRCA. In SASF, feature selection on filter banks is used on the first module of RTRCA, and feature selection on time windows is used on the second module of RTRCA. A linear discriminant analysis classifier is used to classify the optimized features. In the binary classification between two motions, the classification accuracy of SASF achieves 0.9670$\\pm$0.0522, which is significantly higher than the result provided by the deep convolutional neural network (0.6247$\\pm$0.0680) and the discriminative spatial pattern method (0.4400$\\pm$0.0700). In the multi-class classification of 7 states, the classification accuracy of SASF is 0.9491$\\pm$0.0372. The proposed SASF greatly improves the classification between two motions and enables the classification among multiple motions. The result shows that the movement can be decoded from EEG signals before the actual limb movement."}}
