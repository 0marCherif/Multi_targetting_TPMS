Unlike dense 2D computation, point cloud convolution has sparse and irregular computation patterns and thus requires dedicated inference system support with specialized high-performance kernels. While existing point cloud deep learning libraries have developed different dataflows for convolution on point clouds, they assume a single dataflow throughout the execution of the entire model. In this work, we systematically analyze and improve existing dataflows. Our resulting system, TorchSparse++, achieves 2.9\u00d7, 3.3\u00d7, 2.2\u00d7 and 1.8\u00d7 measured end-to-end speedup on an NVIDIA A100 GPU over the state-of-the-art MinkowskiEngine, SpConv 1.2, TorchSparse and SpConv v2 in inference respectively. Furthermore, TorchSparse++ is the only system to date that supports all necessary primitives for 3D segmentation, detection, and reconstruction workloads in autonomous driving.

However, deploying these models for inference has been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented resource requirements. This has forced existing deployment frameworks to use multi-GPU inference pipelines, which are often complex and costly, or to use smaller and less performant models. In this work, we demonstrate that the main bottleneck for generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute, specifically for single batch inference. While quantization has emerged as a promising solution by representing model weights with reduced precision, previous efforts have often resulted in notable performance degradation. To address this, we introduce SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to 3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory constraint. Our framework incorporates two novel ideas: (i) sensitivity-based non-uniform quantization, which searches for the optimal bit precision assignment based on second-order information; and (ii) the Dense-and-Sparse decomposition that stores outliers and sensitive weight values in an efficient sparse format. When applied to the LLaMA models, our 3-bit quantization significantly reduces the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline by up to 2.1x as compared to the state-of-the-art methods with the same memory requirement. Furthermore, when deployed on an A6000 GPU, our quantized models achieve up to 2.3x speedup compared to the baseline. Our code is open-sourced and available online."}}

However, the slow inference, high memory consumption, and computation intensity of the noise estimation model hinder the efficient adoption of diffusion models. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) is considered a go-to compression method for other tasks, it does not work out-of-the-box on diffusion models. We propose a novel PTQ method specifically tailored towards the unique multi-timestep pipeline and model architecture of the diffusion models, which compresses the noise estimation network to accelerate the generation process. We identify the key difficulty of diffusion model quantization as the changing output distributions of noise estimation networks over multiple time steps and the bimodal activation distribution of the shortcut layers within the noise estimation network. We tackle these challenges with timestep-aware calibration and split shortcut quantization in this work. Experimental results show that our proposed method is able to quantize full-precision unconditional diffusion models into 4-bit while maintaining comparable performance (small FID change of at most 2.34 compared to >100 for traditional PTQ) in a training-free manner. Our approach can also be applied to text-guided image generation, where we can run stable diffusion in 4-bit weights with high generation quality for the first time."}}

ArtBench-10 has several advantages over previous artwork datasets. Firstly, it is class-balanced while most previous artwork datasets suffer from the long tail class distributions. Secondly, the images are of high quality with clean annotations. Thirdly, ArtBench-10 is created with standardized data collection, annotation, filtering, and preprocessing procedures. We provide three versions of the dataset with different resolutions ($32\\times32$, $256\\times256$, and original image size), formatted in a way that is easy to be incorporated by popular machine learning frameworks. We also conduct extensive benchmarking experiments using representative image synthesis models with ArtBench-10 and present in-depth analysis.

To empower users to counteract unwanted data use, we design, implement and evaluate a practical system that enables users to detect if their data was used to train an DNN model. We show how users can create special data points we call isotopes, which introduce \"spurious features\" into DNNs during training. With only query access to a trained model and no knowledge of the model training process, or control of the data labels, a user can apply statistical hypothesis testing to detect if a model has learned the spurious features associated with their isotopes by training on the user's data. This effectively turns DNNs' vulnerability to memorization and spurious correlations into a tool for data provenance. Our results confirm efficacy in multiple settings, detecting and distinguishing between hundreds of isotopes with high accuracy. We further show that our system works on public ML-as-a-service platforms and larger models such as ImageNet, can use physical objects instead of digital marks, and remains generally robust against several adaptive countermeasures."}}

As such, ubiquitous datasets for graph machine learning tasks have generally been highly homophilous, rewarding methods that leverage homophily as an inductive bias. Recent work has pointed out this particular focus, as new non-homophilous datasets have been introduced and graph representation learning models better suited for low-homophily settings have been developed. However, these datasets are small and poorly suited to truly testing the effectiveness of new methods in non-homophilous settings. We present a series of improved graph datasets with node label relationships that do not satisfy the homophily principle. Along with this, we introduce a new measure of the presence or absence of homophily that is better suited than existing measures in different regimes.
