Therefore, we hypothesize that nodes with the same attribute are often connected to the same node. Consequently, we propose two methods for graph embedding, parallel and serial, that use metric learning to reflect attribute data in node features. The proposed method can be applied to any graph embedding and metric learning method, and thus can also be applied to many new methods yet to be developed.

Although existing methods based on the steepest descent have achieved high attack success rates, ill-conditioned problems occasionally reduce their performance. To address this limitation, we utilize the conjugate gradient (CG) method, which is effective for this type of problem, and propose a novel attack algorithm inspired by the CG method, named the Auto Conjugate Gradient (ACG) attack. The results of large-scale evaluation experiments conducted on the latest robust models show that, for most models, ACG was able to find more adversarial examples with fewer iterations than the existing SOTA algorithm Auto-PGD (APGD). We investigated the difference in search performance between ACG and APGD in terms of diversification and intensification, and define a measure called Diversity Index (DI) to quantify the degree of diversity. From the analysis of the diversity using this index, we show that the more diverse search of the proposed method remarkably improves its attack success rate."}}

Sophisticated adversaries distribute their scans over multiple hosts and operate with stealth; therefore, low-rate scans hide beneath other benign traffic. Although previous studies attempted to discover such stealth scans by observing the distribution of ports and hosts, well-organized scans are difficult to find. However, a scanner can embed a fingerprint into the packet fields to distinguish between the scan and other traffic. In this study, we propose a new algorithm to identify the flexible fingerprint in consideration of the genetic algorithm idea. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such attempt. We successfully identified previously unknown fingerprints rather than existing ones through numer-ical experiments on darknet traffic. We analyzed the packets and discovered distinctive scan activities. Further, we collated the results with both cyber threat intelligence and investigation/large-scale scanner lists to ascertain the reliability of our model."}}

The B-spline is composed of line segments, Euler spirals, and arcs. By simplifying and digging in the qualities of Euler spirals, we discover a valid spiral segment criterion. This criterion can be used in deciding how to compose the B-spline. One main trait of the trajectory is that this B-spline trajectory is assumed and generated inside a collision-free corridor in every interpolation scenario. Hence, the trajectory can be G2 continuous and avoid instant obstacles in every scenario case."}}

Fugaku is a huge-scale Japanese exascale supercomputer that consists of 158,976 nodes connected by the Tofu interconnect D (TofuD). We have developed a BFS implementation that can extract the performance of Fugaku. We also optimize the number of processes per node, one-to-one communication, performance power ratio, and process mapping in the six-dimensional mesh/torus topology of TofuD. We evaluate the BFS performance for a large-scale graph consisting of about 2.2 trillion vertices and 35.2 trillion edges using the whole Fugaku system, and achieve 102,955 giga-traversed edges per second (GTEPS), resulting in the first position of Graph500 BFS ranking in November 2020. This performance is 3.3 times higher than that of Fugaku\u2019s previous system, the K computer."}}

There are no classical or quantum algorithms known to solve these problems efficiently. Their hardness has made lattices a major cryptographic primitive for post-quantum cryptography. Several different approaches have been used for lattice problems with different computational profiles; some suffer from super-exponential time, and others require exponential space. This motivated us to develop a novel lattice problem solver, CMAP-LAP, based on the clever coordination of different algorithms that run massively in parallel. With our flexible framework, heterogeneous modules run asynchronously in parallel on a large-scale distributed system while exchanging information, which drastically boosts the overall performance. We also implement full checkpoint-and-restart functionality, which is vital to high-dimensional lattice problems. CMAP-LAP facilitates the implementation of large-scale parallel strategies for lattice problems since all the functions are designed to be customizable and abstract. Through numerical experiments with up to 103,680 cores, we evaluated the performance and stability of our system and demonstrated its high capability for future massive-scale experiments."}}

For a long time, frequent visits to customers were required because they could not determine the amount of remaining gas without a staff visit and observation. To solve this problem, smart meters are started to be employed to acquire gas consumption more frequently without visiting customers. In this study, we construct a system to optimize plans for cylinder replacement, and evaluate it with a large-scale field test. We propose an algorithm to create a replacement plan with three steps: estimating the replacement date, acquiring the customer list for replacement, and determining the delivery route. A more accurate estimation of the replacement date can be acquired with a smart meter, which is used for making a customer list for replacement. The formulation for making a customer list enables the gas provider to replace cylinders some days before the date when the gas would run out. It can suppress the concentration of replacements on certain days. Large-scale verification experiments were performed with more than 1,000 customers in Chiba prefecture in Japan. In the field test, the gas provider incorporated the system into its replacement operations. Moreover, the replacement plans developed by the proposed system were compared with that by the gas provider. Our system reduced the number of gas cylinders with gas shortage, the number of visits without replacement due to plenty of gas remaining, and the working duration per customer, which shows that our system benefits both gas providers and customers."}}
