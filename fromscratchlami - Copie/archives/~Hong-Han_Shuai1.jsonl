Lightweight deep learning (DL) indicates the procedures of compressing DNN models into more compact ones, which are suitable to be executed on edge devices due to their limited resources and computational capabilities while maintaining comparable performance as the original. Currently, the approaches of model compression include but not limited to network pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, neural architecture search. In this work, we present a fresh overview to summarize recent development and challenges for model compression."}}

However, the considerable cost of annotating data motivates the need for learning strategies under low-resource settings. In this paper, we investigate the problems of learning summarizers with only few examples and propose corresponding methods for improvements. First, typical transfer learning methods are prone to be affected by data properties and learning objectives in the pretext tasks. Therefore, based on pretrained language models, we further present a meta learning framework to transfer few-shot learning processes from source corpora to the target corpus. Second, previous methods learn from training examples without decomposing the  <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">content</i>  and  <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">preference</i> . The generated summaries could therefore be constrained by the preference bias in the training set, especially under low-resource settings. As such, we propose decomposing the contents and preferences during learning through the parameter modulation, which enables control over preferences during inference. Third, given a target application, specifying required preferences could be non-trivial because the preferences may be difficult to derive through observations. Therefore, we propose a novel decoding method to automatically estimate suitable preferences and generate corresponding summary candidates from the few training examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on six diverse corpora with 30.11%/33.95%/27.51% and 26.74%/31.14%/24.48% average improvements on ROUGE-1/2/L under 10- and 100-example settings."}}

By virtue of deep learning techniques, the performance of MER has been significantly improved and reached unprecedented results. This paper proposes a novel architecture to mimic how the expressions are annotated. Specifically, during the annotation process in several datasets, the AU labels are first obtained with FACS, and the expression labels are then decided based on the combinations of the AU labels. Meanwhile, these AU labels describe either the eyes or mouth movements (mutually-exclusive). Following this idea, we design a dual-branch structure with a new augmentation method to separately capture the eyes and mouth features and teach the model what the general expressions should be. Moreover, to adaptively fuse the area features for different expressions, we propose Area Weighted Module to assign different weights to each region. Additionally, we set up an auxiliary task to align the AU similarity scores to help our model capture facial patterns further with AU labels. The proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy on the CASME II and SAMM datasets. Moreover, we provide a new visualization approach to show the relationship between the facial regions and AU features."}}

In this paper, we focus on objectively judging what and where to return strokes, which is still unexplored in turn-based sports. By formulating stroke forecasting as a sequence prediction task, existing works can tackle the problem but fail to model information based on the characteristics of badminton. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Position-aware Fusion of Rally Progress and Player Styles framework (ShuttleNet) that incorporates rally progress and information of the players by two modified encoder-decoder extractors. Moreover, we design a fusion network to integrate rally contexts and contexts of the players by conditioning on information dependency and different positions. Extensive experiments on the badminton dataset demonstrate that ShuttleNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and also empirically validates the feasibility of each component in ShuttleNet. On top of that, we provide an analysis scenario for the stroke forecasting problem."}}

Although there are many works for SIoT, they focus on designing the architectures and protocols for SIoT under the specific schemes. How to efficiently utilize the collaboration capability of SIoT to complete complex tasks remains unexplored. Therefore, we propose a new problem family, namely, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Task-Optimized SIoT Selection (TOSS)</i> , to find the best group of IoT objects for a given set of tasks in the task pool. TOSS aims to select the target SIoT group such that the target SIoT group is able to easily communicate with each other while maximizing the accuracy of performing the given tasks. We propose two problem formulations, named <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Bounded Communication-loss TOSS (BC-TOSS)</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Robustness Guaranteed TOSS (RG-TOSS)</i> , for different scenarios and prove that they are both NP-hard and inapproximable. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm with a performance guarantee for BC-TOSS, and an efficient polynomial-time algorithm to obtain good solutions for RG-TOSS. Moreover, as RG-TOSS is NP-hard and inapproximable within any factor, we further propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Structure-Aware Reinforcement Learning (SARL)</i> to leverage the Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to effectively solve RG-TOSS.

In this paper, we present an extract-then-abstract Transformer framework to overcome the problem. Specifically, we leverage pre-trained language models to construct a hierarchical extractor for salient sentence selection across documents and an abstractor for rewriting the selected contents as summaries. However, learning such a framework is challenging since the optimal contents for the abstractor are generally unknown. Previous works typically create pseudo extraction oracle to enable the supervised learning for both the extractor and the abstractor. Nevertheless, we argue that the performance of such methods could be restricted due to the insufficient information for prediction and inconsistent objectives between training and testing. To this end, we propose a loss weighting mechanism that makes the model aware of the unequal importance for the sentences not in the pseudo extraction oracle, and leverage the fine-tuned abstractor to generate summary references as auxiliary signals for learning the extractor. Moreover, we propose a reinforcement learning method that can efficiently apply to the extractor for harmonizing the optimization between training and testing. Experiment results show that our framework substantially outperforms strong baselines with comparable model sizes and achieves the best results on the Multi-News, Multi-XScience, and WikiCatSum corpora."}}

Robust Face Mask Detector via Triplet-Consistency Representation Learning", "abstract": "In the absence of vaccines or medicines to stop COVID-19, one of the effective methods to slow the spread of the coronavirus and reduce the overloading of healthcare is to wear a face mask. Nevertheless, to mandate the use of face masks or coverings in public areas, additional human resources are required, which is tedious and attention-intensive. To automate the monitoring process, one of the promising solutions is to leverage existing object detection models to detect the faces with or without masks. As such, security officers do not have to stare at the monitoring devices or crowds, and only have to deal with the alerts triggered by the detection of faces without masks. Existing object detection models usually focus on designing the CNN-based network architectures for extracting discriminative features. However, the size of training datasets of face mask detection is small, while the difference between faces with and without masks is subtle. Therefore, in this article, we propose a face mask detection framework that uses the context attention module to enable the effective attention of the feed-forward convolution neural network by adapting their attention maps\u2019 feature refinement. Moreover, we further propose an anchor-free detector with Triplet-Consistency Representation Learning by integrating the consistency loss and the triplet loss to deal with the small-scale training data and the similarity between masks and occlusions.
