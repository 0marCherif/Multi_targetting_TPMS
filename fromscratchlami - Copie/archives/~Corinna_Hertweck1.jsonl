However, these metrics are still insufficiently linked to philosophical theories, and their moral meaning is often unclear. We propose a general framework for analyzing the fairness of decision systems based on theories of distributive justice, encompassing different established \"patterns of justice\" that correspond to different normative positions. We show that the most popular group fairness metrics can be interpreted as special cases of our approach. Thus, we provide a unifying and interpretative framework for group fairness metrics that reveals the normative choices associated with each of them and that allows understanding their moral substance. At the same time, we provide an extension of the space of possible fairness metrics beyond the ones currently discussed in the fair ML literature. Our framework also allows overcoming several limitations of group fairness metrics that have been criticized in the literature, most notably (1) that they are parity-based, i.e., that they demand some form of equality between groups, which may sometimes be harmful to marginalized groups, (2) that they only compare decisions across groups, but not the resulting consequences for these groups, and (3) that the full breadth of the distributive justice literature is not sufficiently represented."}}

We suspect that one reason for this is that the field of algorithmic fairness came up with a lot of definitions of fairness, which are difficult to navigate. The goal of this paper is to provide data scientists with an accessible introduction to group fairness metrics and to give some insight into the philosophical reasoning for caring about these metrics. We will do this by considering in which sense socio-demographic groups are compared for making a statement on fairness."}}

When fairness metrics are proposed, they are typically argued for by highlighting their mathematical properties. Rarely are the moral assumptions beneath the metric explained. Our aim in this paper is to consider the moral aspects associated with the statistical fairness criterion of independence (statistical parity). To this end, we consider previous work, which discusses the two worldviews \"What You See Is What You Get\" (WYSIWYG) and \"We're All Equal\" (WAE) and by doing so provides some guidance for clarifying the possible assumptions in the design of algorithms. We present an extension of this work, which centers on morality. The most natural moral extension is that independence needs to be fulfilled if and only if differences in predictive features (e.g. high school grades and standardized test scores are predictive of performance at university) between socio-demographic groups are caused by unjust social disparities or measurement errors. Through two counterexamples, we demonstrate that this extension is not universally true. This means that the question of whether independence should be used or not cannot be satisfactorily answered by only considering the justness of differences in the predictive features."}}
