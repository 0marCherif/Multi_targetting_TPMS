Machine learning can harness the power of computers to potentially create an accurate and efficient method for performing this task at scale, given that its analytical processing can be more sensitive to subtle physical differences in insects, which experts may not perceive. However, existing machine learning methods are designed to only classify insect samples into described species, thus failing to identify samples from undescribed species.\nWe propose a novel deep hierarchical Bayesian model for insect classification, given the taxonomic hierarchy inherent in insects. This model can classify samples of both described and undescribed species; described samples are assigned a species while undescribed samples are assigned a genus, which is a pivotal advancement over just identifying them as outliers. We demonstrated this proof of concept on a new database containing paired insect image and DNA barcode data from four insect orders, including 1040 species, which far exceeds the number of species used in existing work. A quarter of the species were excluded from the training set to simulate undescribed species.\nWith the proposed classification framework using combined image and DNA data in the model, species classification accuracy for described species was 96.66% and genus classification accuracy for undescribed species was 81.39%. Including both data sources in the model resulted in significant improvement over including image data only (39.11% accuracy for described species and 35.88% genus accuracy for undescribed species), and modest improvement over including DNA data only (73.39% genus accuracy for undescribed species).\nUnlike current machine learning methods, the proposed deep hierarchical Bayesian learning approach can simultaneously classify samples of both described and undescribed species, a functionality that could become instrumental in biodiversity monitoring across the globe. This framework can be customized for any taxonomic classification problem for which image and DNA data can be obtained, thus making it relevant for use across all biological kingdoms."}}

In biophysical modeling, it is commonly assumed that the complex spatial arrangement of myelinated and unmyelinated axons in peripheral nerves is random, however, in reality the axonal organization is inhomogeneous and anisotropic. Present quantitative neuroanatomy methods analyze peripheral nerves in terms of the number of axons and the morphometric characteristics of the axons, such as area and diameter. In this study, we employed spatial statistics and point process models to describe the spatial arrangement of axons and Sinkhorn distances to compute the similarities between these arrangements (in terms of first- and second-order statistics) in various vagus and pelvic nerve cross-sections. We utilized high-resolution TEM images that have been segmented using a custom-built high-throughput deep learning system based on a highly modified U-Net architecture. Our findings show a novel and innovative approach to quantifying similarities between spatial point patterns using metrics derived from the solution to the optimal transport problem. We also present a generalizable pipeline for quantitative analysis of peripheral nerve architecture. Our data demonstrate differences between male- and female-originating samples and similarities between the pelvic and abdominal vagus nerves."}}

We propose a Bayesian approach to zero-shot learning (ZSL) that introduces the notion of meta-classes and implements a Bayesian hierarchy around these classes to effectively blend data likelihood with local and global priors. Local priors driven by data from seen classes, i.e., classes available at training time, become instrumental in recovering unseen classes, i.e., classes that are missing at training time, in a generalized ZSL (GZSL) setting. Hyperparameters of the Bayesian model offer a convenient way to optimize the trade-off between seen and unseen class accuracy. We conduct experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including a large scale ImageNet and show that our model produces promising results in the challenging GZSL setting."}}

Its utility in detecting rare phases is demonstrated with new geologic discoveries near the Mars-2020 rover landing site. Akaganeite is found in sediments on the Jezero crater floor and in fluvial deposits at NE Syrtis. Jarosite and silica are found on the Jezero crater floor while chlorite-smectite and Al phyllosilicates are found in the Jezero crater walls. These detections point to a multi-stage, multi-chemistry history of water in Jezero crater and the surrounding region and provide new information for guiding the Mars-2020 rover's landed exploration. In particular, the akaganeite, silica, and jarosite in the floor deposits suggest either a later episode of salty, Fe-rich waters that post-date Jezero delta or groundwater alteration of portions of the Jezero sedimentary sequence."}}

Most existing solutions for this task are proposed for static data. However, more realistic scenarios stipulate emergence of records in a streaming fashion where records may belong to known as well as unknown persons all sharing the same name. This requires a flexible name disambiguation algorithm that can not only classify records of known persons represented in the training data by their existing records but can also identify records of new ambiguous persons with no existing records included in the initial training dataset. Toward achieving this objective, in this paper we present a non-parametric Bayesian framework that utilizes a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPGMM) as a core engine for online name disambiguation task. A Sequential Importance Sampling with Resampling (SISR) technique, also known as particle filtering, is proposed for inference to simultaneously perform online classification and new class discovery. Specifically, for each online record, we approximate its class conditional posterior distribution by a set of particles and their weights, which are updated in a sequential manner without the need to re-access previously observed records. We also propose an interactive version of our online name disambiguation method, which improves the prediction accuracy by exploiting user feedback."}}

Some of these hurdles led to a surge of interest in several research areas relevant to NEL such as open set classification or zero-shot learning. The presented study which has been motivated by two important applications proposes a NEL algorithm built on a highly flexible, doubly non-parametric Bayesian Gaussian mixture model that can grow arbitrarily large in terms of the number of classes and their components. We report several experiments that demonstrate the promising performance of the introduced model for NEL."}}
