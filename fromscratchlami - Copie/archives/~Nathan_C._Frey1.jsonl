While innovations and applications from A.I. have brought significant advances, from applications to vision and natural language to improvements to fields like medical imaging and materials engineering, their costs should not be neglected. As we embrace a world with ever-increasing amounts of data as well as research and development of A.I. applications, we are sure to face an ever-mounting energy footprint to sustain these computational budgets, data storage needs, and more. But, is this sustainable and, more importantly, what kind of setting is best positioned to nurture such sustainable A.I. in both research and practice? In this paper, we outline our outlook for Green A.I. -- a more sustainable, energy-efficient and energy-aware ecosystem for developing A.I. across the research, computing, and practitioner communities alike -- and the steps required to arrive there. We present a bird's eye view of various areas for potential changes and improvements from the ground floor of AI's operational and hardware optimizations for datacenters/HPCs to the current incentive structures in the world of A.I. research and practice, and more. We hope these points will spur further discussion, and action, on some of these issues and their potential solutions."}}

However, these problems often require sampling new designs that satisfy multiple properties of interest in addition to learning the data distribution. This multi-objective optimization becomes more challenging when properties are independent or orthogonal to each other.\nIn this work, we propose a Pareto-compositional energy-based model (pcEBM), a framework that uses multiple gradient descent for sampling new designs that adhere to various constraints in optimizing distinct properties. We demonstrate its ability to learn non-convex Pareto fronts and generate sequences that simultaneously satisfy multiple desired properties across a series of real-world antibody design tasks."}}

Recent works highlighting this problem conclude there is an urgent need for methods that reduce the energy needs of NLP and machine learning more broadly. In this article, we investigate techniques that can be used to reduce the energy consumption of common NLP applications. In particular, we focus on techniques to measure energy usage and different hardware and datacenter-oriented settings that can be tuned to reduce energy consumption for training and inference for language models. We characterize the impact of these settings on metrics such as computational performance and energy consumption through experiments conducted on a high performance computing system as well as popular cloud computing platforms. These techniques can lead to significant reduction in energy consumption when training language models or their use for inference. For example, power-capping, which limits the maximum power a GPU can consume, can enable a 15\\% decrease in energy usage with marginal increase in overall computation time when training a transformer-based language model."}}

Neural architecture searches, hyperparameter sweeps, and rapid prototyping consume immense resources that can prevent resource-constrained researchers from experimenting with large models and carry considerable environmental impact. As such, it becomes essential to understand how different deep neural networks (DNNs) and training leverage increasing compute and energy resources -- especially specialized computationally-intensive models across different domains and applications. In this paper, we conduct over 3,400 experiments training an array of deep networks representing various domains/tasks -- natural language processing, computer vision, and chemistry -- on up to 424 graphics processing units (GPUs). During training, our experiments systematically vary compute resource characteristics and energy-saving mechanisms such as power utilization and GPU clock rate limits to capture and illustrate the different trade-offs and scaling behaviors each representative model exhibits under various resource and energy-constrained regimes. We fit power law models that describe how training time scales with available compute resources and energy constraints. We anticipate that these findings will help inform and guide high-performance computing providers in optimizing resource utilization, by selectively reducing energy consumption for different deep learning tasks/workflows with minimal impact on training."}}
