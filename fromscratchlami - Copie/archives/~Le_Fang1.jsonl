Most existing algorithms assume that the underlying task distribution is stationary. Here we consider a more realistic and challenging setting in that task distributions evolve over time. We name this problem as Semi-supervised meta-learning with Evolving Task diStributions, abbreviated as SETS. Two key challenges arise in this more realistic setting: (i) how to use unlabeled data in the presence of a large amount of unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) data; and (ii) how to prevent catastrophic forgetting on previously learned task distributions due to the task distribution shift. We propose an OOD Robust and knowleDge presErved semi-supeRvised meta-learning approach (ORDER) (we use ORDER to denote the task distributions sequentially arrive with some ORDER), to tackle these two major challenges. Specifically, our ORDER introduces a novel mutual information regularization to robustify the model with unlabeled OOD data and adopts an optimal transport regularization to remember previously learned knowledge in feature space. In addition, we test our method on a very challenging dataset: SETS on large-scale non-stationary semi-supervised task distributions consisting of (at least) 72K tasks. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate the proposed ORDER alleviates forgetting on evolving task distributions and is more robust to OOD data than related strong baselines."}}

The widely adopted memory replay approach could gradually become less effective for long data streams, as the model may memorize the stored examples and overfit the memory buffer. Second, existing methods overlook the high uncertainty in the memory data distribution since there is a big gap between the memory data distribution and the distribution of all the previous data examples. To address these problems, for the first time, we propose a principled memory evolution framework to dynamically evolve the memory data distribution by making the memory buffer gradually harder to be memorized with distributionally robust optimization (DRO). We then derive a family of methods to evolve the memory buffer data in the continuous probability measure space with Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF). The proposed DRO is wrt the worst-case evolved memory data distribution, thus guarantees the model performance and learns significantly more robust features than existing memory-replay-based methods. Extensive experiments on existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for alleviating forgetting. As a by-product of the proposed framework, our method is more robust to adversarial examples than existing task-free CL methods."}}

The CF issue remains nearly unexplored and is more challenging when meta-learning on a sequence of domains (datasets), called sequential domain meta-learning (SDML). In this work, we propose a simple yet effective learning to learn approach, ie, meta optimizer, to mitigate the CF problem in SDML. We first apply the proposed meta optimizer to the simplified setting of SDML, domain-aware meta-learning, where the domain labels and boundaries are known during the learning process. We propose dynamically freezing the network and incorporating it with the proposed meta optimizer by considering the domain nature during meta training. In addition, we extend the meta optimizer to the more general setting of SDML, domain-agnostic meta-learning, where domain labels and boundaries are unknown during the learning process. We propose a domain shift detection technique to capture latent domain change and equip the meta optimizer with it to work in this setting. The proposed meta optimizer is versatile and can be easily integrated with several existing meta-learning algorithms. Finally, we construct a challenging and large-scale benchmark consisting of 10 heterogeneous domains with a super long task sequence consisting of 100K tasks. We perform extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark for both settings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, outperforming current strong baselines by a large margin."}}

A typical setting across current meta learning algorithms assumes a stationary task distribution during meta training. In this paper, we explore a more practical and challenging setting where task distribution changes over time with domain shift. Particularly, we consider realistic scenarios where task distribution is highly imbalanced with domain labels unavailable in nature. We propose a kernel-based method for domain change detection and a difficulty-aware memory management mechanism that jointly considers the imbalanced domain size and domain importance to learn across domains continuously. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient adaptive task sampling method during meta training, which significantly reduces task gradient variance with theoretical guarantees. Finally, we propose a challenging benchmark with imbalanced domain sequences and varied domain difficulty. We have performed extensive evaluations on the proposed benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method."}}

However, users of these models can only control the prefix of sentences or certain global aspects of generated text. It is challenging to simultaneously achieve fine-grained controllability and preserve the state-of-the-art unconditional text generation capability. In this paper, we first propose a new task named \u201cOutline to Story\u201d (O2S) as a test bed for fine-grained controllable generation of long text, which generates a multi-paragraph story from cascaded events, i.e., a sequence of outline events that\nguide subsequent paragraph generation. We then create dedicate datasets for future benchmarks, built by state-of-the-art keyword extraction techniques. Finally, we propose an extremely simple yet strong baseline method for the O2S task, which fine tunes pre-trained language models on augmented sequences of outline-story pairs with simple language modeling objective. Our method does not introduce any new parameters or perform any architecture modification, except several special tokens as delimiters to build augmented sequences.\nExtensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art conditional story generation performance with our model, achieving better fine-grained controllability and user flexibility. Our paper is among the first ones by our knowledge to propose a model and to create datasets for the task of \u201coutline to story\u201d.

Recently, Transformers and its variants have achieved remarkable effectiveness without explicit latent representation learning, thus lack satisfying controllability in generation. In this paper, we advocate to revive latent variable modeling, essentially the power of representation learning, in the era of Transformers to enhance controllability without hurting state-of-the-art generation effectiveness. Specifically, we integrate latent representation vectors with a Transformer-based pre-trained architecture to build conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE).

One key factor is the exploitation of smooth latent structures to guide the generation. However, the representation power of VAEs is limited due to two reasons: (1) the Gaussian assumption is often made on the variational posteriors; and meanwhile (2) a notorious \"posterior collapse\" issue occurs. In this paper, we advocate sample-based representations of variational distributions for natural language, leading to implicit latent features, which can provide flexible representation power compared with Gaussian-based posteriors. We further develop an LVM to directly match the aggregated posterior to the prior. It can be viewed as a natural extension of VAEs with a regularization of maximizing mutual information, mitigating the \"posterior collapse\" issue. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our models in various text generation scenarios, including language modeling, unaligned style transfer, and dialog response generation.

In this paper, we formulate the dynamics of a complex interacting network as a stochastic process driven by a sequence of events, and develop expectation propagation algorithms to make inferences from noisy observations. To avoid getting stuck at a local optimum, we formulate the problem of minimizing Bethe free energy as a constrained primal problem and take advantage of the concavity of dual problem in the feasible domain of dual variables guaranteed by duality theorem. Our expectation propagation algorithms demonstrate better performance in inferring the interaction dynamics in complex transportation networks than competing models such as particle filter, extended Kalman filter, and deep neural networks."}}
