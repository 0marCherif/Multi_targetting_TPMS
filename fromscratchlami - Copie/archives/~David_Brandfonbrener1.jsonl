To accomplish this goal, we modify the process of data collection to include more than just successful demonstrations of the desired task. Instead we develop a novel protocol that we call Visual Backtracking Teleoperation (VBT), which deliberately collects a dataset of visually similar failures, recoveries, and successes. VBT data collection is particularly useful for efficiently learning accurate value functions from small datasets of image-based observations. We demonstrate VBT on a real robot to perform continuous control from image observations for the deformable manipulation task of T-shirt grasping. We find that by adjusting the data collection process we improve the quality of both the learned value functions and policies over a variety of baseline methods for data collection. Specifically, we find that offline reinforcement learning on VBT data outperforms standard behavior cloning on successful demonstration data by 13% when both methods are given equal-sized datasets of 60 minutes of data from the real robot."}}

This requirement restricts the algorithms derived in that work to the tabular and linear settings where such estimates exist. In this work, we develop a novel method for incorporating scalable uncertainty estimates into an offline reinforcement learning algorithm called deep-SPIBB that extends the SPIBB family of algorithms to environments with larger state and action spaces. We use recent innovations in uncertainty estimation from the deep learning community to get more scalable uncertainty estimates to plug into deep-SPIBB. While these uncertainty estimates do not allow for the same theoretical guarantees as in the tabular case, we argue that the SPIBB mechanism for incorporating uncertainty is more robust and flexible than pessimistic approaches that incorporate the uncertainty as a value function penalty. We bear this out empirically, showing that deep-SPIBB outperforms pessimism based approaches with access to the same uncertainty estimates and performs at least on par with a variety of other strong baselines across several environments and datasets."}}

RCSL algorithms learn the distribution of actions conditioned on both the state and the return of the trajectory. Then they define a policy by conditioning on achieving high return. In this paper, we provide a rigorous study of the capabilities and limitations of RCSL something which is crucially missing in previous work. We find that RCSL returns the optimal policy under a set of assumptions that are stronger than those needed for the more traditional dynamic programming-based algorithms. We provide specific examples of MDPs and datasets that illustrate the necessity of these assumptions and the limits of RCSL. Finally, we present empirical evidence that these limitations will also cause issues in practice by providing illustrative experiments in simple point-mass environments and on datasets from the D4RL benchmark."}}

Such data-driven progress has been less evident in offline reinforcement learning (RL), because offline RL data is usually collected to optimize specific target tasks limiting the data\u2019s diversity. In this work, we propose Exploratory data for Offline RL (ExORL), a data-centric approach to offline RL. ExORL first generates data with unsupervised reward-free exploration, then relabels this data with a downstream reward before training a policy with offline RL. We find that exploratory data allows vanilla off-policy RL algorithms, without any offline-specific modifications, to outperform or match state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on downstream tasks. Our findings suggest that data generation is as important as algorithmic advances for offline RL and hence requires careful consideration from the community."}}

This one-step algorithm beats the previously reported results of iterative algorithms on a large portion of the D4RL benchmark. The one-step baseline achieves this strong performance while being notably simpler and more robust to hyperparameters than previously proposed iterative algorithms. We argue that the relatively poor performance of iterative approaches is a result of the high variance inherent in doing off-policy evaluation and magnified by the repeated optimization of policies against those estimates.

We ask whether the same phenomenon occurs for offline contextual bandits. Our results are mixed. Value-based algorithms benefit from the same generalization behavior as overparameterized supervised learning, but policy-based algorithms do not. We show that this discrepancy is due to the \\emph{action-stability} of their objectives. An objective is action-stable if there exists a prediction (action-value vector or action distribution) which is optimal no matter which action is observed. While value-based objectives are action-stable, policy-based objectives are unstable. We formally prove upper bounds on the regret of overparameterized value-based learning and lower bounds on the regret for policy-based algorithms. In our experiments with large neural networks, this gap between action-stable value-based objectives and unstable policy-based objectives leads to significant performance differences."}}

Here we take a first step towards extending theoretical convergence guarantees to TD learning with nonlinear function approximation. More precisely, we consider the expected learning dynamics of the TD(0) algorithm for value estimation. As the step-size converges to zero, these dynamics are defined by a nonlinear ODE which depends on the geometry of the space of function approximators, the structure of the underlying Markov chain, and their interaction. We find a set of function approximators that includes ReLU networks and has geometry amenable to TD learning regardless of environment, so that the solution performs about as well as linear TD in the worst case. Then, we show how environments that are more reversible induce dynamics that are better for TD learning and prove global convergence to the true value function for well-conditioned function approximators. Finally, we generalize a divergent counterexample to a family of divergent problems to demonstrate how the interaction between approximator and environment can go wrong and to motivate the assumptions needed to prove convergence.
