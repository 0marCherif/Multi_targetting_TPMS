As the number of classes increases, class ambiguity and class imbalance become more and more problematic to achieve high top-1 accuracy. Meanwhile, Top-K metrics (metrics allowing K guesses) have become popular, especially for performance reporting. Yet, proposing top-K losses tailored for deep learning remains a challenge, both theoretically and practically. In this paper we introduce a stochastic top-K hinge loss inspired by recent developments on top-K calibrated losses. Our proposal is based on the smoothing of the top-K operator building on the flexible \"perturbed optimizer\" framework. We show that our loss function performs very well in the case of balanced datasets, while benefiting from a significantly lower computational time than the state-of-the-art top-K loss function. In addition, we propose a simple variant of our loss for the imbalanced case. Experiments on a heavy-tailed dataset show that our loss function significantly outperforms other baseline loss functions. "}}

We highlight two particular features of the dataset, inherent to the way the images are acquired and to the intrinsic diversity of plants morphology:\n    i) The dataset has a strong class imbalance, meaning that a few species account for most of the images.\n    ii) Many species are visually similar, making identification difficult even for the expert eye.\nThese two characteristics make the present dataset well suited for the evaluation of set-valued classification methods and algorithms. Therefore, we recommend two set-valued evaluation metrics associated with the dataset (mean top-k accuracy and mean average-k accuracy) and we provide the results of a baseline approach based on a deep neural network trained with the cross-entropy loss."}}
