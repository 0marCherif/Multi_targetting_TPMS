Finding a feasible worst case workload is difficult due to logical correlation within the logic circuit under consideration. In this article, we propose an NBTI-aware subset simulation (SS) framework that efficiently and accurately finds the failure probability covering various input duty cycles determined by different workloads. In addition, the proposed method is incorporated with the NBTI mitigation technique to facilitate workload-aware mitigation. Through numerical experiments using benchmark circuits, the proposed method achieves up to 36 times speedup compared to a naive Monte Carlo method. The NBTI mitigation based on SS demonstrates <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.78\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula> better mitigation for multiple input duty cycles compared to the conventional method."}}

For computer vision tasks where inputs are images, existing works mostly focus on improving the throughput of inference for multiple images. However, in many real-time applications, it is critical to reduce the latency of a single image inference, which is more complicated than improving the throughput because of the inherent data dependencies. On the other hand, from human brain's perspective, the complexity in our visual surroundings is first encoded as a pattern of light on a two dimensional array of photoreceptors, with little direct resemblance to the original input or the ultimate percept. Within just a few hundred microns of retinal thickness, this initial signal encoded by our photoreceptors must be transformed into an adequate representation of the entire visual scene. Inspired by how the retina helps human brain incept new information efficiently, we present an end-to-end structured framework built using any existing convolutional neural network (CNN) as the backbone. The proposed framework, called VisualNet, can create task parallelism for the backbone during the inference of a single image. Experiments using a number of neural networks for the ImageNet classification task and the CIFAR-10 classification task on GPUs and CPUs show that the proposed VisualNet reduces the latency of the regular network it builds on by up to 80.6% when both are fully parallelized with state-of-the-art acceleration libraries. At the same time, VisualNet can achieve similar or slightly higher accuracy."}}

Among the various quantum-resilient cryptography schemes proposed in the currently running NIST\u2019s post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization plan, the lattice-based learning-with-error (LWE) schemes have emerged as the most viable and preferred class for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to their compact area and memory footprint compared to other alternatives. However, compared to the classical schemes used today, R-LWE is much harder a challenge to fit on embedded IoT (end-node) devices, due to their stricter resource constraints (lower area, memory, and energy budgets) as well as their limited computational capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first endeavor exploring the inherent approximate nature of the LWE problem to undertake a multilevel approximate R-LWE (AxRLWE) architecture with respective security estimates opt for lightweight IoT devices. Undertaking AxRLWE on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), we benchmarked a 64% area reduction cost compared to earlier accurate R-LWE designs at the cost of reduced quantum security. For the application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) with 45-nm CMOS technology, AxRLWE was benchmarked to fit well within the same area budget of a lightweight ECC processor and consume a third of energy compared to special class of R-Binary LWE (R-BLWE) designs being proposed for an IoT, with a better security level."}}
