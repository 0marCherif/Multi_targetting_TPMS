Each source generates packets in a decentralized manner and employs a slotted random access mechanism to transmit the packets. In particular, we are interested in networks with a large number of low-complexity devices that share low-capacity random access channels. Accordingly, we investigate update strategies for remote tracking of source states that require each update to constitute as few bits as possible. To that end, we develop update strategies requiring only one-bit of information per update that employ a local cancellation strategy. We further analytically compare the performance of the cancellation-enabled update policy to the optimal policy that does not restrict the number of bits for each update, which show that an asymptotic upper bound of the optimality ratio is <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\frac{13\\sqrt{2}}{12}$</tex-math></inline-formula> . Through simulations, we compare the proposed cancellation-enabled one-bit update policy with zero-wait sampling and threshold-based sampling policies that require more than one-bit of information per update. The comparisons show that the cancellation-enabled update policy at its optimal threshold level outperforms the multi-bit update policies."}}

This calls for new distributed and low-overhead Multiple-Access-Control (MAC) strategies to serve such dynamic demands with spectral efficiency characteristics. In this work, we address this need by identifying and developing two fundamentally different MAC paradigms: (i) congestion-based paradigm that estimates the congestion level in the system and adapts to it; and (ii) age-based paradigm that prioritizes demands based on their ages. Despite their apparent differences, we develop policies under each paradigm in a generic multi-channel access scenario that are provably throughput-optimal when they employ any asymptotically-efficient channel encoding/decoding mechanism. We also characterize the stability regions of the two designs, and investigate the conditions under which one design outperforms the other. We perform extensive simulations to validate the theoretical claims and investigate the non-asymptotic performances of our designs."}}

Therefore, solving the distributed optimization problem has become an important task. In this work, we consider a distributed processing network $G = \\left( {\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E}} \\right)$ with n nodes, where each node i can only evaluate the values of a local function (i.e., has zeroth-order information) and can only communicate with its neighbors. The objective is to reach consensus on the global optimizer of ${\\max _{x \\in \\mathcal{X}}}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^n {{f_i}(x)} $. Previous methods either assume first-order gradient information which is not suitable for many model-free learning scenarios, or consider the zeroth-order information but assume convexity of the objective functions and can only guarantee convergence to a stationary point for nonconvex objectives. To address these limitations, we drop both the known gradient assumption and convexity assumption. Instead, we propose a distributed Bayesian framework for the problem with only zeroth-order information and general nonconvex objective functions in a Mat\u00e9rn Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Under this framework, we propose an algorithm and show that with high probability it reaches consensus on all nodes and has a sublinear regret with regard to the global optimal. The results are validated under numerical studies."}}

In such instances, the existing RL methods may fail miserably due to frequent statistical outliers. In this work, we establish that temporal difference (TD) learning with a dynamic gradient clipping mechanism, and correspondingly operated natural actor-critic (NAC), can be provably robustified against heavy-tailed reward distributions. It is shown in the framework of linear function approximation that a favorable tradeoff between bias and variability of the stochastic gradients can be achieved with this dynamic gradient clipping mechanism. In particular, we prove that robust versions of TD learning achieve sample complexities of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{1}{p}})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-1-\\frac{1}{p}})$ with and without the full-rank assumption on the feature matrix, respectively, under heavy-tailed rewards with finite moments of order $(1+p)$ for some $p\\in(0,1]$, both in expectation and with high probability. We show that a robust variant of NAC based on Robust TD learning achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{-4-\\frac{2}{p}})$ sample complexity. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical experiments."}}

We start by formulating the hard-cache-constrained problem for this setting, which quickly becomes intractable due to the limited cache. To bypass this challenge, we first propose a flexible time-based-eviction model to derive the average system cost function that measures the system\u2019s cost due to the service of aging content in addition to the regular cache miss cost. Next, we solve the cache-unconstrained case, which reveals how the refresh dynamics and popularity of content affect optimal caching. Then, we extend our approach to a soft-cache-constrained version, where we can guarantee that the cache use is limited with arbitrarily high probability. The corresponding solution reveals the interesting insight that \u2018whether to cache an item or not in the local cache?\u2019 depends primarily on its popularity level and channel reliability, whereas \u2018how long the cached item should be held in the cache before eviction?\u2019 depends primarily on its refresh rate. Moreover, we investigate the cost-cache saving trade-offs and prove that substantial cache gains can be obtained while also asymptotically achieving the minimum cost as the database size grows."}}

However, numerous applications, such as news and dynamic sources with time-varying states, generate \u2018dynamic\u2019 content where new updates replace previous versions. This motivates us in this work to study the freshness-driven caching algorithm for dynamic content, which accounts for the changing nature of data content. In particular, we provide new models and analyses of the average operational cost both for the single and distributed edge caching scenarios. In both scenarios, we characterize the performance of the optimal solution and develop algorithms to select the content and the update rate that the user(s) must employ to have low-cost access to fresh content. Moreover, our work reveals new and easy-to-calculate key metrics for quantifying the caching value of dynamic content in terms of their refresh rates, popularity, number of users in the distribute edge caching group, and the fetching and update costs associated with the optimal decisions. We compare the proposed freshness-driven caching strategies with benchmark caching strategies like cache the most popular content. Results demonstrate that freshness-driven caching strategies considerably enhance the utilization of the edge caches with possibly orders-of-magnitude cost reduction. Furthermore, our investigations reveal that the distributed edge caching scenario, benefiting from the multicasting property of wireless service to update the cached content, can be cost-effective compared to the single edge caching, as the number of edge caches increases."}}
