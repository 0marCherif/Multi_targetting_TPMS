Machine learning enables robots to become experts and play the role of teachers to help in this situation. In this work, we formalize cooperative robot teaching as a Markov game, consisting of four key elements: the target task, the student model, the teacher model, and the interactive teaching-learning process. Under a moderate assumption, the Markov game reduces to a partially observable Markov decision process, with an efficient approximate solution. We illustrate our approach on two cooperative tasks, one in a simulated video game and one with a real robot."}}

However, most existing motion mimicking methods are built upon reinforcement learning (RL) and suffer from heavy reward engineering, high variance, and slow convergence with hard explorations. Specifically, they usually take tens of hours or even days of training to mimic a simple motion sequence, resulting in poor scalability. In this work, we leverage differentiable physics simulators (DPS) and propose an efficient motion mimicking method dubbed $\\textbf{DiffMimic}$. Our key insight is that DPS casts a complex policy learning task to a much simpler state matching problem. In particular, DPS learns a stable policy by analytical gradients with ground-truth physical priors hence leading to significantly faster and stabler convergence than RL-based methods. Moreover, to escape from local optima, we utilize an \\textit{Demonstration Replay} mechanism to enable stable gradient backpropagation in a long horizon. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that DiffMimic has a better sample efficiency and time efficiency than existing methods (e.g., DeepMimic). Notably, DiffMimic allows a physically simulated character to learn back-flip after 10 minutes of training and be able to cycle it after 3 hours of training, while DeepMimic requires about a day of training to cycle back-flip. More importantly, we hope DiffMimic can benefit more differentiable animation systems with techniques like differentiable clothes simulation in future research.

This paper presents DaXBench, a differentiable simulation framework for DOM. While existing work often focuses on a specific type of deformable objects, DaXBench supports fluid, rope, cloth ...; it provides a general-purpose benchmark to evaluate widely different DOM methods, including planning, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning. DaXBench combines recent advances in deformable object simulation with JAX, a high-performance computational framework. All DOM tasks in DaXBench are wrapped with the OpenAI Gym API for easy integration with DOM algorithms. We hope that DaXBench provides to the research community a comprehensive, standardized benchmark and a valuable tool to support the development and evaluation of new DOM methods. The code and video are available online."}}

Recent successes in differentiable physics simulators allow learning algorithms to train a policy with analytic gradients through environment dynamics, which significantly facilitates the development of DOM algorithms. However, existing DOM benchmarks are either single-object-based or non-differentiable. This leaves the questions of 1) how a task-specific algorithm performs on other tasks and 2) how a differentiable-physics-based algorithm compares with the non-differentiable ones in general. In this work, we present DaXBench, a differentiable DOM benchmark with a wide object and task coverage. DaXBench includes 9 challenging high-fidelity simulated tasks, covering rope, cloth, and liquid manipulation with various difficulty levels. To better understand the performance of general algorithms on different DOM tasks, we conduct comprehensive experiments over representative DOM methods, ranging from planning to imitation learning and reinforcement learning. In addition, we provide careful empirical studies of existing decision-making algorithms based on differentiable physics, and discuss their limitations, as well as potential future directions."}}

Compared to imbalanced and long-tailed classification, imbalanced regression has its unique challenges as the regression label space can be continuous, boundless, and high-dimensional. In this work, we present a principled framework, Bayesian Posterior Debiasing (Bayesian-PD), for re-balancing the regression among frequent and rare observations. Our key insight is that a balanced posterior can be obtained by debiasing the conditional probability with a regression label space prior. Importantly, through a normalization reparameterization technique, we derive a general debiasing function between the empirical posterior and the balanced posterior without relying on task-specific assumptions. We show that the Bayesian-PD framework has multiple instantiations in both training and testing time, with either closed-form or numerical implementations. We further uncover that several existing methods in imbalanced classification/regression serve as special cases of our Bayesian-PD framework. Extensive experiments on both uni- and multi-dimensional regression benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Bayesian-PD framework on various real-world tasks. Notably, Bayesian-PD exhibits strong robustness to different skewness of the training distributions."}}
