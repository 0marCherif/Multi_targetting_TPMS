In contrast to prior works that typically assume known 3D templates and reduce the problem to 3D pose estimation, our work reconstructs generic hand-held object without knowing their 3D templates. Our key insight is that hand articulation is highly predictive of the object shape, and we propose an approach that conditionally reconstructs the object based on the articulation and the visual input. Given an image depicting a hand-held object, we first use off-the-shelf systems to estimate the underlying hand pose and then infer the object shape in a normalized hand-centric coordinate frame. We parameterized the object by signed distance which are inferred by an implicit network which leverages the information from both visual feature and articulation-aware coordinates to process a query point. We perform experiments across three datasets and show that our method consistently outperforms baselines and is able to reconstruct a diverse set of objects. We analyze the benefits and robustness of explicit articulation conditioning and also show that this allows the hand pose estimation to further improve in test-time optimization."}}

We enforce the representation geometrically consistent with both appearance and masks, and also that the synthesized novel views are indistinguishable from image collections. The coarse volumetric prediction is then converted to a mesh-based representation, which is further refined in the predicted camera frame. These two steps allow both shape-pose factorization from image collections and per-instance reconstruction in finer details. We examine the method on both synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate its scalability on 50 categories in the wild, an order of magnitude more classes than existing works."}}

We propose to model a scene as a collection of objects, each with an explicit spatial location and implicit visual feature, and learn to model the effects of actions using random interaction data. Our model allows capturing the robot-object and object-object interactions, and leads to more sample-efficient and accurate predictions. We show that this learned model can be leveraged to search for action sequences that lead to desired goal configurations, and that in conjunction with a learned correction module, this allows for robust closed loop execution. We present experiments both in simulation and the real world, and show that our approach improves over alternate implicit or pixel-space forward models.

The key to dealing with the unfamiliar or novel category is to transfer knowledge obtained from familiar classes to describe the unfamiliar class. In this paper, we build upon the recently introduced Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and propose an approach that uses both semantic embeddings and the categorical relationships to predict the classifiers. Given a learned knowledge graph (KG), our approach takes as input semantic embeddings for each node (representing visual category). After a series of graph convolutions, we predict the visual classifier for each category. During training, the visual classifiers for a few categories are given to learn the GCN parameters. At test time, these filters are used to predict the visual classifiers of unseen categories. We show that our approach is robust to noise in the KG. More importantly, our approach provides significant improvement in performance compared to the current state-of-the-art results (from 2 ~ 3% on some metrics to whopping 20% on a few)."}}

The objective of background substitution is to extract the foreground from the input video and then combine it with a new background. In this paper, we use a color line model to improve the Gaussian mixture model in the background cut method to obtain a binary foreground segmentation result that is less sensitive to brightness differences. Based on the high quality binary segmentation results, we can automatically create a reliable trimap for alpha matting to refine the segmentation boundary. To make the composition result more realistic, an automatic foreground color adjustment step is added to make the foreground look consistent with the new background. Compared to previous approaches, our method can produce higher quality binary segmentation results, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such an automatic and integrated background substitution system has been proposed which can run in real time, which makes it practical for everyday applications."}}
