However, previous works mainly consider static, pair-wise interactions with limited relational reasoning. To promote more comprehensive interaction modeling and relational reasoning, we propose DynGroupNet, a dynamic-group-aware network, which can i) model time-varying interactions in highly dynamic scenes; ii) capture both pair-wise and group-wise interactions; and iii) reason both interaction strength and category without direct supervision. Based on DynGroupNet, we further design a prediction system to forecast socially plausible trajectories with dynamic relational reasoning. The proposed prediction system leverages the Gaussian mixture model, multiple sampling and prediction refinement to promote prediction diversity, training stability and trajectory smoothness, respectively. Extensive experiments show that: 1)DynGroupNet can capture time-varying group behaviors, infer time-varying interaction category and interaction strength during trajectory prediction without any relation supervision on physical simulation datasets; 2)DynGroupNet outperforms the state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods by a significant improvement of 22.6%/28.0%, 26.9%/34.9%, 5.1%/13.0% in ADE/FDE on the NBA, NFL Football and SDD datasets and achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the ETH-UCY dataset."}}

To address this issue, we propose a novel method FedFM, which guides each client's features to match shared category-wise anchors (landmarks in feature space). This method attempts to mitigate the negative effects of data heterogeneity in FL by aligning each client's feature space. Besides, we tackle the challenge of varying objective function and provide convergence guarantee for FedFM. In FedFM, to mitigate the phenomenon of overlapping feature spaces across categories and enhance the effectiveness of feature matching, we further propose a more precise and effective feature matching loss called contrastive-guiding (CG), which guides each local feature to match with the corresponding anchor while keeping away from non-corresponding anchors. Additionally, to achieve higher efficiency and flexibility, we propose a FedFM variant, called FedFM-Lite, where clients communicate with server with fewer synchronization times and communication bandwidth costs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedFM with CG outperforms several works by quantitative and qualitative comparisons. FedFM-Lite can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods with five to ten times less communication costs."}}

However, previous works only consider pair-wise interactions with limited relational reasoning. To promote more comprehensive interaction modeling for relational reasoning, we propose GroupNet, a multiscale hypergraph neural network, which is novel in terms of both interaction capturing and representation learning. From the aspect of interaction capturing, we propose a trainable multiscale hypergraph to capture both pair-wise and group-wise interactions at multiple group sizes. From the aspect of interaction representation learning, we propose a three-element format that can be learnt end-to-end and explicitly reason some relational factors including the interaction strength and category. We apply GroupNet into both CVAE-based prediction system and previous state-of-the-art prediction systems for predicting socially plausible trajectories with relational reasoning. To validate the ability of relational reasoning, we experiment with synthetic physics simulations to reflect the ability to capture group behaviors, reason interaction strength and interaction category. To validate the effectiveness of prediction, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world trajectory prediction datasets, including NBA, SDD and ETH-UCY; and we show that with GroupNet, the CVAE-based prediction system outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also show that adding GroupNet will further improve the performance of previous state-of-the-art prediction systems."}}

In order to handle these challenges, this work first proposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the uncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general CU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant uncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty estimation. Further, we apply the proposed framework to current SOTA multi-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables the SOTA systems to 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic dataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately approximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily helps SOTA systems improve their performances. Specially, the proposed framework helps VectorNet improve by 262 cm regarding the Final Displacement Error of the chosen optimal prediction on the nuScenes dataset; 3) for multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting systems, prediction uncertainty is positively correlated with future stochasticity; and 4) the estimated CU values are highly related to the interactive information among agents."}}

However, in this way, the model parameters come from all seen instances, which means a huge amount of irrelevant seen instances might also involve in predicting the current situation, disturbing the performance. To provide a more explicit link between the current situation and the seen instances, we imitate the mechanism of retrospective memory in neuropsychology and propose MemoNet, an instance-based approach that predicts the movement intentions of agents by looking for similar scenarios in the training data. In MemoNet, we design a pair of memory banks to explicitly store representative instances in the training set, acting as prefrontal cortex in the neural system, and a trainable memory addresser to adaptively search a current situation with similar instances in the memory bank, acting like basal ganglia. During prediction, MemoNet recalls previous memory by using the memory addresser to index related instances in the memory bank. We further propose a two-step trajectory prediction system, where the first step is to leverage MemoNet to predict the destination and the second step is to fulfill the whole trajectory according to the predicted destinations. Experiments show that the proposed MemoNet improves the FDE by 20.3%/10.2%/28.3%from the previous best method on SDD/ETH-UCY/NBA datasets. Experiments also show that our MemoNet has the ability to trace back to specific instances during prediction, promoting more interpretability."}}

To solve this unsupervised-learning problem, the teacher network adopts pose-dictionary-based modeling for regularization to estimate a physically plausible 3D pose. To handle the decomposition ambiguity in the teacher network, we propose a cycle-consistent architecture promoting a 3D rotation-invariant property to train the teacher network. To further improve the estimation accuracy, the student network adopts a novel graph convolution network for flexibility to directly estimate the 3D coordinates. Another cycle-consistent architecture promoting 3D rotation-equivariant property is adopted to exploit geometry consistency, together with knowledge distillation from the teacher network to improve the pose estimation performance. We conduct extensive experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Our method reduces the 3D joint prediction error by 11.4% compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and also outperforms many weakly-supervised methods that use side information on Human3.6M.
