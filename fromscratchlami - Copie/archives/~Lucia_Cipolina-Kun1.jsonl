However, the lack of theoretical principles for using MARL in coalitional bargaining games remain less explored. This paper aims to address this gap by providing an examination of the theoretical link between coalition formation, coalitional bargaining games, and MARL through the link of stochastic games. Through this analysis, the paper seeks to shed light on the underlying principles that support the use of MARL in coalitional bargaining and to explore the contributions of this approach and its limitations in comparison to traditional game theoretical methods."}}

We extend on the current literature to integrate walking options within the trip, this allows us to effectively account for a user\u2019s value of time when walk- ing, which is not negligible. Additionally, we propose a price allocation method that ensures proportionality for sharing the costs. We formally evaluate the effi- cacy of our pricing method and discuss its desirable properties. Our study is a step towards developing smart mobility systems that recommend optimal ridesharing coalitions to users and suggest cost allocations that are fair and stable."}}

In this paper, we consider a novel setting where individuals walk to a common pick-up point and ride together to a single drop-off point from where they walk to their final destination. This setting requires finding the optimal composition of riders and pick-up and drop-off meeting points, as well as an equitable distribution of the costs whereby riders are incentivised to participate. Based on game-theoretic principles, we propose a methodology to determine the optimal pick-up and drop-off points, together with a cost allocation method that is equitable in the sense that it ensures proportionality for sharing the costs, i.e., those who walk more should pay less. We present a formal evaluation of our cost allocation method and empirical evaluation against the Shapley value using real-world and simulated data. Our results show that our approach is computationally more tractable than the Shapley value, as it is linear in time while guaranteeing individual rationality under certain conditions."}}

Dstl would like to investigate RL in the context of games that are relevant in the defence sphere, and in particular whether RL can provide solutions which are adaptable to changes in the configuration o f the game. The aim of this DSG is thus to investigate the effectiveness of RL techniques when the rules of the game change between the training phase and the deployment phase."}}
