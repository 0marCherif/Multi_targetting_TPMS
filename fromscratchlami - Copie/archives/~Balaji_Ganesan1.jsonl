However, existing works have shown that temporal characteristics of streaming documents are significant features for clustering. In this paper we propose a stacked Dirichlet-Hawkes process with inverse cluster frequency prior as a simple but effective solution for the task of short text clustering using temporal features in continuous time. Based on the classical formulation of the Dirichlet-Hawkes process, our model provides an elegant, theoretically grounded and interpretable solution while performing at par with recent state of the art models in short text clustering."}}

Data Marketplaces are platforms where users discover and shop for data products. These products themselves are produced by modern data stacks governed by frameworks like Data Fabric. Knowledge Graphs and semantic technologies already form a core part of Data Fabric and hence could be leveraged for data discovery. In this tutorial, we\u2019ll present state of the art semantic technologies that enable automation of various tasks in data discovery. In particular, we\u2019ll focus on data enrichment, datasets search and recommendations, and explorations within a dataset."}}

Entities are typically people, organizations, locations, and events represented as attributed nodes in a graph, though they can also be represented as records in relational data. While probabilistic matching engines and artificial neural network models exist for this task, explaining entity matching has received less attention. In this demo, we present our Explainable Entity Matching (xEM) system and discuss the different AI/ML considerations that went into its implementation."}}

Before the advent of language models, several artificial neural network models were proposed for this task. We revisit these models and compare them with BERT-based models for the specific task of classifying Personal Data Entities (PDE). We observe that using side information from rule-based annotators improves neural model performance on this task and can complement language models."}}

While neural networks have led to improvements in the different tasks that are part of KBP, the overall F1 of the end-to-end system remains quite low. This problem is more acute in personal knowledge bases, which present additional challenges with regard to data protection, fairness and privacy. In this work, we use data augmentation to populate a more complete personal knowledge base from the TACRED dataset. We then use explainability techniques and representative set sampling to show that the augmented knowledge base is more fair and diverse as well."}}

In this demo, we describe our solution for predicting similar nodes in a case graph derived from our legal knowledge graph."}}
