Most of current methods have been proposed to improve the robustness to distribution shift from the algorithmic perspective, i.e., designing better training algorithms to help the generalization in shifted test distributions. This paper studies the distribution shift problem from the perspective of pre-training and data augmentation, two important factors in the practice of deep learning that have not been systematically investigated by existing work. By evaluating seven pre-trained models, including ResNets and ViT's with self-supervision and supervision mode, on five important distribution-shift datasets, from WILDS and DomainBed benchmarks, with five different learning algorithms, we provide the first comprehensive empirical study focusing on pre-training and data augmentation. With our empirical result obtained from 1,330 models, we provide the following main observations: 1) ERM combined with data augmentation can achieve state-of-the-art performance if we choose a proper pre-trained model respecting the data property; 2) specialized algorithms further improve the robustness on top of ERM when handling a specific type of distribution shift, e.g., GroupDRO for spurious correlation and CORAL for large-scale out-of-distribution data; 3) Comparing different pre-training modes, architectures and data sizes, we provide novel observations about pre-training on distribution shift, which sheds light on designing or selecting pre-training strategy for different kinds of distribution shifts. In summary, our empirical study provides a comprehensive baseline for a wide range of pre-training models fine-tuned with data augmentation, which potentially inspires research exploiting the power of pre-training and data augmentation in the future of distribution shift study."}}

However, most of existing pruning algorithms only focus on the classification task defined on the source domain. Different from the strong transferability of the original model, a pruned network is hard to transfer to complicated downstream tasks such as object detection \\citet{girish2021lottery}. In this paper, we show that the image-level pretrain task is not capable of pruning models for diverse downstream tasks. To mitigate this problem, we introduce image reconstruction, a pixel-level task, into the traditional pruning framework. Concretely, an autoencoder is trained based on the original model, and then the pruning process is optimized with both autoencoder and classification losses. The empirical study on benchmark downstream tasks shows that the proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art results explicitly."}}

However, recent studies have empirically shown that training from scratch has the final performance that is no worse than this pre-training strategy once the number of training samples is increased in some vision tasks. In this work, we revisit this phenomenon from the perspective of generalization analysis by using excess risk bound which is popular in learning theory. The result reveals that the excess risk bound may have a weak dependency on the pre-trained model. The observation inspires us to leverage pre-training data for fine-tuning, since this data is also available for fine-tuning. The generalization result of using pre-training data shows that the excess risk bound on a target task can be improved when the appropriate pre-training data is included in fine-tuning. With the theoretical motivation, we propose a novel selection strategy to select a subset from pre-training data to help improve the generalization on the target task. Extensive experimental results for image classification tasks on 8 benchmark data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed data selection based fine-tuning pipeline.

Given a large model (i.e., teacher model), it aims to improve the performance of a compact model (i.e., student model) by transferring the information from the teacher. Various information for distillation has been studied. Recently, a number of works propose to transfer the pairwise similarity between examples to distill relative information. However, most of efforts are devoted to developing different similarity measurements, while only a small matrix consisting of examples within a mini-batch is transferred at each iteration that can be inefficient for optimizing the pairwise similarity over the whole data set. In this work, we aim to transfer the full similarity matrix effectively. The main challenge is from the size of the full matrix that is quadratic to the number of examples. To address the challenge, we decompose the original full matrix with Nystr\u00f6m method. By selecting appropriate landmark points, our theoretical analysis indicates that the loss for transfer can be further simplified. Concretely, we find that the difference between the original full kernel matrices between teacher and student can be well bounded by that of the corresponding partial matrices, which only consists of similarities between original examples and landmark points. Compared with the full matrix, the size of the partial matrix is linear in the number of examples, which improves the efficiency of optimization significantly. The empirical study on benchmark data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}}

However, the difference between the training data and testing data makes the performance of learned feature degraded during testing. Hence, re-ranking is proposed to mitigate this issue and various algorithms have been developed. However, most of existing re-ranking methods focus on replacing the Euclidean distance with sophisticated distance metrics, which are not friendly to downstream tasks and hard to be used for fast retrieval of massive data in real applications. In this work, we propose a graph-based re-ranking method to improve learned features while still keeping Euclidean distance as the similarity metric. Inspired by graph convolution networks, we develop an operator to propagate features over an appropriate graph. Since graph is the essential key for the propagation, two important criteria are considered for designing the graph, and different graphs are explored accordingly. Furthermore, a simple yet effective method is proposed to generate a profile vector for each tracklet in videos, which helps extend our method to video re-ID. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets, e.g., Market-1501, Duke, and MARS, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."}}

Existing DG methods try to prompt the diversity of source domains for the model's generalization ability, while they may have to introduce auxiliary networks or striking computational costs. On the contrary, this work applies the implicit semantic augmentation in feature space to capture the diversity of source domains. Concretely, an additional loss function of distance metric learning (DML) is included to optimize the local geometry of data distribution. Besides, the logits from cross entropy loss with infinite augmentations is adopted as input features for the DML loss in lieu of the deep features. We also provide a theoretical analysis to show that the logits can approximate the distances defined on original features well. Further, we provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanism and rational behind our approach, which gives us a better understanding of why leverage logits in lieu of features can help domain generalization. The proposed DML loss with the implicit augmentation is incorporated into a recent DG method, that is, Fourier Augmented Co-Teacher framework (FACT). Meanwhile, our method also can be easily plugged into various DG methods. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks (Digits-DG, PACS and Office-Home) have demonstrated that the proposed method is able to achieve the state-of-the-art performance."}}

Remarkable performance has been achieved, benefiting from image, feature, and network perturbations. To make full use of these perturbations, in this work, we propose a new consistency regularization framework called mutual knowledge distillation (MKD). We innovatively introduce two auxiliary mean-teacher models based on the consistency regularization method. More specifically, we use the pseudo label generated by one mean teacher to supervise the other student network to achieve a mutual knowledge distillation between two branches. In addition to using image-level strong and weak augmentation, we also employ feature augmentation considering implicit semantic distributions to add further perturbations to the students. The proposed framework significantly increases the diversity of the training samples. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that our framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods under various semi-supervised settings.

Clustering is to assign each instance a pseudo label that will be used to learn representations in discrimination. The main challenge resides in clustering since prevalent clustering methods (e.g., k-means) have to run in a batch mode. Besides, there can be a trivial solution consisting of a dominating cluster. To address these challenges, we first investigate the objective of clustering-based representation learning. Based on this, we propose a novel clustering-based pretext task with online Constrained K-means (CoKe). Compared with the balanced clustering that each cluster has exactly the same size, we only constrain the minimal size of each cluster to flexibly capture the inherent data structure. More importantly, our online assignment method has a theoretical guarantee to approach the global optimum. By decoupling clustering and discrimination, CoKe can achieve competitive performance when optimizing with only a single view from each instance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and other benchmark data sets verify both the efficacy and efficiency of our proposal."}}

To avoid over-fitting to the noise in the teacher network, a large number of training examples is essential for knowledge distillation. Imagelevel argumentation techniques like flipping, translation or rotation are widely used in previous knowledge distillation framework. Inspired by the recent progress on semantic directions on feature-space, we propose to include augmentations in feature space for efficient distillation. Specifically, given a semantic direction, an infinite number of augmentations can be obtained for the student in the feature space. Furthermore, the analysis shows that those augmentations can be optimized simultaneously by minimizing an upper bound for the losses defined by augmentations. Based on the observation, a new algorithm is developed for knowledge distillation in semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on four semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method can boost the performance of current knowledge distillation methods without any significant overhead.
