The process of\nobtaining a JT is usually termed compilation.\nAs compilation is usually viewed as a whole\nprocess; each time the network is modified, a\nnew compilation process has to be performed.\nThe possibility of reusing an already existing JT in order to obtain the new one regarding only the modifications in the network\nhas received only little attention in the literature. In this paper, we present a method for\nincremental compilation of a Bayesian network, following the classical scheme in which\ntriangulation plays the key role. In order\nto perform incremental compilation, we propose to recompile only those parts of the JT\nwhich may have been affected by the network's modifications. To do so, we exploit\nthe technique of maximal prime subgraph decomposition in determining the minimal subgraph(s) that have to be recompiled, and\nthereby the minimal subtree(s) of the JT that\nshould be replaced by new subtree(s). We focus on structural modifications: addition and\ndeletion of links and variables"}}

Hence, the proposal of new classifiers can be seen as an attempt to cover new areas of the complexity space of datasets, or even to compete with those previously assigned to others. Several complexity measures for supervised classification have been designed to define these areas. In this paper, we want to discover which type of datasets, defined by certain range values of the complexity measures for supervised classification, fits for some of the most well-known semi-naive Bayesian network classifiers. This study is carried out on continuous and discrete domains for naive Bayes and Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE), which are two widely used incremental classifiers that provide some of the best trade-offs between error performance and efficiency. Furthermore, an automatic procedure to advise on the best semi-naive BNC to use for classification, based on the values of certain complexity measures, is proposed."}}

This task consists of determining where the robot is located by using\nsemantic annotations instead of metric locations, and based on robots perceptions, namely images. The\nproposal covers the two key steps of (1) extracting descriptive features from the input image and (2)\nconstruction and evaluation of models, comparing the performance of BNCs technologies with SVMs solutions. The experimentation is performed over two different datasets, and the results, given in terms\nof accuracy, provide a quite appealing analysis where specialization versus generalization or model complexity are considered. Overall BNCs proved to be quite competitive, and appear to be a very promising\ntool for future applications since they would allow the introduction of additional contextual information\nto the processing pipeline."}}

Learning analytics is a new field with a key role in educational institutions in the coming years. It may help make strategic decisions to reduce student disengagement. The use of technology in educational environments has grown significantly and, with it, awareness of the importance of student engagement. We exploit tracking and wearable technologies to increase user engagement in learning processes, exploring also the area of multimodal learning analytics (MMLA). We use wearables and Internet of Things for education, an interactive and collaborative system designed to improve motivation and learning. This article presents the results obtained in different experiments conducted in a secondary school in a long-term participatory learning context. The captured data were analyzed and used to identify different students' behavior patterns, showing their progress and motivation. Subsequently, from the captured data and aiming at a decision-making phase, we used machine learning techniques and MMLA methodologies to construct models able to \u201cexplain\u201d when student engagement is present, so this knowledge can later be exploited. In particular, we chose decision trees and rule systems based on a set of variables with proven relevance to the problem. The evaluation of this novel engagement classification system confirms the high performance of these variables. The rules obtained, which can be easily interpreted by a nonexpert, help the teacher to observe, analyze, and make decisions with the purpose of fostering engagement."}}

A hybrid dynamic object-oriented Bayesian network (OOBN)\nwas learnt based on mixture of truncated exponential models, a scenario of rainfall event was included, and the final model\nwas validated. OOBN structure allows the catchment to be divided into five different units and models each of them\nindependently. It transforms a complex problem into a simple and easily interpretable model.

The tool explained in this study is based on models trained using the musical collection data from Audioset. For this purpose, we have used classifiers from distinct Machine Learning paradigms: Probabilistic Graphical Models (Naive Bayes), Feed-forward and Recurrent Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). All these models were trained in a multi-label classification scenario. Because genres may vary along a song's timeline, we perform classification in chunks of ten seconds. This capability is enabled by Audioset, which offers 10-second samples. The visualization output presents this temporal information in real time, synced with the music video being played, presenting classification results in stacked area charts, where scores for the top-10 labels obtained per chunk are shown. We briefly explain the theoretical and scientific basis of the problem and the proposed classifiers. Subsequently, we show how the application works in practice, using three distinct songs as cases of study, which are then analyzed and compared with online categorizations to discuss models performance and music genre classification challenges."}}
