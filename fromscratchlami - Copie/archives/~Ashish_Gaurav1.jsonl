In this paper, we construct an ICRL benchmark in the context of RL application domains, including robot control, and autonomous driving. For each environment, we design relevant constraints and train expert agents to generate demonstration data. Besides, unlike existing baselines that learn a deterministic constraint, we propose a variational ICRL method to model a posterior distribution of candidate constraints. We conduct extensive experiments on these algorithms under our benchmark and show how they can facilitate studying important research challenges for ICRL.

In many real-world problems, however, the constraints followed by expert agents (e.g., humans) are often hard to specify mathematically and unknown to the RL agents. To tackle these issues, Constraint Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL) considers the formalism of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) and estimates constraints from expert demonstrations by learning a constraint function. As an emerging research topic, CIRL does not have common benchmarks, and previous works tested their algorithms with hand-crafted environments (e.g., grid worlds). In this paper, we construct a CIRL benchmark in the context of two major application domains: robot control and autonomous driving. We design relevant constraints for each environment and empirically study the ability of different algorithms to recover those constraints based on expert trajectories that respect those constraints. To handle stochastic dynamics, we propose a variational approach that infers constraint distributions, and we demonstrate its performance by comparing it with other CIRL baselines on our benchmark. The benchmark, including the information for reproducing the performance of CIRL algorithms, is publicly available at https://github.com/Guiliang/CIRL-benchmarks-public"}}

We therefore consider the problem of transfer reinforcement learning and study how a policy learned in a simple environment using WiseMove can be transferred to our high-fidelity simulator, WiseMove. WiseMove is a framework to study safety and other aspects of RL for autonomous driving. WiseMove accurately reproduces the dynamics and software stack of our real vehicle. We find that the accurately modelled perception errors in WiseMove contribute the most to the transfer problem. These errors, when even naively modelled in WiseMove, provide an RL policy that performs better in WiseMove than a hand-crafted rule-based policy. Applying domain randomization to the environment in WiseMove yields an even better policy. The final RL policy reduces the failures due to perception errors from 10% to 2.75%. We also observe that the RL policy has significantly less reliance on velocity compared to the rule-based policy, having learned that its measurement is unreliable."}}

Previous methods in continual learning have demonstrated how to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and learn new tasks while retaining performance on the previous tasks. We analyze catastrophic forgetting from the perspective of change in classifier likelihood and propose a simple L1 minimization criterion which can be adapted to different use cases. We further investigate two ways to minimize forgetting as quantified by this criterion and propose strategies to achieve finer control over forgetting. Finally, we evaluate our strategies on 3 datasets of varying difficulty and demonstrate improvements over previously known L2 strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting."}}
