Generally speaking, interacted examples are considered as positive while negative examples are sampled from uninteracted ones. However, noisy examples are prevalent in real-world implicit feedback. A noisy positive example could be interacted but it actually leads to negative user preference. A noisy negative example which is uninteracted because of unawareness of the user could also denote potential positive user preference. Conventional training methods overlook these noisy examples, leading to sub-optimal recommendations.\nIn this work, we propose a novel framework to learn robust recommenders from implicit feedback. Through an empirical study, we find that different models make relatively similar predictions on clean examples which denote the real user preference, while the predictions on noisy examples vary much more across different models. Motivated by this observation, we propose denoising with cross-model agreement(DeCA) which aims to minimize the KL-divergence between the real user preference distributions parameterized by two recommendation models while maximizing the likelihood of data observation. We employ the proposed DeCA on four state-of-the-art recommendation models and conduct experiments on four datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that DeCA significantly improves recommendation performance compared with normal training and other denoising methods. Codes will be open-sourced."}}

This is of paramount importance for entity-level tasks such as entity linking where the ability to model entity relations (especially synonymy) is pivotal. To address this challenge, we propose SapBERT, a pretraining scheme that self-aligns the representation space of biomedical entities. We design a scalable metric learning framework that can leverage UMLS, a massive collection of biomedical ontologies with 4M+ concepts. In contrast with previous pipeline-based hybrid systems, SapBERT offers an elegant one-model-for-all solution to the problem of medical entity linking (MEL), achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on six MEL benchmarking datasets. In the scientific domain, we achieve SOTA even without task-specific supervision. With substantial improvement over various domain-specific pretrained MLMs such as BioBERT, SciBERTand and PubMedBERT, our pretraining scheme proves to be both effective and robust."}}

The generalization capability\nof GPs depends heavily on the kernel function, which implicitly imposes the smoothness assumptions of the data. However, common feature-based kernel functions are inefficient to model the relational data, where the smoothness assumptions implied by the\nkernels are violated. To model the complex and non-differentiable functions over relational data, we propose a novel Graph Convolutional Kernel, which enables to incorporate relational structures to feature-based kernels to capture the statistical structure of data. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of proposed kernel function in modeling relational data, we introduce GP models with Graph Convolutional\nKernel in two relational learning settings, i.e., unsupervised settings of link prediction and semi-supervised settings of object classification. The parameters of our GP models are optimized through the scalable variational inducing point method. However, the highly\nstructured likelihood objective requires densely sampling from variational distributions, which is costly and makes its optimization challenging in the unsupervised settings. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Local Neighbor Sampling technique with a provable more efficient computational complexity. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of the-art performance in two relational learning tasks"}}

In this paper, we propose a novel structure-aware random Fourier (SRF) kernel for GPs that brings several benefits when modeling graph-structured data. First, SRF kernel is defined with a spectral distribution based on the Fourier duality given by the Bochner's theorem, transforming the kernel learning problem to a distribution inference problem. Second, SRF kernel admits a random Fourier feature formulation that makes the kernel scalable for optimization. Third, SRF kernel enables to leverage geometric structures by taking subgraphs as inputs. To effectively optimize GPs with SRF kernel, we develop a variational EM algorithm, which alternates between an inference procedure (E-step) and a learning procedure (M-step). Experimental results on five real-world datasets show that our model can achieve state-of-the-art performance in two typical graph learning tasks, i.e., object classification and link prediction. "}}

In contrast, this paper focuses on a more complex online setting, where tasks arrive sequentially and follow a non-stationary distribution. Accordingly, we propose a Variational Continual Bayesian Meta-Learning (VC-BML) algorithm. VC-BML maintains a Dynamic Gaussian Mixture Model for meta-parameters, with the number of component distributions determined by a Chinese Restaurant Process. Dynamic mixtures at the meta-parameter level increase the capability to adapt to diverse tasks due to a larger parameter space, alleviating the negative knowledge transfer problem. To infer posteriors of model parameters, compared to the previously used point estimation method, we develop a more robust posterior approximation method -- structured variational inference for the sake of avoiding forgetting knowledge. Experiments on tasks from non-stationary distributions show that VC-BML is superior in transferring knowledge among diverse tasks and alleviating catastrophic forgetting in an online setting.\n\n"}}

Semi-supervised variational auto-encoders (SVAE) as a classical DGM offers a principled framework to effective generalize from small labelled data to large unlabelled ones, but it is difficult to incorporate rich unstructured relationships within the multiple heterogeneous entities. In this paper, to deal with the problem, we present a semi-supervised co-embedding model for attributed networks (SCAN) based on the generalized SVAE for the heterogeneous data, which collaboratively learns low- dimensional vector representations of both nodes and attributes for partially labelled attributed networks semi-supervisedly. The node and attribute embeddings obtained in a unified manner by our SCAN can benefit not only for capturing the proximities between nodes but also the affinities between nodes and attributes. Moreover, our model also trains a discriminative network to learn the label predictive distribution of nodes. Experimental results on real-world networks demonstrate that our model yields excellent performance in a number of applications such as attribute inference, user profiling and node classification compared to the state-of-the-art baselines."}}

As being one of deep generative models, it has both non-linearity and Bayesian nature. Additionally, in BDCMF, we derive an efficient EM-style point estimation algorithm for parameter learning. To further improve recommendation performance, we also derive a full Bayesian posterior estimation algorithm for inference.
