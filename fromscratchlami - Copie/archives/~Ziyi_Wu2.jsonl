This is mainly attributed to the human brain\u2019s ability of partitioned learning and memory replay. In this paper, we simulate this ability and propose an incremental learning network of Sustainable Regional Isolation and Integration (SRII). SRII consists of two phases, regional isolation and regional integration, which are iterated to achieve continuous incremental class learning. Regional isolation isolates new learning processes to avoid interfering with existing knowledge, while regional integration introduces knowledge distillation and margin loss regularization term, knowledge distillation to transfer replay knowledge for alleviating catastrophic forgetting, margin loss regularization term to clarify the boundaries of new and old knowledge for alleviating recency bias. Experimental results on the CIFAR100 and miniImageNet datasets demonstrate that SRII outperforms the state-of-the-arts to avoid catastrophic forgetting. In all 5-stage and 10-stage incremental settings, SRII outperforms the baseline and achieves at least $5.27\\%+$ average accuracy improvement.
