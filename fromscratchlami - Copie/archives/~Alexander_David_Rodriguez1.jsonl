How to leverage rich heterogeneous data based on various signals such as mobility, testing, and/or disease exposure for forecasting? How to handle noisy data and generate uncertainties in the forecast? In this paper, we present DeepCOVID, an operational deep learning framework designed for real-time COVID-19 forecasting. DeepCOVID works well with sparse data and can handle noisy heterogeneous data signals by propagating the uncertainty from the data in a principled manner resulting in meaningful uncertainties in the forecast. The deployed framework also consists of modules for both real-time and retrospective exploratory analysis to enable interpretation of the forecasts. Results from real-time predictions (featured on the CDC website and FiveThirtyEight. com) since April 2020 indicates that our approach is competitive among the methods in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub, especially for short-term predictions."}}

Previous works assume rigid consistency over the given hierarchies and do not adapt well to real-world data that show deviation from this assumption. Moreover, recent state-of-art neural probabilistic methods also impose hierarchical relations on point predictions and samples of the predictive distribution. This does not account for full forecast distributions being consistent with the hierarchy and leading to poorly calibrated forecasts. We close both these gaps and propose PROFHiT, a probabilistic hierarchical forecasting model that jointly models forecast distributions over the entire hierarchy. PROFHiT (1) uses a flexible probabilistic Bayesian approach and (2) introduces soft distributional consistency regularization that enables end-to-end learning of the entire forecast distribution leveraging information from the underlying hierarchy. This enables calibrated forecasts as well as adaptation to real-life data with varied hierarchical consistency. PROFHiT provides 41-88% better performance in accuracy and significantly better calibration over a wide range of dataset consistency. Furthermore, PROFHiT adapts to missing data and can provide reliable forecasts even if up to 10% of input time-series data is missing, whereas other methods' performance severely degrades by over 70%"}}

Many real-life scenarios, such as public health, economics, and social applications, involve feedback loops where predictions can influence the predicted outcome, subsequently altering the target variable's distribution. This phenomenon, known as performativity, introduces the potential for 'self-negating' or 'self-fulfilling' predictions. Despite extensive studies in classification problems across domains, performativity remains largely unexplored in the context of time-series forecasting from a machine-learning perspective. In this paper, we formalize performative time-series forecasting (PeTS), addressing the challenge of accurate predictions when performativity-induced distribution shifts are possible. We propose a novel approach, Feature Performative-Shifting (FPS), which leverages the concept of delayed response to anticipate distribution shifts and subsequently predicts targets accordingly. We provide theoretical insights suggesting that FPS can potentially lead to reduced generalization error. We conduct comprehensive experiments using multiple time-series models on COVID-19 and traffic forecasting tasks. The results demonstrate that FPS consistently outperforms conventional time-series forecasting methods, highlighting its efficacy in handling performativity-induced challenges."}}

There is, however, a limited understanding of how epidemics spread, largely due to other complex dynamics, most notably social and pathogen dynamics. With the increasing availability of real-time multimodal data, a new opportunity has emerged for capturing previously unobservable facets of the spatiotemporal dynamics of epidemics. In this regard, my work brings a data-centric perspective to public health via methodological advances in AI at the intersection of time series analysis, spatiotemporal mining, scientific ML, and multi-agent systems. This extended abstract focuses on our new techniques for end-to-end learning with mechanistic epidemiological models-based on differential equations and agent-based models-that bridge ML advances and traditional domain knowledge to leverage individual merits. I finalize discussing some future directions for my work."}}

Epidemiological ODE models contain mechanisms that can guide us in these two tasks; however, they have limited capability of ingesting data sources and modeling composite signals. Thus, we propose to leverage work in physics-informed neural networks to learn latent epidemic dynamics and transfer relevant knowledge to another neural network which ingests multiple data sources and has more appropriate inductive bias. In contrast with previous work, we do not assume the observability of complete dynamics and do not need to numerically solve the ODE equations during training. Our thorough experiments on all US states and HHS regions for COVID-19 and influenza forecasting showcase the clear benefits of our approach in both short-term and long-term forecasting as well as in learning the mechanistic dynamics over other non-trivial alternatives."}}
