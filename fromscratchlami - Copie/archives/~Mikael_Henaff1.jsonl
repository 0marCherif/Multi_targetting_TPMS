In this work, we first shed light on the behavior these two kinds of bonuses on hard exploration tasks through easily interpretable examples. We find that the two types of bonuses succeed in different settings, with episodic bonuses being most effective when there is little shared structure between environments and global bonuses being effective when more structure is shared. We also find that combining the two bonuses leads to more robust behavior across both of these settings. Motivated by these findings, we then investigate different algorithmic choices for defining and combining function approximation-based global and episodic bonuses. This results in a new algorithm which sets a new state of the art across 18 tasks from the MiniHack suite used in prior work. "}}

In this work, we show that the effectiveness of these methods critically relies on a count-based episodic term in their exploration bonus. As a result, despite their success in relatively simple, noise-free settings, these methods fall short in more realistic scenarios where the state space is vast and prone to noise. To address this limitation, we introduce Exploration via Elliptical Episodic Bonuses (E3B), a new method which extends count-based episodic bonuses to continuous state spaces and encourages an agent to explore states that are diverse under a learned embed- ding within each episode. The embedding is learned using an inverse dynamics model in order to capture controllable aspects of the environment. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art across 16 challenging tasks from the MiniHack suite, without requiring task-specific inductive biases. E3B also outperforms existing methods in reward-free exploration on Habitat, demonstrating that it can scale to high-dimensional pixel-based observations and realistic environments."}}

It operates by training an ensemble of policies on the expert demonstration data, and using the variance of their predictions as a cost which is minimized with RL together with a supervised behavioral cloning cost. Unlike adversarial imitation methods, it uses a fixed reward function which is easy to optimize. We prove a regret bound for the algorithm which is linear in the time horizon multiplied by a coefficient which we show to be low for certain problems in which behavioral cloning fails. We evaluate our algorithm empirically across multiple pixel-based Atari environments and continuous control tasks, and show that it matches or significantly outperforms behavioral cloning and generative adversarial imitation learning."}}

The algorithm maintains a set of dynamics models consis- tent with current experience and explores by finding policies which induce high disagreement between their state predictions. It then exploits using the refined set of models or experience gathered during exploration. We show that under realizability and optimal planning assumptions, our algorithm provably finds a near-optimal policy with a number of samples which is polynomial in terms of a structural complexity measure which we show to be low in several natural settings. We then give a practical approximation using neural networks and gradient-based optimization, and demonstrate its performance and sample efficiency in practice."}}

In this work, we propose to train a policy while explicitly penalizing the mismatch between these two distributions over a fixed time horizon. We do this by using a learned model of the environment dynamics which is unrolled for multiple time steps, and training a policy network to minimize a differentiable cost over this rolled-out trajectory. This cost contains two terms: a policy cost which represents the objective the policy seeks to optimize, and an uncertainty cost which represents its divergence from the states it is trained on. We propose to measure this second cost by using the uncertainty of the dynamics model about its own predictions, using recent ideas from uncertainty estimation for deep networks. We evaluate our approach using a large-scale observational dataset of driving behavior recorded from traffic cameras, and show that we are able to learn effective driving policies from purely observational data, with no environment interaction.
