It contains about 3M nodes, 4M dynamic edges, and 1M ground-truth nodes. We provide a comprehensive observation of DGraph, revealing that anomalous nodes and normal nodes generally have different structures, neighbor distribution, and temporal dynamics. Moreover, it suggests that 2M background nodes are also essential for detecting fraudsters. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on DGraph.

Analyzing taocodes can potentially facilitate understanding of the social relationships between users and, more excitingly, their online purchasing behaviors under the influence of taocode diffusion. This paper innovatively investigates the problem of online purchasing predictions from an information diffusion perspective, with taocode as a case study. Specifically, we conduct profound observational studies on a large-scale real-world dataset from Taobao, containing over 100M Taocode sharing records. Inspired by our observations, we propose InfNet, a dynamic GNN-based framework that models the information diffusion across Taocode. We then apply InfNet to item purchasing predictions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of InfNet compared with \u03bdmofbaseline~ state-of-the-art baselines."}}

This new task requires a model to draw inference on whether a natural language statement entails or contradicts a given video clip. In this paper, we study how to address three critical challenges for this task: judging the global correctness of the statement involved multiple semantic meanings, joint reasoning over video and subtitles, and modeling long-range relationships and complex social interactions. First, we propose an adaptive hierarchical graph network that achieves in-depth understanding of the video over complex interactions. Specifically, it performs joint reasoning over video and subtitles in three hierarchies, where the graph structure is adaptively adjusted according to the semantic structures of the statement. Secondly, we introduce semantic coherence learning to explicitly encourage the semantic coherence of the adaptive hierarchical graph network from three hierarchies. The semantic coherence learning can further improve the alignment between vision and linguistics, and the coherence across a sequence of video segments. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline by a large margin."}}

Considering its harmfulness to both power grids and the public, several mechanized methods have been developed to automatically recognize electricity-theft behaviors. However, these methods, which mainly assess users\u2019 electricity usage records, can be insufficient due to the diversity of theft tactics and the irregularity of user behaviors. In this paper, we propose to recognize electricity-theft behavior via multi-source data. In addition to users\u2019 electricity usage records, we analyze user behaviors by means of regional factors (non-technical loss) and climatic factors (temperature) in the corresponding transformer area. By conducting analytical experiments, we unearth several interesting patterns: for instance, electricity thieves are likely to consume much more electrical power than normal users, especially under extremely high or low temperatures. Motivated by these empirical observations, we further design a novel hierarchical framework for identifying electricity thieves. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our proposed model can achieve the best performance in electricity-theft detection (e.g., at least +3.0% in terms of F0.5) compared with several baselines. Last but not least, our work has been applied by the State Grid of China and used to successfully catch electricity thieves in Hangzhou with a precision of 15% (an improvement from 0% attained by several other models the company employed) during monthly on-site investigation."}}
