However, due to the challenges in training and the restrictions in architectural design, there are limited examples of competitive SNNs in the realm of event-based dense prediction when compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this paper, we present an efficient spiking encoder-decoder network designed for large-scale event-based semantic segmentation tasks. This is achieved by optimizing the encoder using a hierarchical search method. To enhance learning from dynamic event streams, we harness the inherent adaptive threshold of spiking neurons to modulate network activation. Moreover, we introduce a dual-path Spiking Spatially-Adaptive Modulation (SSAM) block, specifically designed to enhance the representation of sparse events, thereby considerably improving network performance. Our proposed network achieves a 72.57% mean intersection over union (MIoU) on the DDD17 dataset and a 57.22% MIoU on the recently introduced, larger DSEC-Semantic dataset. This performance surpasses the current state-of-the-art ANNs by 4%, whilst consuming significantly less computational resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating SNNs outperforming ANNs in demanding event-based semantic segmentation tasks, thereby establishing the vast potential of SNNs in the field of event-based vision. Our source code will be made publicly accessible."}}

By adopting the perspective of PC as a variational Bayes algorithm under the Laplace approximation, we identify the source of these deficits to lie in the exclusion of an associated Hessian term in the PC objective function, which would otherwise regularise the sharpness of the probability landscape and prevent over-certainty in the approximate posterior. To remedy this, we make three primary contributions: we begin by suggesting a simple Monte Carlo estimated evidence lower bound which relies on sampling from the Hessian-parameterised variational posterior. We then derive a novel block diagonal approximation to the full Hessian matrix that has lower memory requirements and favourable mathematical properties. Lastly, we present an algorithm that combines our method with standard PC to reduce memory complexity further.

Recently, modified forms of predictive coding (PC), an algorithm with origins in computational neuroscience, have been shown to result in approximately or exactly equal parameter updates to those under backpropagation. Due to this connection, it has been suggested that PC can act as an alternative to backpropagation with desirable properties that may facilitate implementation in neuromorphic systems. Here, we explore these claims using the different contemporary PC variants proposed in the literature. We obtain time complexity bounds for these PC variants which we show are lower-bounded by backpropagation. We also present key properties of these variants that have implications for neurobiological plausibility and their interpretations, particularly from the perspective of standard PC as a variational Bayes algorithm for latent probabilistic models. Our findings shed new light on the connection between the two learning frameworks and suggest that, in its current forms, PC may have more limited potential as a direct replacement of backpropagation than previously envisioned."}}

We take inspiration from the biological plausibility learning where the neuron responses are tuned based on a local synapse-change procedure and activated by competitive lateral inhibition rules. Based on these feed-forward learning rules, we design a soft Hebbian learning process which provides an unsupervised and effective mechanism for online adaptation. We observe that the performance of this feed-forward Hebbian learning for fully test-time adaptation can be significantly improved by incorporating a feedback neuro-modulation layer. It is able to fine-tune the neuron responses based on the external feedback generated by the error back-propagation from the top inference layers. This leads to our proposed neuro-modulated Hebbian learning (NHL) method for fully test-time adaptation. With the unsupervised feed-forward soft Hebbian learning being combined with a learned neuro-modulator to capture feedback from external responses, the source model can be effectively adapted during the testing process. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve the adaptation performance of network models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}}

Though plagued with noise and stochasticity, videos consist of features that are organised in a spatiotemporal hierarchy, different features possessing different temporal dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Latent Hierarchy (DLH) -- a deep hierarchical latent model that represents videos as a hierarchy of latent states that evolve over separate and fluid timescales. Each latent state is a mixture distribution with two components, representing the immediate past and the predicted future, causing the model to learn transitions only between sufficiently dissimilar states, while clustering temporally persistent states closer together. Using this unique property, DLH naturally discovers the spatiotemporal structure of a dataset and learns disentangled representations across its hierarchy. We hypothesise that this simplifies the task of modeling temporal dynamics of a video, improves the learning of long-term dependencies, and reduces error accumulation. As evidence, we demonstrate that DLH outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in video prediction, is able to better represent stochasticity, as well as to dynamically adjust its hierarchical and temporal structure. Our paper shows, among other things, how progress in representation learning can translate into progress in prediction tasks."}}

Moreover, the approximations significantly decrease accuracy in benchmarks, suggesting that an entirely different approach may be more fruitful. Here, grounded on recent theory for Hebbian learning in soft winner-take-all networks, we present multilayer SoftHebb, i.e. an algorithm that trains deep neural networks, without any feedback, target, or error signals. As a result, it achieves efficiency by avoiding weight transport, non-local plasticity, time-locking of layer updates, iterative equilibria, and (self-) supervisory or other feedback signals \u2013 which were necessary in other approaches. Its increased efficiency and biological compatibility do not trade off accuracy compared to state-of-the-art bio-plausible learning, but rather improve it. With up to five hidden layers and an added linear classifier, accuracies on MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImageNet, respectively reach 99.4%, 80.3%, 76.2%, and 27.3%. In conclusion, SoftHebb shows with a radically different approach from BP that Deep Learning over few layers may be plausible in the brain and increases the accuracy of bio-plausible machine learning.

An SSL framework derived from biological first principles of embodied learning could unify the various SSL methods, help elucidate learning in the brain, and possibly improve ML. SSL commonly transforms each training datapoint into a pair of views, uses the knowledge of this pairing as a positive (i.e. non-contrastive) self-supervisory sign, and potentially opposes it to unrelated, (i.e. contrastive) negative examples. Here, we show that this type of self-supervision is an incomplete implementation of a concept from neuroscience, the Efference Copy (EC). Specifically, the brain also transforms the environment through efference, i.e. motor commands, however it sends to itself an EC of the full commands, i.e. more than a mere SSL sign. In addition, its action representations are likely egocentric. From such a principled foundation we formally recover and extend SSL methods such as SimCLR, BYOL, and ReLIC under a common theoretical framework, i.e. Self-supervision Through Efference Copies (S-TEC). Empirically, S-TEC restructures meaningfully the within- and between-class representations. This manifests as improvement in recent strong SSL baselines in image classification, segmentation, object detection, and in audio. These results hypothesize a testable positive influence from the brain's motor outputs onto its sensory representations."}}

Here we explore a bio-inspired development process to form the connections in a network used for locality sensitive hashing. The network is a simplified model of the insect mushroom body, which has sparse connections from the input layer to a second layer of higher dimension, forming a sparse code. In previous versions of this model, connectivity between the layers is random. We investigate whether the performance of the hash, evaluated in nearest neighbour query tasks, can be improved by process of developing the connections, in which the strongest input dimensions in successive samples are wired to each successive coding dimension. Experiments show that the accuracy of searching for nearest neighbours is improved, although performance is dependent on the parameter values and datasets used. Our approach is also much faster than alternative methods that have been proposed for training the connections in this model. Importantly, the development process does not impact connections built at an earlier stage, which should provide stable coding results for simultaneous learning in a downstream network. "}}

By adopting architectures of deep artificial neural networks (ANNs), SNNs are achieving competitive performances in benchmark tasks such as image classification. However, successful architectures of ANNs are not necessary ideal for SNN and when tasks become more diverse effective architectural variations could be critical. To this end, we develop a spike-based differentiable hierarchical search (SpikeDHS) framework, where spike-based computation is realized on both the cell and the layer level search space. Based on this framework, we find effective SNN architectures under limited computation cost. During the training of SNN, a suboptimal surrogate gradient function could lead to poor approximations of true gradients, making the network enter certain local minima. To address this problem, we extend the differential approach to surrogate gradient search where the SG function is efficiently optimized locally. Our models achieve state-of-the-art performances on classification of CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet with accuracy of 95.50%, 76.25% and 68.64%. On event-based deep stereo, our method finds optimal layer variation and surpasses the accuracy of specially designed ANNs meanwhile with 26$\\times$ lower energy cost ($6.7\\mathrm{mJ}$), demonstrating the advantage of SNN in processing highly sparse and dynamic signals.
