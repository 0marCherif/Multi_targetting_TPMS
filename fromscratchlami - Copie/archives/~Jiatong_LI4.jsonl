In Chinese NER, character substitution is a complicated linguistic phenomenon. Some Chinese characters are quite similar for sharing the same components or having similar pronunciations. People replace characters in a named entity with similar characters to generate a new collocation but referring to the same object. It becomes even more common in the Internet age and is often used to avoid Internet censorship or just for fun. Such character substitution is not friendly to those pre-trained language models because the new collocations are occasional. As a result, it always leads to unrecognizable or recognition errors in the NER task. In this paper, we propose a new method, Multi-Feature Fusion Embedding (MFE) for Chinese Named Entity Recognition, to strengthen the language pattern of Chinese and handle the character substitution problem in Chinese Named Entity Recognition. MFE fuses semantic, glyph, and phonetic features together. In the glyph domain, we disassemble Chinese characters into components to denote structure features so that characters with similar structures can have close embedding space representation. Meanwhile, an improved phonetic system is also proposed in our work, making it reasonable to calculate phonetic similarity among Chinese characters. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves the overall performance of Chinese NER and especially performs well in informal language environments."}}
