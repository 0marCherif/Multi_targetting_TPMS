The resultant network spaces, named Elite Spaces, are discovered from Expanded Search Space with minimal human expertise imposed. The Pareto-efficient Elite Spaces are aligned with the Pareto front under various complexity constraints and can be further served as NAS search spaces, benefiting differentiable NAS approaches (e.g. In CIFAR-100, an averagely 2.3% lower error rate and 3.7% closer to target constraint than the baseline with around 90% fewer samples required to find satisfactory networks). Moreover, our NSS approach is capable of searching for superior spaces in future unexplored spaces, revealing great potential in searching for network spaces automatically."}}

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art methods often utilize cross-entropy loss which in-explicitly assumes the independence among class labels. Motivated by the fact that class members from the same hierarchy need to be similar to each others, we design a new training diagram called Hierarchical Complement Objective Training (HCOT). In HCOT, in addition to maximizing the probability of the ground truth class, we also neutralize the probabilities of rest of the classes in a hierarchical fashion, making the model take advantage of the label hierarchy explicitly. We conduct our method on both image classification and semantic segmentation. Results show that HCOT outperforms state-of-the-art models in CIFAR100, Imagenet, and PASCAL-context. Our experiments also demonstrate that HCOT can be applied on tasks with latent label hierarchies, which is a common characteristic in many machine learning tasks. "}}

Nevertheless, state-of-the-art methods often deploy cross-entropy loss that implicitly assumes class labels to be exclusive and thus independence from each other. Motivated by the fact that classes from the same parental category usually share certain similarity, we design a new training diagram called Hierarchical Complement Objective Training (HCOT) that leverages the information from label hierarchy. HCOT maximizes the probability of the ground truth class, and at the same time, neutralizes the probabilities of rest of the classes in a hierarchical fashion, making the model take advantage of the label hierarchy explicitly. The proposed HCOT is evaluated on both image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results confirm that HCOT outperforms state-of-the-art models in CIFAR-100, ImageNet-2012, and PASCAL-Context.

This motivates us to study a new training paradigm that maximizes the likelihood of the ground-truth class while neutralizing the probabilities of the complement classes. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple tasks ranging from computer vision to natural language understanding. The experimental results confirm that, compared to the conventional training with just one primary objective, training also with the complement objective further improves the performance of the state-of-the-art models across all tasks.
