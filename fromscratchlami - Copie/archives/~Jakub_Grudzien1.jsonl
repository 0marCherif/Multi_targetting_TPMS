However, many research endeavours have been focused on developing practical MARL algorithms whose effectiveness has been studied only empirically, thereby lacking theoretical guarantees. As recent studies have revealed, MARL methods often achieve performance that is unstable in terms of reward monotonicity or suboptimal at convergence. To resolve these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework named Heterogeneous-Agent Mirror Learning (HAML) that provides a general template for MARL algorithmic designs. We prove that algorithms derived from the HAML template satisfy the desired properties of the monotonic improvement of the joint reward and the convergence to Nash equilibrium. We verify the practicality of HAML by proving that the current state-of-the-art cooperative MARL algorithms, HATRPO and HAPPO, are in fact HAML instances. Next, as a natural outcome of our theory, we propose HAML extensions of two well-known RL algorithms, HAA2C (for A2C) and HADDPG (for DDPG), and demonstrate their effectiveness against strong baselines on StarCraftII and Multi-Agent MuJoCo tasks."}}

A natural follow-up question is how to abstract multi-agent decision making also as an sequence modeling problem and benefit from the prosperous development of the SMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture named Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) that effectively casts cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) into SM problems wherein the objective is to map agents'  observation sequences to agents' optimal action sequences. Our goal is to build the bridge between MARL and SMs so that the modeling power of modern sequence models can be unleashed for MARL. Central to our MAT is an encoder-decoder architecture which leverages the multi-agent advantage decomposition theorem to transform the joint policy search problem into a sequential decision making process; this renders only linear time complexity for multi-agent problems and, most importantly, endows MAT with monotonic performance improvement guarantee. Unlike prior arts such as Decision Transformer fit only pre-collected offline data, MAT is trained by online trial and error from the environment in an on-policy fashion. To validate MAT, we conduct extensive experiments on StarCraftII, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, Dexterous Hands Manipulation, and Google Research Football benchmarks. Results demonstrate that MAT achieves superior performance and data efficiency compared to strong baselines including MAPPO and HAPPO. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MAT is an excellent few-short learner on unseen tasks regardless of changes in the number of agents.\nSee our project page at https://sites.google.com/view/multi-agent-transformer."}}

Unfortunately, when it comes to multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),  the property of monotonic improvement may not simply apply; this is because agents, even in cooperative games, could have conflicting directions of policy updates. As a result, achieving a guaranteed improvement on the joint policy where each agent acts individually remains an open challenge. In this paper, we extend the theory of trust region learning to MARL. Central to our findings are the multi-agent advantage decomposition lemma and the sequential policy update scheme. Based on these, we develop Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimisation (HATPRO) and Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimisation (HAPPO) algorithms. Unlike many existing MARL algorithms, HATRPO/HAPPO do not need agents to share parameters, nor do they need any restrictive assumptions on decomposibility of the joint value function. Most importantly, we justify in theory the monotonic improvement property of HATRPO/HAPPO. We evaluate the proposed methods on a series of Multi-Agent MuJoCo and StarCraftII tasks. Results show that HATRPO and HAPPO significantly outperform strong baselines such as IPPO, MAPPO and MADDPG on all tested tasks, thereby establishing a new state of the art. "}}

In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) settings, policy optimisation with safety awareness is particularly challenging because each individual agent has to not only meet its own safety constraints, but also consider those of others so that their joint behaviour can be guaranteed safe. Despite its importance, the problem of safe multi-agent learning has not been rigorously studied; very few solutions have been proposed, nor a sharable testing environment or benchmarks. To fill these gaps, in this work, we formulate the safe MARL problem as a constrained Markov game and solve it with policy optimisation methods. Our solutions---Multi-Agent Constrained Policy Optimisation (MACPO) and MAPPO-Lagrangian---leverage the theories from both constrained policy optimisation and multi-agent trust region learning. Crucially, our methods enjoy theoretical guarantees of both monotonic improvement in reward and satisfaction of safety constraints at every iteration. To examine the effectiveness of our methods, we develop the benchmark suite of Safe Multi-Agent MuJoCo that involves a variety of  MARL baselines. Experimental results justify that MACPO/MAPPO-Lagrangian can consistently satisfy safety constraints, meanwhile achieving comparable performance to strong baselines."}}

In multi-agent RL (MARL), although the PG theorem can be naturally extended, the effectiveness of multi-agent PG (MAPG)  methods degrades as the variance of gradient estimates increases rapidly with the number of agents.  In this paper, we offer a rigorous analysis of MAPG methods by, firstly, quantifying the contributions of the number of agents and agents' explorations to the variance of MAPG estimators. Based on this analysis, we derive the optimal baseline (OB) that achieves the minimal variance. In comparison to the OB, we measure the excess variance of existing MARL algorithms such as vanilla MAPG and COMA. Considering using deep neural networks,  we also propose a surrogate version of OB, which can be seamlessly plugged into any existing PG methods in MARL.   On benchmarks of Multi-Agent MuJoCo and StarCraft challenges, our OB technique effectively stabilises training and improves the performance of multi-agent PPO  and COMA algorithms by a significant margin.
