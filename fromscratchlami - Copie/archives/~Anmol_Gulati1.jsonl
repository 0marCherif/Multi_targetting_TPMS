However, emitting fast without degrading quality, as measured by word error rate (WER), is highly challenging. Existing approaches including Early and Late Penalties [1] and Constrained Alignments [2], [3] penalize emission delay by manipulating per-token or per-frame probability prediction in sequence transducer models [4]. While being successful in reducing delay, these approaches suffer from significant accuracy regression and also require additional word alignment information from an existing model. In this work, we propose a sequence-level emission regularization method, named FastEmit, that applies latency regularization directly on per-sequence probability in training transducer models, and does not require any alignment. We demonstrate that FastEmit is more suitable to the sequence-level optimization of transducer models [4] for streaming ASR by applying it on various end-to-end streaming ASR networks including RNN-Transducer [5], Transformer-Transducer [6], [7], ConvNet-Transducer [8] and Conformer-Transducer [9]. We achieve 150 ~ 300ms latency reduction with significantly better accuracy over previous techniques on a Voice Search test set. FastEmit also improves streaming ASR accuracy from 4.4%/8.9% to 3.1%/7.5% WER, meanwhile reduces 90th percentile latency from 210ms to only 30ms on LibriSpeech."}}

Existing work has shown positive transfer from high resource to low resource languages. However, degradations on high resource languages are commonly observed due to interference from the heterogeneous multilingual data and reduction in per-language capacity. We conduct a capacity study on a 15-language task, with the amount of data per language varying from 7.6K to 53.5K hours. We adopt GShard [1] to efficiently scale up to 10B parameters. Empirically, we find that (1) scaling the number of model parameters is an effective way to solve the capacity bottleneck - our 500M-param model already outperforms monolingual baselines and scaling it to 1B and 10B brought further quality gains; (2) larger models are not only more data efficient, but also more efficient in terms of training cost as measured in TPU days - the 1B-param model reaches the same accuracy at 34% of training time as the 500M-param model; (3) given a fixed capacity budget, adding depth works better than width and large encoders do better than large decoders; (4) with continuous training, they can be adapted to new languages and domains."}}

We find that the combination of pre-training, self-training and scaling up model size greatly increases data efficiency, even for extremely large tasks with tens of thousands of hours of labeled data. In particular, on an ASR task with 34k hours of labeled data, by fine-tuning an 8 billion parameter pre-trained Conformer model we can match state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance with only 3% of the training data and significantly improve SoTA with the full training set. We also report on the universal benefits gained from using big pre-trained and self-trained models for a large set of downstream tasks that cover a wide range of speech domains and span multiple orders of magnitudes of dataset sizes, including obtaining SoTA performance on many public benchmarks. In addition, we utilize the learned representation of pre-trained networks to achieve SoTA results on non-ASR tasks."}}

However, the model still tends to delay the predictions towards the end and thus has much higher partial latency compared to a conventional ASR model. To address this issue, we look at encouraging the E2E model to emit words early, through an algorithm called FastEmit [3]. Naturally, improving on latency results in a quality degradation. To address this, we explore replacing the LSTM layers in the encoder of our E2E model with Conformer layers [4], which has shown good improvements for ASR. Secondly, we also explore running a 2nd-pass beam search to improve quality. In order to ensure the 2nd-pass completes quickly, we explore non-causal Conformer layers that feed into the same 1st-pass RNN-T decoder, an algorithm called Cascaded Encoders [5]. Overall, the Conformer RNN-T with Cascaded Encoders offers a better quality and latency tradeoff for streaming ASR."}}

ContextNet features a fully convolutional encoder that incorporates global context information into convolution layers by adding squeeze-and-excitation modules. In addition, we propose a simple scaling method that scales the widths of ContextNet that achieves good trade-off between computation and accuracy. We demonstrate that on the widely used Librispeech benchmark, ContextNet achieves a word error rate (WER) of 2.1%/4.6% without external language model (LM), 1.9%/4.1% with LM and 2.9%/7.0% with only 10M parameters on the clean/noisy LibriSpeech test sets. This compares to the best previously published model of 2.0%/4.6% with LM and 3.9%/11.3% with 20M parameters. The superiority of the proposed ContextNet model is also verified on a much larger internal dataset."}}
