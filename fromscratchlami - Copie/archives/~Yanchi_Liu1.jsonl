While effective and prevalent, contrastive learning has been less explored for time series data. A key component of contrastive learning is to select appropriate augmentations imposing some priors to construct feasible positive samples, such that an encoder can be trained to learn robust and discriminative representations. Unlike image and language domains where ``desired'' augmented samples can be generated with the rule of thumb guided by prefabricated human priors, the ad-hoc manual selection of time series augmentations is hindered by their diverse and human-unrecognizable temporal structures. How to find the desired augmentations of time series data that are meaningful for given contrastive learning tasks and datasets remains an open question. In this work, we address the problem by encouraging both high \\textit{fidelity} and \\textit{variety} based upon information theory. A theoretical analysis leads to the criteria for selecting feasible data augmentations. On top of that, we propose a new contrastive learning approach with information-aware augmentations, InfoTS, that adaptively selects optimal augmentations for time series representation learning. Experiments on various datasets show highly competitive performance with up to 12.0\\% reduction in MSE on forecasting tasks and up to 3.7\\% relative improvement in accuracy on classification tasks over the leading baselines."}}

However, the flexibility of these dockless systems comes at the cost of management and operation complexity. Indeed, the imbalanced and dynamic use of bikes leads to mandatory rebalancing operations, which impose a critical need for effective bike traffic flow prediction. While efforts have been made in developing traffic flow prediction models, existing approaches lack interpretability, and thus have limited value in practical deployment. To this end, we propose an Interpretable Bike Flow Prediction (IBFP) framework, which can provide effective bike flow prediction with interpretable traffic patterns. Specifically, by dividing the urban area into regions according to flow density, we first model the spatio-temporal bike flows between regions with graph regularized sparse representation, where graph Laplacian is used as a smooth operator to preserve the commonalities of the periodic data structure. Then, we extract traffic patterns from bike flows using subspace clustering with sparse representation to construct interpretable base matrices. Moreover, the bike flows can be predicted with the interpretable base matrices and learned parameters. Finally, experimental results on real-world data show the advantages of the IBFP method for flow prediction in dockless bike sharing systems. In addition, the interpretability of our flow pattern exploitation is further illustrated through a case study where IBFP provides valuable insights into bike flow analysis."}}

A large portion of prior studies on competition analysis focuses on mining textual data, e.g., news articles and social comments. However, the increasing availability of human mobility and mobile query data enables a new paradigm for analyzing the competitive relationships among POIs, which remains largely unexplored. To this end, in this paper, we attempt to mine large-scale online map search query data for better understanding POI competitive relationships. Based on a co-query POI graph built from the map search query data, we develop a novel neural graphlet-based prediction framework to predict the competitive relationships among POIs. A unique perspective of our model is to infer latent POI competitive relationships by integrating multiple distinct factors, e.g., graphlet structure, geographical distance, and regional features, reflected in map search query data and POI data. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, and show that our framework outperforms all baselines with a significant margin in all evaluation metrics."}}

The effective prediction of city-wide parking availability can boost parking efficiency, improve urban planning, and ultimately alleviate city congestion. However, it is a non-trivial task for city-wide parking availability prediction because of three major challenges: 1) the non-euclidean spatial autocorrelation among parking lots, 2) the dynamic temporal autocorrelation inside of and between parking lots, and 3) the scarcity of information about real-time parking availability obtained from real-time sensors (e.g., camera, ultrasonic sensor, and bluetooth sensor). To this end, we propose a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><u>S</u>emi-supervised <u>H</u>ier<u>a</u>rchical <u>Re</u>current Graph Neural Network-<u>X</u></i> ( <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SHARE-X</small> ) to predict parking availability of each parking lot within a city. Specifically, we first propose a hierarchical graph convolution module to model the non-euclidean spatial autocorrelation among parking lots. Along this line, a contextual graph convolution block and a multi-resolution soft clustering graph convolution block are respectively proposed to capture local and global spatial dependencies between parking lots. Moreover, we devise a hierarchical attentive recurrent network module to incorporate both short and long-term dynamic temporal dependencies of parking lots. Additionally, a parking availability approximation module is introduced to estimate missing real-time parking availabilities from both spatial and temporal domains. Finally, experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SHARE-X</small> outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines in parking availability prediction."}}
