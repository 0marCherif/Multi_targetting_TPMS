However, most machine learning methods are designed to improve a model\u2019s average performance on a chosen end task without consideration for their impact on worst group error. Multitask learning (MTL) is one such widely used technique. In this paper, we seek not only to understand the impact of MTL on worst-group accuracy but also to explore its potential as a tool to address the challenge of group-wise fairness. We primarily consider the common setting of fine-tuning a pre-trained model, where, following recent work (Gururangan et al., 2020; Dery et al., 2023), we multitask the end task with the pre- training objective constructed from the end task data itself. In settings with few or no group annotations, we find that multitasking often, but not always, achieves better worst-group accuracy than Just-Train-Twice (JTT; Liu et al. (2021)) \u2013 a representative distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method. Leveraging insights from synthetic data experiments, we propose to modify standard MTL by regularizing the joint multitask representation space. We run a large number of fine-tuning experiments across computer vision and natural language and find that our regularized MTL approach consistently outperforms JTT on both worst and average group outcomes.

Whilst much work has been done to formulate useful auxiliary objectives, their construction is still an art which proceeds by slow and tedious hand-design. Intuitions about how and when these objectives improve end-task performance have also had limited theoretical backing. In this work, we present an approach for automatically generating a suite of auxiliary objectives. We achieve this by deconstructing existing objectives within a novel unified taxonomy, identifying connections between them, and generating new ones based on the uncovered structure. Next, we theoretically formalize widely-held intuitions about how auxiliary learning improves generalization of the end-task. This leads us to a principled and efficient algorithm for searching the space of generated objectives to find those most useful to a specified end-task. With natural language processing (NLP) as our domain of study, we empirically verify that our automated auxiliary learning pipeline leads to strong improvements over competitive baselines across continued training experiments on a pre-trained model on 5 NLP end-tasks."}}

However, similar gains have not been observed in many other modalities due to a lack of relevant pretrained models. In this work, we propose ORCA, a general cross-modal fine-tuning framework that extends the applicability of a single large-scale pretrained model to diverse modalities. ORCA adapts to a target task via an align-then-refine workflow: given the target input, ORCA first learns an embedding network that aligns the embedded feature distribution with the pretraining modality. The pretrained model is then fine-tuned on the embedded data to exploit the knowledge shared across modalities. Through extensive experiments, we show that ORCA obtains state-of-the-art results on 3 benchmarks containing over 60 datasets from 12 modalities, outperforming a wide range of hand-designed, AutoML, general-purpose, and task-specific methods. We highlight the importance of data alignment via a series of ablation studies and demonstrate ORCA's utility in data-limited regimes."}}

Multi-step planning based approaches to hyperparameter optimization promise improved efficiency over myopic alternatives by more effectively balancing out exploration and exploitation. However, the potential of these approaches has not been fully realized due to their technical complexity and computational intensity. In this work, we leverage recent advances in Transformer-based, natural-language-interfaced hyperparameter optimization to circumvent these barriers. We build on top of the recently proposed OptFormer which casts both hyperparameter suggestion and target function approximation as autoregressive generation thus making planning via rollouts simple and efficient.  We conduct extensive exploration of different strategies for performing multi-step planning on top of the OptFormer model to highlight its potential for use in constructing non-myopic HPO strategies."}}

In this work, we revisit this assumption by studying the cross-modal transfer ability of large-scale pretrained models. We introduce ORCA, a general cross-modal fine-tuning workflow that enables fast and automatic exploitation of existing pretrained models for diverse tasks. ORCA achieves task-specific adaptation by learning feature embeddings that minimize an optimal transport distance metric to map the data distribution in the end-task modality to the pretraining modality. We test ORCA on 13 tasks with varying modalities and input-output types. ORCA performs the best on 10 of them and is in the top three on the others. We further quantify the importance of embedding distance for downstream performance, highlight ORCA\u2019s utility for data-limited tasks, and demonstrate its compatibility with same-modality transfer."}}
