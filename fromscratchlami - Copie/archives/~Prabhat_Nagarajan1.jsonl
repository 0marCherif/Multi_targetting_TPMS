However, hyperparameter selection prior to deployment requires selecting policies offline without online execution, which is a significant challenge known as offline policy selection. As yet, there is little understanding about the fundamental limitations of the offline policy selection problem. To contribute to our understanding of this problem, in this paper, we investigate when sample efficient offline policy selection is possible. As off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) is a natural approach for policy selection, the sample complexity of offline policy selection is therefore upper-bounded by the number of samples needed to perform OPE. In addition, we prove that the sample complexity of offline policy selection is also lower-bounded by the sample complexity of OPE. These results imply not only that offline policy selection is effective when OPE is effective, but also that sample efficient policy selection is not possible without additional assumptions that make OPE effective. Moreover, we theoretically study the conditions under which offline policy selection using Fitted Q evaluation (FQE) and the Bellman error is sample efficient. We conclude with an empirical study comparing FQE and Bellman errors for offline policy selection."}}

However, safety is a necessary prerequisite to deploying RL systems in real world domains such as autonomous vehicles or cooperative robotics. Safe RL problems are often formulated as constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs). In particular, solving CMDPs becomes challenging when safety must be ensured in rare, dangerous situations in stochastic environments. In this paper, we propose an approach for CMDPs where we have access to a generative model (e.g. a simulator) that can preferentially sample rare, dangerous events. In particular, our approach, termed the RP algorithm decomposes the CMDP into a pair of MDPs which we term a reconnaissance MDP (R-MDP) and a planning MDP (P-MDP). In the R-MDP, we leverage the generative model to preferentially sample rare, dangerous events and train a threat function, the Q-function analog of danger that can determine the safety level of a given state-action pair. In the P-MDP, we train a reward-seeking policy while using the trained threat function to ensure that the agent considers only safe actions. We show that our approach, termed the RP algorithm enjoys several useful theoretical properties. Moreover, we present an approximate version of the RP algorithm that can significantly reduce the difficulty of solving the R-MDP. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method over classical approaches in multiple tasks, including a collision-free navigation task with dynamic obstacles."}}

However, drawing inspiration from model-free reinforcement learning, we propose learning a latent dynamics model directly from rewards. In this work, we introduce a model-based planning framework which learns a latent reward prediction model and then plan in the latent state-space. The latent representation is learned exclusively from multi-step reward prediction which we show to be the only necessary information for successful planning.  With this framework, we are able to benefit from the concise model-free representation, while still enjoying the data-efficiency of model-based algorithms.  We demonstrate our framework in multi-pendulum and multi-cheetah environments where several pendulums or cheetahs are shown to the agent but only one of them produces rewards. In these environments, it is important for the agent to construct a concise latent representation to filter out irrelevant observations. We find that our method can successfully learn an accurate latent reward prediction model in the presence of the irrelevant information while existing model-based methods fail. Planning in the learned latent state-space shows strong performance and high sample efficiency over model-free and model-based baselines."}}

However, reinforcement learning struggles to learn efficiently, thus limiting its pervasive application to several challenging problems. A typical RL agent learns solely from its own trial-and-error experiences, requiring many experiences to learn a successful policy. To alleviate this problem, we propose collaborative inter-agent knowledge distillation (CIKD). CIKD is a learning framework that uses an ensemble of RL agents to execute different policies in the environment while sharing knowledge amongst agents in the ensemble. Our experiments demonstrate that CIKD improves upon state-of-the-art RL methods in sample efficiency and performance on several challenging MuJoCo benchmark tasks. Additionally, we present an in-depth investigation on how CIKD leads to performance improvements.\n"}}

This is because IRL typically seeks a reward function that makes the demonstrator appear near-optimal, rather than inferring the underlying intentions of the demonstrator that may have been poorly executed in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel reward-learning-from-observation algorithm, Trajectory-ranked Reward EXtrapolation (T-REX), that extrapolates beyond a set of (approximately) ranked demonstrations in order to infer high-quality reward functions from a set of potentially poor demonstrations. When combined with deep reinforcement learning, T-REX outperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning and IRL methods on multiple Atari and MuJoCo benchmark tasks and achieves performance that is often more than twice the performance of the best demonstration. We also demonstrate that T-REX is robust to ranking noise and can accurately extrapolate intention by simply watching a learner noisily improve at a task over time."}}
