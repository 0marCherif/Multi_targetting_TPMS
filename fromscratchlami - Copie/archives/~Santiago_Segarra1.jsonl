History-dependent spatio-temporal Hawkes processes are often used to mathematically model these point events. However, previous approaches have faced numerous challenges, particularly when attempting to forecast multiple future events. In this work, we propose a new neural architecture for multi-event forecasting of spatio-temporal point processes, utilizing transformers, augmented with normalizing flows and probabilistic layers. Our network makes batched predictions of complex history-dependent spatio-temporal distributions of future discrete events, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmark datasets including the South California Earthquakes, Citibike, Covid19, and Hawkes synthetic Pinwheel datasets. More generally, we illustrate how our network can be applied to any dataset of discrete events with associated markers, even when no underlying physics is known."}}

Repetitive COP refers to problems to be solved repeatedly on graphs of the same or slowly changing topology but rapidly changing node or edge weights. Compared to one-shot COPs, repetitive COPs often rely on fast heuristics to solve one instance of the problem before the next one arrives, at the cost of a relatively large optimality gap. Through numerical experiments on several discrete optimization problems, we show that our approach can learn reusable node or edge representations to reduce the optimality gap of fast heuristics for independent repetitive COPs, and can optimize the long-term objectives for repetitive COPs embedded in graph-based Markov decision processes.

Several of the most popular and empirically successful algorithms are, at their core, a greedy walk along a pruned near neighbor graph. However, graph traversal applications often suffer from poor memory access patterns, and near neighbor search is no exception to this rule. Our measurements show that popular search indices such as the hierarchical navigable small-world graph (HNSW) can have poor cache miss performance. To address this issue, we formulate the graph traversal problem as a cache hit maximization task and propose multiple graph reordering as a solution. Graph reordering is a memory layout optimization that groups commonly-accessed nodes together in memory. We mathematically formalize the connection between the graph layout and the cache complexity of search. We present exhaustive experiments applying several reordering algorithms to a leading graph-based near neighbor method based on the HNSW index. We find that reordering improves the query time by up to 40%, we present analysis and improvements for existing graph layout methods, and we demonstrate that the time needed to reorder the graph is negligible compared to the time required to construct the index."}}

Drawing analogies from discrete and graph signal processing, we introduce the building blocks for processing data on simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, two common higher-order network abstractions that can incorporate polyadic relationships. We provide brief introductions to simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, with a special emphasis on the concepts needed for the processing of signals supported on these structures. Specifically, we discuss Fourier analysis, signal denoising, signal interpolation, node embeddings, and nonlinear processing through neural networks, using these two higher-order network models. In the context of simplicial complexes, we specifically focus on signal processing using the Hodge Laplacian matrix, a multi-relational operator that leverages the special structure of simplicial complexes and generalizes desirable properties of the Laplacian matrix in graph signal processing. For hypergraphs, we present both matrix and tensor representations, and discuss the trade-offs in adopting one or the other. We also highlight limitations and potential research avenues, both to inform practitioners and to motivate the contribution of new researchers to the area."}}

In this hypergraph model, the contribution of every vertex to each of its incident hyperedges is represented through an edge-dependent weight, conferring the model higher expressivity than the classical hypergraph. In our method, we leverage random walks with EDVWs to construct a hypergraph Laplacian and use its spectral properties to embed vertices and hyperedges in a common space. We then cluster these embeddings to obtain our proposed co-clustering method, of particular relevance in applications requiring the simultaneous clustering of data entities and features. Numerical experiments using real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in comparison with state-of-the-art alternatives."}}

In studying maps on the chain complex of a simplicial complex, we define three desirable properties of a simplicial neural network architecture: namely, permutation equivariance, orientation equivariance, and simplicial awareness. The first two properties respectively account for the fact that the node indexing and the simplex orientations in a simplicial complex are arbitrary. The last property encodes the desirable feature that the output of the neural network depends on the entire simplicial complex and not on a subset of its dimensions. Based on these properties, we propose a simple convolutional architecture, rooted in tools from algebraic topology, for the problem of trajectory prediction, and show that it obeys all three of these properties when an odd, nonlinear activation function is used. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in extrapolating trajectories on synthetic and real datasets, with particular emphasis on the gains in generalizability to unseen trajectories."}}

This problem is motivated by the task of learning gene regulatory networks based on gene expression data from different tissues, developmental stages or disease states. We prove that under certain regularity conditions, the proposed $\\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimator converges in Frobenius norm to the adjacency matrices consistent with the data-generating distributions and has the correct sparsity. In particular, we show that this joint estimation procedure leads to a faster convergence rate than estimating each DAG model separately. As a corollary, we also obtain high-dimensional consistency results for causal inference from a mix of observational and interventional data. For practical purposes, we propose jointGES consisting of Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) to estimate the union of all DAG models followed by variable selection using lasso to obtain the different DAGs, and we analyze its consistency guarantees. The proposed method is illustrated through an analysis of simulated data as well as epithelial ovarian cancer gene expression data."}}
