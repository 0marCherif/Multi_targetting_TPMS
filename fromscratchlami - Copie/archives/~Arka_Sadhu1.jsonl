Among many efforts on task-free CL, a notable family of approaches are memory-based that store and replay a subset of training examples. However, the utility of stored seen examples may diminish over time since CL models are continually updated. Here, we propose Gradient based Memory EDiting (GMED), a framework for editing stored examples in continuous input space via gradient updates, in order to create more \"challenging\" examples for replay. GMED-edited examples remain similar to their unedited forms, but can yield increased loss in the upcoming model updates, thereby making the future replays more effective in overcoming catastrophic forgetting. By construction, GMED can be seamlessly applied in conjunction with other memory-based CL algorithms to bring further improvement. Experiments validate the effectiveness of GMED, and our best method significantly outperforms baselines and previous state-of-the-art on five out of six datasets. "}}

We represent videos as a set of related events, wherein each event consists of a verb and multiple entities that fulfill various roles relevant to that event. To study the challenging task of semantic role labeling in videos or VidSRL, we introduce the VidSitu benchmark, a large-scale video understanding data source with $29K$ $10$-second movie clips richly annotated with a verb and semantic-roles every $2$ seconds. Entities are co-referenced across events within a movie clip and events are connected to each other via event-event relations. Clips in VidSitu are drawn from a large collection of movies (${\\sim}3K$) and have been chosen to be both complex (${\\sim}4.2$ unique verbs within a video) as well as diverse (${\\sim}200$ verbs have more than $100$ annotations each). We provide a comprehensive analysis of the dataset in comparison to other publicly available video understanding benchmarks, several illustrative baselines and evaluate a range of standard video recognition models. Our code and dataset is available at vidsitu.org."}}

These metrics limit the VidQA models' application scenario. In this work, we leverage semantic roles derived from video descriptions to mask out certain phrases, to introduce VidQAP which poses VidQA as a fill-in-the-phrase task. To enable evaluation of answer phrases, we compute the relative improvement of the predicted answer compared to an empty string. To reduce the influence of language bias in VidQA datasets, we retrieve a video having a different answer for the same question. To facilitate research, we construct ActivityNet-SRL-QA and Charades-SRL-QA and benchmark them by extending three vision-language models. We further perform extensive analysis and ablative studies to guide future work."}}

Previous methods apply image grounding based algorithms to address VOG, fail to explore the object relation information and suffer from limited generalization. Here, we investigate the role of object relations in VOG and propose a novel framework VOGNet to encode multi-modal object relations via self-attention with relative position encoding. To evaluate VOGNet, we propose novel contrasting sampling methods to generate more challenging grounding input samples, and construct a new dataset called ActivityNet-SRL (ASRL) based on existing caption and grounding datasets. Experiments on ASRL validate the need of encoding object relations in VOG, and our VOGNet outperforms competitive baselines by a significant margin."}}

To study this human-like language acquisition ability, we present VisCOLL, a visually grounded language learning task, which simulates the continual acquisition of compositional phrases from streaming visual scenes. In the task, models are trained on a paired image-caption stream which has shifting object distribution; while being constantly evaluated by a visually-grounded masked language prediction task on held-out test sets. VisCOLL compounds the challenges of continual learning (i.e., learning from continuously shifting data distribution) and compositional generalization (i.e., generalizing to novel compositions). To facilitate research on VisCOLL, we construct two datasets, COCO-shift and Flickr-shift, and benchmark them using different continual learning methods. Results reveal that SoTA continual learning approaches provide little to no improvements on VisCOLL, since storing examples of all possible compositions is infeasible. We conduct further ablations and analysis to guide future work."}}

The annotated language queries available during training are limited, which also limits the variations of language combinations that a model can see during training. In this paper, we study the case applying objects without labeled queries for training the semi-supervised phrase grounding. We propose to use learned location and subject embedding predictors (LSEP) to generate the corresponding language embeddings for objects lacking annotated queries in the training set. With the assistance of the detector, we also apply LSEP to train a grounding model on images without any annotation. We evaluate our method based on MAttNet on three public datasets: RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg. We show that our predictors allow the grounding system to learn from the objects without labeled queries and improve accuracy by 34.9\\% relatively with the detection results."}}

In previous work, the phrases were restricted to have nouns that were encountered in training, we extend the task to Zero-Shot Grounding(ZSG) which can include novel, \u201cunseen\u201d nouns. Current phrase grounding systems use an explicit object detection network in a 2-stage framework where one stage generates sparse proposals and the other stage evaluates them. In the ZSG setting, generating appropriate proposals itself becomes an obstacle as the proposal generator is trained on the entities common in the detection and grounding datasets. We propose a new single-stage model called ZSGNet which combines the detector network and the grounding system and predicts classification scores and regression parameters. Evaluation of ZSG system brings additional subtleties due to the influence of the relationship between the query and learned categories; we define four distinct conditions that incorporate different levels of difficulty. We also introduce new datasets, sub-sampled from Flickr30k Entities and Visual Genome, that enable evaluations for the four conditions. Our experiments show that ZSGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on Flickr30k and ReferIt under the usual \u201cseen\u201d settings and performs significantly better than baseline in the zero-shot setting."}}
