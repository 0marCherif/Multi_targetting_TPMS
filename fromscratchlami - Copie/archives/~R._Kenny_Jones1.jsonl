The discovered abstractions capture common patterns (both structural and parametric) across a dataset, so that programs rewritten with these abstractions are more compact, and suppress spurious degrees of freedom. ShapeCoder improves upon previous abstraction discovery methods, finding better abstractions, for more complex inputs, under less stringent input assumptions. This is principally made possible by two methodological advancements: (a) a shape-to-program recognition network that learns to solve sub-problems and (b) the use of e-graphs, augmented with a conditional rewrite scheme, to determine when abstractions with complex parametric expressions can be applied, in a tractable manner. We evaluate ShapeCoder on multiple datasets of 3D shapes, where primitive decompositions are either parsed from manual annotations or produced by an unsupervised cuboid abstraction method. In all domains, ShapeCoder discovers a library of abstractions that captures high-level relationships, removes extraneous degrees of freedom, and achieves better dataset compression compared with alternative approaches. Finally, we investigate how programs rewritten to use discovered abstractions prove useful for downstream tasks."}}

Training models to perform this task is complicated because paired (shape, program) data is not readily available for many domains, making exact supervised learning infeasible. However, it is possible to get paired data by compromising the accuracy of either the assigned program labels or the shape distribution. Wake-sleep methods use samples from a generative model of shape programs to approximate the distribution of real shapes. In self-training, shapes are passed through a recognition model, which predicts programs that are treated as \u2018pseudo-labels\u2019 for those shapes. Related to these approaches, we introduce a novel self-training variant unique to program inference, where program pseudo-labels are paired with their executed output shapes, avoiding label mismatch at the cost of an approximate shape distribution. We propose to group these regimes under a single conceptual framework, where training is performed with maximum likelihood updates sourced from either Pseudo-Labels or an Approximate Distribution (PLAD). We evaluate these techniques on multiple 2D and 3D shape program inference domains. Compared with policy gradient reinforcement learning, we show that PLAD techniques infer more accurate shape programs and converge significantly faster. Finally, we propose to combine updates from different PLAD methods within the training of a single model, and find that this approach outperforms any individual technique."}}

NGSP solves this problem via MAP inference, modeling the posterior probability of a label assignment conditioned on an input shape with a learned likelihood function. To make this search tractable, NGSP employs a neural guide network that learns to approximate the posterior. NGSP finds high-probability label assignments by first sampling proposals with the guide network and then evaluating each proposal under the full likelihood. We evaluate NGSP on the task of fine-grained semantic segmentation of man ufactured 3D shapesfrom PartNet, where shapes have been decomposed into regions that correspond to part instance over-segmentations. We find that NGSP delivers significant performance improvements over comparison methods that (i) use regions to group per-point predictions, (ii) use regions as a self-supervisory signal or (iii) assign labels to regions under alternative formulations. Further, we show that NGSP maintains strong performance even with limited labeled data or noisy input shape regions. Finally, we demonstrate that NGSP can be directly applied to CAD shapes found in online repositories and validate its effectiveness with a perceptual study."}}

Such programs consist of a series of instructions along with their associated parameter values. To fully realize the benefits of this representation, a shape program should be compact and only expose degrees of freedom that allow for meaningful manipulation of output geometry. One way to achieve this goal is to design higher-level macro operators that, when executed, expand into a series of commands from the base shape modeling language. However, manually authoring such macros, much like shape programs themselves, is difficult and largely restricted to domain experts. In this paper, we present ShapeMOD, an algorithm for automatically discovering macros that are useful across large datasets of 3D shape programs. ShapeMOD operates on shape programs expressed in an imperative, statement-based language. It is designed to discover macros that make programs more compact by minimizing the number of function calls and free parameters required to represent an input shape collection. We run ShapeMOD on multiple collections of programs expressed in a domain-specific language for 3D shape structures. We show that it automatically discovers a concise set of macros that abstract out common structural and parametric patterns that generalize over large shape collections. We also demonstrate that the macros found by ShapeMOD improve performance on downstream tasks including shape generative modeling and inferring programs from point clouds. Finally, we conduct a user study that indicates that ShapeMOD's discovered macros make interactive shape editing more efficient."}}

Procedural representations are one such possibility: they offer high-quality and editable results but are difficult to author and often produce outputs with limited diversity. On the other extreme are deep generative models: given enough data, they can learn to generate any class of shape but their outputs have artifacts and the representation is not editable. In this paper, we take a step towards achieving the best of both worlds for novel 3D shape synthesis. First, we propose ShapeAssembly, a domain-specific \"assembly-language\" for 3D shape structures. ShapeAssembly programs construct shape structures by declaring cuboid part proxies and attaching them to one another, in a hierarchical and symmetrical fashion. ShapeAssembly functions are parameterized with continuous free variables, so that one program structure is able to capture a family of related shapes. We show how to extract ShapeAssembly programs from existing shape structures in the PartNet dataset. Then, we train a deep generative model, a hierarchical sequence VAE, that learns to write novel ShapeAssembly programs. Our approach leverages the strengths of each representation: the program captures the subset of shape variability that is interpretable and editable, and the deep generative model captures variability and correlations across shape collections that is hard to express procedurally. We evaluate our approach by comparing the shapes output by our generated programs to those from other recent shape structure synthesis models. We find that our generated shapes are more plausible and physically-valid than those of other methods. Additionally, we assess the latent spaces of these models, and find that ours is better structured and produces smoother interpolations. As an application, we use our generative model and differentiable program interpreter to infer and fit shape programs to unstructured geometry, such as point clouds."}}
