We embed Luenberger-type observer into the network's architecture to inform the network of the physics of the process, and to provide error correction and stabilization mechanisms. In addition, to compensate for decrease of observer's performance due to the presence of unknown destabilizing forcing, the network is designed to estimate the contribution of the unknown forcing implicitly from the data over the course of training. By running a set of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed network does recover unknown forcing from data and is capable of predicting turbulent flows in high resolution from low resolution noisy observations."}}

For optimal sensor placement under various wind fields in source inversion problems, this paper proposes a framework under non-Gaussian priors for the detection and inversion estimate of emission rates. The optimization framework with non-Gaussian prior utilizes a bi-level optimization expression with inner quadratic programming. The proposed truncated Gaussian prior is to incorporate non-negativity of emission rates, but it poses a challenge in optimization. We preliminarily investigate the bi-level optimization with a Gaussian plume model example. The Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions of the inner quadratic programming are considered for solving the bi-level optimization. The efficiency of the proposed optimization framework is demonstrated by numerical results to optimally place sensors and quantify emission rates."}}

The deep learning model consists of a recurrent neural network, which aims to learn the time marching structure, and a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn and sample from the probability distribution of the random dynamical system. Although GANs provide a powerful tool to model a complex probability distribution, the training often fails without a proper regularization. Here, we propose a regularization strategy for a GAN based on consistency conditions for the sequential inference problems. First, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is used to enforce the consistency between conditional and marginal distributions of a stochastic process. Then, the marginal distributions of the multiple-step predictions are regularized by using MMD or from multiple discriminators. The behavior of the proposed model is studied by using three stochastic processes with complex noise structures."}}

Moreover, considering the ill-posed nature of a super-resolution problem, we employ the Recurrent Wasserstein Autoencoder to model the uncertainty."}}

With an assumption of the universal function approximation capability of ESN, it is shown that the reconstruction problem can be formulated as a fixed-point problem, in which the trajectory of the dynamical system is a fixed point of the ESN. An under-relaxed fixed-point iteration is proposed to reconstruct the nonlinear dynamics from a sparse observation. The proposed fixed-point ESN is tested against both univariate and multivariate chaotic dynamical systems by randomly removing up to 95% of the data. It is shown that the fixed-point ESN is able to reconstruct the complex dynamics from only 5 ~ 10% of the data. For a relatively simple non-chaotic dynamical system, the numerical experiments on a forced van der Pol oscillator show that it is possible to reconstruct the nonlinear dynamics from only 1~2% of the data."}}
