This new mechanism tends to generate proposals that have higher target probability values. The momentum distribution that is naturally joint with our Fixed-Distance HMC (FDHMC), and keeps the proposal acceptance probability close to 1, is not Gaussian and generates momentums that have  a higher expected magnitude. This translates into a reduced correlation between the successive MCMC states and according to our experimental results, leads to an  improvement in terms of the effective sample size per gradient when compared to the baseline HMC and No-U-Turn (NUTS) samplers.  \n"}}

In this work we rigorously prove that with minimal algorithmic modifications, both HMC and NUTS can be combined with transition functions that are not necessarily volume preserving. In light of these results, we propose a non-volume preserving transition function that conserves the Hamiltonian better than the baseline leapfrog mechanism, on piecewise-continuous distributions. The resulting samplers do not require any assumptions on the geometry of the discontinuity boundaries, and our experimental results show a significant improvement upon traditional HMC and NUTS."}}

Fortunately, when such constraints are invertible, the model can be collapsed and the constraints eliminated through the well-known Jacobian-based change of variables. As our first contribution in this work, we show that a much broader class of algebraic constraints can be collapsed by leveraging the properties of a Dirac delta model of deterministic constraints. Unfortunately, the collapsing process can lead to highly piece-wise densities that pose challenges for existing probabilistic inference tools. Thus, our second contribution to address these challenges is to present a variation of Gibbs sampling that efficiently samples from these piecewise densities. The key insight to achieve this is to introduce a class of functions that (1) is sufficiently rich to approximate arbitrary models up to arbitrary precision, (2) is closed under dimension reduction (collapsing) for models with (non)linear algebraic constraints and (3) always permits one analytical integral sufficient to automatically derive closed-form conditionals for Gibbs sampling. Experiments demonstrate the proposed sampler converges at least an order of magnitude faster than existing Monte Carlo samplers."}}

However, it has difficulty simulating Hamiltonian dynamics with non-smooth functions, leading to poor performance. This paper is motivated by the behavior of Hamiltonian dynamics in physical systems like optics. We introduce a modification of the Leapfrog discretization of Hamiltonian dynamics on piecewise continuous energies, where intersections of the trajectory with discontinuities are detected, and the momentum is reflected or refracted to compensate for the change in energy. We prove that this method preserves the correct stationary distribution when boundaries are affine. Experiments show that by reducing the number of rejected samples, this method improves on traditional HMC."}}

Unfortunately, exact closed-form inference in the underlying Bayesian graphical models is intractable in the general case and existing approximation techniques provide few guarantees on both approximation quality and efficiency. While (Markov Chain) Monte Carlo methods provide an attractive asymptotically unbiased approximation approach, rejection sampling and Metropolis-Hastings both prove inefficient in practice, and analytical derivation of Gibbs samplers require exponential space and time in the amount of data. In this work, we show how to transform problematic piecewise likelihoods into equivalent mixture models and then provide a blocked Gibbs sampling approach for this transformed model that achieves an exponential-to-linear reduction in space and time compared to a conventional Gibbs sampler. This enables fast, asymptotically unbiased Bayesian inference in a new expressive class of piecewise graphical models and empirically requires orders of magnitude less time than rejection, Metropolis-Hastings, and conventional Gibbs sampling methods to achieve the same level of accuracy."}}
