The model infers a latent 3D representation of the scene in the form of 3D feature points, where each continuous world 3D point is mapped to its corresponding feature vector. The model is trained for contrastive view prediction by rendering 3D feature clouds in queried viewpoints and matching against the 3D feature point cloud predicted from the query view. Notably, the representation can be queried for any 3D location, even if it is not visible from the input view. Our model brings together three powerful ideas of recent exciting research work: 3D feature grids as a neural bottleneck for view prediction, implicit functions for handling resolution limitations of 3D grids, and contrastive learning for unsupervised training of feature representations. We show the resulting 3D visual feature representations effectively scale across objects and scenes, imagine information occluded or missing from\nthe input viewpoints, track objects over time, align semantically related objects in 3D, and improve 3D object detection. We outperform many existing state-of-the-art methods for 3D feature learning and view prediction, which are either limited by 3D grid spatial resolution, do not attempt to build amodal 3D representations, or do not handle combinatorial scene variability due to their non-convolutional\nbottlenecks."}}

Current supervised visual detectors, though impressive within their training distribution, often fail to segment out-of-distribution scenes.

For image segmentation, recent slot-centric generative models break such dependence on supervision by attempting to segment scenes into entities in a self-supervised manner by reconstructing pixels. Drawing upon these two lines of work, we propose Slot-TTA, a semi-supervised instance segmentation model equipped with a slot-centric image rendering component, that is adapted per scene at test time through gradient descent on reconstruction or novel view synthesis objectives. We show that test-time adaptation greatly improves segmentation in out-of-distribution scenes. We evaluate Slot-TTA in scene segmentation benchmarks and show substantial out-of-distribution performance improvements against state-of-the-art supervised feed-forward detectors and self-supervised domain adaptation models.

Current supervised visual detectors though impressive within their training distribution, often fail to segment out-of-distribution scenes into their constituent entities. Recent slot-centric generative models break such dependence on supervision, by attempting to segment scenes into entities unsupervised, by reconstructing pixels. However, they have been restricted thus far to toy scenes as they suffer from a reconstruction-segmentation trade-off: as the entity bottleneck gets wider, reconstruction improves but then the segmentation collapses. We propose GFS-Nets (Generating Fast and Slow Networks) that alleviate this issue with two ingredients: i) curriculum training in the form of primitives, often missing from current generative models and, ii) test-time adaptation per scene through gradient descent on the reconstruction objective, what we call slow inference, missing from current feed-forward detectors. We show the proposed curriculum suffices to break the reconstruction-segmentation trade-off, and slow inference greatly improves segmentation in out-of-distribution scenes. We evaluate GFS-Nets in 3D and 2D scene segmentation benchmarks of PartNet, CLEVR, Room Diverse++, and show large ( 50%) performance improvements against SOTA supervised feed-forward detectors and unsupervised object discovery methods"}}
