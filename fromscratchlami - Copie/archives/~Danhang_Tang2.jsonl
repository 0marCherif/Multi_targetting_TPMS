In these methods, mesh vertices and edges are visible to neural networks, enabling the possibility to establish a direct mapping between 2D image pixels and 3D mesh vertices. In this paper, we seek to establish and exploit this mapping with a simple and compact architecture. The network is designed with these considerations: 1) aggregating both local 2D image features from the encoder and 3D geometric features captured in the mesh decoder; 2) decoding coarse-to-fine meshes along the decoding layers to make the best use of the hierarchical multi-scale information.  Specifically, we propose an end-to-end pipeline for hand mesh recovery tasks which consists of three phases: a 2D feature extractor constructing multi-scale feature maps, a feature mapping module transforming local 2D image features to 3D vertex features via 3D-to-2D projection, and a mesh decoder combining the graph convolution and self-attention to reconstruct mesh. The decoder aggregate both local image features in pixels and geometric features in vertices. It also regresses the mesh vertices in a coarse-to-fine manner, which can leverage multi-scale information. By exploiting the local connection and designing the mesh decoder, Our approach achieves state-of-the-art for hand mesh reconstruction on the public FreiHAND dataset."}}

To compress the TSDF, our method relies on a block-based neural network architecture trained end-to-end, achieving state-of-the-art rate-distortion trade-off. To prevent topological errors, we losslessly compress the signs of the TSDF, which also upper bounds the reconstruction error by the voxel size. To compress the corresponding texture, we designed a fast block-based UV parameterization, generating coherent texture maps that can be effectively compressed using\nexisting video compression algorithms.\nWe demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on two 4D performance capture datasets, reducing bitrate by $66\\%$ for the same distortion, or alternatively reducing the distortion by $50\\%$ for the same bitrate, compared to the state-of-the-art."}}

In this paper, we show significant improvement upon such black box optimization by exploiting high-level knowledge of the parameter structure and using a local surrogate energy function. Our new framework, hierarchical sampling optimization (HSO), consists of a sequence of discriminative predictors organized into a kinematic hierarchy. Each predictor is conditioned on its ancestors, and generates a set of samples over a subset of the pose parameters, with only one selected by the highly-efficient surrogate energy. The selected partial poses are concatenated to generate a full-pose hypothesis. Repeating the same process, several hypotheses are generated and the full energy function selects the best result. Under the same kinematic hierarchy, two methods based on decision forest and convolutional neural network are proposed to generate the samples and two optimization methods are studied when optimizing these samples. Experimental evaluations on three publicly available datasets show that our method is particularly impressive in low-compute scenarios where it significantly outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods."}}

We adapt a state of the art template matching feature into a scale-invariant patch descriptor and integrate it into a regression forest using a novel template-based split function. We train with positive samples only and we treat class distributions at the leaf nodes as latent variables. During testing we infer by iteratively updating these distributions, providing accurate estimation of background clutter and foreground occlusions and, thus, better detection rate. Furthermore, as a by-product, our Latent-Class Hough Forests can provide accurate occlusion aware segmentation masks, even in the multi-instance scenario. In addition to an existing public dataset, which contains only single-instance sequences with large amounts of clutter, we have collected two, more challenging, datasets for multiple-instance detection containing heavy 2D and 3D clutter as well as foreground occlusions. We provide extensive experiments on the various parameters of the framework such as patch size, number of trees and number of iterations to infer class distributions at test time. We also evaluate the Latent-Class Hough Forests on all datasets where we outperform state of the art methods."}}

Prior discriminative methods often fall into two categories: holistic and patch-based. Holistic methods are efficient but less flexible due to their nearest neighbour nature. Patch-based methods can generalise to unseen samples by consider local appearance only. However, they are complex because each pixel need to be classified or regressed during testing. In contrast to these two baselines, our method can be considered as a structured coarse-to-fine search, starting from the centre of mass of a point cloud until locating all the skeletal joints. The searching process is guided by a learnt latent tree model which reflects the hierarchical topology of the hand. Our main contributions can be summarised as follows: (i) Learning the topology of the hand in an unsupervised, data-driven manner. (ii) A new forest-based, discriminative framework for structured search in images, as well as an error regression step to avoid error accumulation. (iii) A new multi-view hand pose dataset containing 180 K annotated images from 10 different subjects.

We propose a conditional Convolutional Neural Network, named as c-CNN, to handle multimodal face recognition. Different from traditional CNN that adopts fixed convolution kernels, samples in c-CNN are processed with dynamically activated sets of kernels. In particular, convolution kernels within each layer are only sparsely activated when a sample is passed through the network. For a given sample, the activations of convolution kernels in a certain layer are conditioned on its present intermediate representation and the activation status in the lower layers. The activated kernels across layers define the sample-specific adaptive routes that reveal the distribution of underlying modalities. Consequently, the proposed framework does not rely on any prior knowledge of modalities in contrast with most existing methods. To substantiate the generic framework, we introduce a special case of c-CNN via incorporating the conditional routing of the decision tree, which is evaluated with two problems of multimodality - multi-view face identification and occluded face verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over the counterparts unaware of modalities."}}

Noisy data and occlusions are the major challenges of articulated hand pose estimation. In addition, the discrepancies among realistic and synthetic pose data undermine the performances of existing approaches that use synthetic data extensively in training. We therefore propose the Semi-supervised Transductive Regression (STR) forest which learns the relationship between a small, sparsely labelled realistic dataset and a large synthetic dataset. We also design a novel data-driven, pseudo-kinematic technique to refine noisy or occluded joints. Our contributions include: (i) capturing the benefits of both realistic and synthetic data via transductive learning, (ii) showing accuracies can be improved by considering unlabelled data, and (iii) introducing a pseudo-kinematic technique to refine articulations efficiently. Experimental results show not only the promising performance of our method with respect to noise and occlusions, but also its superiority over state-of-the-arts in accuracy, robustness and speed."}}
