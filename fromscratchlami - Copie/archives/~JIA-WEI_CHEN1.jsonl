However, the sensitive information in the datasets discourages data owners from releasing these datasets. Despite recent research devoted to removing sensitive information from images, they provide neither meaningful privacy-utility trade-off nor provable privacy guarantees. In this study, with the consideration of the perceptual similarity, we propose perceptual indistinguishability (PI) as a formal privacy notion particularly for images. We also propose PI-Net, a privacy-preserving mechanism that achieves image obfuscation with PI guarantee. Our study shows that PI-Net achieves significantly better privacy utility trade-off through public image data."}}

One may use differentially private generative models to generate synthetic data. Unfortunately, generators are typically restricted to generating images of low-resolutions due to the limitation of noisy gradients. Here, we propose DPGEN, a network model designed to synthesize high-resolution natural images while satisfying differential privacy. In particular, we propose an energy-guided network trained on sanitized data to indicate the direction of the true data distribution via Langevin Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method. In contrast to the state-of-the-art methods that can process only low-resolution images (e.g., MNIST and Fashion-MNIST), DPGEN can generate differentially private synthetic images with resolutions up to $128\\times 128$ with superior visual quality and data utility.
