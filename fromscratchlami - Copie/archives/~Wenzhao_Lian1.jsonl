Nevertheless, it often requires expensive real-world data collection and manual specification of semantic keypoints for each object category and task. Additionally, coarse keypoint predictions and ignoring intermediate action sequences hinder adoption in complex manipulation tasks beyond pick-and-place. This work proposes a novel, category-level manipulation framework that leverages an object-centric, category-level representation and model-free 6 DoF motion tracking. The canonical object representation is learned solely in simulation and then used to parse a category-level, task trajectory from a single demonstration video. The demonstration is reprojected to a target trajectory\ntailored to a novel object via the canonical representation. During execution, the manipulation horizon is decomposed into longrange,\ncollision-free motion and last-inch manipulation. For the latter part, a category-level behavior cloning (CatBC) method leverages motion tracking to perform closed-loop control. CatBC follows the target trajectory, projected from the demonstration and anchored to a dynamically selected category-level coordinate frame. The frame is automatically selected along the manipulation horizon by a local attention mechanism. This framework allows to teach different manipulation strategies by solely providing a single demonstration, without complicated manual programming. Extensive experiments demonstrate its efficacy in a range of challenging industrial tasks in highprecision assembly, which involve learning complex, long-horizon policies. The process exhibits robustness against uncertainty due\nto dynamics as well as generalization across object instances and scene configurations.

Learning how to perform this task, however, is challenging, since task-relevant grasp labels are hard to define and annotate. There is also yet no consensus on proper representations for modeling or off-the-shelf tools for performing task-relevant grasps. This work proposes a\nframework to learn task-relevant grasping for industrial objects without the need of time-consuming real-world data collection or manual annotation. To achieve this, the entire framework is trained solely in simulation, including supervised training with synthetic label generation and self-supervised, hand-object interaction. In the context of this framework, this paper proposes a novel, object-centric canonical representation at the category level, which allows establishing dense correspondence across object instances and transferring task-relevant grasps to novel instances. Extensive experiments on task-relevant grasping of densely-cluttered industrial objects are conducted in both simulation and real-world setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Specifically, we employ a linear+quadratic model and regularize the linear term with the \u21132-regularizer and the quadratic term with the trace norm regularizer. Then, we formulate the CFM optimization as a semidefinite programming problem and propose an efficient optimization procedure with Hazan's algorithm. A key advantage of CFM over existing FMs is that it can find a globally optimal solution, while FMs may get a poor locally optimal solution since the objective function of FMs is non-convex. In addition, the proposed algorithm is simple yet effective and can be implemented easily. Finally, CFM is a general factorization method and can also be used for other factorization problems, including multi-view matrix factorization and tensor completion problems, in various domains including toxicogenomics and bioinformatics. Through synthetic and traditionally used movielens datasets, we first show that the proposed CFM achieves results competitive to FMs. We then show in a toxicogenomics prediction task that CFM predicts the toxic outcomes of a collection of drugs better than a state-of-the-art tensor factorization method."}}

Our framework has the following distinguishing aspects: (i) a unified latent factor model for integrating information from diverse feature (ordinal, binary, real) and similarity based views, and predicting the missing data in each view, leveraging view correlations; (ii) seamless adaptation to binary/multiclass classification where data consists of multiple feature and/or similarity-based views; and (iii) an efficient, variational inference algorithm which is especially flexible in modeling the views with ordinal-valued data (by learning the cutpoints for the ordinal data), and extends naturally to streaming data settings. Our framework subsumes methods such as multiview learning and multiple kernel learning as special cases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on several real-world and benchmarks datasets."}}

It is believed that these regions may jointly constitute a ``brain state,'' relating to cognition and behavior. An infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) is proposed to model the evolution of brain states, based on electrophysiological LFP data measured at multiple brain regions. A brain state influences the spectral content of each region in the measured LFP. A new state-dependent tensor factorization is employed across brain regions, and the spectral properties of the LFPs are characterized in terms of Gaussian processes (GPs). The LFPs are modeled as a mixture of GPs, with state- and region-dependent mixture weights, and with the spectral content of the data encoded in GP spectral mixture covariance kernels. The model is able to estimate the number of brain states and the number of mixture components in the mixture of GPs. A new variational Bayesian split-merge algorithm is employed for inference. The model infers state changes as a function of external covariates in two novel electrophysiological datasets, using LFP data recorded simultaneously from multiple brain regions in mice; the results are validated and interpreted by subject-matter experts."}}
