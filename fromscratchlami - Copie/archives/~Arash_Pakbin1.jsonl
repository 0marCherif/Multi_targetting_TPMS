In healthcare settings, such covariates provide dynamic patient histories that can be used to assess health risks in realtime by tracking the hazard function. Hazard learning is thus particularly useful in healthcare analytics, and the open-source package BoXHED 1.0 provides the first implementation of a gradient boosted hazard estimator that is fully nonparametric. This paper introduces BoXHED 2.0, a quantum leap over BoXHED 1.0 in several ways. Crucially, BoXHED 2.0 can deal with survival data that goes far beyond right-censoring and it also supports recurring events. To our knowledge, this is the only nonparametric machine learning implementation that is able to do so. Another major improvement is that BoXHED 2.0 is orders of magnitude more scalable, due in part to a novel data preprocessing step that sidesteps the need for explicit quadrature when dealing with time-dependent covariates. BoXHED 2.0 supports the use of GPUs and multicore CPUs, and is available from GitHub: www.github.com/BoXHED."}}

One of the most exciting applications of EHR data is in developing a real-time mortality warning system with tools from survival analysis. However, most of the survival analysis methods used recently are based on (semi)parametric models using static covariates. These models do not take advantage of the information conveyed by the time-varying EHR data. In this work we present an application of a highly scalable survival analysis method, BoXHED 2.0 [1], to develop a real-time in-ICU mortality warning indicator based on the MIMIC IV data set [2]. Importantly, BoXHED can incorporate time-dependent covariates in a fully nonparametric manner and is backed by theory [3]. Our in-ICU mortality model achieves an AUC-PRC of 0.41 and AUC-ROC of 0.83 out of sample, demonstrating the benefit of real-time monitoring."}}

We develop a context-aware mixture of deep models termed the {\\alpha}-\\b{eta} network coupled with uncertainty quantification (UQ) based upon maximum entropy to enhance human activity recognition performance. We improve accuracy and F score by 10% by identifying high-level contexts in a data-driven way to guide model development. In order to ensure training stability, we have used a clustering-based pre-training in both public and in-house datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy through unknown context discovery."}}

Survival analysis, in particular hazard estimation, is well-suited to analyzing this stream of data to predict disease onset as a function of the time-varying vitals. This paper introduces the software package BoXHED (pronounced 'box-head') for nonparametrically estimating hazard functions via gradient boosting. BoXHED 1.0 is a novel tree-based implementation of the generic estimator proposed in Lee, Chen, Ishwaran (2017), which was designed for handling time-dependent covariates in a fully nonparametric manner. BoXHED is also the first publicly available software implementation for Lee, Chen, Ishwaran (2017). Applying BoXHED to cardiovascular disease onset data from the Framingham Heart Study reveals novel interaction effects among known risk factors, potentially resolving an open question in clinical literature."}}

However, they require both raw data and annotations to train their respective signal processing algorithms. Collecting these annotations is often burdensome for the users. Our proposed methodology leverages the notion of location from nearable sensors in Internet of Things (IoT) platforms and learns users' patterns of behavior without any prior knowledge. It also requests users for annotations and labels only when the algorithms are unable to automatically annotate the data. We validate our proposed approach in the context of diet monitoring, a significant application that often requires considerable user compliance. Our approach improves eating detection accuracy by 2.4% with requested annotations restricted to 20 per day."}}

Machine learning models on electronic health record data can help identify these cases, providing more information about short and long-term risks to clinicians at the time of ICU discharge. While time-to-event techniques have been used in clinical care, models that identify risks over time using higher-dimensional, non-linear machine learning models need to be developed to present changes in risk with non-linear techniques. This work identifies risks of ICU readmissions at 24 hours, 72 hours, 7 days, 30 days, and bounceback readmissions in the same hospital admission with an AUROC for 72 hours of 0.76 and for bounceback of 0.84."}}
