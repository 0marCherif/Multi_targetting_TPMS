In contrast to rule-based game environments with well-defined reward functions, complex real-world robotic applications, such as contact-rich manipulation, lack explicit and informative descriptions that can directly be used as a reward. Previous effort has shown that it is possible to algorithmically extract dense rewards directly from multimodal observations. In this paper, we aim to extend this effort by proposing a more efficient and robust way of sampling and learning. In particular, our sampling approach utilizes temporal variance to simulate the fluctuating state and action distribution of a manipulation task. We then proposed a network architecture for self-supervised learning to better incorporate temporal information in latent representations. We tested our approach in two experimental setups, namely joint-assembly and door-opening. Preliminary results show that our approach is effective and efficient in learning dense rewards, and the learned rewards lead to faster convergence than baselines."}}

Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can improve observability, for example of algal bloom regions, ocean acidification, and ocean circulation. This AUV paradigm, however, requires robust operation that is cost effective and responsive to the environment. To achieve low cost we generate operational sequences automatically from science goals, and achieve robustness by reasoning about the discrete and continuous effects of actions.\r\n\r\nWe introduce Kongming2, a generative planner for hybrid systems with temporally extended goals (TEGs) and temporally flexible actions. It takes as input high-level goals and outputs trajectories and actions of the hybrid system, for example an AUV. Kongming2 makes two major extensions to Kongming1: planning for TEGs, and planning with temporally flexible actions. We demonstrated a proof of concept of the planner in the Atlantic ocean on Odyssey IV, an AUV designed and built by the MIT AUV Lab at Sea Grant."}}
