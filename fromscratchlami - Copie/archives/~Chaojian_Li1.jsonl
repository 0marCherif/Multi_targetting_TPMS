Specifically, ViT multi-head attention layers make it possible to embed information globally across the overall image. Nevertheless, computing and storing such attention matrices incurs a quadratic cost dependency on the number of patches, limiting its achievable efficiency and scalability and prohibiting more extensive real-world ViT applications on resource-constrained devices. Sparse attention has been shown to be a promising direction for improving hardware acceleration efficiency for NLP models. However, a systematic counterpart approach is still missing for accelerating ViT models. To close the above gap, we propose a first-of-its-kind algorithm-hardware codesigned framework, dubbed ViTALiTy, for boosting the inference efficiency of ViTs. Unlike sparsity-based Transformer accelerators for NLP, ViTALiTy unifies both low-rank and sparse components of the attention in ViTs. At the algorithm level, we approximate the dot-product softmax operation via first-order Taylor attention with row-mean centering as the low-rank component to linearize the cost of attention blocks and further boost the accuracy by incorporating a sparsity-based regularization. At the hardware level, we develop a dedicated accelerator to better leverage the resulting workload and pipeline from ViTALiTy's linear Taylor attention which requires the execution of only the low-rank component, to further boost the hardware efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that ViTALiTy offers boosted end-to-end efficiency (e.g., 3\u00d7 faster and 3\u00d7 energy-efficient) under comparable accuracy, with respect to the state-of-the-art solution."}}

However, applying NAS to a new computer vision task still requires a huge amount of effort. This is because 1) previous NAS research has been over-prioritized on image classification while largely ignoring other tasks; 2) many NAS works focus on optimizing task-specific components that cannot be favorably transferred to other tasks; and 3) existing NAS methods are typically designed to be \"proxyless\" and require significant effort to be integrated with each new task's training pipelines. To tackle these challenges, we propose FBNetV5, a NAS framework that can search for neural architectures for a variety of vision tasks with much reduced computational cost and human effort. Specifically, we design 1) a search space that is simple yet inclusive and transferable; 2) a multitask search process that is disentangled with target tasks' training pipeline; and 3) an algorithm to simultaneously search for architectures for multiple tasks with a computational cost agnostic to the number of tasks. We evaluate the proposed FBNetV5 targeting three fundamental vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Models searched by FBNetV5 in a single run of search have outperformed the previous stateof-the-art in all the three tasks: image classification (e.g., +1.3% ImageNet top-1 accuracy under the same FLOPs as compared to FBNetV3), semantic segmentation (e.g., +1.8% higher ADE20K val. mIoU than SegFormer with 3.6x fewer FLOPs), and object detection (e.g., +1.1% COCO val.

However, their sheer number of node features and large adjacency matrix limit their deployment into real-world applications, as they impose the following challenges: (1) prohibitive inference cost, especially for resource-constrained applications and (2) low trainability of deep GCNs. To this end, we aim to develop low-cost GCNs with improved trainability, as inspired by recent findings in deep neural network optimization which show that not all data/(model components) are equally important. Specifically, we propose a Data-Dependent GCN framework dubbed D$^2$-GCN which integrates data-dependent dynamic skipping at multiple granularities: (1) node-wise skipping to bypass aggregating features of unimportant neighbor nodes and their corresponding combinations; (2) edge-wise skipping to prune the unimportant edge connections of each node; and (3) bit-wise skipping to dynamically adapt the bit-precision of both the node features and weights. Our D$^2$-GCN is achieved by identifying the importance of node features via a low-cost indicator, and thus is simple and generally applicable to various graph-based learning tasks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on 6 GCN model and dataset pairs consistently validate that the proposed D$^2$-GCN can (1) largely squeeze out unnecessary costs from both the aggregation and combination phases (e.g., reduce the inference FLOPs by $\\downarrow$1.1$\\times$ $\\sim$ $\\downarrow$37.0$\\times$ and shrink the energy cost of GCN inference by $\\downarrow$1.6$\\times$ $\\sim$ $\\downarrow$8.4$\\times$), while offering a comparable or an even better accuracy (e.g., $\\downarrow$ 0.5% $\\sim$ $\\uparrow$ 5.6%); and (2) help GCNs to go deeper by boosting their trainability (e.g., providing a $\\uparrow$ 0.8% $\\sim$ $\\uparrow$ 5.1% higher accuracy when increasing the model depth from 4 layers to 64 layers) and thus achieving a comparable or even better accuracy of GCNs with more layers over SOTA techniques (e.g., a $\\downarrow$0.4% $\\sim$ $\\uparrow$38.6% higher accuracy for models with 64 layers).

Many recent works have focused on proposing new architectures to improve ViT and deploying it into real-world applications. However, little effort has been made to analyze and understand ViT\u2019s architecture design space and its implication of hardware-cost on different devices. In this work, by simply scaling ViT's depth, width, input size, and other basic configurations, we show that a scaled vanilla ViT model without bells and whistles can achieve comparable or superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off than most of the latest ViT variants. Specifically, compared to DeiT-Tiny, our scaled model achieves a $\\uparrow1.9\\%$ higher ImageNet top-1 accuracy under the same FLOPs and a $\\uparrow3.7\\%$ better ImageNet top-1 accuracy under the same latency on an NVIDIA Edge GPU TX2. Motivated by this, we further investigate the extracted scaling strategies from the following two aspects: (1) \"can these scaling strategies be transferred across different real hardware devices?''; and (2) \"can these scaling strategies be transferred to different ViT variants and tasks?''. For (1), our exploration, based on various devices with different resource budgets, indicates that the transferability effectiveness depends on the underlying device together with its corresponding deployment tool; for (2), we validate the effective transferability of the aforementioned scaling strategies obtained from a vanilla ViT model on top of an image classification task to the PiT model, a strong ViT variant targeting efficiency, as well as object detection and video classification tasks. In particular, when transferred to PiT, our scaling strategies lead to a boosted ImageNet top-1 accuracy of from $74.6\\%$ to $76.7\\%$ ($\\uparrow2.1\\%$) under the same 0.7G FLOPs; and when transferred to the COCO object detection task, the average precision is boosted by $\\uparrow0.7\\%$ under a similar throughput on a V100 GPU.

This direction becomes more promising during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person education becomes infeasible. However, as one of the most influential and practical MT paradigms, iterative machine teaching (IMT) is prohibited on IoT devices due to its inefficient and unscalable algorithms. IMT is a paradigm where a teacher feeds examples iteratively and intelligently based on the learner's status. In each iteration, current IMT algorithms greedily traverse the whole training set to find an example for the learner, which is computationally expensive in practice.  We propose a novel teaching framework, Locality Sensitive Teaching (LST), based on locality sensitive sampling, to overcome these challenges. LST has provable near-constant time complexity, which is exponentially better than the existing baseline. With at most 425.12x speedups and 99.76% energy savings over IMT, LST is the first algorithm that enables energy and time efficient machine teaching on IoT devices. Owing to LST's substantial efficiency and scalability, it is readily applicable in real-world education scenarios."}}

The prohibitive energy of DRAM accesses makes it non-trivial to deploy DNN on resource-constrained devices, calling for minimizing the weight and data movements to improve the energy efficiency. We present SmartDeal (SD), an algorithm framework to trade higher-cost memory storage/access for lower-cost computation, in order to aggressively boost the storage and energy efficiency, for both inference and training. The core of SD is a novel weight decomposition with structural constraints, carefully crafted to unleash the hardware efficiency potential. Specifically, we decompose each weight tensor as the product of a small basis matrix and a large structurally sparse coefficient matrix whose non-zeros are quantized to power-of-2. The resulting sparse and quantized DNNs enjoy greatly reduced energy for data movement and weight storage, incurring minimal overhead to recover the original weights thanks to the sparse bit-operations and cost-favorable computations. Beyond inference, we take another leap to embrace energy-efficient training, introducing innovative techniques to address the unique roadblocks arising in training while preserving the SD structures. We also design a dedicated hardware accelerator to fully utilize the SD structure to improve the real energy efficiency and latency. We conduct experiments on both multiple tasks, models and datasets in different settings. Results show that: 1) applied to inference, SD achieves up to 2.44x energy efficiency as evaluated via real hardware implementations; 2) applied to training, SD leads to 10.56x and 4.48x reduction in the storage and training energy, with negligible accuracy loss compared to state-of-the-art training baselines.

Despite its promising performance, developing optimal HW-NAS solutions can be prohibitively challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in the algorithm, micro-architecture, and device-specific compilation. First, to determine the hardware-cost to be incorporated into the NAS process, existing works mostly adopt either pre-collected hardware-cost look-up tables or device-specific hardware-cost models. The former can be time-consuming due to the required knowledge of the device\u2019s compilation method and how to set up the measurement pipeline, while building the latter is often a barrier for non-hardware experts like NAS researchers. Both of them limit the development of HW-NAS innovations and impose a barrier-to-entry to non-hardware experts. Second, similar to generic NAS, it can be notoriously difficult to benchmark HW-NAS algorithms due to their significant required computational resources and the differences in adopted search spaces, hyperparameters, and hardware devices. To this end, we develop HW-NAS-Bench, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. To design HW-NAS-Bench, we carefully collected the measured/estimated hardware performance (e.g., energy cost and latency) of all the networks in the search spaces of both NAS-Bench-201 and FBNet, on six hardware devices that fall into three categories (i.e., commercial edge devices, FPGA, and ASIC). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the collected measurements in HW-NAS-Bench to provide insights for HW-NAS research. Finally, we demonstrate exemplary user cases to (1) show that HW-NAS-Bench allows non-hardware experts to perform HW-NAS by simply querying our pre-measured dataset and (2) verify that dedicated device-specific HW-NAS can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.
