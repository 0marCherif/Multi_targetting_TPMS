We consider a Markov process-based SIS epidemic model. We call a curing policy fair if demographic groups are cured with comparable speeds. We propose a fair curing policy based on the curing policy of Drakopoulos et al. Since these optimization problems are NP-hard, finding optimal policies is intractable for large graphs. We provide approximation guarantees on both curing and fair curing policies. Moreover, when the total infection rate is large, the original curing policy includes a waiting period in which no measures are taken to mitigate the spread until the rate slows down. To avoid the waiting period, we study network design problems to reduce the total infection rate by deleting edges or reducing the weight of edges. Then the curing processes become continuous since the total infection rate is restricted by network design. We provide algorithms with provable guarantees for the considered network design problems. In summary, the proposed fair curing and network design algorithms together provide an effective, fair, and computationally efficient approach that mitigates SIS epidemic spread in networks."}}

We consider a Markov chain SIR model and its two instantiations in the deterministic SIR (D-SIR) model and the independent cascade SIR (IC-SIR) model. We investigate the problem of minimizing the number of infections by restricting contacts under realistic constraints. Under moderate assumptions on the reproduction number, we prove that the infection numbers are bounded by supermodular functions in the D-SIR model and the IC-SIR model for large classes of random networks. We propose efficient algorithms with approximation guarantees to minimize infections. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations."}}

The objective is to maximize the increase in payoff of a forecaster who exerts a binary level of effort to refine a posterior belief from a prior belief. In this framework we characterize optimal scoring rules in simple settings, give efficient algorithms for computing optimal scoring rules in complex settings, and identify simple scoring rules that are approximately optimal. In comparison, standard scoring rules in theory and practice -- for example the quadratic rule, scoring rules for the expectation, and scoring rules for multiple tasks that are averages of single-task scoring rules -- can be very far from optimal."}}

This framework is a generalization to strategic agents of the classical knapsack problem (cf. Briest, Krysta, and V\\\"ocking, 2005, Singer, 2010) and it is foundational to applying algorithmic mechanism design to the classroom. The paper identifies two simple families of scoring rules that guarantee constant approximations to the optimal scoring rule. The truncated separate scoring rule is the sum of single dimensional scoring rules that is truncated to the bounded range of feasible scores. The threshold scoring rule gives the maximum score if reports exceed a threshold and zero otherwise. Approximate optimality of one or the other of these rules is similar to the bundling or selling separately result of Babaioff, Immorlica, Lucier, and Weinberg (2014). Finally, we show that the approximate optimality of the best of those two simple scoring rules is robust when the agent's choice of effort is made sequentially."}}
