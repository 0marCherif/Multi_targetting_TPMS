This not only helps produce more reliable feature representation but also better informs users by delineating query-matched object regions. However, object classes are usually not predefined in a retrieval dataset and class label information is generally unavailable in image retrieval. This situation makes object discovery a challenging task. To address this, we propose a novel dataset-driven unsupervised object discovery framework. By utilizing deep feature representation and weakly-supervised object detection, we explore supervisory information from within an image dataset, construct class-wise object detectors, and assign multiple detectors to each image for detection. To efficiently construct object detectors for large image datasets, we propose a novel \u201cbase-detector repository\u201d and derive a fast way to generate the base detectors. In addition, the whole framework is designed to work in a self-boosting manner to iteratively refine object discovery. Compared with existing unsupervised object detection methods, our framework produces more accurate object discovery results. Different from supervised detection, we need neither manual annotation nor auxiliary datasets to train object detectors. Experimental study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the improved performance for region-based instance image retrieval."}}

To attain it, existing methods usually resort to a deep model pre-trained on benchmark datasets or even fine-tune the model with a task-dependent labelled auxiliary dataset. Although achieving promising results, this approach is restricted by two issues: 1) the domain gap between benchmark datasets and the dataset of a given retrieval task; 2) the required auxiliary dataset cannot be readily obtained. In light of this situation, this work looks into a different approach which has not been well investigated for instance image retrieval previously: {can we learn feature representation \\textit{specific to} a given retrieval task in order to achieve excellent retrieval?} Our finding is encouraging. By adding an object proposal generator to generate image regions for self-supervised learning, the investigated approach can successfully learn feature representation specific to a given dataset for retrieval. This representation can be made even more effective by boosting it with image similarity information mined from the dataset. As experimentally validated, such a simple ``self-supervised learning + self-boosting'' approach can well compete with the relevant state-of-the-art retrieval methods. Ablation study is conducted to show the appealing properties of this approach and its limitation on generalisation across datasets."}}

For retrieval without human interaction, such characteristic is usually obtained by average query expansion (AQE) or its discriminative variant (DQE) learned from pseudo-examples online, among others. In this paper, we propose a new query expansion method to further improve the above ones. The key idea is to learn a \"unique'' discriminative characteristic for each database image, in an offline manner. During retrieval, the characteristic of a query is obtained by aggregating the unique characteristics of the query-relevant images collected from an initial retrieval result. Compared with AQE which works in the original feature space, our method works in the space of the unique characteristics of database images, significantly enhancing the discriminative power of the characteristic identified for a query. Compared with DQE, our method needs neither pseudo-labeled negatives nor the online learning process, leading to more efficient retrieval and even better performance. The experimental study conducted on seven benchmark datasets verifies the considerable improvement achieved by the proposed method, and also demonstrates its application to the state-of-the-art diffusion-based image retrieval."}}
