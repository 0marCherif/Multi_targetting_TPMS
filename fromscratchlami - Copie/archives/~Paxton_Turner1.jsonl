Using Sinkhorn's theorem, we show that the signal captured by the $\\chi^2$-test may be a modeling artifact, and it may disappear once we replace the Erd\u00f6s-Renyi model by a broader network model.  We show that the recent SgnQ test is more appropriate for such a setting. The test is optimal in detecting communities with sizes comparable to the whole network, but has never been studied for our setting, which is substantially different and more challenging.  Using a degree-corrected block model (DCBM), we establish phase transitions of this testing problem concerning the size of the small community and the edge densities in small and large communities.  When the size of the small community is larger than $\\sqrt{n}$, the SgnQ test is optimal  for it attains the computational lower bound (CLB), the information lower bound for methods allowing polynomial computation time. When the size of the small community is smaller than $\\sqrt{n}$, we establish the parameter regime where the SgnQ test has full power and make some conjectures of the CLB. We also study the classical information lower bound (LB) and show that there is always a gap between the CLB and LB in our range of interest. \t"}}

Two rational polygons P and Q are said to be discretely equidecomposable if there exists a piecewise affine-unimodular bijection (equivalently, a piecewise affine-linear bijection that preserves the integer lattice $${\\mathbb {Z}}^2$$ Z 2 ) from P to Q. We develop an invariant for a particular version of this notion called rational finite discrete equidecomposability. We construct triangles that are Ehrhart equivalent but not rationally finitely discretely equidecomposable, thus providing a partial negative answer to a question of Haase\u2013McAllister on whether Ehrhart equivalence implies discrete equidecomposability. Surprisingly, if we delete an edge from each of these triangles, there exists an infinite rational discrete equidecomposability relation between them. Our final section addresses the topic of infinite equidecomposability with concrete examples and a potential setting for further investigation of this phenomenon."}}

This relaxation effectively reformulates an optimization problem over the Boolean hypercube into one over the space of correlation matrices. We show that Gaussian discrepancy is a tighter relaxation than the previously studied vector and spherical discrepancy problems, and we construct a fast online algorithm that achieves a version of the Banaszczyk bound for Gaussian discrepancy. This work also raises new questions such as the Koml\\'{o}s conjecture for Gaussian discrepancy, which may shed light on classical discrepancy problems."}}
