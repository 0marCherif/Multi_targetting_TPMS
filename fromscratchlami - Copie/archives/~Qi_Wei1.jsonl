The motion is modeled by a newly proposed component, motion guider, which plays the role of both learner and teacher. Specifically, it learns the temporal features from real data and guides the generator to predict future frames. The spatial consistency in video is modeled by an adaptive filtering network. To further ensure the spatio-temporal consistency of the prediction, a discriminator is also adopted to distinguish the real and generated frames. Further, the discriminator leaks information to the motion guider and the generator to help the learning of motion. The proposed LMVP can effectively learn the static and temporal features in videos without the need for human labeling. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that LMVP can yield state-of-the-art results."}}

The ADMM updates consist of a proximity operator, a least squares regression that includes a big matrix inversion, and an explicit solution for updating the dual variables. Typically, inner loops are required to solve the first two sub-minimization problems due to the intractability of the prior and the matrix inversion. To avoid such drawbacks or limitations, we propose an inner-loop free update rule with two pre-trained deep convolutional architectures. More specifically, we learn a conditional denoising auto-encoder which imposes an implicit data-dependent prior/regularization on ground-truth in the first sub-minimization problem. This design follows an empirical Bayesian strategy, leading to so-called amortized inference. For matrix inversion in the second sub-problem, we learn a convolutional neural network to approximate the matrix inversion, i.e., the inverse mapping is learned by feeding the input through the learned forward network. Note that training this neural network does not require ground-truth or measurements, i.e., data-independent. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method compared with the conventional ADMM solution using inner loops for solving inverse problems."}}
