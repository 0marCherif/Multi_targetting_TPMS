However, these methods struggle to precisely locate the point of interest in the image, i.e, the anomaly. This limitation is due to the difficulty of fine-grained prediction at the pixel level. To address this issue, we build upon the recent ObsNet approach by providing object instance knowledge to the observer. We extend ObsNet by harnessing an instance-wise mask prediction. We use an additional, class agnostic, object detector to filter and aggregate observer predictions. Finally, we predict an unique anomaly score for each instance in the image. We show that our proposed method accurately disentangles in-distribution objects from OOD objects on three datasets."}}

Only this final state of the weights is typically kept for testing, while the wealth of information on the geometry of the weight space, accumulated over the descent towards the minimum is discarded. In this work we propose to make use of this knowledge and leverage it for computing the distributions of the weights of the DNN. This can be further used for estimating the epistemic uncertainty of the DNN by aggregating predictions from an ensemble of networks sampled from these distributions. To this end we introduce a method for tracking the trajectory of the weights during optimization, that does neither require any change in the architecture, nor in the training procedure. We evaluate our method, TRADI, on standard classification and regression benchmarks, and on out-of-distribution detection for classification and semantic segmentation. We achieve competitive results, while preserving computational efficiency in comparison to ensemble approaches."}}

Recently proposed Deterministic Uncertainty Methods (DUM) can only partially meet such requirements as their scalability to complex computer vision tasks is not obvious. In this work we advance a scalable and effective DUM for high-resolution semantic segmentation, that relaxes the Lipschitz constraint typically hindering practicality of such architectures. We learn a discriminant latent space by leveraging a distinction maximization layer over an arbitrarily-sized set of trainable prototypes.

However, hardware limitations of real-world systems constrain to smaller ensembles and lower-capacity networks, significantly deteriorating their performance and properties. We introduce Packed-Ensembles (PE), a strategy to design and train lightweight structured ensembles by carefully modulating the dimension of their encoding space. We leverage grouped convolutions to parallelize the ensemble into a single shared backbone and forward pass to improve training and inference speeds. PE is designed to operate within the memory limits of a standard neural network. Our extensive research indicates that PE accurately preserves the properties of DE, such as diversity, and performs equally well in terms of accuracy, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and robustness to distribution shift.

Online prediction of these BEV maps involves non-trivial operations such as multi-camera data extraction as well as fusion and projection into a common topview grid. This is usually done with error-prone geometric operations (e.g., homography or back-projection from monocular depth estimation) or expensive direct dense mapping between image pixels and pixels in BEV (e.g., with MLP or attention). In this work, we present \u2018LaRa\u2019, an efficient encoder-decoder, transformer-based model for vehicle semantic segmentation from multiple cameras. Our approach uses a system of cross-attention to aggregate information over multiple sensors into a compact, yet rich, collection of latent representations. These latent representations, after being processed by a series of selfattention blocks, are then reprojected with a second cross-attention in the BEV space. We demonstrate that our model outperforms the best previous works using transformers on nuScenes. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/valeoai/LaRa.\n"}}

However, disentangling the different types and sources of uncertainty is non trivial in most datasets, especially since there is no ground truth for uncertainty. In addition, different degrees of weather conditions can disrupt neural networks, resulting in inconsistent training data quality. Thus, we introduce the MUAD dataset (Multiple Uncertainties for Autonomous Driving), consisting of 8,500 realistic synthetic images with diverse adverse weather conditions (night, fog, rain, snow), out-of-distribution objects and annotations for semantic segmentation, depth estimation, object and instance detection. MUAD allows to better assess the impact of different sources of uncertainty on model performance. We propose a study that shows the importance of having reliable Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in multiple experiments, and will release our dataset to allow researchers to benchmark their algorithm methodically in ad-verse conditions.

A solution to this would be to eliminate shadow regions from the images before the processing of the perception system. Yet, training such a solution requires pairs of aligned shadowed and non-shadowed images which are difficult to obtain. We introduce a novel weakly supervised shadow removal framework UnShadowNet trained using contrastive learning. It comprises of a DeShadower network responsible for removal of the extracted shadow under the guidance of an Illumination network which is trained adversarially by the illumination critic and a Refinement network to further remove artifacts. We show that UnShadowNet can also be easily extended to a fully-supervised setup to exploit the ground-truth when available. UnShadowNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on three publicly available shadow datasets (ISTD, adjusted ISTD, SRD) in both the weakly and fully supervised setups."}}

We present a novel approach based on tree search and graph machine learning for the scheduling problem known as Disjunctive Temporal Networks with Uncertainty (DTNU). Dynamic Controllability (DC) of DTNUs seeks a reactive scheduling strategy to satisfy temporal constraints in response to uncontrollable action durations. We introduce new semantics for reactive scheduling: Time-based Dynamic Controllability (TDC) and a restricted subset of TDC, R-TDC. We design a tree search algorithm to determine whether or not a DTNU is R-TDC. Moreover, we leverage a graph neural network as a heuristic for tree search guidance. Finally, we conduct experiments on a known benchmark on which we show R-TDC to retain significant completeness with regard to DC, while being faster to prove. This results in the tree search processing fifty percent more DTNU problems in R-TDC than the state-of-the-art DC solver does in DC with the same time budget. We also observe that graph neural network search guidance leads to substantial performance gains on benchmarks of more complex DTNUs, with up to eleven times more problems solved than the baseline tree search."}}

Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a novel method for cross-modal unsupervised learning of semantic image segmentation by leveraging synchronized LiDAR and image data. The key ingredient of our method is the use of an object proposal module that analyzes the LiDAR point cloud to obtain proposals for spatially consistent objects. Second, we show that these 3D object proposals can be aligned with the input images and reliably clustered into semantically meaningful pseudo-classes. Finally, we develop a cross-modal distillation approach that leverages image data partially annotated with the resulting pseudo-classes to train a transformer-based model for image semantic segmentation. We show the generalization capabilities of our method by testing on four different testing datasets (Cityscapes, Dark Zurich, Nighttime Driving and ACDC) without any finetuning, and demonstrate significant improvements compared to the current state of the art on this problem.

In this work, we argue that image token masking differs from token masking in text, due to the amount and correlation of tokens in an image. In particular, to generate a challenging pretext task for MIM, we advocate a shift from random masking to informed masking. We develop and exhibit this idea in the context of distillation-based MIM, where a teacher transformer encoder generates an attention map, which we use to guide masking for the student. We thus introduce a novel masking strategy, called attention-guided masking (AttMask), and we demonstrate its effectiveness over random masking for dense distillation-based MIM as well as plain distillation-based self-supervised learning on classification tokens. We confirm that AttMask accelerates the learning process and improves the performance on a variety of downstream tasks. We provide the implementation code at https://github.com/gkakogeorgiou/attmask."}}
