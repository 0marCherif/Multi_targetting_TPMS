Recent methods formulate such task as a supervised- learning problem. But it often suffers from limited realistic ground truth. In this paper, a compact network, embedded with cost volume, residual encoder and deconvolutional decoder, is presented to regress optical flow in an end-to-end manner. To overcome the lack of flow labels, we propose a novel data-driven strategy called masked label learning, where a large amount of masked labels are generated from the FlowNet 2.0 model and filtered by warping calibration for model training. We also present an extended-Huber loss to handle large displacements. With pretraining on massive masked flow data, followed by finetuning on a small number of sparse labels, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on KITTI flow benchmark."}}

However, existing deep learning methods always overfit to specific domains. In this paper, focus on domain adaptation problem of disparity estimation, we present a novel training strategy to conduct synthetic-realistic collaborative learning. At first, we design a compact model that consists of shallow feature extractor, correlation feature aggregator and disparity encoder-decoder. Our model enables end-to-end disparity regression with fast speed and high accuracy. To perform collaborative learning, we then propose two distinct training schemes, including guided label distillation and semi-supervised regularization, both of which are used to alleviate the lack of disparity labels in realistic datasets. Finally, we evaluate the trained models on different datasets that belong to various domains. Comparative results demonstrate the capability of our designed model and the effectiveness of collaborative training strategy."}}

However, with the limited stereo data available in the existing datasets and unstable ranging precision of current stereo methods, industry-level stereo matching in autonomous driving remains challenging. In this paper, we construct a novel large-scale stereo dataset named DrivingStereo. It contains over 180k images covering a diverse set of driving scenarios, which is hundreds of times larger than the KITTI Stereo dataset. High-quality labels of disparity are produced by a model-guided filtering strategy from multi-frame LiDAR points. For better evaluations, we present two new metrics for stereo matching in the driving scenes, i.e. a distance-aware metric and a semantic-aware metric. Extensive experiments show that compared with the models trained on FlyingThings3D or Cityscapes, the models trained on our DrivingStereo achieve higher generalization accuracy in real-world driving scenes, while the proposed metrics better evaluate the stereo methods on all-range distances and across different classes. Our dataset and code are available at https://drivingstereo-dataset.github.io."}}

Traditional algorithms may fail on featureless regions, which could be handled by high-level clues such as semantic segments. In this paper, we suggest that appropriate incorporation of semantic cues can greatly rectify prediction in commonly-used disparity estimation frameworks. Our method conducts semantic feature embedding and regularizes semantic cues as the loss term to improve learning disparity. Our unified model SegStereo employs semantic features from segmentation and introduces semantic softmax loss, which helps improve the prediction accuracy of disparity maps. The semantic cues work well in both unsupervised and supervised manners. SegStereo achieves state-of-the-art results on KITTI Stereo benchmark and produces decent prediction on both CityScapes and FlyingThings3D datasets."}}
