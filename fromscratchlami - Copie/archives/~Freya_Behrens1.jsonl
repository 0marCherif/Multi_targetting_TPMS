Nodes in the graph are partitioned into two non-empty groups. In the assortative partition every node requires at least $H$ of their neighbors to be in their own group. In the disassortative partition they require less than $H$ neighbors to be in their own group. Using the cavity method based on analysis of the Belief Propagation algorithm we establish for which combinations of parameters $(d,H)$ these partitions exist with high probability and for which they do not. For $H>\\lceil \\frac{d}{2} \\rceil $ we establish that the structure of solutions to the assortative partition problems corresponds to the so-called frozen-1RSB. This entails a conjecture of algorithmic hardness of finding these partitions efficiently. For $H \\le \\lceil \\frac{d}{2} \\rceil $ we argue that the assortative partition problem is algorithmically easy on average for all $d$. Further we provide arguments about asymptotic equivalence between the assortative partition problem and the disassortative one, going trough a close relation to the problem of single-spin-flip-stable states in spin glasses. In the context of spin glasses, our results on algorithmic hardness imply a conjecture that gapped single spin flip stable states are hard to find which may be a universal reason behind the observation that physical dynamics in glassy systems display convergence to marginal stability."}}

A prime example is learned ISTA (LISTA) where weights, step sizes and thresholds are learned from training data. Recently, Analytic LISTA (ALISTA) has been introduced, combining the strong empirical performance of a fully learned approach like LISTA, while retaining theoretical guarantees of classical compressed sensing algorithms and significantly reducing the number of parameters to learn. However, these parameters are trained to work in expectation, often leading to suboptimal reconstruction of individual targets. In this work we therefore introduce Neurally Augmented ALISTA, in which an LSTM network is used to compute step sizes and thresholds individually for each target vector during reconstruction. This adaptive approach is theoretically motivated by revisiting the recovery guarantees of ALISTA. We show that our approach further improves empirical performance in sparse reconstruction, in particular outperforming existing algorithms by an increasing margin as the compression ratio becomes more challenging."}}

Explearn leverages Gaussian Processes (GP)-based contextual bandits. This brings two key benefits. First, GPs naturally capture different kinds of explanations and enable the system designer to control how explanations generalize across the space by virtue of choosing a suitable kernel. Second, Explearn builds on recent results in contextual bandits which guarantee convergence with high probability. Our initial experiments hint at the promise of the approach."}}

At its core, MetaExp presents a small set of meta-paths to the user, which are sequences of relationships among node types. Such meta-paths do not overwhelm the user with complex structures, yet they preserve semantically-rich relationships in a graph. MetaExp engages the user in an interactive procedure, which involves simple meta-paths evaluations to infer a user-specific similarity measure. This similarity measure incorporates the domain knowledge and the preferences of the user, overcoming the fundamental limitations of previous methods based on local node neighborhoods or statically determined similarity scores. Our system provides a user-friendly interface for searching initial nodes and guides the user towards progressive refinements of the meta-paths. The system is demonstrated on three datasets, Freebase, a movie database, and a biological network."}}
