To cleanly capture the set of neural architectures to which our method applies, we introduce the concept of a differential neural computational machine (\u2202NCM) and show that several existing architectures (e.g., NTMs, NRAMs) can be instantiated as a \u2202NCM and can thus benefit from any amount of additional supervision over their interpretable components. Based on our method, we performed a detailed experimental evaluation with both, the NTM and NRAM architectures, and showed that the approach leads to significantly better convergence and generalization capabilities of the learning phase than when training using only input-output examples.\n"}}
