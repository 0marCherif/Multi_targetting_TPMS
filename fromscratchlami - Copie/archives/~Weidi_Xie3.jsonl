Existing learning-based VFI methods have achieved great success, but they still suffer from limited generalization ability due to the limited motion distribution of training datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based VFI method that can adapt to unseen motions at test time. Our method is based on a cycle-consistency adaptation strategy that leverages the motion characteristics among video frames. We also introduce a lightweight adapter that can be inserted into the motion estimation module of existing pre-trained VFI models to improve the efficiency of adaptation. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can boost the performance of two-frame VFI models, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art methods, even those that use extra input."}}

For movies, this presents notable challenges -- AD must occur only during existing pauses in dialogue, should refer to characters by name, and ought to aid understanding of the storyline as a whole. To this end, we develop a new model for automatically generating movie AD, given CLIP visual features of the frames, the cast list, and the temporal locations of the speech; addressing all three of the `who', `when', and `what' questions: (i) who -- we introduce a character bank consisting of the character's name, the actor that played the part, and a CLIP feature of their face, for the principal cast of each movie, and demonstrate how this can be used to improve naming in the generated AD; (ii) when -- we investigate several models for determining whether an AD should be generated for a time interval or not, based on the visual content of the interval and its neighbours; and (iii) what -- we implement a new vision-language model for this task, that can ingest the proposals from the character bank, whilst conditioning on the visual features using cross-attention, and demonstrate how this improves over previous architectures for AD text generation in an apples-to-apples comparison."}}

Generating high-quality movie AD is challenging due to the dependency of the descriptions on context, and the limited amount of training data available. In this work, we leverage the power of pretrained foundation models, such as GPT and CLIP, and only train a mapping net- work that bridges the two models for visually-conditioned text generation. In order to obtain high-quality AD, we make the following four contributions: (i) we incorporate context from the movie clip, AD from previous clips, as well as the subtitles of the current shot; (ii) we address the lack of training data by pretraining on large scale datasets, where visual or contextual information are unavailable, e.g. text-only AD without movies or visual captioning datasets with- out context; (iii) we improve on the currently available AD datasets, by removing label noise in the MAD dataset, and adding character naming information; and (iv) we obtain strong results on the movie AD task compared with previous methods."}}

Ironically, object detection for drones has always been conducted in the 2D image space, which fundamentally limits their ability to understand 3D scenes. Furthermore, existing 3D object detection methods developed for autonomous driving cannot be directly applied to drones due to the lack of deformation modeling, which is essential for the distant aerial perspective with sensitive distortion and small objects. To fill the gap, this work proposes a dual-view detection system named <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DVDET</b> to achieve aerial monocular object detection in both the 2D image space and the 3D physical space. To address the severe view deformation issue, we propose a novel trainable geo-deformable transformation module that can properly warp information from the drone's perspective to the birds' eye view (BEV). Compared to the monocular methods for cars, our transformation includes a learnable deformable network for explicitly revising the severe deviation. To address the dataset challenge, we propose a new large-scale simulation dataset named AM3D-Sim, and a new real-world aerial dataset named AM3D-Real with high-quality annotations for 3D object detection. Extensive experiments show that i) aerial monocular 3D object detection is feasible; ii) the model pre-trained on the simulation dataset helps real-world performance; and iii) DVDET also helps monocular 3D object detection for cars. To encourage more researchers to investigate this area, we released the dataset and related code."}}

To achieve this goal, we make the following contributions: (i) we start with a naive two-stage approach for open-vocabulary object detection and attribute classification, termed CLIP-Attr. The candidate objects are first proposed with an offline RPN and later classified for semantic category and attributes; (ii) we combine all available datasets and train with a federated strategy to finetune the CLIP model, aligning the visual representation with attributes, additionally, we investigate the efficacy of leveraging freely available online image-caption pairs under weakly supervised learning; (iii) in pursuit of efficiency, we train a Faster-RCNN type model end-to-end with knowledge distillation, that performs class-agnostic object proposals and classification on semantic categories and attributes with classifiers generated from a text encoder; Finally, (iv) we conduct extensive experiments on VAW, MS-COCO, LSA, and OVAD datasets, and show that recognition of semantic category and attributes is complementary for visual scene understanding, i.e., jointly training object detection and attributes prediction largely outperform existing approaches that treat the two tasks independently, demonstrating strong generalization ability to novel attributes and categories."}}

First, we introduce the novel task of Open-Vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation, which aims to simultaneously segment, track, and classify objects in videos from open-set categories, including novel categories unseen during training. Second, to benchmark Open-Vocabulary VIS, we collect a Large-Vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation dataset (LV-VIS), that contains well-annotated objects from 1,196 diverse categories, significantly surpassing the category size of existing datasets by more than one order of magnitude. Third, we propose an efficient Memory-Induced Transformer architecture, OV2Seg, to first achieve Open-Vocabulary VIS in an end-to-end manner with near real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments on LV-VIS and four existing VIS datasets demonstrate the strong zero-shot generalization ability of OV2Seg on novel categories.

In particular, we make the following contributions: First, to explicitly incorporate experts' knowledge, we propose to learn a neural representation for the medical knowledge graph via contrastive learning, implicitly establishing relations between different medical concepts. Second, while training the visual encoder, we keep the parameters of the knowledge encoder frozen and propose to learn a set of prompt vectors for efficient adaptation. Third, we adopt a Transformer-based disease-query module for cross-model fusion, which naturally enables explainable diagnosis results via cross attention. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conduct thorough experiments on three x-ray imaging datasets across different anatomy structures, showing our model is able to exploit the implicit relations between diseases/findings, thus is beneficial to the commonly encountered problem in the medical domain, namely, long-tailed and zero-shot recognition, which conventional methods either struggle or completely fail to realize."}}
