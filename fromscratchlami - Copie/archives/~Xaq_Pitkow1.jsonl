In machine learning, attention usually means a multiplicative mechanism whereby the weights in a weighted summation of an input vector are calculated from the input itself or some other context vector. In both scenarios, attention can be conceptualized as a gating mechanism. In this paper, we argue that three-way interactions serve as a normative way to define a gating mechanism in generative probabilistic graphical models. By going a step beyond pairwise interactions, it empowers much more computational efficiency, like a transistor expands possible digital computations. Models with three-way interactions are also easier to scale up and thus to implement biologically. As an example application, we show that a graphical model with three-way interactions provides a normative explanation for divisive normalization in macaque primary visual cortex, an operation adopted widely throughout the cortex to reduce redundancy, save energy, and improve computation."}}

While graph neural networks provide a useful relational inductive bias for modeling such systems, generalization to new system instances of the same type is less studied. In this work we trained graph neural networks to fit time series from an example nonlinear dynamical system, the belief propagation algorithm. We found simple interpretations of the learned representation and model components, and they are consistent with core properties of the probabilistic inference algorithm. We successfully identified a 'graph translator' between the statistical attributes in belief propagation and parameters of the corresponding trained network, and showed that it enables two types of novel generalization: to recover the underlying structure of a new system instance based solely on time series observations, and to construct a new network from this structure directly. Our results demonstrated a path towards understanding both dynamics and structure of a complex system and how such understanding can be used for generalization."}}

Inference about the world's latent variables is thus an important computation for the brain. However, computational constraints limit the performance of these computations. These constraints include energetic costs for neural activity and noise on every channel. Efficient coding is one prominent theory that describes how such limited resources can best be used. In one incarnation, this leads to a theory of predictive coding, where predictions are subtracted from signals, reducing the cost of sending something that is already known. This theory does not, however, account for the costs or noise associated with those predictions. Here we offer a theory that accounts for both feedforward and feedback costs, and noise in all computations. We formulate this inference problem as message-passing on a graph whereby feedback serves as an internal control signal aiming to maximize how well an inference tracks a target state while minimizing the costs of computation. We apply this novel formulation of inference as control to the canonical problem of inferring the hidden scalar state of a linear dynamical system with Gaussian variability. The best solution depends on architectural constraints, such as Dale's law, the ubiquitous law that each neuron makes solely excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic connections. This biological structure can create asymmetric costs for feedforward and feedback channels. Under such conditions, our theory predicts the gain of optimal predictive feedback and how it is incorporated into the inference computation. We show that there is a non-monotonic dependence of optimal feedback gain as a function of both the computational parameters and the world dynamics, leading to phase transitions in whether feedback provides any utility in optimal inference under computational constraints."}}

Sampling methods excel at approximating arbitrary probability distributions, but can be inefficient. VI methods are efficient, but may misrepresent the true distribution. Here, we develop a general framework where approximations are stochastic mixtures of simple component distributions. Both sampling and VI can be seen as special cases: in sampling, each mixture component is a delta-function and is chosen stochastically, while in standard VI a single component is chosen to minimize divergence. We derive a practical method that interpolates between sampling and VI by analytically solving an optimization problem over a mixing distribution. Intermediate inference methods then arise by varying a single parameter. Our method provably improves on sampling (reducing variance) and on VI (reducing bias+variance despite increasing variance). We demonstrate our method's bias/variance trade-off in practice on reference problems, and we compare outcomes to commonly used sampling and VI methods. This work takes a step towards a highly flexible yet simple family of inference methods that combines the complementary strengths of sampling and VI."}}

The use of attributes also facilitates learning of new concepts with zero or few examples. However, the zero-shot learning paradigm assumes that the set of attributes are known and fixed, which is a limitation if a test-time task depends on a previously irrelevant attribute. In this work we study rapid learning of attributes that are previously not labeled in the dataset. Compared to standard few-shot learning of semantic classes, learning new attributes imposes a stiffer challenge. We found that directly supervising the model with a set of training attributes does not generalize well on the test attributes, whereas self-supervised pre-training brings significant improvement. We further experimented with random splits of the attribute space and found that the predictability of attributes provides an informative estimate of a model's ability to generalize."}}

Typically, the learner observes data only from a fixed number of classes at training time and is asked to generalize to a new set of classes at test time. Two examples from the same class would always be assigned the same labels in any episode. In this work, we consider a realistic setting where the relationship between examples can change from episode to episode depending on the task context, which is not given to the learner.  We define two new benchmark datasets for this flexible few-shot scenario, where the tasks are based on images of faces (Celeb-A) and shoes (Zappos50K). While classification baselines learn representations that work well for standard few-shot learning, they suffer in our flexible tasks since the classification criteria shift from training to testing. On the other hand, unsupervised contrastive representation learning with instance-based invariance objectives preserves such flexibility. A combination of instance and class invariance learning objectives is found to perform best on our new flexible few-shot learning benchmarks, and a novel variant of Prototypical Networks is proposed for selecting useful feature dimensions."}}

Short of designing new RNN architectures, previous methods for dealing with this problem usually boil down to orthogonalization of the recurrent dynamics, either at initialization or during the entire training period. The basic motivation behind these methods is that orthogonal transformations are isometries of the Euclidean space, hence they preserve (Euclidean) norms and effectively deal with vanishing/exploding gradients. However, this ignores the crucial effects of non-linearity and noise. In the presence of a non-linearity, orthogonal transformations no longer preserve norms, suggesting that alternative transformations might be better suited to non-linear networks. Moreover, in the presence of noise, norm preservation itself ceases to be the ideal objective. A more sensible objective is maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the propagated signal instead. Previous work has shown that in the linear case, recurrent networks that maximize the SNR display strongly non-normal, sequential dynamics and orthogonal networks are highly suboptimal by this measure. Motivated by this finding, here we investigate the potential of non-normal RNNs, i.e. RNNs with a non-normal recurrent connectivity matrix, in sequential processing tasks. Our experimental results show that non-normal RNNs outperform their orthogonal counterparts in a diverse range of benchmarks. We also find evidence for increased non-normality and hidden chain-like feedforward motifs in trained RNNs initialized with orthogonal recurrent connectivity matrices. "}}

A completely satisfactory explanation for their success remains elusive. Here, we present a novel explanation for the benefits of skip connections in training very deep networks. The difficulty of training deep networks is partly due to the singularities caused by the non-identifiability of the model. Several such singularities have been identified in previous works: (i) overlap singularities caused by the permutation symmetry of nodes in a given layer, (ii) elimination singularities corresponding to the elimination, i.e. consistent deactivation, of nodes, (iii) singularities generated by the linear dependence of the nodes. These singularities cause degenerate manifolds in the loss landscape that slow down learning. We argue that skip connections eliminate these singularities by breaking the permutation symmetry of nodes, by reducing the possibility of node elimination and by making the nodes less linearly dependent. Moreover, for typical initializations, skip connections move the network away from the \"ghosts\" of these singularities and sculpt the landscape around them to alleviate the learning slow-down. These hypotheses are supported by evidence from simplified models, as well as from experiments with deep networks trained on real-world datasets."}}
