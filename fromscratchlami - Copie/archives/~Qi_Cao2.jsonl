However, it has become impractical for humans to extract the data manually, as it is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Digital documents contain various components such as tables, key-value pairs and figures. Existing optical character recognition (OCR) methods can recognize texts, but it is challenging to extract the key-value pairs in unformatted digital invoices or receipts. Hence, developing an information extraction system with intelligent algorithms would be beneficial, as it can increase the workflow efficiency for knowledge discovery and data recognition. In this paper, a pipeline of the information extraction system is proposed with intelligent computing and deep learning approaches for classifying key-value pairs first, followed by linking the key-value pairs. Two key-value pairing rules are developed in the proposed pipeline. Various experiments with intelligent algorithms are conducted to evaluate the performance of the pipeline of information extraction system."}}

Even though some progress has been made, the recognition of the type of the traffic services cannot be done in real time. In this paper, we propose a novel method for classifying traffic series in real time based on transfer learning techniques. We pre-train a deep learning model with long traffic series and fine-tune the model with short traffic series. In this way, the developed model achieves the capability of recognising traffic services in real time. In other words, the model can recognize traffic services by using short traffic series. We collect Downlink Control Information (DCI) from commercial LTE networks when using five common types of traffic services. Then we use the dataset to validate our method. Our experimental results show that, by using proposed method, LSTM accuracy rates will increase to 80% and 88.5% when the length of the traffic series is 5 seconds and 10 seconds respectively, which is higher than the baseline. The strategy is also suitable for one dimension convolution neural network (1D-CNN)."}}

Currently, low-rank representation (LRR) serves as a benchmark method. However, we observe that these LRR-based methods would suffer from two issues: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">limited clustering performance</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">high computational cost</i> since (1) they usually adopt the nuclear norm with biased estimation to explore the low-rank structures; (2) the singular value decomposition of large-scale matrices is inevitably involved. Moreover, LRR may not achieve low-rank properties in both intra-views and inter-views simultaneously.

Finally, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is designed to solve the BTMSC model. Extensive experiments with ten datasets of texts and images illustrate the performance superiority of the proposed BTMSC method over state-of-the-art methods."}}

The acquisition of software engineering skills is important and crucial to prepare students for the software industry. Learning of professional software development (PSD) knowledge involves various educational approaches. This study examines the feedback in students\u2019 learning journey and preparedness for the industry across three years of the CS degree programme. The research is carried out to evaluate the current bottlenecks of learning in the PSD course. Surveys are conducted to collect feedback of 72 CS students from three different cohorts, namely freshmen, penultimate and final study year. Their sentiments are identified and analyzed using the quantitative and qualitative data gathered. Observed from the results obtained, most of the final year students have perceived attainment of favourable skills needed for the industry, after their internship experience where they applied their skillsets. A significant rise in positive sentiments from graduating students suggests that the PSD module taught is relevant and applicable for the software industry. However, the sentiments among the penultimate year students are different and show that there might be an issue with the current course delivery, which needs to be improved. In addition, this paper suggests possible improvement opportunities that could be explored by eliciting current challenges faced in the current syllabus. These include the specification variances for projects, timely introduction of topics, flexibility in marking rubrics, and introduction of in-demand practices."}}

Optimal portfolios constructed aim to have a minimal risk with highest accompanying investment returns, regardless of market conditions. This paper focuses on providing an alternative view in maximising portfolio returns using Reinforcement Learning (RL) by considering dynamic risks appropriate to market conditions through dynamic portfolio rebalancing. The proposed algorithm is able to improve portfolio management by introducing the dynamic rebalancing of portfolios with vigorous risk through an RL agent. This is done while accounting for market conditions, asset diversifications, risk and returns in the global financial market. Studies have been performed in this paper to explore four types of methods with variations in fully portfolio rebalancing and gradual portfolio rebalancing, which combine with and without the use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices for adjusting the technical indicator centring. Performances of the four methods have been evaluated and compared using three constructed financial portfolios, including one portfolio with global market index assets with different risk levels, and two portfolios with uncorrelated stock assets from different sectors and risk levels. Observed from the experiment results, the proposed RL agent for gradual portfolio rebalancing with the LSTM model on price prediction outperforms the other three methods, as well as returns of individual assets in these three portfolios. The improvements of the returns using the RL agent for gradual rebalancing with prediction model are achieved at about 27.9\u201393.4% over those of the full rebalancing without prediction model. It has demonstrated the ability to dynamically adjust portfolio compositions according to the market trends, risks and returns of the global indices and stock assets."}}

Applying recommender systems to coupon discount applications could improve consumers accessibility to coupons of their interest, leading to increased product sales related to coupons. The research aims to create a recommender system model for coupon suggestions based on customer data interactions. The proposed recommender model is a hybrid model that combines matrix factorization and association rule mining. While matrix factorization utilises customer-item interactions with customer transactions history and information as the implicit feedback, the association rule uses the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets from customer discount transactions to create the weight of each item. As a result, the proposed hybrid recommender model provides overall performance higher than the baseline models and other benchmark models. In addition, the proposed model has a precision rank increase of nearly 20% in the same dataset compared to that of the baseline models."}}

Several deep learning based motion segmentation approaches have been reported based on the interpretable optical flow feature. However, the interpretable optical flow feature has not been explored by object-level MOD approaches. In this paper, we propose a motion embedding pipeline (MEP) architecture that utilizes interpretable optical flow and deep learning to solve object-level MOD problems. The MEP is a three-stage pipeline that consists of an object detector, a novel feature extraction algorithm to capture relative motion between objects and the background, as well as a motion predictor for representation learning with stacked autoencoder to determine motions. A new dataset, Singapore motion object detection (SG-MOD) dataset is constructed in this work with much larger variations in urban environments. Experimental results show that the proposed MEP outperforms other pipeline-based architecture and deep learning based approaches on the SG-MOD and KITTI-MOD datasets in most metrics."}}
