Despite the impressive results, VLP research becomes extremely expensive with the need for massive data and a long training time, preventing further explorations. In this work, we revitalize region features of sparsely sampled video clips to significantly reduce both spatial and temporal visual redundancy towards democratizing VLP research at the same time achieving state-of-the-art results. Specifically, to fully explore the potential of region features, we introduce a novel bidirectional region-word alignment regularization that properly optimizes the fine-grained relations between regions and certain words in sentences, eliminating the domain/modality disconnections between pre-extracted region features and text. Extensive results of downstream video-language retrieval tasks on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method on both effectiveness and efficiency, e.g., our method achieves competing results with 80% fewer data and 85% less pre-training time compared to the most efficient VLP method so far."}}

BCT presents the first step towards backward-compatible model upgrades to get rid of backfilling. It is workable but leaves the new model in a dilemma between new feature discriminativeness and new-to-old compatibility due to the undifferentiated compatibility constraints. In this work, we propose Darwinian Model Upgrades (DMU), which disentangle the inheritance and variation in the model evolving with selective backward compatibility and forward adaptation, respectively. The old-to-new heritable knowledge is measured by old feature discriminativeness, and the gallery features, especially those of poor quality, are evolved in a lightweight manner to become more adaptive in the new latent space. We demonstrate the superiority of DMU through comprehensive experiments on large-scale landmark retrieval and face recognition benchmarks. DMU effectively alleviates the new-to-new degradation and improves new-to-old compatibility, rendering a more proper model upgrading paradigm in large-scale retrieval systems."}}

A pioneering work introduced backward-compatible training, where the new model can be directly deployed in a backfill-free manner, i.e., the new query can be directly compared to the old gallery features. Despite a possible solution, its improvement in sequential model upgrades is gradually limited by the fixed and under-quality old gallery embeddings. To this end, we propose a new model upgrade paradigm, termed Bidirectional Compatible Training (BiCT), which will upgrade the old gallery embeddings by forward-compatible training towards the embedding space of the backward-compatible new model. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify the prominent improvement by BiCT and interestingly observe that the inconspicuous loss weight of backward compatibility actually plays an essential role for both backward and forward retrieval performance. To summarize, we introduce a new and valuable problem named privacy-preserving model upgrades, with a proper solution BiCT. Several intriguing insights are further proposed to get the most out of our method."}}

Though progress has been made continuously in this field, some issues still need to be resolved. First, most of the existing methods rely on the combination of multiple complicated modules to solve the task. Second, due to the semantic gaps between the two different modalities, aligning the information at different granularities (local and global) between the video and the language is significant, which is less addressed. Last, previous works do not consider the inevitable annotation bias due to the ambiguities of action boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose a simple two-branch Cross-Modality Attention (CMA) module with intuitive structure design, which alternatively modulates two modalities for better matching the information both locally and globally. In addition, we introduce a new task-specific regression loss function, which improves the temporal grounding accuracy by alleviating the impact of annotation bias. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our method, and the results show that just with this simple model, it can outperform the state of the arts on both Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets."}}
