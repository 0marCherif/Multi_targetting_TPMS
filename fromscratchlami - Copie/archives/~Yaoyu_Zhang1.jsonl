Inspired by the phase diagram for two-layer ReLU NNs with infinite width (Luo et al., 2021), we make a step towards drawing a phase diagram for three-layer ReLU NNs with infinite width. First, we derive a normalized gradient flow for three-layer ReLU NNs and obtain two key independent quantities to distinguish different dynamical regimes for common initialization methods. With carefully designed experiments and a large computation cost, for both synthetic datasets and real datasets, we find that the dynamics of each layer also could be divided into a linear regime and a condensed regime, separated by a critical regime. The criteria is the relative change of input weights (the input weight of a hidden neuron consists of the weight from its input layer to the hidden neuron and its bias term) as the width approaches infinity during the training, which tends to $0$, $+\\infty$ and $O(1)$, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrate that different layers can lie in different dynamical regimes in a training process within a deep NN. In the condensed regime, we also observe the condensation of weights in isolated orientations with low complexity. Through experiments under three-layer condition, our phase diagram suggests a complicated dynamical regimes consisting of three possible regimes, together with their mixture, for deep NNs and provides a guidance for studying deep NNs in different initialization regimes, which reveals the possibility of completely different dynamics emerging within a deep NN for its different layers."}}

The condensation dynamics implies that the training implicitly regularizes a NN towards one with much smaller effective size. In this work, we illustrate the formation of the condensation in multi-layer fully connected NNs and show that the maximal number of condensed orientations in the initial training stage is twice the multiplicity of the activation function, where ``multiplicity'' indicates the multiple roots of activation function at origin. Our theoretical analysis confirms experiments for two cases, one is for the activation function of multiplicity one with arbitrary dimension input, which contains many common activation functions, and the other is for the layer with one-dimensional input and arbitrary multiplicity. This work makes a step towards understanding how small initialization leads NNs to condensation at the initial training stage."}}

In this work, we prove an embedding principle that the loss landscape of a DNN \"contains\" all the critical points of all the narrower DNNs. More precisely, we propose a critical embedding such that any critical point, e.g., local or global minima, of a narrower DNN can be embedded to a critical point/affine subspace of the target DNN with higher degeneracy and preserving the DNN output function. Note that, given any training data, differentiable loss function and differentiable activation function, this embedding structure of critical points holds.This general structure of DNNs is starkly different from other nonconvex problems such as protein-folding.Empirically, we find that a wide DNN is often attracted by highly-degenerate critical points that are embedded from narrow DNNs. The embedding principle provides a new perspective to study the general easy optimization of wide DNNs and unravels a potential implicit low-complexity regularization during the training.Overall, our work provides a skeleton for the study of loss landscape of DNNs and its implication, by which a more exact and comprehensive understanding can be anticipated in the near future.
