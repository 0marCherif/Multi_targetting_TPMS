We show that steering is impossible if the total budget (across iterations) is finite. However, with average, realized payments converging to zero, we show that steering is possible. In the full-feedback setting, that is, when players' full strategies are observed at each timestep, it is possible with constant per-iteration payments. In the bandit-feedback setting, that is, when only trajectories through the game tree are observable, steering is impossible with constant per-iteration payments but possible if we allow the maximum per-iteration payment to grow with time, while maintaining the property that average, realized payments vanish. We supplement our theoretical positive results with experiments highlighting the efficacy of steering in large, extensive-form games, and show how our framework relates to optimal mechanism design and information design."}}

This model includes both popular recreational games such as the Mafia/Werewolf family and The Resistance (Avalon) and real-world security settings, where a distributed system wants to operate while some of its nodes are controlled by adversaries. There has been little to no formal mathematical grounding of such settings in the literature, and it is not even immediately clear what the right solution concept is. In particular, the suitable notion of equilibrium depends on communication available to the players (whether players can communicate, whether they can communicate in private, and whether they can observe who is communicating), and defining it turns out to be a nontrivial task with several surprising consequences. We show that in certain cases, including the above recreational games, near-optimal equilibria can be computed efficiently. In most other cases, we show that computing an optimal equilibrium is either NP-hard or coNP-hard. Lastly, we experimentally validate our approach by computing nearly-exact equilibria for complete Avalon instances up to 6 players whose size in terms of number of information sets is larger than $10^{56}$."}}

It applies to extensive-form settings with any number of players, including mechanism design, information design, and solution concepts such as correlated, communication, and certification equilibria. We observe that optimal equilibria are minimax equilibrium strategies of a player in an extensive-form zero-sum game. This reformulation allows to apply techniques for learning in zero-sum games, yielding the first learning dynamics that converge to optimal equilibria, not only in empirical averages, but also in iterates. We demonstrate the practical scalability and flexibility of our approach by attaining state-of-the-art performance in benchmark tabular games, and by computing an optimal mechanism for a sequential auction design problem using deep reinforcement learning."}}

These games are the simplest setting with multiple players where cooperation and competition coexist, and it is known that the information asymmetry among the team members makes equilibrium approximation computationally hard. Although much effort has been spent designing scalable algorithms, the problem of solving large game instances is open. In this paper, we extend the successful approach of solving huge two-*player* zero-sum games, where a blueprint strategy is computed offline by using an abstract version of the game and then it is refined online, that is, during a playthrough. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, our paper provides the first method for online strategy refinement via subgame solving in adversarial team games. Our method, based on the team belief DAG, generates a gadget game and then refine the blueprint strategy by using column-generation approaches in anytime fashion. If the blueprint is sparse, then our whole algorithm runs end-to-end in polynomial time given a best-response oracle; in particular, it avoids expanding the whole team belief DAG, which has exponential worst-case size. We apply our method to a standard test suite, and we empirically show the performance improvement of the strategies thanks to subgame solving."}}

In our representation, at every timestep, a team coordinator observes the information that is public to all its members, and then decides on a prescription for all the possible states consistent with its observations.  Our representation unifies and extends recent approaches to team coordination. Similar to the approach of Carminati et al (2021), our team belief DAG form can be used to capture adversarial team games, and enables standard, out-of-the-box game-theoretic techniques including no-regret learning (e.g., CFR and its state-of-the-art modern variants such as DCFR and PCFR$^+$) and first-order methods. However, our representation can be exponentially smaller, and can be viewed as a lossless abstraction of theirs into a directed acyclic graph. In particular, like the LP-based algorithm of Zhang & Sandholm (2022), the size of our representation scales with the amount of information uncommon to the team; in fact, using linear programming on top of our team belief DAG form to solve for a team correlated equilibrium in an adversarial team games recovers almost exactly their algorithm. Unlike that paper, however, our representation explicitly exposes the structure of the decision space, which is what enables the aforementioned game-theoretic techniques."}}
