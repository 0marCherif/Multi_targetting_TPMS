This phenomenon is referred to as benign overfitting. Recently, a few studies have attempted to theoretically understand benign overfitting in neural networks. However, these works are either limited to neural networks with smooth activation functions or to the neural tangent kernel regime. How and when benign overfitting can occur in ReLU neural networks remains an open problem. In this work, we seek to answer this question by establishing algorithm-dependent risk bounds for learning two-layer ReLU convolutional neural networks with label-flipping noise. We show that, under mild conditions, the neural network trained by gradient descent can achieve near-zero training loss and Bayes optimal test risk. Our result also reveals a sharp transition between benign and harmful overfitting under different conditions on data distribution in terms of test risk. Experiments on synthetic data back up our theory."}}

We analyze a Perceptron-type algorithm called GLM-tron (Kakade et al., 2011) and provide its dimension-free risk upper bounds for high-dimensional ReLU regression in both well-specified and misspecified settings. Our risk bounds recover several existing results as special cases. Moreover, in the well-specified setting, we provide an instance-wise matching risk lower bound for GLM-tron. Our upper and lower risk bounds provide a sharp characterization of the high-dimensional ReLU regression problems that can be learned via GLM-tron. On the other hand, we provide some negative results for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for ReLU regression with symmetric Bernoulli data: if the model is well-specified, the excess risk of SGD is provably no better than that of GLM-tron ignoring constant factors, for each problem instance; and in the noiseless case, GLM-tron can achieve a small risk while SGD unavoidably suffers from a constant risk in expectation. These results together suggest that GLM-tron might be preferable to SGD for high-dimensional ReLU regression."}}

A Case Study", "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning is a popular machine learning paradigm that utilizes a large amount of unlabeled data as well as a small amount of labeled data to facilitate learning tasks. While semi-supervised learning has achieved great success in training neural networks, its theoretical understanding remains largely open. In this paper, we aim to theoretically understand a semi-supervised learning approach based on pre-training and linear probing. In particular, the semi-supervised learning approach we consider first trains a two-layer neural network based on the unlabeled data with the help of pseudo-labelers. Then it linearly probes the pre-trained network on a small amount of labeled data. We prove that, under a certain toy data generation model and two-layer convolutional neural network, the semisupervised learning approach can achieve nearly zero test loss, while a neural network directly trained by supervised learning on the same amount of labeled data can only achieve constant test loss. Through this case study, we demonstrate a separation between semi-supervised learning and supervised learning in terms of test loss provided the same amount of labeled data."}}

A common practice in meta-learning is to perform a train-validation split on each task, where the training set is used for adapting the model parameter to that specific task and the validation set is used for learning a prior model that is shared across all tasks. Despite its success and popularity in multitask learning and few-shot learning, the understanding of the train-validation split is still limited, especially when the neural network models are used. In this paper, we study the benefit of train-validation split for classification problems with neural network models trained by gradient descent. We prove that the train-validation split is necessary to learn a good prior model when the noise in the training sample is large, while the train-train method fails. We validate our theory by conducting experiment on both synthetic and real datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work towards the theoretical understanding of train-validation split in meta-learning with neural networks."}}
