FMs are characterized by its usage of the inner product of factorized parameters to model pairwise feature interactions, making it highly expressive and powerful. This paper proposes Holographic Factorization Machines (HFM), a new novel method of enhancing the representation capability of FMs without increasing its parameter size. Our approach replaces the inner product in FMs with holographic reduced representations (HRRs), which are theoretically motivated by associative retrieval and compressed outer products. Empirically, we found that this leads to consistent improvements over vanilla FMs by up to 4% improvement in terms of mean squared error, with improvements larger at smaller parameterization. Additionally, we propose a neural adaptation of HFM which enhances its capability to handle nonlinear structures. We conduct extensive experiments on nine publicly available datasets for collaborative filtering with explicit feedback. HFM achieves state-of-the- art performance on all nine, outperforming strong competitors such as Attentional Factorization Machines (AFM) and Neural Matrix Factorization (NeuMF)."}}

Specifically, we study the connection between metric learning in hyperbolic space and collaborative filtering by exploring M\u00f6bius gyrovector spaces where the formalism of the spaces could be utilized to generalize the most common Euclidean vector operations. Overall, this work aims to bridge the gap between Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry in recommender systems through metric learning approach. We propose HyperML (Hyperbolic Metric Learning), a conceptually simple but highly effective model for boosting the performance. Via a series of extensive experiments, we show that our proposed HyperML not only outperforms their Euclidean counterparts, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of personalized recommendation in hyperbolic geometry."}}

Group-level recommendation is known to be a challenging task, in which intricate group dynamics have to be considered. As such, this is to be contrasted with the standard recommendation problem where recommendations are personalized with respect to a single user. Our proposed approach hinges upon the key intuition that the decision making process (in groups) is generally dynamic, i.e., a user\u2019s decision is highly dependent on the other group members. All in all, our key motivation manifests in a form of an attentive neural model that captures fine-grained interactions between group members. In our MoSAN model, each sub-attention module is rep- resentative of a single member, which models a user\u2019s preference with respect to all other group members. Subsequently, a Medley of Sub-Attention modules is then used to collectively make the group\u2019s final decision. Overall, our proposed model is both expres- sive and effective. Via a series of extensive experiments, we show that MoSAN not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also improves standard baselines by a considerable margin."}}

The key challenge of next-POI recommendation is to precisely learn users' sequential movements from sparse check-in data. To this end, various embedding methods have been proposed to learn the representations of check-in data in the Euclidean space. However, their ability to learn complex patterns, especially hierarchical structures, is limited by the dimensionality of the Euclidean space. To this end, we propose a new research direction that aims to learn the representations of check-in activities in a hyperbolic space, which yields two advantages. First, it can effectively capture the underlying hierarchical structures, which are implied by the power-law distributions of user movements. Second, it provides high representative strength and enables the check-in data to be effectively represented in a low-dimensional space. Specifically, to solve the next-POI recommendation task, we propose a novel hyperbolic metric embedding (HME) model, which projects the check-in data into a hyperbolic space. The HME jointly captures sequential transition, user preference, category and region information in a unified approach by learning embeddings in a shared hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore a non-Euclidean embedding model for next-POI recommendation. We conduct extensive experiments on three check-in datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our hyperbolic embedding approach over the state-of-the-art next-POI recommendation algorithms. Moreover, we conduct experiments on another four online transaction datasets for next-item recommendation to further demonstrate the generality of our proposed model."}}
