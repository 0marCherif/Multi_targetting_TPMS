Despite their effectiveness, GNNs often suffer from high latency due to non-trivial neighborhood data dependency in practical deployments. To address this issue, researchers have proposed methods based on knowledge distillation (KD) to transfer the knowledge from teacher GNNs to student MLPs, which are known to be efficient even with industrial scale data, and have shown promising results on node classification. Nonetheless, using KD to accelerate link prediction is still unexplored. In this work, we start with exploring two direct analogs of traditional KD for link prediction, i.e., predicted logit-based matching and node representation-based matching. Upon observing direct KD analogs do not perform well for link prediction, we propose a relational KD framework, Linkless Link Prediction (LLP). Unlike simple KD methods that match independent link logits or node representations, LLP distills relational knowledge that is centered around each (anchor) node to the student MLP. Specifically, we propose two matching strategies that complement each other: rank-based matching and distribution-based matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP boosts the link prediction performance of MLPs with significant margins, and even outperforms the teacher GNNs on 6 out of 9 benchmarks. LLP also achieves a 776.37x speedup in link prediction inference compared to GNNs on the large scale Citation2 dataset. "}}

Existing methods attempt to address this scalability issue by training student multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) exclusively on node content features using labels derived from the teacher GNNs. However, the trained MLPs are neither effective nor robust. In this paper, we ascribe the lack of effectiveness and robustness to three significant challenges: 1) the misalignment between content feature and label spaces, 2) the strict hard matching to teacher's output, and 3) the sensitivity to node feature noises. To address the challenges, we propose NOSMOG, a novel method to learn NOise-robust Structure-aware MLPs On Graphs, with remarkable effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Specifically, we first address the misalignment by complementing node content with position features to capture the graph structural information. We then design an innovative representational similarity distillation strategy to inject soft node similarities into MLPs. Finally, we introduce adversarial feature augmentation to ensure stable learning against feature noises. Extensive experiments and theoretical analyses demonstrate the superiority of NOSMOG by comparing it to GNNs and the state-of-the-art method in both transductive and inductive settings across seven datasets.

A recent focal area is the space of graph self-supervised learning (SSL), which aims to derive useful node representations without labeled data. Notably, many state-of-the-art graph SSL methods are contrastive methods, which use a combination of positive and negative samples to learn node representations. Owing to challenges in negative sampling (slowness and model sensitivity), recent literature introduced non-contrastive methods, which instead only use positive samples. Though such methods have shown promising performance in node-level tasks, their suitability for link prediction tasks, which are concerned with predicting link existence between pairs of nodes (and have broad applicability to recommendation systems contexts) is yet unexplored. In this work, we extensively evaluate the performance of existing non-contrastive methods for link prediction in both transductive and inductive settings. While most existing non-contrastive methods perform poorly overall, we find that, surprisingly, BGRL generally performs well in transductive settings. However, it performs poorly in the more realistic inductive settings where the model has to generalize to links to/from unseen nodes. We find that non-contrastive models tend to overfit to the training graph and use this analysis to propose T-BGRL, a novel non-contrastive framework that incorporates cheap corruptions to improve the generalization ability of the model. This simple modification strongly improves inductive performance in 5/6 of our datasets, with up to a 120% improvement in Hits@50 - all with comparable speed to other non-contrastive baselines, and up to $14\\times$ faster than the best-performing contrastive baseline. Our work imparts interesting findings about non-contrastive learning for link prediction and paves the way for future researchers to further expand upon this area."}}

A typical application of LP is to retrieve the top scoring neighbors for a given source node, such as the friend recommendation. These services desire the high inference scalability to find the top scoring neighbors from many candidate nodes at low latencies. There are two popular decoders that the recent LP models mainly use to compute the edge scores from node embeddings: the \\textbf{HadamardMLP} and \\textbf{Dot Product} decoders. After theoretical and empirical analysis, we find that the HadamardMLP decoders are generally more effective for LP. However, HadamardMLP lacks the scalability for retrieving top scoring neighbors on large graphs, since to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist an algorithm to retrieve the top scoring neighbors for HadamardMLP decoders in sublinear complexity. To make HadamardMLP scalable, we propose the \\textit{Flashlight} algorithm to accelerate the top scoring neighbor retrievals for HadamardMLP: a sublinear algorithm that progressively applies approximate maximum inner product search (MIPS) techniques with adaptively adjusted query embeddings. Empirical results show that Flashlight improves the inference speed of LP by more than 100 times on the large OGBL-CITATION2 dataset without sacrificing effectiveness. Our work paves the way for large-scale LP applications with the effective HadamardMLP decoders by greatly accelerating their inference."}}

Due to the recent success of graph neural networks (GNNs), a variety of GNN-based models were proposed to tackle the link prediction task. Specifically, GNNs leverage the message passing paradigm to obtain node representation, which relies on link connectivity. However, in a link prediction task, links in the training set are always present while ones in the testing set are not yet formed, resulting in a discrepancy of the connectivity pattern and bias of the learned representation. It leads to a problem of dataset shift which degrades the model performance. In this paper, we first identify the dataset shift problem in the link prediction task and provide theoretical analyses on how existing link prediction methods are vulnerable to it. We then propose FakeEdge, a model-agnostic technique, to address the problem by mitigating the graph topological gap between training and testing sets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the applicability and superiority of FakeEdge on multiple datasets across various domains."}}
