The objective is to allocate resources equitably among several agents in an online fashion so that the difference of the aggregate $\\alpha$-fair utilities of the agents between an optimal static clairvoyant allocation and that of the online policy grows sub-linearly with time. The problem is challenging due to the non-additive nature of the $\\alpha$-fairness function. Previously, it was shown that no online policy can exist for this problem with a sublinear standard regret. In this paper, we propose an efficient online resource allocation policy, called Online Proportional Fair (OPF), that achieves $c_\\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret with the approximation factor $c_\\alpha=(1-\\alpha)^{-(1-\\alpha)}\\leq 1.445,$ for $0\\leq \\alpha < 1$. The upper bound to the $c_\\alpha$-regret for this problem exhibits a surprising phase transition phenomenon. The regret bound changes from a power-law to a constant at the critical exponent $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2}.$ As a corollary, our result also resolves an open problem raised by Even-Dar et al. [2009] on designing an efficient no-regret policy for the online job scheduling problem in certain parameter regimes. The proof of our results introduces new algorithmic and analytical techniques, including greedy estimation of the future gradients for non-additive global reward functions and bootstrapping adaptive regret bounds, which may be of independent interest."}}

We show that a natural greedy scheduling policy is competitive against any optimal offline policy in minimizing the AoI in the adversarial setting. We also derive universal lower bounds to the competitive ratio achievable by any online policy in the adversarial framework. In the stochastic setting, we show that a simple index policy is near-optimal for minimizing the average AoI in two different mobility scenarios. Further, we prove that the greedy scheduling policy minimizes the peak AoI for static users in the stochastic setting. Simulation results show that the proposed policies perform well under realistic conditions."}}

The non-stationary environment is modelled using a novel adversarial framework. In this setting, we propose a greedy scheduling policy, called MA-CSIT, that takes into account the current channel state information. We establish a finite upper bound on the competitive ratio achieved by the MA-CSIT policy for a small number of users and show that the proposed policy has a better performance guarantee than a recently proposed greedy scheduler that operates without CSIT. In particular, we show that access to the additional channel state information improves the competitive ratio from 8 to 2 in the two-user case and from 18 to 8/3 in the three-user case. Finally, we carry out extensive numerical simulations to quantify the advantage of knowing CSIT in order to minimize the Age-of-Information for an arbitrary number of users."}}

We present a simple sublinear time algorithm that approximates all eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$ up to additive error $\\pm \\epsilon n$ using those of a randomly sampled $\\tilde {O}\\left (\\frac{\\log^3 n}{\\epsilon^3}\\right ) \\times \\tilde O\\left (\\frac{\\log^3 n}{\\epsilon^3}\\right )$ principal submatrix. Our result can be viewed as a concentration bound on the complete eigenspectrum of a random submatrix, significantly extending known bounds on just the singular values (the magnitudes of the eigenvalues). We give improved error bounds of $\\pm \\epsilon \\sqrt{\\text{nnz}(\\mathbf{A})}$ and $\\pm \\epsilon \\|\\mathbf A\\|_F$ when the rows of $\\mathbf A$ can be sampled with probabilities proportional to their sparsities or their squared $\\ell_2$ norms respectively.

Even for the strictly easier problems of approximating the singular values or testing the existence of large negative eigenvalues (Bakshi, Chepurko, and Jayaram, FOCS '20), our results are the first that take advantage of non-uniform sampling to give improved error bounds. From a technical perspective, our results require several new eigenvalue concentration and perturbation bounds for matrices with bounded entries. Our non-uniform sampling bounds require a new algorithmic approach, which judiciously zeroes out entries of a randomly sampled submatrix to reduce variance, before computing the eigenvalues of that submatrix as estimates for those of $\\mathbf A$. We complement our theoretical results with numerical simulations, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms in practice."}}

In this setting, we propose a scheduling policy and show that it is 2-optimal. Next, we propose a new adversarial channel model for studying the scheduling problem in non-stationary environments. For N users, we show that the competitive ratio of any online scheduling policy in this setting is at least \u03a9(N).

Motivated by the unreliability and non-stationarity of the emerging 5G-mmWave channels for high-speed users, we forego of any statistical modeling assumptions of the wireless channels and user-mobility. Instead, we allow the channel states and the mobility patterns to be dictated by an omniscient adversary. It is not difficult to see that no competitive scheduling policy can exist for the corresponding throughput-maximization problem in this adversarial model. Surprisingly, we show that there exists a simple online distributed scheduling policy with a finite competitive ratio for maximizing the freshness of information in this model. We also prove that the proposed policy is competitively optimal up to an O(logN) factor."}}

Although many different caching algorithms are in use today, the fundamental performance limits of network caching algorithms from an online learning point-of-view remain poorly understood to date. In this paper, we resolve this question in the following two settings: (1) a single user connected to a single cache, and (2) a set of users and a set of caches interconnected through a bipartite network. Recently, an online gradient-based coded caching policy was shown to enjoy sub-linear regret. However, due to the lack of known regret lower bounds, the question of the optimality of the proposed policy was left open. In this paper, we settle this question by deriving tight non-asymptotic regret lower bounds in both of the above settings. In addition to that, we propose a new Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader-based uncoded caching policy with near-optimal regret. Technically, the lower-bounds are obtained by relating the online caching problem to the classic probabilistic paradigm of balls-into-bins. Our proofs make extensive use of a new result on the expected load in the most populated half of the bins, which might also be of independent interest. We evaluate the performance of the caching policies by experimenting with the popular MovieLens dataset and conclude the paper with design recommendations and a list of open problems."}}
