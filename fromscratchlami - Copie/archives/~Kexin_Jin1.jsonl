We apply this property to quintic resonance interactions and obtain a description of dynamics for time up to $T=\\frac{L^2}{\\epsilon^4}$, if $L$ is sufficiently large and size of initial data $\\epsilon$ is small enough. Since $T$ is the characteristic time of wave turbulence, this result implies the absence of wave turbulence behavior of 1D cubic NLS. Our approach can be adapted to other integrable systems without too many difficulties. In the proof, we develop a correspondence between Feynman diagrams and terms in normal forms, which allows us to calculate the coefficients inductively. "}}

Here, the target function is given as an integral over a family of (continuously) indexed target functions - integrated with respect to a probability measure. Such problems can often be solved by stochastic optimization methods: performing optimization steps with respect to the indexed target function with randomly switched indices. In this work, we study a continuous-time variant of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm for optimization problems with continuous data. This so-called stochastic gradient process consists in a gradient flow minimizing an indexed target function that is coupled with a continuous-time index process determining the index. Index processes are, e.g., reflected diffusions, pure jump processes, or other L\u00e9vy processes on compact spaces. Thus, we study multiple sampling patterns for the continuous data space and allow for data simulated or streamed at runtime of the algorithm. We analyze the approximation properties of the stochastic gradient process and study its longtime behavior and ergodicity under constant and decreasing learning rates. We end with illustrating the applicability of the stochastic gradient process in a polynomial regression problem with noisy functional data, as well as in a physics-informed neural network. "}}

Domain generalization (DG) has become one of the key topics in various fields. Several literatures show that DG can be arbitrarily hard without exploiting target domain information. To address this issue, test-time adaptive (TTA) methods are proposed. Existing TTA methods require offline target data or extra sophisticated optimization procedures during the inference stage. In this work, we adopt Non-Parametric Classifier to perform the test-time Adaptation (AdaNPC). In particular, we construct a memory that contains the feature and label pairs from training domains. During inference, given a test instance, AdaNPC first recalls K closed samples from the memory to vote for the prediction, and then the test feature and predicted label are added to the memory. In this way, the sample distribution in the memory can be gradually changed from the training distribution towards the test distribution with very little extra computation cost. We theoretically justify the rationality behind the proposed method. Besides, we test our model on extensive numerical experiments. AdaNPC significantly outperforms competitive baselines on various DG benchmarks. In particular, when the adaptation target is a series of domains, the adaptation accuracy of AdaNPC is 50% higher than advanced TTA methods.

Here, momentum-based stochastic optimisation algorithms have become especially popular in recent years. The stochasticity arises from data subsampling which reduces computational cost. Moreover, both, momentum and stochasticity are supposed to help the algorithm to overcome local minimisers and, hopefully, converge globally. Theoretically, this combination of stochasticity and momentum is badly understood. In this work, we propose and analyse a continuous-time model for stochastic gradient descent with momentum. This model is a piecewise-deterministic Markov process that represents the particle movement by an underdamped dynamical system and the data subsampling through a stochastic switching of the dynamical system. In our analysis, we investigate longtime limits, the subsampling-to-no-subsampling limit, and the momentum-to-no-momentum limit. We are particularly interested in the case of reducing the momentum over time: intuitively, the momentum helps to overcome local minimisers in the initial phase of the algorithm, but prohibits fast convergence to a global minimiser later. Under convexity assumptions, we show convergence of our dynamical system to the global minimiser when reducing momentum over time and let the subsampling rate go to infinity. We then propose a stable, symplectic discretisation scheme to construct an algorithm from our continuous-time dynamical system. In numerical experiments, we study our discretisation scheme in convex and non-convex test problems. Additionally, we train a convolutional neural network to solve the CIFAR-10 image classification problem. Here, our algorithm reaches competitive results compared to stochastic gradient descent with momentum."}}
