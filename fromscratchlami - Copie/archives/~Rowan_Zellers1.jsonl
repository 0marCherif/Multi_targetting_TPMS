By identifying concrete visual clues scattered throughout a scene, we almost can't help but draw probable inferences beyond the literal scene based on our everyday experience and knowledge about the world. For example, if we see a \"20 mph\" sign alongside a road, we might assume the street sits in a residential area (rather than on a highway), even if no houses are pictured. Can machines perform similar visual reasoning? We present Sherlock, an annotated corpus of 103K images for testing machine capacity for abductive reasoning beyond literal image contents. We adopt a free-viewing paradigm: participants first observe and identify salient clues within images (e.g., objects, actions) and then provide a plausible inference about the scene, given the clue. In total, we collect 363K (clue, inference) pairs, which form a first-of-its-kind abductive visual reasoning dataset. Using our corpus, we test three complementary axes of abductive reasoning. We evaluate the capacity of models to: i) retrieve relevant inferences from a large candidate corpus; ii) localize evidence for inferences via bounding boxes, and iii) compare plausible inferences to match human judgments on a newly-collected diagnostic corpus of 19K Likert-scale judgments. While we find that fine-tuning CLIP-RN50x64 with a multitask objective outperforms strong baselines, significant headroom exists between model performance and human agreement.

We introduce @MERLOT RESERVE, a model that represents videos jointly over time - through a new training objective that learns from audio, subtitles, and video frames. Given a video, we replace snippets of text and audio with a MASK token; the model learns by choosing the correct masked-out snippet. Our objective learns faster than alternatives, and performs well at scale: we pretrain on 20 million YouTube videos. Empirical results show that @MERLOT RESERVE learns strong multimodal representations. When finetuned, it sets state-of-the-art on Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), TVQA, and Kinetics-600; outperforming prior work by 5%, 7%, and 1.5% respectively. Ablations show that these tasks benefit from audio pretraining - even VCR, a QA task centered around images (without sound). Moreover, our objective enables out-of-the-box prediction, revealing strong multimodal commonsense understanding. In a fully zero-shot setting, our model obtains competitive results on four video tasks, even outperforming supervised approaches on the recently proposed Situated Reasoning (STAR) benchmark. We analyze why audio enables better vision-language representations, suggesting significant opportunities for future research. We conclude by discussing ethical and societal implications of multimodal pretraining."}}

Can their zero-shot capacity be extended to multimodal inputs? In this work, we propose ESPER which extends language-only zero-shot models to unseen multimodal tasks, like image and audio captioning. Our key novelty is to use reinforcement learning to align multimodal inputs to language model generations without direct supervision: for example, in the image case our reward optimization relies only on cosine similarity derived from CLIP, and thus requires no additional explicitly paired (image, caption) data. Because the parameters of the language model are left unchanged, the model maintains its capacity for zero-shot generalization. Experiments demonstrate that ESPER outperforms baselines and prior work on a variety of zero-shot tasks; these include a new benchmark we collect+release, ESP dataset, which tasks models with generating several diversely-styled captions for each image."}}

Humor \"Understanding\" Benchmarks from The New Yorker Caption Contest", "abstract": "We challenge AI models to \"demonstrate understanding\" of the sophisticated multimodal humor of The New Yorker Caption Contest. Concretely, we develop three carefully circumscribed tasks for which it suffices (but is not necessary) to grasp potentially complex and unexpected relationships between image and caption, and similarly complex and unexpected allusions to the wide varieties of human experience; these are the hallmarks of a New Yorker-caliber cartoon. We investigate vision-and-language models that take as input the cartoon pixels and caption directly, as well as language-only models for which we circumvent image-processing by providing textual descriptions of the image. Even with the rich multifaceted annotations we provide for the cartoon images, we identify performance gaps between high-quality machine learning models (e.g., a fine-tuned, 175B parameter language model) and humans. We publicly release our corpora including annotations describing the image's locations/entities, what's unusual about the scene, and an explanation of the joke."}}
