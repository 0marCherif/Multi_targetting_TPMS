Here, we present results from a group decision-making task known as the volunteer\u2019s dilemma and demonstrate that a Bayesian model based on partially observable Markov decision processes outperforms existing models in quantitatively predicting human behavior and outcomes of group interactions. Our results suggest that in decision-making tasks involving large groups with anonymous members, humans use Bayesian inference to model the \u201cmind of the group,\u201d making predictions of others\u2019 decisions while also simulating the effects of their own actions on the group\u2019s dynamics in the future."}}

However, it has not yet been established whether these grid-like codes serve to transfer learning and to generalize previous experiences for inferences in novel situations. Do grid codes provide consistent context-invariant representations of structural relationships or do they flexibly switch their reference frame according to the current task demand to plan/discover optimal decision policy? Here we aim to reveal the constraints, conditions, and potential transformations of grid codes in the human brain that would afford flexible generalization."}}

Here we adopt the hypothesis that when we are in an interactive social setting, our brains perform Bayesian inference of the intentions and cooperativeness of others using probabilistic representations. We employ the framework of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) to model human decision making in a social context, focusing specifically on the volunteer's dilemma in a version of the classic Public Goods Game. We show that the POMDP model explains both the behavior of subjects as well as neural activity recorded using fMRI during the game. The decisions of subjects can be modeled across all trials using two interpretable parameters. Furthermore, the expected reward predicted by the model for each subject was correlated with the activation of brain areas related to reward expectation in social interactions. Our results suggest a probabilistic basis for human social decision making within the framework of expected reward maximization."}}
