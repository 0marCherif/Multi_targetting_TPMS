It produces highly noisy 2D images by projecting a molecule's 3D density from random viewing directions. Because the projection directions are unknown, estimating the images' poses is necessary to perform the reconstruction. We focus on this task and study it under the group synchronization framework: if the relative poses of pairs of images can be approximated from the data, an estimation of the images' poses is given by the assignment which is most consistent with the relative ones.\nIn particular, by studying the symmetries of cryo-EM, we show that relative poses in the group O(2) provide sufficient constraints to identify the images' poses, up to the molecule's chirality. With this in mind, we improve the existing multi-frequency vector diffusion maps (MFVDM) method: by using O(2) relative poses, our method not only predicts the similarity between the images' viewing directions but also recovers their poses. Hence, we can leverage all input images in a 3D reconstruction algorithm by initializing the poses with our estimation rather than just clustering and averaging the input images. We validate the recovery capabilities and robustness of our method on randomly generated synchronization graphs and a synthetic cryo-EM dataset."}}

Euclidean steerable CNNs are one of the most common classes of equivariant networks. While the constraints these architectures need to satisfy are understood, existing approaches are tailored to specific (classes of) groups. No generally applicable method that is practical for implementation has been described so far. In this work, we generalize the Wigner-Eckart theorem proposed in Lang & Weiler (2020), which characterizes general $G$-steerable kernel spaces for compact groups $G$ over their homogeneous spaces, to arbitrary $G$-spaces. This enables us to directly parameterize filters in terms of a band-limited basis on the whole space rather than on $G$'s orbits, but also to easily implement steerable CNNs equivariant to a large number of groups. To demonstrate its generality, we instantiate our method on a variety of isometry groups acting on the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Our framework allows us to build $E(3)$ and $SE(3)$-steerable CNNs like previous works, but also CNNs with arbitrary $G\\leq O(3)$-steerable kernels. For example, we build 3D CNNs equivariant to the symmetries of platonic solids or choose $G=SO(2)$ when working with 3D data having only azimuthal symmetries. We compare these models on 3D shapes and molecular datasets, observing improved performance by matching the model's symmetries to the ones of the data."}}
