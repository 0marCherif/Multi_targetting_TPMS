Yet, long-horizon forecasting remains a very difficult task. Two common challenges afflicting the task are the volatility of the predictions and their computational complexity. We introduce N-HiTS, a model which addresses both challenges by incorporating novel hierarchical interpolation and multi-rate data sampling techniques. These techniques enable the proposed method to assemble its predictions sequentially, emphasizing components with different frequencies and scales while decomposing the input signal and synthesizing the forecast. We prove that the hierarchical interpolation technique can efficiently approximate arbitrarily long horizons in the presence of smoothness. Additionally, we conduct extensive large-scale dataset experiments from the long-horizon forecasting literature, demonstrating the advantages of our method over the state-of-the-art methods, where N-HiTS provides an average accuracy improvement of almost 20% over the latest Transformer architectures while reducing the computation time by an order of magnitude (50 times).

Numerous applications in the past have implicitly combined adaptive moment methods with adaptive probabilities yet the theoretical guarantees of such procedures have not been explored. We formalize double adaptive stochastic gradient methods DASGrad as an optimization technique and analyze its convergence improvements in a stochastic convex optimization setting, we provide empirical validation of our findings with convex and non convex objectives. We observe that the benefits of the method increase with the model complexity and variability of the gradients, and we explore the resulting utility in extensions to transfer learning. "}}
