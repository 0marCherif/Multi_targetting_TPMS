In this paper, we propose a general multi-scale framework that can be applied to state-of-the-art transformer-based time series forecasting models\n(FEDformer, Autoformer, etc.). Using iteratively refining a forecasted time series at multiple scales with shared weights, architecture adaptations and a specially-designed normalization scheme, we are able to achieve significant performance improvements with minimal additional computational overhead. Via detailed ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed architectural and methodological innovations. Furthermore, our experiments on various public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the corresponding baselines. Depending on the choice of transformer architecture, our mutli-scale framework results in mean squared error reductions ranging from 5.5% to 38.5%. Our code is publicly available in https://github.com/BorealisAI/scaleformer."}}

The current convention is to approach this task with cycle-consistent GANs: using a discriminator to encourage the generator to change the image to match the target domain, while training the generator to be inverted with another mapping. While ending up with paired inverse functions may be a good end result, enforcing this restriction at all times during training can be a hindrance to effective modeling. We propose an alternate approach that directly restricts the generator to performing a simple sparse transformation in a latent layer, motivated by recent work from cognitive neuroscience suggesting an architectural prior on representations corresponding to consciousness. Our biologically motivated approach leads to representations more amenable to transformation by disentangling high-level abstract concepts in the latent space. We demonstrate that image-to-image domain translation with many different domains can be learned more effectively with our architecturally constrained, simple transformation than with previous unconstrained architectures that rely on a cycle-consistency loss."}}

To allow for test-time transfer, each class is annotated with semantic information, commonly in the form of attributes or text descriptions. While classical zero-shot learning does not explicitly forbid using information from other datasets, the approaches that achieve the best absolute performance on image benchmarks rely on features extracted from encoders pretrained on Imagenet. This approach relies on hyper-optimized Imagenet-relevant parameters from the supervised classification setting, entangling important questions about the suitability of those parameters and how they were learned with more fundamental questions about representation learning and generalization. To remove these distractors, we propose a more challenging setting: Zero-Shot Learning from scratch (ZFS), which explicitly forbids the use of encoders fine-tuned on other datasets. Our analysis on this setting highlights the importance of local information, and compositional representations."}}

For this purpose, we propose joint learning from a scratch to train a classifier and a generative stochastic translation network end-to-end. The translation network is used to perform on-line data augmentation across classes, whereas previous works have mostly involved domain adaptation. To help the model further benefit from this data-augmentation, we introduce an adaptive fade-in loss and a quadruplet loss. We perform experiments on multiple datasets to demonstrate the proposed method's performance in varied settings. Of particular interest, training on 40% of the dataset is enough for our model to surpass the performance of baselines trained on the full dataset. When our architecture is trained on the full dataset, we achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods despite using a light-weight architecture."}}

Different sources contribute complementary explanatory factors. Similarly, research studies often collect multimodal imaging data, each of which can provide shared and unique information. This observation motivated the design of powerful multimodal self-supervised representation-learning algorithms. In this paper, we unify recent work on multimodal self-supervised learning under a single framework. Observing that most self-supervised methods optimize similarity metrics between a set of model components, we propose a taxonomy of all reasonable ways to organize this process. We first evaluate models on toy multimodal MNIST datasets and then apply them to a multimodal neuroimaging dataset with Alzheimer's disease patients. We find that (1) multimodal contrastive learning has significant benefits over its unimodal counterpart, (2) the specific composition of multiple contrastive objectives is critical to performance on a downstream task, (3) maximization of the similarity between representations has a regularizing effect on a neural network, which can sometimes lead to reduced downstream performance but still reveal multimodal relations. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms previous self-supervised encoder-decoder methods based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) or the mixture-of-experts multimodal variational autoEncoder (MMVAE) on various datasets with a linear evaluation protocol. Importantly, we find a promising solution to uncover connections between modalities through a jointly shared subspace that can help advance work in our search for neuroimaging biomarkers."}}
