To address these issues, we propose a collaborative human-AI algorithm that automatically optimizes candidate sub-goals and refines prior knowledge. Our algorithm can be integrated into various hierarchical frameworks and effectively prevent negative inferences that may arise from conflicting sub-goals. Our approach is robust in the face of different levels of human knowledge and able to accelerate convergence to optimal sub-goals and hierarchical policies."}}

In this article, we propose an effective way of explicitly modeling the domain relatedness of each domain pair through transfer kernel learning. Specifically, we first discuss the advantages and disadvantages of existing transfer kernels in handling the multi-source transfer regression problem. To cope with the limitations of the existing transfer kernels, we further propose a novel multi-source transfer kernel <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k_{ms}$</tex-math></inline-formula> . The proposed <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k_{ms}$</tex-math></inline-formula> assigns a learnable parametric coefficient to model the relatedness of each inter-domain pair, and simultaneously regulates the relatedness of the intra-domain pair to be 1. Moreover, to capture the heterogeneous data characteristics of multiple domains, <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k_{ms}$</tex-math></inline-formula> exploits different standard kernels for different domain pairs. We further provide a theorem that not only guarantees the positive semi-definiteness of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k_{ms}$</tex-math></inline-formula> but also conveys a semantic interpretation to the learned domain relatedness. Moreover, the theorem can be easily used in the learning of the corresponding transfer Gaussian process model with <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k_{ms}$</tex-math></inline-formula> . Extensive empirical studies show the effectiveness of our proposed method on domain relatedness modelling and transfer performance."}}

Bayesian causal inference is an important approach to learning the distribution of the causal estimands and understanding the uncertainty of causal effects. Our framework estimates the posterior distributions of the causal effects to compute the higher-order statistics that capture the uncertainty. We integrate local causal effects from different data sources without centralizing them. We then estimate the treatment effects from observational data using a non-parametric reformulation of the classical potential outcomes framework. We model the potential outcomes as a random function distributed by Gaussian processes, with defining parameters that can be efficiently learned from multiple data sources. Our method avoids exchanging raw data among the sources, thus contributing towards privacy-preserving causal learning. The promise of our approach is demonstrated through a set of simulated and real-world examples."}}

We leverage multiple data sources which share similar causal mechanisms with the scarce target observations to help infer causal effects in the target domain. The data sources may be available in sequence or some unplanned order. Causal inference can be carried out without prior knowledge of the data discrepancy between the source and target observations. We introduce three levels of knowledge transfer through modelling the outcomes, treatments, and confounders to achieve consistent positive transfer. We incorporate parametric transfer factors to adaptively control the transfer strength, thus achieving a fair and balanced knowledge transfer between the sources and the target.
