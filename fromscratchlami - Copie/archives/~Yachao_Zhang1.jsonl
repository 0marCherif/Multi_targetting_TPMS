COD is a challenging task due to the intrinsic similarity of camouflaged objects with the background, as well as their ambiguous boundaries. Existing approaches to this problem have developed various techniques to mimic the human visual system. Albeit effective in many cases, these methods still struggle when camouflaged objects are so deceptive to the vision system. In this paper, we propose the FEature Decomposition and Edge Reconstruction (FEDER) model for COD. The FEDER model addresses the intrinsic similarity of foreground and background by decomposing the features into different frequency bands using learnable wavelets. It then focuses on the most informative bands to mine subtle cues that differentiate foreground and background. To achieve this, a frequency attention module and a guidance-based feature aggregation module are developed. To combat the ambiguous boundary problem, we propose to learn an auxiliary edge reconstruction task alongside the COD task. We design an ordinary differential equation-inspired edge reconstruction module that generates exact edges. By learning the auxiliary task in conjunction with the COD task, the FEDER model can generate precise prediction maps with accurate object boundaries. Experiments show that our FEDER model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with cheaper computational and memory costs."}}

It remains a challenging task since (1) it is hard to distinguish concealed objects from the background due to the intrinsic similarity and (2) the sparsely-annotated training data only provide weak supervision for model learning. In this paper, we propose a new WSCOS method to address these two challenges. To tackle the intrinsic similarity challenge, we design a multi-scale feature grouping module that first groups features at different granularities and then aggregates these grouping results. By grouping similar features together, it encourages segmentation coherence, helping obtain complete segmentation results for both single and multiple-object images. For the weak supervision challenge, we utilize the recently-proposed vision foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), and use the provided sparse annotations as prompts to generate segmentation masks, which are used to train the model. To alleviate the impact of low-quality segmentation masks, we further propose a series of strategies, including multi-augmentation result ensemble, entropy-based pixel-level weighting, and entropy-based image-level selection. These strategies help provide more reliable supervision to train the segmentation model. We verify the effectiveness of our method on various WSCOS tasks, and experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on these tasks."}}

From the perspective of solving imbalance at the sample level, we propose a simple but effective method, named Sample-aware Knowledge Distillation (SAKD), which includes Selective Knowledge Distillation module and Stable Feature Center Learning module. The former conducts knowledge distillation at the sample-level by selecting samples, in which whether the sample needs to be distilled and to what extent is determined by evaluating the teacher network\u2019s predictions for this sample. The latter is used to obtaining the stable feature center and making the feature center free from perturbation by hard samples, then further improving the classification boundary. We conduct extensive experiments on several long-tailed benchmark datasets and these results demonstrate that SAKD is effective. In addition, our SFCL module can be combined with other methods and also improve their performance."}}

In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation framework via receptive-driven pseudo label consistency and structural consistency to mine potential knowledge. Specifically, we propose three consistency contrains: pseudo label consistency among different scales, semantic structure consistency between intra-class features and class-level relation structure consistency between pair-wise categories. Three consistency constraints are jointly used to effectively prepares and utilizes pseudo labels simultaneously for stable training. Finally, extensive experimental results on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods and even achieves comparable performance to the fully supervised methods."}}

However, UDA methods rely on access to the target domain during training, meaning the trained model only works in a specific target domain. In light of this, we propose cross-modal learning under bird's-eye view for Domain Generalization (DG) of 3D semantic segmentation, called BEV-DG. DG is more challenging because the model cannot access the target domain during training, meaning it needs to rely on cross-modal learning to alleviate the domain gap. Since 3D semantic segmentation requires the classification of each point, existing cross-modal learning is directly conducted point-to-point, which is sensitive to the misalignment in projections between pixels and points. To this end, our approach aims to optimize domain-irrelevant representation modeling with the aid of cross-modal learning under bird's-eye view. We propose BEV-based Area-to-area Fusion (BAF) to conduct cross-modal learning under bird's-eye view, which has a higher fault tolerance for point-level misalignment. Furthermore, to model domain-irrelevant representations, we propose BEV-driven Domain Contrastive Learning (BDCL) with the help of cross-modal learning under bird's-eye view. We design three domain generalization settings based on three 3D datasets, and BEV-DG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competitors with tremendous margins in all settings."}}

Albeit achieving remarkable success, existing COD detectors still struggle to obtain precise results in some challenging cases. To handle this problem, we draw inspiration from the prey-vs-predator game that leads preys to develop better camouflage and predators to acquire more acute vision systems and develop algorithms from both the prey side and the predator side. On the prey side, we propose an adversarial training framework, Camouflageator, which introduces an auxiliary generator to generate more camouflaged objects that are harder for a COD method to detect. Camouflageator trains the generator and detector in an adversarial way such that the enhanced auxiliary generator helps produce a stronger detector. On the predator side, we introduce a novel COD method, called Internal Coherence and Edge Guidance (ICEG), which introduces a camouflaged feature coherence module to excavate the internal coherence of camouflaged objects, striving to obtain more complete segmentation results. Additionally, ICEG proposes a novel edge-guided separated calibration module to remove false predictions to avoid obtaining ambiguous boundaries. Extensive experiments show that ICEG outperforms existing COD detectors and Camouflageator is flexible to improve various COD detectors, including ICEG, which brings state-of-the-art COD performance."}}

However, due to utilizing the case-agnostic rigid strategy, their generalization ability to arbitrary cases and the 3D consistency of reconstruction are still poor. In this work, we propose Consistent123, a case-aware two-stage method for highly consistent 3D asset reconstruction from one image with both 2D and 3D diffusion priors. In the first stage, Consistent123 utilizes only 3D structural priors for sufficient geometry exploitation, with a CLIP-based case-aware adaptive detection mechanism embedded within this process. In the second stage, 2D texture priors are introduced and progressively take on a dominant guiding role, delicately sculpting the details of the 3D model. Consistent123 aligns more closely with the evolving trends in guidance requirements, adaptively providing adequate 3D geometric initialization and suitable 2D texture refinement for different objects. Consistent123 can obtain highly 3D-consistent reconstruction and exhibits strong generalization ability across various objects. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image-to-3D methods.

Existing methods only mutually mimic the outputs of cross-modality in each domain, which enforces the class probability distribution agreeable in different domains. However, these methods ignore the complementarity brought by the modality fusion representation in cross-modal learning. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal UDA method for 3D semantic segmentation via Bidirectional Fusion-then-Distillation, named BFtD-xMUDA, which explores cross-modal fusion in UDA and realizes distribution consistency between outputs of two domains not only for 2D image and 3D point cloud but also for 2D/3D and fusion. Our method contains three significant components: Model-agnostic Feature Fusion Module (MFFM), Bidirectional Distillation (B-Distill), and Cross-modal Debiased Pseudo-Labeling (xDPL). MFFM is employed to generate cross-modal fusion features for establishing a latent space, which enforces maximum correlation and complementarity between two heterogeneous modalities. B-Distill is introduced to exploit bidirectional knowledge distillation which includes cross-modality and cross-domain fusion distillation, and well-achieving domain-modality alignment. xDPL is designed to model the uncertainty of pseudo-labels by self-training scheme. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in several adaptation scenarios."}}

Recently, some feature generation methods introduce metric learning to enhance the discriminability of visual features. Although these methods achieve good results, they focus only on metric learning in the visual feature space to enhance features and ignore the association between the feature space and the semantic space. Since the GZSL method uses semantics as prior knowledge to migrate visual knowledge to unseen classes, the consistency between visual space and semantic space is critical. To this end, we propose relational metric learning which can relate the metrics in the two spaces and make the distribution of the two spaces more consistent. Based on the generation method and relational metric learning, we proposed a novel GZSL method, termed VS-Boost, which can effectively boost the association between vision and semantics. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective and achieves significant gains on five benchmark datasets compared with the state-of-the-art methods."}}

Regrettably, the commonly used parallel head often lacks omni perceptual capabilities, such as deformation perception, global perception and cross-task perception. Despite numerous methods attempt to enhance these abilities from a single aspect, achieving a comprehensive and unified solution remains a significant challenge. In response to this challenge, we have developed an innovative detection head, termed UniHead, to unify three perceptual abilities simultaneously. More precisely, our approach (1) introduces deformation perception, enabling the model to adaptively sample object features; (2) proposes a Dual-axial Aggregation Transformer (DAT) to adeptly model long-range dependencies, thereby achieving global perception; and (3) devises a Cross-task Interaction Transformer (CIT) that facilitates interaction between the classification and localization branches, thus aligning the two tasks. As a plug-and-play method, the proposed UniHead can be conveniently integrated with existing detectors. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our UniHead can bring significant improvements to many detectors. For instance, the UniHead can obtain +2.7 AP gains in RetinaNet, +2.9 AP gains in FreeAnchor, and +2.1 AP gains in GFL. The code will be publicly available.
