While the top-5 zero-shot accuracies of these models are very high, the top-1 accuracies are much lower (over 25% gap in some cases). We investigate the reason for this performance gap and find that many of the failure cases are caused by ambiguity in the text prompts. First,we develop a simple and efficient zero-shot post-hoc method to identify images where the top-1 prediction is likely to be incorrect, by measuring consistency of the predictions w.r.t. multiple prompts and image transformations. We show that our procedure better predicts mistakes, outperforming the popular max logit baseline on selective prediction tasks. Next, we propose a simple and efficient way to improve accuracy on such uncertain images by making use of the WordNet hierarchy; specifically we use information from parents in the hierarchy to add superclass to prompts, and use information from children in the hierarchy to devise fine-grained prompts. We conduct experiments on both CLIP and LiT models with five different ImageNet-based datasets. For CLIP, our method improves the top-1 accuracy by 17.13% on the uncertain subset and 3.6% on the entire ImageNet validation set. We also show that our method consistently improvement on other ImageNet shifted datasets and other model architectures such as LiT. Our proposed method is hyperparameter-free, requires no additional model training and can be easily scaled to other large multi-modal architectures. Code for our experiments is opensourced at link hidden for anonymity."}}

While the reported improvements are indeed impressive, experiments are mostly limited to face datasets, where the clustered embeddings are highly discriminative or well-separated by class (Recall@1 above 90% and often near ceiling), and the experimental methodology seemingly favors the deep methods. We conduct an empirical study of 14 clustering methods on two popular non-face datasets---Cars196 and Stanford Online Products---and obtain robust, but contentious findings. Notably, deep methods are surprisingly fragile for embeddings with more uncertainty, where they underperform the shallow, heuristic-based methods. We believe our benchmarks broaden the scope of supervised clustering methods beyond the face domain and can serve as a foundation on which these methods could be improved."}}

We conduct a large-scale empirical study of 17 clustering methods across three datasets and obtain several robust findings. Notably, deep methods are surprisingly fragile for embeddings with more uncertainty, where they match or even perform worse than shallow, heuristic-based methods. When embeddings are highly discriminative, deep methods do outperform the baselines, consistent with past results, but the margin between methods is much smaller than previously reported. We believe our benchmarks broaden the scope of supervised clustering methods beyond the face domain and can serve as a foundation on which these methods could be improved. To enable reproducibility, we include all necessary details in the appendices, and plan to release the code."}}
