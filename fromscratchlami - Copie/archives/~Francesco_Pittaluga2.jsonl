However, severe concerns regarding the privacy implications of camera-based solutions currently limit the range of environments where cameras can be deployed. The key question we address is: Can cameras be enhanced with a scalable solution to preserve users\u2019 privacy without degrading their machine intelligence capabilities? Our solution is a novel end-to-end adversarial learning pipeline in which a phase mask placed at the aperture plane of a camera is jointly optimized with respect to privacy and utility objectives. We conduct an extensive design space analysis to determine operating points with desirable privacy-utility tradeoffs that are also amenable to sensor fabrication and real-world constraints. We demonstrate the first working prototype that enables passive depth estimation while inhibiting face identification."}}

Gradient averaging based DPFL methods require costly communication rounds and hardly work with large-capacity models, due to the explicit dimension dependence in its added noise. In this paper, inspired by the non-federated knowledge transfer privacy learning methods, we design two DPFL algorithms (AE-DPFL and kNN-DPFL) that provide provable DP guarantees for both instance-level and agent-level privacy regimes. By voting among the data labels returned from each local model, instead of averaging the gradients, our algorithms avoid the dimension dependence and significantly reduces the communication cost. Theoretically, by applying secure multi-party computation, we could exponentially amplify the (data-dependent) privacy guarantees when the margin of the voting scores are distinctive. Empirical evaluation on both instance and agent level DP is conducted across five datasets, showing 2% to 12% higher accuracy when privacy cost is the same compared to DP-FedAvg, or less than $65\\%$ privacy cost when accuracy aligns the same."}}

Our work addresses two key challenges in trajectory prediction, learning multimodal outputs, and better predictions by imposing constraints using driving knowledge. Recent methods have achieved strong performances using Multi-Choice Learning objectives like winner-takes-all (WTA) or best-of-many. But the impact of those methods in learning diverse hypotheses is under-studied as such objectives highly depend on their initialization for diversity. As our first contribution, we propose a novel Divide-And-Conquer (DAC) approach that acts as a better initialization technique to WTA objective, resulting in diverse outputs without any spurious modes. Our second contribution is a novel trajectory prediction framework called ALAN that uses existing lane centerlines as anchors to provide trajectories constrained to the input lanes. Our framework provides multi-agent trajectory outputs in a forward pass by capturing interactions through hypercolumn descriptors and incorporating scene information in the form of rasterized images and per-agent lane anchors. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that the proposed DAC captures the data distribution better compare to other WTA family of objectives.

Thus, facilitating federated learning methods with differential privacy (DPFL) becomes attractive. Existing algorithms based on privately aggregating clipped gradients require many rounds of communication, which may not converge, and cannot scale up to large-capacity models due to explicit dimension-dependence in its added noise. In this paper, we adopt the knowledge transfer model of private learning pioneered by Papernot et al. (2017; 2018) and extend their algorithm PATE, as well as the recent alternative PrivateKNN (Zhu et al., 2020) to the federated learning setting. The key difference is that our method privately aggregates the labels from the agents in a voting scheme, instead of aggregating the gradients, hence avoiding the dimension dependence and achieving signi\ufb01cant savings in communication cost. Theoretically, we show that when the margins of the voting scores are large, the agents enjoy exponentially higher accuracy and stronger (data-dependent) differential privacy guarantees on both agent-level and instance-level. Extensive experiments show that our approach signi\ufb01cantly improves the privacy-utility trade-off over the current state-of-the-art in DPFL."}}
