There is currently a wide variety of AC problem variants and methods proposed in the literature. Existing reviews do not take into account all derivatives of the AC problem, nor do they offer a complete classification scheme. To this end, we introduce taxonomies to describe the AC problem and features of configuration methods, respectively. We review existing AC literature within the lens of our taxonomies, outline relevant design choices of configuration approaches, contrast methods and problem variants against each other, and describe the state of AC in industry. Finally, our review provides researchers and practitioners with a look at future research directions in the field of AC."}}

While neural approaches capable of high-quality solutions in a single shot are emerging, state-of-the-art approaches are often unable to take full advantage of the solving time available to them. In contrast, hand-crafted heuristics perform highly effective search well and exploit the computation time given to them, but contain heuristics that are difficult to adapt to a dataset being solved. With the goal of providing a powerful search procedure to neural CO approaches, we propose simulation-guided beam search (SGBS), which examines candidate solutions within a fixed-width tree search that both a neural net-learned policy and a simulation (rollout) identify as promising. We further hybridize SGBS with efficient active search (EAS), where SGBS enhances the quality of solutions backpropagated in EAS, and EAS improves the quality of the policy used in SGBS. We evaluate our methods on well-known CO benchmarks and show that SGBS significantly improves the quality of the solutions found under reasonable runtime assumptions."}}

Multi-stage, stochastic optimization problems pose a particular challenge for decision makers, as the uncertainty in the input data makes it hard to determine the correct decisions. The scalable stochastic optimization (SSO) technique proposes a way of solving these problems, but is not able to provide feedback to a decision maker regarding why it makes its decisions. We suggest a mechanism for explaining the feedback of SSO to help decision makers better understand a decision support system\u2019s recommendations."}}

Finding good parameter configurations is a formidable challenge, even for fixed problem instance distributions. However, when the instance distribution can change over time, a once effective configuration may no longer provide adequate performance. Realtime algorithm configuration (RAC) offers assistance in finding high-quality configurations for such distributions by automatically adjusting the configurations it recommends based on instances seen so far. Existing RAC methods treat the solver to be configured as a black box, meaning the solver is given a configuration as input, and it outputs either a solution or runtime as an objective function for the configurator. However, analyzing intermediate output from the solver can enable configurators to avoid wasting time on poorly performing configurations. To this end, we propose a gray-box approach that utilizes intermediate output during evaluation and implement it within the RAC method CPPL. We apply cost sensitive machine learning with pairwise comparisons to determine whether ongoing evaluations can be terminated to free resources. We compare our realtime gray-box configurator to a black-box equivalent on several experimental settings and show that our approach reduces the total solving time in several scenarios."}}

With multiple, deep lanes they can achieve high storage densities, but accessing some unit loads can be time-consuming. The unit-load pre-marshalling problem sorts the unit loads in a block stacking storage system in off-peak time periods to prepare for upcoming orders. The goal is to find a minimum number of unit-load moves needed to sequence a storage bay in ascending order based on the retrieval priority group of each unit load. In this paper, we present two solution approaches for determining the minimum number of unit-load moves. We show that for storage bays with one access direction, it is possible to adapt existing, optimal tree search procedures and lower bound heuristics from the container pre-marshalling problem. For multiple access directions, we develop a novel, two-step solution approach based on a network flow model and an A* algorithm with an adapted lower bound that is applicable in all scenarios. We further analyze the performance of the presented solutions in computational experiments for randomly generated problem instances and show that multiple access directions greatly reduce both the total access time of unit loads and the required sorting effort."}}
