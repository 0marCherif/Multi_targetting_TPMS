Most existing research on HOI synthesis lacks comprehensive whole-body interactions with dynamic objects, e.g., often limited to manipulating small or static objects. Our task is significantly more challenging, as it requires modeling dynamic objects with various shapes, capturing whole-body motion, and ensuring physically valid interactions. To this end, we propose InterDiff, a framework comprising two key steps: (i) interaction diffusion, where we leverage a diffusion model to encode the distribution of future human-object interactions; (ii) interaction correction, where we introduce a physics-informed predictor to correct denoised HOIs in a diffusion step. Our key insight is to inject prior knowledge that the interactions under reference with respect to contact points follow a simple pattern and are easily predictable. Experiments on multiple human-object interaction datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for this task, capable of producing realistic, vivid, and remarkably long-term 3D HOI predictions."}}

Despite their impressive results on novel-view synthesis, it remains a fundamental challenge for NeRFs to edit the shape of the scene. Our key insight is to exploit the explicit point cloud representation as the underlying structure to construct NeRFs, inspired by the intuitive interpretation of NeRF rendering as a process that projects or \"plots\" the associated 3D point cloud to a 2D image plane. To this end, NeuralEditor introduces a novel rendering scheme based on deterministic integration within K-D tree-guided density-adaptive voxels, which produces both high-quality rendering results and precise point clouds through optimization. NeuralEditor then performs shape editing via mapping associated points between point clouds. Extensive evaluation shows that NeuralEditor achieves state-of-the-art performance in both mesh deformation and scene morphing tasks. Notably, NeuralEditor supports both zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning over the edited shape. Our code, benchmark, and demo video are available at immortalco.github.io/NeuralEditor."}}

Most of the existing work has focused on developing data-driven discriminative models for scene understanding. This paper provides a new approach to scene understanding, from a synthesis model perspective, by leveraging the recent progress on implicit scene representation and neural rendering. Building upon the great success of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), we introduce Scene-Property Synthesis with NeRF (SS-NeRF) that is able to not only render photo-realistic RGB images from novel viewpoints, but also render various accurate scene properties (e.g., appearance, geometry, and semantics). By doing so, we facilitate addressing a variety of scene understanding tasks under a unified framework, including semantic segmentation, surface normal estimation, reshading, keypoint detection, and edge detection. Our SS-NeRF framework can be a powerful tool for bridging generative learning and discriminative learning, and thus be beneficial to the investigation of a wide range of interesting problems, such as studying task relationships within a synthesis paradigm, transferring knowledge to novel tasks, facilitating downstream discriminative tasks as ways of data augmentation, and serving as auto-labeller for data creation."}}

Overlooking this difference, many 3D detectors directly follow the common practice of 2D detectors, which downsample the feature maps even after quantizing the point clouds. In this paper, we start by rethinking how such multi-stride stereotype affects the LiDAR-based 3D object detectors. Our experiments point out that the downsampling operations bring few advantages, and lead to inevitable information loss. To remedy this issue, we propose Single-stride Sparse Transformer (SST) to maintain the original resolution from the beginning to the end of the network. Armed with transformers, our method addresses the problem of insufficient receptive field in single-stride architectures. It also cooperates well with the sparsity of point clouds and naturally avoids expensive computation. Eventually, our SST achieves state-of-the-art results on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset. It is worth mentioning that our method can achieve exciting performance (83.8 LEVEL_1 AP on validation split) on small object (pedestrian) detection due to the characteristic of single stride. Our codes will be public soon."}}

Although incremental segmentation methods exist in the literature, they tend to fall short in the few-shot regime and when given partially-annotated training images, where only the novel class is segmented. This paper proposes a data synthesizer, Guided copy-And-Paste Synthesis (GAPS), that improves the performance of few-shot incremental segmentation in a model-agnostic fashion. Despite the great success of copy-paste synthesis in the conventional offline visual recognition, we demonstrate substantially degraded performance of its naive extension in our online scenario, due to newly encountered challenges. To this end, GAPS (i) addresses the partial-annotation problem by leveraging copy-paste to generate fully-labeled data for training, (ii) helps augment the few images of novel objects by introducing a guided sampling process, and (iii) mitigates catastrophic forgetting by employing a diverse memory-replay buffer. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, GAPS dramatically boosts the novel IoU of baseline methods on established few-shot incremental segmentation benchmarks by up to 80%. More notably, GAPS maintains good performance in even more impoverished annotation settings, where only single instances of novel objects are annotated."}}

Despite rapid progress, state-of-the-art encoders are restrictive to canonicalized point clouds, and have weaker than necessary performance when encountering geometric transformation distortions. To overcome this challenge, we propose PointTree, a general-purpose point cloud encoder that is robust to transformations based on relaxed K-D trees. Key to our approach is the design of the division rule in K-D trees by using principal component analysis (PCA). We use the structure of the relaxed K-D tree as our computational graph, and model the features as border descriptors which are merged with pointwise-maximum operation. In addition to this novel architecture design, we further improve the robustness by introducing pre-alignment -- a simple yet effective PCA-based normalization scheme. Our PointTree encoder combined with pre-alignment consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins, for applications from object classification to semantic segmentation on various transformed versions of the widely-benchmarked datasets."}}

Prior work has primarily focused on evaluating the recognition accuracy of various pre-training algorithms, but has overlooked other behavioral aspects. In addition to accuracy, distributional robustness plays a critical role in the reliability of machine learning models. We design and conduct a series of robustness tests to quantify the behavioral differences between contrastive learning and supervised learning to downstream or pre-training data distribution changes. These tests leverage data corruptions at multiple levels, ranging from pixel-level gamma distortion to patch-level shuffling and to dataset-level distribution shift. Our tests unveil intriguing robustness behaviors of contrastive and supervised learning. On the one hand, under downstream corruptions, we generally observe that contrastive learning is surprisingly more robust than supervised learning. On the other hand, under pre-training corruptions, we find contrastive learning vulnerable to patch shuffling and pixel intensity change, yet less sensitive to dataset-level distribution change. We attempt to explain these results through the role of data augmentation and feature space properties. Our insight has implications in improving the downstream robustness of supervised learning."}}
