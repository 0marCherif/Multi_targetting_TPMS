With the prevalence of deep learning, the encoder-decoder architecture is dominantly adopted for this task. Accurately encoding the source information is of key importance to text generation, because the target text can be generated only when accurate and complete source information is captured by the encoder and fed into the decoder. However, most existing approaches fail to effectively encode and learn the entire source information, as some features are easy to be missed along with the encoding procedures of the encoder. Similar problems also confuse the implementation of the decoder. How to reduce the problem of information loss in the encoder-decoder model is critical for text generation. To address this issue, we propose a novel correlation encoder-decoder model, which optimizes both the encoder and the decoder to reduce the problem of information loss by enforcing them to minimize the differences between hierarchical layers by maximizing the mutual information. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model substantially outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

This emerging technology has been considered a promising solution for various sectors to enhance the sustainability of business development. In general, DT relies on the living models for simulating system behaviors to monitor the systems or assets in production. Such models could be either mathematical/physics-based or data-driven, which are able to explain, predict, and describe system behaviors timely and accurately. Therefore, the machine learning-enabled modeling technology has become a powerful tool to develop such data-driven living models. However, data-driven models developed with supervised learning techniques carry a fatal deficiency: once the operational environments are changed, the model may hardly work well or even becomes useless due to the distribution shift between the training data and the new dataset. This paper attempts to address this issue by proposing to apply transfer learning techniques to develop lifetime robust living models for real-world DT systems. This paper presents a framework for developing lifetime data-driven living models. A case study, railway digital twin from our on-going research project along with the preliminary results, will be presented to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed modeling framework for digital twin."}}

Various fragmentation strategies have been presented in the literature to reduce the complexity of the molecular search space. From the optimization perspective, drug design can be viewed as a multi-objective optimization process. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks have displayed promising performances in this field. However, lengthy training periods and inefficient use of sample data limit the scalability of the current frameworks. In this paper, we (1) review the fundamental concepts of deep or multi-objective RL methods and their applications in molecular design, (2) investigate the performance of a recent multi-objective DRL-based and fragment-based drug design framework, named DeepFMPO, in a real application by integrating protein-ligand docking affinity score, and (3) compare this method with a single-objective variant. Through experiments, we find that the DeepFMPO framework (with docking score) can achieve limited success, however, it is incredibly unstable. Our findings encourage further exploration and improvement. Possible sources of the framework's instability and suggestions of further modifications to stabilize the framework are examined."}}

Contextual information such as the semantic representation of a passage or historical dialogue forms an essential part of a conversation and a precise understanding of the present phrase or sentence. However, the standard attention mechanisms typically generate weights using query and key but ignore context, forming a Bi-Attention framework, despite their great success in modeling sequence alignment. This Bi-Attention mechanism does not explicitly model the interactions between the contexts, queries and keys of target sequences, missing important contextual information and resulting in poor attention performance. Accordingly, a novel and general triple-attention (Tri-Attention) framework expands the standard Bi-Attention mechanism and explicitly interacts query, key, and context by incorporating context as the third dimension in calculating relevance scores. Four variants of Tri-Attention are generated by expanding the two-dimensional vector-based additive, dot-product, scaled dot-product, and bilinear operations in Bi-Attention to the tensor operations for Tri-Attention. Extensive experiments on three NLP tasks demonstrate that Tri-Attention outperforms about 30 state-of-the-art non-attention, standard Bi-Attention, contextual Bi-Attention approaches and pretrained neural language models1."}}
