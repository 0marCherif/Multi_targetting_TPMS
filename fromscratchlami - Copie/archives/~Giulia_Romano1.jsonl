Differently from previous, we consider the case in which the seller is an interested party, as the action chosen by the buyer does not only influence their utility, but also seller's one. This happens in many real-world settings, where the way in which businesses use acquired information may positively or negatively affect the seller, due to the presence of externalities on the information market. The utilities of both the seller and the buyer depend on a random state of nature, which is revealed to the seller, but it is unknown to the buyer. Thus, the seller's goal is to (partially) sell their information about the state of nature to the buyer, so as to concurrently maximize revenue and induce the buyer to take a desirable action. We study settings in which buyer's budget and utilities are determined by a random buyer's type that is unknown to the seller. In such settings, an optimal protocol for the seller must propose to the buyer a menu of information-revelation policies to choose from, with the latter acquiring one of them by paying its corresponding price. Moreover, since in our model the seller is an interested party, an optimal protocol must also prescribe the seller to pay back the buyer contingently on their action. First, we show that the problem of computing a seller-optimal protocol can be solved in polynomial time. Next, we switch the attention to the case in which a seller's protocol employs a single information-revelation policy, rather than proposing a menu, deriving both positive and negative results."}}

When a group of competing advertisers is managed by a common agency, many forms of collusion, such as bid rigging, can be implemented by coordinating bidding strategies, dramatically increasing advertisers' value. We study the problem of finding bids and monetary transfers maximizing the utility of a group of colluders, under GSP and VCG mechanisms. First, we introduce an abstract bid optimization problem -- called weighted utility problem (WUP) -- , which is useful in proving our results. We show that the utilities of bidding strategies are related to the length of paths in a directed acyclic weighted graph, whose structure and weights depend on the mechanism under study. This allows us to solve WUP in polynomial time by finding a shortest path of the graph. Next, we switch to our original problem, focusing on two settings that differ for the incentives they allow for. Incentive constraints ensure that colluders do not leave the agency, and they can be enforced by implementing monetary transfers between the agency and the advertisers. In particular, we study the arbitrary transfers setting, where any kind of monetary transfer to and from the advertisers is allowed, and the more realistic limited liability setting, in which no advertiser can be paid by the agency. In the former, we cast the problem as a WUP instance and solve it by our graph-based algorithm, while, in the latter, we formulate it as a linear program with exponentially-many variables efficiently solvable by applying the ellipsoid algorithm to its dual. This requires to solve a suitable separation problem in polynomial time, which can be done by reducing it to a WUP instance."}}

The problem faced by the seller is about how to partially disclose information about the state so as to maximize revenue. Unlike classical signaling problems, in this setting, the seller must also correlate the signals being sent to the buyers with some price proposals for them.

We consider two cases: the one where the seller can only send signals publicly visible to all buyers, and the case in which the seller can privately send a different signal to each buyer.

As a result, in the rest of the paper, we focus on designing PTASs. In order to do so, we first introduce a unifying framework encompassing both public and private signaling, whose core result is a decomposition lemma that allows focusing on a finite set of possible buyers' posteriors. This forms the basis on which our PTASs are developed. In particular, in the public signaling setting, our PTAS employs some ad hoc techniques based on linear programming, while our PTAS for the private setting relies on the ellipsoid method to solve an exponentially-sized LP in polynomial time.

The auction mechanism has complete knowledge of the actual state of nature, and it can send signals to bidders so as to disclose information about the state and increase revenue. For instance, a state may collectively encode some features of the user that are known to the mechanism only, since the latter has access to data sources unaccessible to the bidders. We study the problem of computing how the mechanism should send signals to bidders in order to maximize revenue. While this problem has already been addressed in the easier setting of second-price auctions, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to explore ad auctions with more than one slot. In this paper, we focus on public signaling and VCG mechanisms, under which bidders truthfully report their valuations. We start with a negative result, showing that, in general, the problem does not admit a PTAS unless P = NP, even when bidders' valuations are known to the mechanism. The rest of the paper is devoted to settings in which such negative result can be circumvented. First, we prove that, with known valuations, the problem can indeed be solved in polynomial time when either the number of states d or the number of slots m is fixed. Moreover, in the same setting, we provide an FPTAS for the case in which bidders are single minded, but d and m can be arbitrary. Then, we switch to the random valuations setting, in which these are randomly drawn according to some probability distribution. In this case, we show that the problem admits an FPTAS, a PTAS, and a QPTAS, when, respectively, d is fixed, m is fixed, and bidders' valuations are bounded away from zero."}}

In particular, AI will enable the optimization of more and more intricate economic settings, in which multiple different activities need to be jointly automated. This is the case of, e.g., Google Hotel Ads and Tripadvisor, where auctions are used to display ads of similar products or services together with their prices. As in classical ad auctions, the ads are ranked depending on the advertisers' bids, whereas, differently from classical settings, ads are displayed together with their prices, so as to provide a direct comparison among them. This dramatically affects users' behavior, as well as the properties of ad auctions. We show that, in such settings, social welfare maximization can be achieved by means of a direct-revelation mechanism that jointly optimizes, in polynomial time, the ads allocation and the advertisers' prices to be displayed with them. However, in practice it is unlikely that advertisers allow the mechanism to choose prices on their behalf. Indeed, in commonly-adopted mechanisms, ads allocation and price optimization are decoupled, so that the advertisers optimize prices and bids, while the mechanism does so for the allocation, once prices and bids are given. We investigate how this decoupling affects the efficiency of mechanisms. In particular, we study the Price of Anarchy (PoA) and the Price of Stability (PoS) of indirect-revelation mechanisms with both VCG and GSP payments, showing that the PoS for the revenue may be unbounded even with two slots, and the PoA for the social welfare may be as large as the number of slots. Nevertheless, we show that, under some assumptions, simple modifications to the indirect-revelation mechanism with VCG payments achieve a PoS of 1 for the revenue."}}
