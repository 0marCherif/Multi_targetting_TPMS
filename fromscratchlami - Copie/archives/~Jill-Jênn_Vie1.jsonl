Inspired by collaborative filtering, we define a general class of models that includes many MIRT models. We discuss the use of penalized joint maximum likelihood (JML) to estimate individual models and cross-validation to select the best performing model. This model evaluation process can be optimized using batching techniques, such that even sparse large-scale data can be analyzed efficiently. We illustrate our approach with simulated and real data, including an example from a massive open online course (MOOC). The high-dimensional model fit to this large and sparse dataset does not lend itself well to traditional methods of factor interpretation. By analogy to recommender-system applications, we propose an alternative \"validation\" of the factor model, using auxiliary information about the popularity of items consulted during an open-book exam in the course."}}

Bayesian formulations of FMs have been proposed to provide confidence intervals over the predictions made by the model, however they usually involve Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods that require many samples to provide accurate predictions, resulting in slow training in the context of large-scale data. In this paper, we propose a variational formulation of factorization machines that allows us to derive a simple objective that can be easily optimized using standard mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, making it amenable to large-scale data. Our algorithm learns an approximate posterior distribution over the user and item parameters, which leads to confidence intervals over the predictions. We show, using several datasets, that it has comparable or better performance than existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy, and provide some applications in active learning strategies, e.g., preference elicitation techniques."}}

Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a crucial part of that system. It is about inferring the skill mastery of students and predicting their performance to adjust the curriculum accordingly. Deep Learning based models like Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and Dynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN) have shown significant predictive performance compared with traditional models like Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Performance Factors Analysis (PFA). However, it is difficult to extract psychologically meaningful explanations from the tens of thousands of parameters in neural networks, that would relate to cognitive theory. There are several ways to achieve high accuracy in student performance prediction but diagnostic and prognostic reasonings are more critical in learning science. In this work, we present Interpretable Knowledge Tracing (IKT), a simple model that relies on three meaningful features: individual skill mastery, ability profile (learning transfer across skills) and problem difficulty by using data mining techniques. IKT\u2019s prediction of future student performance is made using a Tree Augmented Naive Bayes Classifier (TAN), therefore its predictions are easier to explain than deep learning based student models. IKT also shows better student performance prediction than deep learning based student models without requiring a huge amount of parameters. We conduct ablation studies on each feature to examine their contribution to student performance prediction. Thus, IKT has great potential for providing adaptive and personalized instructions with causal reasoning in real-world educational systems."}}

When a revolution happens, the consequences are not obvious straight away, and to date, there is no uniformly adapted framework to guide AI research to ensure a sustainable societal transition. To answer this need, here we analyze three key challenges to interdisciplinary AI research, and deliver three broad conclusions: 1) future development of AI should not only impact other scientific domains but should also take inspiration and benefit from other fields of science, 2) AI research must be accompanied by decision explainability, dataset bias transparency as well as development of evaluation methodologies and creation of regulatory agencies to ensure responsibility, and 3) AI education should receive more attention, efforts and innovation from the educational and scientific communities. Our analysis is of interest not only to AI practitioners but also to other researchers and the general public as it offers ways to guide the emerging collaborations and interactions toward the most fruitful outcomes."}}
