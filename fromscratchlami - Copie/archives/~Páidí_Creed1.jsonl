Most DNA sequencing approaches address either genetics or epigenetics and thus capture incomplete information. Methods widely used to detect epigenetic DNA bases fail to capture common C-to-T mutations or distinguish 5-methylcytosine from 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. We present a single base-resolution sequencing methodology that sequences complete genetics and the two most common cytosine modifications in a single workflow. DNA is copied and bases are enzymatically converted. Coupled decoding of bases across the original and copy strand provides a phased digital readout. Methods are demonstrated on human genomic DNA and cell-free DNA from a blood sample of a patient with cancer. The approach is accurate, requires low DNA input and has a simple workflow and analysis pipeline. Simultaneous, phased reading of genetic and epigenetic bases provides a more complete picture of the information stored in genomes and has applications throughout biomedicine."}}

Adopting a Conditional VAE framework, we identify the mathematical principle that unites these challenges: learning a representation that is marginally independent of a condition variable. We therefore propose the Contrastive Mixtures of Posteriors (CoMP) method that uses a novel misalignment penalty to enforce this independence. This penalty is defined in terms of mixtures of the variational posteriors themselves, unlike prior work which uses external discrepancy measures such as MMD to ensure independence in latent space. We show that CoMP has attractive theoretical properties compared to previous approaches, especially when there is complex global structure in latent space. We further demonstrate state of the art performance on a number of real-world problems, including the challenging tasks of aligning human tumour samples with cancer cell-lines and performing counterfactual inference on single-cell RNA sequencing data. Incidentally, we find parallels with the fair representation learning literature, and demonstrate CoMP has competitive performance in learning fair yet expressive latent representations."}}

We introduce a regularized attention mechanism to GCNNs that not only improves performance on clean datasets, but also favorably accommodates noise in KGs, a pervasive issue in real-world applications. Further, we explore new visualization methods for interpretable modelling and to illustrate how the learned representation can be exploited to automate dataset denoising. The results are demonstrated on a synthetic dataset, the common benchmark dataset FB15k-237, and a large biomedical knowledge graph derived from a combination of noisy and clean data sources. Using these improvements, we visualize a learned model's representation of the disease cystic fibrosis and demonstrate how to interrogate a neural network to show the potential of PPARG as a candidate therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis."}}

In many such problems the quantity to be optimized can be expressed as a sum of functions of a restricted form. Here we present a unifying theory of complexity for problems of this kind. We show that the complexity of a finite-domain discrete optimization problem is determined by certain algebraic properties of the objective function, which we call weighted polymorphisms. We define a Galois connection between sets of rational-valued functions and sets of weighted polymorphisms and show how the closed sets of this Galois connection can be characterized. These results provide a new approach to studying the complexity of discrete optimization. We use this approach to identify certain maximal tractable subproblems of the general problem and hence derive a complete classification of complexity for the Boolean case."}}
