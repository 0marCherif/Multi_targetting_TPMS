Although several studies have focused on encoding a skeleton, less attention has been paid to embed this information into the latent representations of human action. InfoGCN proposes a learning framework for action recognition combining a novel learning objective and an encoding method. First, we design an information bottleneck-based learning objective to guide the model to learn informative but compact latent representations. To provide discriminative information for classifying action, we introduce attention-based graph convolution that captures the context-dependent intrinsic topology of human action. In addition, we present a multi-modal representation of the skeleton using the relative position of joints, designed to provide complementary spatial information for joints.

Conventional approaches formulate the problem as a single Markov decision process and apply reinforcement learning methods to provide solutions. However, it is well known that financial markets involve non-stationary processes, leading to violations of this assumption in these methods. In this work, we reformulate the portfolio optimization problem to deal with the non-stationary nature of financial markets. In our approach, we divide a long-term process into multiple short-term processes to adapt to context changes and consider the portfolio optimization problem as a multitask control problem. Thereafter, we propose an evolutionary meta reinforcement learning approach to search for an initial policy that can quickly adapt to the upcoming target tasks. We model the policies as convolutional networks that can score the match of the patterns in market data charts. Finally, we test our approach using real-world cryptographic currency data and show that it adapts well to the changes in the market and leads to better profitability."}}
