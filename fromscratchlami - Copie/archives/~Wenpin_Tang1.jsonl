Such processes have been widely studied over Euclidean spaces, where they are constructed using specified covariance functions or covariograms. These functions specify valid stochastic processes that can be used to model complex dependencies in spatial statistics and other machine learning contexts. Valid (positive\ndefinite) covariance functions have been extensively studied for Gaussian processes on Euclidean spaces. Such investigations have focused, among other aspects, on the identifiability and consistency of covariance parameters as well as the problem of spatial interpolation and prediction within the fixed-domain or infill paradigm of asymptotic inference. This manuscript undertakes analogous theoretical developments for Gaussian processes constructed over Riemannian manifolds. We begin by establishing formal notions and conditions for the equivalence of two Gaussian random measures on compact manifolds. We build upon recently introduced Mat\u00b4ern covariograms on compact Riemannian manifold, derive the microergodic parameter and formally establish the consistency of maximum likelihood estimators and the asymptotic optimality of the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP). The circle and sphere are studied as two specific examples of compact Riemannian manifolds with numerical experiments that illustrate the theory."}}

Vecchia\u2019s approximation for Gaussian process models enables fast evaluation of the likelihood by restricting dependencies at a location to its neighbors. We establish inferential properties of microergodic spatial\ncovariance parameters within the paradigm of fixed-domain asymptotics when they are estimated using Vecchia\u2019s approximation. The conditions required to formally establish these properties are explored, theoretically and empirically, and the effectiveness of Vecchia\u2019s approximation is further corroborated from the standpoint of fixed-domain asymptotics. These explorations suggest some\npractical diagnostics for evaluating the quality of the approximation."}}

The variation in the white noise is attributed to measurement error, or micro-scale variability, and is called the \u201cnugget\u201d. We formally establish results on the identifiability and consistency of the nugget in spatial models based upon the Gaussian process within the framework of in-fill asymptotics, i.e. the sample size increases within a sampling domain that is bounded. Our work extends results in fixed domain asymptotics for spatial models without the nugget. More specifically, we establish the identifiability of parameters in the Matern covariogram and \u00b4the consistency of their maximum likelihood estimators in the presence of discontinuities due to the nugget. We also present simulation studies to demonstrate the role of the identifiable quantities in spatial interpolation."}}

This extends a previous result of Cand`es and Sur who proved the phase transition for the logistic regression with Gaussian covariates. Our result reveals a rich structure in the phase transition phenomenon, which is simply overlooked by Gaussianity. The main tools for deriving the result are data separation, convex geometry and stochastic approximation. We also conduct simulation studies to corroborate our theoretical findings, and explore other features of the problem"}}
