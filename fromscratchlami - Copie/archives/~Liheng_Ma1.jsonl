Thanks to the ability for providing rich information, knowledge graphs (KGs) are being incorporated to enhance the recommendation performance and interpretability. To effectively make use of the knowledge graph, we propose a recommendation model in the hyperbolic space, which facilitates the learning of the hierarchical structure of knowledge graphs. Furthermore, a hyperbolic attention network is employed to determine the relative importances of neighboring entities of a certain item. In addition, we propose an adaptive and fine-grained regularization mechanism to adaptively regularize items and their neighboring representations. Via a comparison using three real-world datasets with state-of-the-art methods, we show that the proposed model outperforms the best existing models by 2-16% in terms of NDCG@K on Top-K recommendation."}}

Given that state-of-the-art GNNs share many similarities with their CNN cousins and that CNNs suffer adversarial vulnerabilities, there has also been interest in exploring analogous vulnerabilities in GNNs. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated that node classification performance of several graph models, including the popular graph convolution network (GCN) model, can be severely degraded through adversarial perturbations to the graph structure and the node features. In this work, we take a first step towards detecting adversarial attacks against graph models. We first propose a straightforward single node threshold test for detecting nodes subject to targeted attacks. Subsequently, we describe a kernel-based two-sample test for detecting whether a given subset of nodes within a graph has been maliciously corrupted. The efficacy of our algorithms is established via thorough experiments using commonly used node classification benchmark datasets. We also illustrate the potential practical benefit of our detection method by demonstrating its application to a real-world Bitcoin transaction network."}}

GNNs often assume homophily \u2013 neighboring nodes having similar features and labels\u2013, and therefore may not be at their full potential when dealing with non-homophilic graphs. In this work, we focus on addressing this limitation and enable Graph Attention Networks (GAT), a commonly used variant of GNNs, to explore the structural information within each graph locality. Inspired by the positional encoding in the Transformers, we propose a framework, termed Graph Attentional Networks with Positional Embeddings (GAT-POS), to enhance GATs with positional embeddings which capture structural and positional information of the nodes in the graph. In this framework, the positional embeddings are learned by a model predictive of the graph context, plugged into an enhanced GAT architecture, which is able to leverage both the positional and content information of each node. The model is trained jointly to optimize for the task of node classification as well as the task of predicting graph context. Experimental results show that GAT-POS reaches remarkable improvement compared to strong GNN baselines and recent structural embedding enhanced GNNs on non-homophilic graphs."}}

The items that users will interact with may depend on the items accessed in the past. However, the substantial increase of users and items makes sequential recommender systems still face non-trivial challenges: (1) the hardness of modeling the short-term user interests; (2) the difficulty of capturing the long-term user interests; (3) the effective modeling of item co-occurrence patterns. To tackle these challenges, we propose a memory augmented graph neural network (MA-GNN) to capture both the long- and short-term user interests. Specifically, we apply a graph neural network to model the item contextual information within a short-term period and utilize a shared memory network to capture the long-range dependencies between items. In addition to the modeling of user interests, we employ a bilinear function to capture the co-occurrence patterns of related items. We extensively evaluate our model on five real-world datasets, comparing with several state-of-the-art methods and using a variety of performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for the task of Top-K sequential recommendation."}}

Although matrix factorization and deep learning based methods have proved effective in user preference modeling, they violate the triangle inequality and fail to capture fine-grained preference information. To tackle this, we develop a distance-based recommendation model with several novel aspects: (i) each user and item are parameterized by Gaussian distributions to capture the learning uncertainties; (ii) an adaptive margin generation scheme is proposed to generate the margins regarding different training triplets; (iii) explicit user-user/item-item similarity modeling is incorporated in the objective function. The Wasserstein distance is employed to determine preferences because it obeys the triangle inequality and can measure the distance between probabilistic distributions.

The feature grouping structures, which are learned in an analytical way, can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of high-dimensional data clustering. In LFGL algorithm, the Darwinian evolutionary process is used to explore the optimal feature grouping structures, which are coded as chromosomes in the genetic algorithm. The feature grouping weighting k-means algorithm is used as the fitness function to evaluate the chromosomes or feature grouping structures in each generation of evolution. To better handle the diverse densities of clusters in high-dimensional data, the original feature grouping weighting k-means is revised with the mass-based dissimilarity measure rather than the Euclidean distance measure and the feature weights are optimized as a nonnegative matrix factorization problem under the orthogonal constraint of feature weight matrix. The genetic operations of mutation and crossover are used to generate the new chromosomes for next generation. In comparison with the well-known clustering algorithms, LFGL algorithm produced encouraging experimental results on real world datasets, which demonstrated the better performance of LFGL when clustering high-dimensional data."}}
