However, accuracy is known in many cases to poorly reflect the practical consequences of classification error, most famously in imbalanced binary classification, where data are dominated by samples from one of two classes. The first part of this paper derives a novel generalization of the Bayes-optimal classifier from accuracy to any performance metric computed from the confusion matrix. Specifically, this result (a) demonstrates that stochastic classifiers sometimes outperform the best possible deterministic classifier and (b) removes an empirically unverifiable absolute continuity assumption that is poorly understood but pervades existing results. We then demonstrate how to use this generalized Bayes classifier to obtain regret bounds in terms of the error of estimating regression functions under uniform loss. Finally, we use these results to develop some of the first finite-sample statistical guarantees specific to imbalanced binary classification. Specifically, we demonstrate that optimal classification performance depends on properties of class imbalance, such as a novel notion called Uniform Class Imbalance, that have not previously been formalized. We further illustrate these contributions numerically in the case of $k$-nearest neighbor classification."}}

In particular, we consider a variant of the k-nearest neighbor classifier with non-uniform class-weightings, for which we derive upper and minimax lower bounds on accuracy, class-weighted risk, and uniform error. Additionally, we show that uniform error bounds lead to bounds on the difference between empirical confusion matrix quantities and their population counterparts across a set of weights. As a result, we may adjust the class weights to optimize classification metrics such as F1 score or Matthew's Correlation Coefficient that are commonly used in practice, particularly in settings with imbalanced classes. We additionally provide a simple example to instantiate our bounds and numerical experiments."}}

In our model, a disease spreads over a network via contagion or random infection, where the times between successive contagion events are independent exponential random variables with unknown rate parameters. A subset of nodes is also censored uniformly at random. Given the observed infection statuses of nodes in the network, the goal is to determine the underlying graph. We present a procedure based on permutation testing, and we derive sufficient conditions for the validity of our test in terms of automorphism groups of the graphs corresponding to the null and alternative hypotheses. Our test is easy to compute and does not involve estimating unknown parameters governing the process. We also derive risk bounds for our permutation test in a variety of settings, and relate our test statistic to approximate likelihood ratio testing and maximin tests. For graphs not satisfying the necessary symmetries, we provide an additional method for testing the significance of the graph structure, albeit at a higher computational cost. We conclude with an application to real data from an HIV infection network."}}

When the degree of each node is at least three, we show that it is possible to construct confi- dence sets for the diffusion source with size independent of the number of infected nodes. Our estimators are motivated by analogous results in the literature concerning identification of the root node in preferential attachment and uniform attachment trees. At the core of our proofs is a probabilistic analysis of P\u00f3lya urns corresponding to the number of uninfected neighbors in specific subtrees of the infection tree. We also provide an example illustrating the shortcomings of source estimation techniques in settings where the underlying graph is asymmetric"}}

We derive two sets of bounds, the first designed for linear threshold models, and the second more broadly applicable to a general class of triggering models, which subsumes the popular independent cascade models, as well. We quantify the gap between our upper and lower bounds in the case of the linear threshold model and illustrate the gains of our upper bounds for independent cascade models in relation to existing results. Importantly, our lower bounds are monotonic and submodular, implying that a greedy algorithm for influence maximization is guaranteed to produce a maximizer within a (1 - 1/e)-factor of the truth. Although the problem of exact influence computation is NP-hard in general, our bounds may be evaluated efficiently. This leads to an attractive, highly scalable algorithm for influence maximization with rigorous theoretical guarantees."}}
