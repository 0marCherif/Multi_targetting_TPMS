Current methods often mask some video regions and then train a model to reconstruct spatial information in these regions (\\eg, original pixels). However,  the model is easy to reconstruct this information by considering content in a single frame. As a result, it may neglect to learn the interactions between frames, which are critical for video analysis. In this paper, we present a new self-supervised learning task, called Masked Motion Modeling (M$^3$Video), for learning representation by enforcing the model to predict the motion of moving objects in the masked regions. To generate motion targets for this task, we track the objects using optical flow. The motion targets consist of position transitions and shape changes of the tracked objects. To predict these trajectory motion targets, the model has to consider multiple frames comprehensively. Besides, to help the model capture fine-grained motion details, we enforce the model to predict trajectory motion targets in high temporal resolution based on a video in low temporal resolution. After pre-training using our M$^3$Video task, the model is able to anticipate fine-grained motion details even taking a sparsely sampled video as input. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our M$^3$Video. Remarkably, when doing pre-training with 400 epochs, we improve the accuracy from 67.6\\% to 69.2\\% and from 78.8\\% to 79.7\\% on Something-Something V2 and Kinetics-400 datasets, respectively."}}

The latest attempts seek to learn a representation model by predicting the appearance contents in the masked regions. However, simply masking and recovering appearance contents may not be sufficient to model temporal clues as the appearance contents can be easily reconstructed from a single frame. To overcome this limitation, we present Masked Motion Encoding (MME), a new pre-training paradigm that reconstructs both appearance and motion information to explore temporal clues. In MME, we focus on addressing two critical challenges to improve the representation performance: 1) how to well represent the possible long-term motion across multiple frames; and 2) how to obtain fine-grained temporal clues from sparsely sampled videos. Motivated by the fact that human is able to recognize an action by tracking objects' position changes and shape changes, we propose to reconstruct a motion trajectory that represents these two kinds of change in the masked regions. Besides, given the sparse video input, we enforce the model to reconstruct dense motion trajectories in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Pre-trained with our MME paradigm, the model is able to anticipate long-term and fine-grained motion details. Code is available at https://github.com/XinyuSun/MME."}}

This task, however, is extremely challenging due to 1) the highly complex spatial-temporal information in videos and 2) the lack of labeled data for training. Unlike representation learning for static images, it is difficult to construct a suitable self-supervised task to effectively model both motion and appearance features. More recently, several attempts have been made to learn video representation through video playback speed prediction. However, it is non-trivial to obtain precise speed labels for the videos. More critically, the learned models may tend to focus on motion patterns and thus may not learn appearance features well. In this paper, we observe that the relative playback speed is more consistent with motion patterns and thus provides more effective and stable supervision for representation learning. Therefore, we propose a new way to perceive the playback speed and exploit the relative speed between two video clips as labels. In this way, we are able to effectively perceive speed and learn better motion features. Moreover, to ensure the learning of appearance features, we further propose an appearance-focused task, where we enforce the model to perceive the appearance difference between two video clips. We show that jointly optimizing the two tasks consistently improves the performance on two downstream tasks (namely, action recognition and video retrieval) w.r.t the increasing pre-training epochs. Remarkably, for action recognition on the UCF101 dataset, we achieve 93.7% accuracy without the use of labeled data for pre-training, which outperforms the ImageNet supervised pre-trained model.

Most existing methods perform this task by first generating a set of proposals and then recognizing each independently. However, due to the complex structures and large content variations in action instances, recognizing them individually can be difficult. Fortunately, some proposals often share information regarding one specific action. Such information, which is ignored in existing methods, can be used to boost recognition performance. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism, called relation attention, to exploit informative relations among proposals based on their appearance or optical flow features. Specifically, we propose a relation attention module to enhance representation power by capturing useful information from other proposals. This module does not change the dimensions of the original input and output and does not rely on any specific proposal generation methods or feature extraction backbone networks. Experimental results show that the proposed relation attention mechanism improves performance significantly on both Thumos14 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets compared to existing architectures. For example, relying on Structured Segment Networks (SSN), the proposed relation attention module helps to increase the mAP from 41.4 to 43.7 on the Thumos14 dataset and outperforms the state-of-the-art results."}}

We then formulate music generation from videos as a motion-to-MIDI translation problem. We present a Graph\u2212Transformer framework that can accurately predict MIDI event sequences in accordance with the body movements. The MIDI event can then be converted to realistic music using an off-the-shelf music synthesizer tool. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our models on videos containing a variety of music performances. Experimental results show that our model outperforms several existing systems in generating music that is pleasant to listen to. More importantly, the MIDI representations are fully interpretable and transparent, thus enabling us to perform music editing flexibly.

Previous state-of-the-art methods attempt to apply spatio-temporal attention mechanism on video frame features without explicitly modeling the location and relations among object interaction occurred in videos. However, the relations between object interaction and their location information are very critical for both action recognition and question reasoning. In this work, we propose to represent the contents in the video as a location-aware graph by incorporating the location information of an object into the graph construction. Here, each node is associated with an object represented by its appearance and location features. Based on the constructed graph, we propose to use graph convolution to infer both the category and temporal locations of an action. As the graph is built on objects, our method is able to focus on the foreground action contents for better video question answering. Lastly, we leverage an attention mechanism to combine the output of graph convolution and encoded question features for final answer reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Specifically, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TGIF-QA, Youtube2Text-QA and MSVD-QA datasets."}}
