In particular, it is more challenging to collect and annotate new massive data accurately and timely compared to traditional offline supervised training settings. Although this online training framework has been shown to be practically beneficial, there has been a lack of theoretical guarantees for the learning performance, especially for the case with noisy labels. This paper aims to investigate a learning theory for both original deep online training and online training with noisy labels. We first introduce a theoretical bound of the gaps of empirical risks and gaps of generalization risks in micro-batch online training when learning with both clean and noisy labels. Those bounds will efficiently help guide the online training scheme when receiving new data. We next analyze the impact of micro-batch size on the learning performance of models with noisy labels through our experimental results on CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets using different noise, which consistently demonstrates the merit of the bounds above in the online training setting."}}

We introduce in this paper the Bayesian recourse, a model-agnostic recourse that minimizes the posterior probability odds ratio. Further, we present its min-max robust counterpart with the goal of hedging against future changes in the machine learning model parameters. The robust counterpart explicitly takes into account possible perturbations of the data in a Gaussian mixture ambiguity set prescribed using the optimal transport (Wasserstein) distance. We show that the resulting worst-case objective function can be decomposed into solving a series of two-dimensional optimization subproblems, and the min-max recourse finding problem is thus amenable to a gradient descent algorithm. Contrary to existing methods for generating robust recourses, the robust Bayesian recourse does not require a linear approximation step. The numerical experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed robust Bayesian recourse facing model shifts.

Given a car manual written in Vietnamese as the main knowledge base, we develop QA-CarManual as a lightweight, real-time and interactive system that integrates state-of-the-art technologies in language and speech processing to (i) understand and interact with users via speech commands and (ii) automatically query the knowledge base and return answers in both forms of text and speech as well as visualization. To our best knowledge, QA-CarManual is the first Vietnamese question answering system that interacts with users via speech inputs and outputs. We perform a human evaluation to assess the quality of our QA-CarManual system and obtain promising results."}}

The evolution generates plenty of different proteins, with unique abilities, but also proteins with related functions hence surface, which is therefore of primary importance for their activity. In the present work, we assess the ability of five methods to retrieve similar protein surfaces, using either their shape only (3D meshes), or their shape and the electrostatic potential at their surface, an important surface property. Five different groups participated in this challenge using the shape only, and one group extended its pre-existing algorithm to handle the electrostatic potential. The results reveal both the ability of the methods to detect related proteins and their difficulties to distinguish between topologically related proteins."}}

Various implementations have achieved impressive progress in performance, thanks to machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, many of such high accuracy systems have low reliability as they fail to achieve robustness in unseen environments. To address that, this paper investigates a method of generalization through adversarial data augmentation. Our results show a slight improvement in deep learning-systems in unseen domains, though the performance is not significant."}}

Kinship verification aims at determining whether two facial images are from related people or not, while kinship retrieval is the task of retrieving possible related facial images to a person from a gallery of images. They introduce unique challenges because of the hidden relations and features that carry inherent characteristics between the facial images. We employ 3 methods, FaceNet, Siamese VGGFace, and a combination of FaceNet and VGG-Face models as feature extractors, to achieve the 9th standing for kinship verification and the 5th standing for kinship retrieval in the Recognizing Family in The Wild 2020 competition. We then further experimented using StyleGAN2 as another encoder, with no improvement in the result."}}
