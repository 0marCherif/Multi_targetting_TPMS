The de-facto standard approach adopts heteroscedastic Gaussian distributions and minimizes the negative log-likelihood (NLL) under observed data. However, optimizing this objective turns out to be surprisingly intricate, and the current state-of-the-art reports several instabilities. This work breaks down the optimization problem, initially focusing on non-contextual settings where convergence can be analyzed analytically. We show that (1) in this learning scheme, the eigenvalues of the predictive covariance define stability in learning, and (2) coupling of gradients and predictions build up errors in both mean and covariance if either is poorly approximated. Building on these insights, we propose Trustable, a novel optimizer that overcomes instabilities methodically by combining systematic update restrictions in the form of trust regions with structured, tractable natural gradients. We demonstrate in several challenging experiments that Trustable outperforms current optimizers in regression with neural networks in terms of the NLL, MSE, and further performance metrics. Unlike other optimizers, Trustable yields an improved and more stable fit and can also be applied to multivariate outputs with full covariance matrices."}}

The Neural Process (NP) is a prominent deep neural network-based BML architecture, which has shown remarkable results in recent years. In its standard formulation, the NP encodes epistemic uncertainty in an amortized, factorized, Gaussian variational (VI) approximation to the BML task posterior (TP), using reparametrized gradients. Prior work studies a range of architectural modifications to boost performance, such as attentive computation paths or improved context aggregation schemes, while the influence of the VI scheme remains under-explored. We aim to bridge this gap by introducing GMM-NP, a novel BML model, which builds on recent work that enables highly accurate, full-covariance Gaussian mixture (GMM) TP approximations by combining VI with natural gradients and trust regions. We show that GMM-NP yields tighter evidence lower bounds, which increases the efficiency of marginal likelihood optimization, leading to improved epistemic uncertainty estimation and accuracy. GMM-NP does not require complex architectural modifications, resulting in a powerful, yet conceptually simple BML model, which outperforms the state of the art on a range of challenging experiments, highlighting its applicability to settings where data is scarce."}}

Recently, casting probabilistic regression as a multi-task learning problem in terms of conditional latent variable (CLV) models such as the Neural Process (NP) has shown promising results. In this paper, we focus on context aggregation, a central component of such architectures, which fuses information from multiple context data points. So far, this aggregation operation has been treated separately from the inference of a latent representation of the target function in CLV models. Our key contribution is to combine these steps into one holistic mechanism by phrasing context aggregation as a Bayesian inference problem. The resulting Bayesian Aggregation (BA) mechanism enables principled handling of task ambiguity, which is key for efficiently processing context information. We demonstrate on a range of challenging experiments that BA consistently improves upon the performance of traditional mean aggregation while remaining computationally efficient and fully compatible with existing NP-based models."}}

Readily available algorithms are typically designed to be universal optimizers and, therefore, often suboptimal for specific tasks. We propose a novel transfer learning method to obtain customized optimizers within the well-established framework of Bayesian optimization, allowing our algorithm to utilize the proven generalization capabilities of Gaussian processes. Using reinforcement learning to meta-train an acquisition function (AF) on a set of related tasks, the proposed method learns to extract implicit structural information and to exploit it for improved data-efficiency. We present experiments on a simulation-to-real transfer task as well as on several synthetic functions and on two hyperparameter search problems. The results show that our algorithm (1) automatically identifies structural properties of objective functions from available source tasks or simulations, (2) performs favourably in settings with both scarse and abundant source data, and (3) falls back to the performance level of general AFs if no particular structure is present."}}
