However, as they are deployed more widely, there is a growing need to better understand their internal mechanisms in order to make them more reliable. These models appear to store vast amounts of knowledge from their training data, and to adapt quickly to new information provided in their context or prompt. We study how transformers balance these two types of knowledge by considering a synthetic setup where tokens are generated from either global or context-specific bigram distributions. By a careful empirical analysis of the training process on a simplified two-layer transformer, we illustrate the fast learning of global bigrams and the slower development of an \"induction head\" mechanism for the in-context bigrams. We highlight the role of weight matrices as associative memories, provide theoretical insights on how gradients enable their learning during training, and study the role of data-distributional properties."}}

These may arise due to different factors, such as random initialization, or spurious correlations in the learning problem. To better understand these factors, we provide a precise study of the adversarial robustness in different scenarios, from initialization to the end of training in different regimes, as well as intermediate scenarios where initialization still plays a role due to \u201clazy\u201d training. We consider over-parameterized networks in high dimensions with quadratic targets and infinite samples. Our analysis allows us to identify new tradeoffs between approximation (as measured via test error) and robustness, whereby robustness can only get worse when test error improves, and vice versa. We also show how linearized lazy training\nregimes can worsen robustness, due to improperly scaled random initialization. Our theoretical results are illustrated with numerical experiments."}}

These models are particularly relevant in high dimension, when the data might present low-dimensional structure that learning algorithms should adapt to. While several statistical aspects of this model, such as the sample complexity of recovering the relevant (one-dimensional) subspace, are well-understood, they rely on tailored algorithms that exploit the specific structure of the target function. In this work, we introduce a natural class of shallow neural networks and study its ability to learn single-index models via gradient flow. More precisely, we consider shallow networks in which biases of the neurons are frozen at random initialization. We show that the corresponding optimization landscape is benign, which in turn leads to generalization guarantees that match the near-optimal sample complexity of dedicated semi-parametric methods."}}

In this paper, we provide a rigorous study of the capabilities and limitations of RCSL something which is crucially missing in previous work. We find that RCSL returns the optimal policy under a set of assumptions that are stronger than those needed for the more traditional dynamic programming-based algorithms. We provide specific examples of MDPs and datasets that illustrate the necessity of these assumptions and the limits of RCSL. Finally, we present empirical evidence that these limitations will also cause issues in practice by providing illustrative experiments in simple point-mass environments and on datasets from the D4RL benchmark."}}

It has been approached with many techniques, such as manifold learning, diffusion maps, or more recently self-supervised learning. Those techniques are arguably all based on the underlying assumption that target functions, associated with future downstream tasks, have low variations in densely populated regions of the input space. Unveiling minimal variations as a guiding principle behind unsupervised representation learning paves the way to better practical guidelines for self-supervised learning algorithms."}}
