These updates usually increase model performance, but may introduce backward compatibility errors, where individual users or groups of users see their performance on the updated model adversely affected. This problem can also be present when training datasets do not accurately reflect overall population demographics, with some groups having overall lower participation in the data collection process, posing a significant fairness concern. We analyze how ideas from distributional robustness and minimax fairness can aid backward compatibility in this scenario, and propose two methods to directly address this issue. Our theoretical analysis is backed by experimental results on CIFAR-10, CelebA, and Waterbirds, three standard image classification datasets."}}

The goal of the competition is to classify a citation in a scientific article based on its purpose. This task is important because it could potentially lead to more comprehensive ways of summarizing the purpose and uses of scientific articles, but it is also difficult, mainly due to the limited amount of available training data in which the purposes of each citation have been hand-labeled, along with the subjectivity of these labels. Our entry in the competition is a multi-task model that combines multiple modules designed to handle the problem from different perspectives, including hand-generated linguistic features, TF-IDF features, and an LSTM-with-attention model. We also provide an ablation study and feature analysis whose insights could lead to future work."}}

One strategy to achieve this goal is to detect the small motion of breathing, which is a consistent indicator of human presence. Among the many smart sensing schemes proposed, microwave and RF sensors have shown great promise due to their simplicity, privacy, and effective range. In this paper, we propose the use of a dynamic metasurface antenna (DMAs) as an alternative hardware platform for sensing motion inside a residential setting using microwave signals. The proposed device is a single-port planar cavity that excites an array of electronically-tunable metamaterial elements. The DMA can generate spatially diverse patterns at a single frequency, avoiding complexities related to wideband operation or high hardware costs of antenna arrays. We demonstrate that it is capable of detecting minute movements, such as breathing emulated by a mannequin, to distinguish human presence. This motion can be detected whether the target is in the the sensor's direct line of sight or out of the direct line of sight. Furthermore, we show that the DMA sensing platform requires a single noise-floor calibration and can operate in different room geometries or configurations (e.g. when furniture is displaced). The proposed DMA-sensor with its single frequency operation and simple hardware is an appealing alternative hardware for intruder detection, human presence detection/activity recognition in smart homes, or seamless health monitoring."}}
