In order to ensure safe and error-free operation, it is necessary to identify the correct configuration, along with their valid bounds and rules, which are commonly referred to as software specifications. As software systems grow in complexity and scale, the number of configurations and associated specifications required to ensure the correct operation can become large and prohibitively difficult to manipulate manually. Due to the fast pace of software development, it is often the case that correct software specifications are not thoroughly checked or validated within the software itself. Rather, they are frequently discussed and documented in a variety of external sources, including software manuals, code comments, and online discussion forums. Therefore, it is hard for the system administrator to know the correct specifications of configurations due to the lack of clarity, organization, and a centralized unified source to look at. To address this challenge, we propose SpecSyn a framework that leverages a state-of-the-art large language model to automatically synthesize software specifications from natural language sources. Our approach formulates software specification synthesis as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem and investigates the extraction of specifications from large contextual texts. This is the first work that uses a large language model for end-to-end specification synthesis from natural language texts. Empirical results demonstrate that our system outperforms prior the state-of-the-art specification synthesis tool by 21% in terms of F1 score and can find specifications from single as well as multiple sentences."}}

The effectiveness of fine-tuning is limited by the inclusion of training examples that negatively affect performance. Here we present Information Gain Filtration, a general fine-tuning method, for improving the overall final performance of a fine-tuned model. We define Information Gain of an example as the improvement on a validation metric after training on that example. A secondary learner is then trained to approximate this quantity. During fine-tuning, this learner filters informative examples from uninformative ones. We show that our method is robust and has consistent improvement across datasets, fine-tuning tasks, and language model architectures. "}}

The general approach of pruning aims at enforcing sparsity on the obtained model, with minimal accuracy loss, but with a sparsity structure that enables acceleration on hardware. The sparsity can be enforced on either the weights or activations of the network, and existing works tend to focus on either one for the entire network. In this paper, we suggest a strategy based on Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to sparsify both activations and weights throughout the network, while utilizing the recent approach of N:M fine-grained structured sparsity that enables practical acceleration on dedicated GPUs. We show that a combination of weight and activation pruning is superior to each option separately. Furthermore, during the training, the choice between pruning the weights of activations can be motivated by practical inference costs (e.g., memory bandwidth). We demonstrate the efficiency of the approach on several image classification datasets."}}

Most existing approaches formulate program synthesis as a search problem with discrete parameters. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of program synthesis as a continuous optimization problem and use a state-of-the-art evolutionary approach, known as Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy to solve the problem. We then propose a mapping scheme to convert the continuous formulation into actual programs. We compare our system, called GENESYS, with several recent program synthesis techniques (in both discrete and continuous domains) and show that GENESYS synthesizes more programs within a fixed time budget than those existing schemes. For example, for programs of length 10, GENESYS synthesizes 28% more programs than those existing schemes within the same time budget."}}

Earlier work has demonstrated that dependencies in natural language tend to decay with distance between words according to a power law. However, it is unclear how this knowledge can be used for analyzing or designing neural network language models. In this work, we derived a theory for how the memory gating mechanism in long short-term memory (LSTM) language models can capture power law decay. We found that unit timescales within an LSTM, which are determined by the forget gate bias, should follow an Inverse Gamma distribution. Experiments then showed that LSTM language models trained on natural English text learn to approximate this theoretical distribution. Further, we found that explicitly imposing the theoretical distribution upon the model during training yielded better language model perplexity overall, with particular improvements for predicting low-frequency (rare) words. Moreover, the explicit multi-timescale model selectively routes information about different types of words through units with different timescales, potentially improving model interpretability. These results demonstrate the importance of careful, theoretically-motivated analysis of memory and timescale in language models."}}

Despite improvements in long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), the forgetting mechanism results in the exponential decay of information, limiting their capacity to capture long-timescale information. Here, we propose a power law forget gate, which instead learns to forget information along a slower power law decay function. Specifically, the new gate learns to control the power law decay factor, p, allowing the network to adjust the information decay rate according to task demands. Our experiments show that an LSTM with power law forget gates (pLSTM) can effectively capture long-range dependencies beyond hundreds of elements on image classification, language modeling, and categorization tasks, improving performance over the vanilla LSTM. We also inspected the revised forget gate by varying the initialization of p, setting p to a fixed value, and ablating cells in the pLSTM network. The results show that the information decay can be controlled by the learnable decay factor p, which allows pLSTM to achieve its superior performance. Altogether, we found that LSTM with the proposed forget gate can learn long-term dependencies, outperforming other recurrent networks in multiple domains; such gating mechanism can be integrated into other architectures for improving the learning of long timescale information in recurrent neural networks."}}
