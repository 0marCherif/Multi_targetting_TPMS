Information-Theoretic Temporal Saliency for Counterfactual Explanations of Probabilistic Forecasts", "abstract": "Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series is significant to several research domains where multiple futures exist for a single observed sequence. Identifying the observations on which a well-performing model bases its forecasts can enable domain experts to form data-driven hypotheses about the causal relationships between features. Consequently, we begin by revisiting the question: what constitutes a causal explanation? One hurdle in the landscape of explainable artificial intelligence is that what constitutes an explanation is not well-grounded. We build upon Miller's framework of explanations derived from research in multiple social science disciplines, and establish a conceptual link between counterfactual reasoning and saliency-based explanation techniques. However, the complication is a lack of a consistent and principled notion of saliency. Also, commonly derived saliency maps may be inconsistent with the data generation process and the underlying model. We therefore leverage a unifying definition of information-theoretic saliency grounded in preattentive human visual cognition and extend it to forecasting settings. In contrast to existing methods that require either explicit training of the saliency mechanism or access to the internal parameters of the underlying model, we obtain a closed-form solution for the resulting saliency map for commonly used density functions in probabilistic forecasting. To empirically evaluate our explainability framework in a principled manner, we construct a synthetic dataset of conversation dynamics and demonstrate that our method recovers the true salient timesteps for a forecast given a well-performing underlying model."}}

In the absence of a formal definition, most studies operationalize the notion of a conversation group either through a spatial or a temporal lens. Spatially, the most commonly used representation is the F-formation, defined by social scientists as the configuration in which people arrange themselves to sustain an interaction. However, the use of this representation is often accompanied with the simplifying assumption that a single conversation occurs within an F-formation. Temporally, various categories have been used to organize conversational units; these include, among others, turn, topic, and floor. Some of these concepts are hard to define objectively by themselves. The present work constitutes an initial exploration into unifying these perspectives by primarily posing the question: can we use the observation of simultaneous speaker turns to infer whether multiple conversation floors exist within an F-formation? We motivate a metric for the existence of distinct conversation floors based on simultaneous speaker turns, and provide an analysis using this metric to characterize conversations across F-formations of varying cardinality. We contribute two key findings: firstly, at the average speaking turn duration of about two seconds for humans, there is evidence for the existence of multiple floors within an F-formation; and secondly, an increase in the cardinality of an F-formation correlates with a decrease in duration of simultaneous speaking turns."}}

In uncontrolled free-standing conversation settings, where participants are free to walk around, these solutions are unsuitable. While wireless solutions are employed in the broadcasting industry, they can be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we propose a modular and cost-effective wireless approach for synchronized multisensor data acquisition of social human behavior. Our core idea involves a cost-accuracy trade-off by using Network Time Protocol (NTP) as a source reference for all sensors. While commonly used as a reference in ubiquitous computing, NTP is widely considered to be insufficiently accurate as a reference for video applications, where Precision Time Protocol (PTP) or Global Positioning System (GPS) based references are preferred. We argue and show, however, that the latency introduced by using NTP as a source reference is adequate for human behavior research, and the subsequent cost and modularity benefits are a desirable trade-off for applications in this domain. We also describe one instantiation of the approach deployed in a real-world experiment to demonstrate the practicality of our setup in-the-wild."}}

To address these, following a 'datasets for the community by the community' ethos, we propose the Conference Living Lab (ConfLab): a new concept for multimodal multisensor data collection of in-the-wild free-standing social conversations. For the first instantiation of ConfLab described here, we organized a real-life professional networking event at a major international conference. Involving 48 conference attendees, the dataset captures a diverse mix of status, acquaintance, and networking motivations. Our capture setup improves upon the data fidelity of prior in-the-wild datasets while retaining privacy sensitivity: 8 videos (1920x1080, 60 fps) from a non-invasive overhead view, and custom wearable sensors with onboard recording of body motion (full 9-axis IMU), privacy-preserving low-frequency audio (1250 Hz), and Bluetooth-based proximity. Additionally, we developed custom solutions for distributed hardware synchronization at acquisition, and time-efficient continuous annotation of body keypoints and actions at high sampling rates. Our benchmarks showcase some of the open research tasks related to in-the-wild privacy-preserving social data analysis: keypoints detection from overhead camera views, skeleton-based no-audio speaker detection, and F-formation detection."}}

These involve identifying predictive relationships between low level nonverbal cues and future semantic events of interest (e.g. turn changes, group leaving). A common hurdle however, is the limited availability of labeled data for supervised learning. In this work, we take the first step in the direction of a bottom-up self-supervised approach in the domain. We formulate the task of Social Cue Forecasting to leverage the larger amount of unlabeled low-level behavior cues, and characterize the modeling challenges involved. To address these, we take a meta-learning approach and propose the Social Process (SP) models\u2014socially aware sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models within the Neural Process (NP) family. SP models learn extractable representations of non-semantic future cues for each participant, while capturing global uncertainty by jointly reasoning about the future for all members of the group. Evaluation on synthesized and real-world behavior data shows that our SP models achieve higher log-likelihood than the NP baselines, and also highlights important considerations for applying such techniques within the domain of social human interactions."}}
