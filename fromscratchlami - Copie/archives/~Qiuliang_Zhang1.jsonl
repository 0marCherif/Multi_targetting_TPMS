Although they achieve superior performances in many tasks, propagation-based GNNs possess three essential drawbacks. Firstly, the propagation tends to produce smooth effect, which meets the inductive bias of homophily, and causes two serious issues: over-smoothing issue and performance drop on networks with heterophily. Secondly, the propagations to each node are irrelevant, which prevents GNNs from modeling high-order relation, and cause the GNNs fragile to the attributes noises. Thirdly, propagation-based GNNs may be fragile to topology noise, since they heavily relay on propagation over the topology. Therefore, the propagation, as the key component of most GNNs, may be the essence of some serious issues in GNNs. To get to the root of these issue, this paper attempts to replace the propagation with a novel local operation. Quantitative experimental analysis reveals: 1) the existence of low-rank characteristic in the node attributes from ego-networks and 2) the performance improvement by reducing its rank. Motivated by this finding, this paper propose the Low-Rank GNNs, whose key component is the low-rank attribute matrix approximation in ego-network. The graph topology is employed to construct the ego-networks instead of message propagation, which is sensitive to topology noises. The proposed Low-Rank GNNs posses some attractive characteristics, including robust to topology and attribute noises, parameter-free and parallelizable. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance, robustness to noises and universality of the proposed Low-Rank GNNs."}}

Unfortunately, most of them suffer a common and fatal drawback: irrelevant propagation to one node and in multi-channels. These two kinds of irrelevances make propagation weights in multi-channels free to be determined by the labeled data, and thus the GNNs are exposed to overfitting. To tackle this issue, a novel Orthogonal Propagation with Ego-Network modeling (OPEN) is proposed by modeling relevances between propagations. Specifically, the relevance between propagations to one node is modeled by whole ego-network modeling, while the relevance between propagations in multi-channels is modeled via diversity requirement. By interpreting the propagations to one node from the perspective of dimension reduction, propagation weights are inferred from principal components of the ego-network, which are orthogonal to each other. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations reveal four attractive characteristics of OPEN as modeling high-order relationships beyond pairwise one, preventing overfitting, robustness, and high efficiency.
