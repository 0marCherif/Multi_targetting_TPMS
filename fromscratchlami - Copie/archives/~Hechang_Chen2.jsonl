In this research, we investigate human action recognition in still images and utilize deep ensemble learning to automatically decompose the body pose and perceive its background information. Firstly, we construct an end-to-end NCNN-based model by attaching the nonsequential convolutional neural network (NCNN) module to the top of the pretrained model. The nonsequential network topology of NCNN can separately learn the spatial- and channel-wise features with parallel branches, which helps improve the model performance. Subsequently, in order to further exploit the advantage of the nonsequential topology, we propose an end-to-end deep ensemble learning based on the weight optimization (DELWO) model. It contributes to fusing the deep information derived from multiple models automatically from the data. Finally, we design the deep ensemble learning based on voting strategy (DELVS) model to pool together multiple deep models with weighted coefficients to obtain a better prediction. More importantly, the model complexity can be reduced by lessening the number of trainable parameters, thereby effectively mitigating overfitting issues of the model in small datasets to some extent. We conduct experiments in Li\u2019s action dataset, uncropped and 1.5x cropped Willow action datasets, and the results have validated the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed models in terms of mitigating overfitting issues in small datasets. Finally, we open source our code for the model in GitHub (https://github.com/yxchspring/deep_ensemble_learning) in order to share our model with the community."}}

Benefiting from the transfer learning, the pre-trained CNN model can provide a reliable initial solution for model optimization of medical image classification. A key concern in breast cancer histology classification is that the model should cover the multi-scale features including nuclei-scale, nuclei organization, and structure-scale features. Inspired by these conjectures, we proposed a novel fusion convolutional neural network (FCNN) based on pre-trained VGG19. The FCNN fuses the shallow, intermediate abstract, and abstract layers to approximately cover the multi-scale features. In order to improve the sensitivity of carcinoma classes, the prediction priority is introduced to enable the lesions can be detected as early as possible. Experimental results show that the proposed FCNN can approximately cover the nuclei-scale, nuclei organization, and structure-scale features. Accuracies of 85%, 75%, and 80.56% are achieved in Initial, Extended, and Overall test set, respectively.

Does there exist better policies outside of this space? By using a novel surrogate objective that employs the sigmoid function (which provides an interesting way of exploration), we found that the answer is \"YES'', and the better policies are in fact located very far from the clipped space. We show that PPO is insufficient in \"off-policyness'', according to an off-policy metric called DEON. Our algorithm explores in a much larger policy space than PPO, and it maximizes the Conservative Policy Iteration (CPI) objective better than PPO during training. To the best of our knowledge, all current PPO methods have the clipping operation and optimize in the clipped policy space. Our method is the first of this kind, which advances the understanding of CPI optimization and policy gradient methods. Code is available at https://github.com/raincchio/P3O."}}

However, learning an optimal SBM for a given network is an NP-hard problem. This results in significant limitations when it comes to applications of SBMs in large-scale networks, because of the significant computational overhead of existing SBM models, as well as their learning methods. Reducing the cost of SBM learning and making it scalable for handling large-scale networks, while maintaining the good theoretical properties of SBM, remains an unresolved problem. In this work, we address this challenging task from a novel perspective of model redefinition. We propose a novel redefined SBM with Poisson distribution and its block-wise learning algorithm that can efficiently analyse large-scale networks. Extensive validation conducted on both artificial and real-world data shows that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of a reasonable trade-off between accuracy and scalability."}}

However, existing models lack representation and inference abilities compared with those of pathologists, especially in cancer subtype diagnosis, which is unconvincing in clinical practice. For instance, pathologists typically observe the lesions of a slide from global to local, and then can give a diagnosis based on their knowledge and experience. In this paper, we propose a Data and Knowledge Co-driving (D&K) model to replicate the process of cancer subtype classification on a histopathological slide like a pathologist. Specifically, in the data-driven module, the bagging mechanism in ensemble learning is leveraged to integrate the histological features from various bags extracted by the embedding representation unit. Furthermore, a knowledge-driven module is established based on the Gestalt principle in psychology to build the three-dimensional (3D) expert knowledge space and map histological features into this space for metric. Then, the diagnosis can be made according to the Euclidean distance between them. Extensive experimental results on both public and in-house datasets demonstrate that the D&K model has a high performance and credible results compared with the state-of-the-art methods for diagnosing histopathological subtypes.

MDP is limited by the Markovian assumption that a reward only depends on the immediate state and action. However, a reward sometimes depends on the history of states and actions, which may result in the decision process in a non-Markovian environment. In such environments, agents receive rewards via temporally-extended behaviors sparsely, and the learned policies may be similar. This leads the agents acquired with similar policies generally overfit to the given task and can not quickly adapt to perturbations of environments. To resolve this problem, this paper tries to learn the diverse policies from the history of state-action pairs under a non-Markovian environment, in which a policy dispersion scheme is designed for seeking diverse policy representation. Specifically, we first adopt a transformer-based method to learn policy embeddings. Then, we stack the policy embeddings to construct a dispersion matrix to induce a set of diverse policies. Finally, we prove that if the dispersion matrix is positive definite, the dispersed embeddings can effectively enlarge the disagreements across policies, yielding a diverse expression for the original policy embedding distribution. Experimental results show that this dispersion scheme can obtain more expressive diverse policies, which then derive more robust performance than recent learning baselines under various learning environments."}}

However, most of the existing studies are focused on the networks with a single structure, e.g., community or bipartite, while ignoring multiple structures, e.g., the coexistence of community and bipartite structures. Furthermore, existing studies were faced with challenge regarding large-scale signed networks due to their high time complexity, especially when determining the number of clusters in the observed network without any prior knowledge. In view of this, we propose a mathematically principled method for signed network multiple structure discovery named the Signed Stochastic Block Model (SSBM). The SSBM can capture the multiple structures contained in signed networks, e.g., community, bipartite, and coexistence of them, by adopting a probabilistic model. Moreover, by integrating the minimum message length (MML) criterion and component-wise EM (CEM) algorithm, a scalable learning algorithm that has the ability of model selection is proposed to handle large-scale signed networks. By comparing state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world signed networks, extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SSBM in discovering large-scale exploratory signed networks with multiple structures."}}

A series of popular deep learning methods have recently been introduced to learn nuance features from RS for binary classifications and achieved outstanding performance than conventional machine learning methods. However, these existing deep learning methods still confront some challenges in classifying subtypes of CVD. For example, the nuance between subtypes is quite hard to capture and represent by intelligent models due to the chillingly similar shape of RS sequences. Moreover, medical history information is an essential resource for distinguishing subtypes, but they are underutilized. In light of this, we propose a multi-modality multi-scale model called M3S, which is a novel deep learning method with two core modules to address these issues. First, we convert RS data to various resolution images by the Gramian angular field (GAF) to enlarge nuance, and a two-branch structure is leveraged to get embeddings for distinction in the multi-scale feature extraction module. Second, a probability matrix and a weight matrix are used to enhance the classification capacity by combining the RS and medical history data in the multi-modality data fusion module. We perform extensive evaluations of M3S and found its outstanding performance on our in-house dataset, with accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score of 0.9330, 0.9379, 0.9291, 0.9752, and 0.9334, respectively. These results demonstrate that the M3S has high performance and robustness compared with popular methods in diagnosing CVD subtypes."}}
