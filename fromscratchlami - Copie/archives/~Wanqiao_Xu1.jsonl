We propose a natural constraint on exploration---\\textit{uniformly} outperforming a conservative policy (adaptively estimated from all data observed thus far), up to a per-episode exploration budget.\nWe design a novel algorithm that uses a UCB reinforcement learning policy for exploration, but overrides it as needed to satisfy our exploration constraint with high probability. Importantly, to ensure unbiased exploration across the state space, our algorithm adaptively determines when to explore. We prove that our approach remains conservative while minimizing regret in the tabular setting.\nWe experimentally validate our results on a sepsis treatment task and an HIV treatment task, demonstrating that our algorithm can learn while ensuring good performance compared to the baseline policy for every patient; the latter task also demonstrates that our approach extends to continuous state spaces via deep reinforcement learning."}}

We prove the first regret bounds for reinforcement learning under a general class of risk-sensitive objectives including the popular CVaR objective. Our theory is based on a novel characterization of the CVaR objective as well as a novel optimistic MDP construction."}}
