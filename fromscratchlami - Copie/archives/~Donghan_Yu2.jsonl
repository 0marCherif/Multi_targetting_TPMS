Previous methods either generate logical forms that can be executed over KBs to obtain final answers or predict answers directly. Empirical results show that the former often produces more accurate answers, but it suffers from  non-execution issues due to potential syntactic and semantic errors in the generated logical forms. In this work, we propose a novel framework DecAF that jointly generates both logical forms and direct answers, and then combines the merits of them to get the final answers. Moreover, different from most of the previous methods, DecAF is based on simple free-text retrieval without relying on any entity linking tools --- this simplification eases its adaptation to different datasets. DecAF achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on WebQSP, FreebaseQA, and GrailQA benchmarks, while getting competitive results on the ComplexWebQuestions benchmark."}}

Thus, they can be great supplements to existing pre-trained language models. However, it remains a challenge to efficiently integrate information from KG into language modeling. And the understanding of a knowledge graph requires related context. We propose a novel joint pre-training framework, JAKET, to model both the knowledge graph and language. The knowledge module and language module provide essential information to mutually assist each other: the knowledge module produces embeddings for entities in text while the language module generates context-aware initial embeddings for entities and relations in the graph. Our design enables the pre-trained model to easily adapt to unseen knowledge graphs in new domains. Experiment results on several knowledge-aware NLP tasks show that our proposed framework achieves superior performance by effectively leveraging knowledge in language understanding."}}

Given an input question, the reading module predicts the answer from the relevant passages which are retrieved by the retriever. The recent proposed Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD), which is built on top of the pretrained generative model T5, achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the reading module. Although being effective, it remains constrained by inefficient attention on all retrieved passages which contain a lot of noise. In this work, we propose a novel method KG-FiD, which filters noisy passages by leveraging the structural relationship among the retrieved passages with a knowledge graph. We initiate the passage node embedding from the FiD encoder and then use graph neural network (GNN) to update the representation for reranking. To improve the efficiency, we build the GNN on top of the intermediate layer output of the FiD encoder and only pass a few top reranked passages into the higher layers of encoder and decoder for answer generation. We also apply the proposed GNN based reranking method to enhance the passage retrieval results in the retrieving module. Extensive experiments on common ODQA benchmark datasets (Natural Question and TriviaQA) demonstrate that KG-FiD can improve vanilla FiD by up to 1.5% on answer exact match score and achieve comparable performance with FiD with only 40% of computation cost."}}

Since PLMs capture word semantics in different contexts, the quality of word representations highly depends on word frequency, which usually follows a heavy-tailed distributions in the pre-training corpus. Therefore, the embeddings of rare words on the tail are usually poorly optimized. In this work, we focus on enhancing language model pre-training by leveraging definitions of the rare words in dictionaries (e.g., Wiktionary). To incorporate a rare word definition as a part of input, we fetch its definition from the dictionary and append it to the end of the input text sequence. In addition to training with the masked language modeling objective, we propose two novel self-supervised pre-training tasks on word and sentence-level alignment between input text sequence and rare word definitions to enhance language modeling representation with dictionary. We evaluate the proposed Dict-BERT model on the language understanding benchmark GLUE and eight specialized domain benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dict-BERT can significantly improve the understanding of rare words and boost model performance on various NLP downstream tasks."}}

How to effectively leverage the rich structural information in complex graphs, such as knowledge graphs with heterogeneous types of entities and relations, is a primary open challenge in the field. Most GCN methods are either restricted to graphs with a homogeneous type of edges (e.g., citation links only), or focusing on representation learning for nodes only instead of jointly propagating and updating the embeddings of both nodes and edges for target-driven objectives. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a novel framework, namely the Knowledge Embedding based Graph Convolutional Network (KE-GCN), which combines the power of GCNs in graph-based belief propagation and the strengths of advanced knowledge embedding (a.k.a. knowledge graph embedding) methods, and goes beyond. Our theoretical analysis shows that KE-GCN offers an elegant unification of several well-known GCN methods as specific cases, with a new perspective of graph convolution. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the advantageous performance of KE-GCN over strong baseline methods in the tasks of knowledge graph alignment and entity classification1."}}

How to effectively and efficiently model the triplet-qualifier relationship for prediction tasks such as HKG completion is an open challenge for research. This paper proposes to improve the best-performing method in HKG completion, namely STARE, by introducing two novel revisions: (1) Replacing the computation-heavy graph neural network module with light-weight entity/relation embedding processing techniques for efficiency improvement without sacrificing effectiveness; (2) Adding a qualifier-oriented auxiliary training task for boosting the prediction power of our approach on HKG completion. The proposed approach consistently outperforms STARE in our experiments on three benchmark datasets, with significantly improved computational efficiency."}}
