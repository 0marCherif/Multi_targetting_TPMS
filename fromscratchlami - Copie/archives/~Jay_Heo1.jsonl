However, such a model is prone to overfitting due to scarcity of human annotations, and requires costly retraining. Moreover, it is almost infeasible for the human annotators to examine attentions on tons of instances and features. We tackle these challenges by proposing a sample-efficient attention mechanism and a cost-effective reranking algorithm for instances and features. First, we propose Neural Attention Process (NAP), which is an attention generator that can update its behavior by incorporating new attention-level supervisions without any retraining. Secondly, we propose an algorithm which prioritizes the instances and the features by their negative impacts, such that the model can yield large improvements with minimal human feedback. We validate IAL on various time-series datasets from multiple domains (healthcare, real-estate, and computer vision) on which it significantly outperforms baselines with conventional attention mechanisms, or without cost-effective reranking, with substantially less retraining and human-model interaction cost."}}

For efficient update of the attention generator without retraining, we propose a novel attention mechanism Neural Attention Process (NAP), which can generate stochastic attentions based on scarce training instances, and can incorporate new training instances without retraining. Further, to minimize human interaction cost, we propose a cost-effective algorithm that selects the most negative training instances that yield incorrect and non-intuitive interpretation with influence function and re-rank the attentions on the input features by their uncertainties, such that the annotators label the instances and attentions that are more influential to the prediction first. We validate IAL on multiple datasets from the healthcare domain, on which it not only significantly outperforms other baselines, but also achieves explicitly trained attention for interpretability that agrees well with human interpretation without expensive human labeling procedure."}}

However, attentions may be unreliable since the networks that generate them are often trained in a weakly-supervised manner. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the notion of input-dependent uncertainty to the attention mechanism, such that it generates attention for each feature with varying degrees of noise based on the given input, to learn larger variance on instances it is uncertain about. We learn this Uncertainty-aware Attention (UA) mechanism using variational inference, and validate it on various risk prediction tasks from electronic health records on which our model significantly outperforms existing attention models. The analysis of the learned attentions shows that our model generates attentions that comply with clinicians' interpretation, and provide richer interpretation via learned variance. Further evaluation of both the accuracy of the uncertainty calibration and the prediction performance with \"I don't know'' decision show that UA yields networks with high reliability as well."}}
