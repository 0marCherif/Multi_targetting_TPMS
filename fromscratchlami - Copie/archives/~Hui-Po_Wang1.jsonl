We aim to jointly optimize video downscaling and upscaling as a combined task. Most recent studies focus on image-based solutions, which do not consider temporal information. We present two joint optimization approaches based on invertible neural networks with coupling layers. Our Long Short-Term Memory Video Rescaling Network (LSTM-VRN) leverages temporal information in the low-resolution video to form an explicit prediction of the missing high-frequency information for upscaling. Our Multi-input Multi-output Video Rescaling Network (MIMO-VRN) proposes a new strategy for downscaling and upscaling a group of video frames simultaneously. Not only do they outperform the image-based invertible model in terms of quantitative and qualitative results, but also show much improved upscaling quality than the video rescaling methods without joint optimization. To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt at the joint optimization of video downscaling and upscaling."}}

However, the communication cost between the server and clients has become the major bottleneck for successful deployment. Despite notable progress in gradient compression, the existing quantization methods require further improvement when low-bits compression is applied, especially the overall\nsystems often degenerate a lot when quantization are applied in double directions to compress model weights and gradients. In this work, we propose a simple cosine-based nonlinear quantization and achieve impressive results in compressing round-trip communication costs. We are not only able to compress model weights and gradients at higher ratios than previous methods, but also achieve competing model performance at the same time. Further, our approach is highly suitable for federated learning problems since it has low computational complexity and requires only a little additional data to recover the compressed information. Extensive experiments have been conducted on image classification and brain tumor semantic segmentation using the CIFAR-10, and BraTS datasets where we show state-of-the-art effectiveness and impressive communication efficiency."}}

However, training is resource-intensive for edge devices, and limited network bandwidth is often the main bottleneck. Prior work often overcomes the constraints by condensing the models or messages into compact formats, e.g., by gradient compression or distillation. In contrast, we propose ProgFed, the first progressive training framework for efficient and effective federated learning. It inherently reduces computation and two-way communication costs while maintaining the strong performance of the final models. We theoretically prove that ProgFed converges at the same asymptotic rate as standard training on full models. Extensive results on a broad range of architectures, including CNNs (VGG, ResNet, ConvNets) and U-nets, and diverse tasks from simple classification to medical image segmentation show that our highly effective training approach saves up to 20% computation and up to 63% communication costs for converged models. As our approach is also complimentary to prior work on compression, we can achieve a wide range of trade-offs by combining these techniques, showing reduced communication of up to 50\u00d7 at only 0.1% loss in utility.
