NGSP solves this problem via MAP inference, modeling the posterior probability of a label assignment conditioned on an input shape with a learned likelihood function. To make this search tractable, NGSP employs a neural guide network that learns to approximate the posterior. NGSP finds high-probability label assignments by first sampling proposals with the guide network and then evaluating each proposal under the full likelihood. We evaluate NGSP on the task of fine-grained semantic segmentation of man ufactured 3D shapesfrom PartNet, where shapes have been decomposed into regions that correspond to part instance over-segmentations. We find that NGSP delivers significant performance improvements over comparison methods that (i) use regions to group per-point predictions, (ii) use regions as a self-supervisory signal or (iii) assign labels to regions under alternative formulations. Further, we show that NGSP maintains strong performance even with limited labeled data or noisy input shape regions. Finally, we demonstrate that NGSP can be directly applied to CAD shapes found in online repositories and validate its effectiveness with a perceptual study."}}

GANimator generates motions that resemble the core elements of the original motion, while simultaneously synthesizing novel and diverse movements. Existing data-driven techniques for motion synthesis require a large motion dataset which contains the desired and specific skeletal structure. By contrast, GANimator only requires training on a single motion sequence, enabling novel motion synthesis for a variety of skeletal structures e.g., bipeds, quadropeds, hexapeds, and more. Our framework contains a series of generative and adversarial neural networks, each responsible for generating motions in a specific frame rate. The framework progressively learns to synthesize motion from random noise, enabling hierarchical control over the generated motion content across varying levels of detail. We show a number of applications, including crowd simulation, key-frame editing, style transfer, and interactive control, which all learn from a single input sequence.

Our framework, Text2Mesh, stylizes a 3D mesh by predicting color and local geometric details which conform to a target text prompt. We consider a disentangled representation of a 3D object using a fixed mesh input (content) coupled with a learned neural network, which we term a neural style field network (NSF). In order to modify style, we obtain a similarity score between a text prompt (describing style) and a stylized mesh by harnessing the representational power of CLIP. Text2Mesh requires neither a pre-trained generative model nor a specialized 3D mesh dataset. It can handle low-quality meshes (non-manifold, boundaries, etc.) with arbitrary genus, and does not require UV parameterization. We demonstrate the ability of our technique to synthesize a myriad of styles over a wide variety of 3D meshes.

A key consideration is the skeletal structure that should correspond to the available mocap data, and the shape deformation in the joint regions, which often requires a tailored, pose-specific refinement. In this work, we develop a neural technique for articulating 3D characters using enveloping with a pre-defined skeletal structure which produces high quality pose dependent deformations. Our framework learns to rig and skin characters with the same articulation structure (e.g., bipeds or quadrupeds), and builds the desired skeleton hierarchy into the network architecture. Furthermore, we propose neural blend shapes - a set of corrective pose-dependent shapes which improve the deformation quality in the joint regions in order to address the notorious artifacts resulting from standard rigging and skinning. Our system estimates neural blend shapes for input meshes with arbitrary connectivity, as well as weighting coefficients which are conditioned on the input joint rotations. Unlike recent deep learning techniques which supervise the network with ground-truth rigging and skinning parameters, our approach does not assume that the training data has a specific underlying deformation model. Instead, during training, the network observes deformed shapes and learns to infer the corresponding rig, skin and blend shapes using indirect supervision. During inference, we demonstrate that our network generalizes to unseen characters with arbitrary mesh connectivity, including unrigged characters built by 3D artists. Conforming to standard skeletal animation models enables direct plug-and-play in standard animation software, as well as game engines."}}

Unlike other point up-sampling methods which analyze shapes via local patches, in this work, we learn from global subsets. We repeatedly self-sample the input point cloud with global subsets that are used to train a deep neural network. Specifically, we define source and target subsets according to the desired consolidation criteria (e.g., generating sharp points or points in sparse regions). The network learns a mapping from source to target subsets, and implicitly learns to consolidate the point cloud. During inference, the network is fed with random subsets of points from the input, which it displaces to synthesize a consolidated point set. We leverage the inductive bias of neural networks to eliminate noise and outliers, a notoriously difficult problem in point cloud consolidation. The shared weights of the network are optimized over the entire shape, learning non-local statistics and exploiting the recurrence of local-scale geometries. Specifically, the network encodes the distribution of the underlying shape surface within a fixed set of local kernels, which results in the best explanation of the underlying shape surface. We demonstrate the ability to consolidate point sets from a variety of shapes, while eliminating outliers and noise."}}

Instead of explicitly specifying a prior that encodes the expected shape properties, the prior is defined automatically using the input point cloud, which we refer to as a self-prior. The self-prior encapsulates reoccurring geometric repetitions from a single shape within the weights of a deep neural network. We optimize the network weights to deform an initial mesh to shrink-wrap a single input point cloud. This explicitly considers the entire reconstructed shape, since shared local kernels are calculated to fit the overall object. The convolutional kernels are optimized globally across the entire shape, which inherently encourages local-scale geometric self-similarity across the shape surface. We show that shrink-wrapping a point cloud with a self-prior converges to a desirable solution; compared to a prescribed smoothness prior, which often becomes trapped in undesirable local minima. While the performance of traditional reconstruction approaches degrades in non-ideal conditions that are often present in real world scanning, i.e., unoriented normals, noise and missing (low density) parts, Point2Mesh is robust to non-ideal conditions. We demonstrate the performance of Point2Mesh on a large variety of shapes with varying complexity."}}
