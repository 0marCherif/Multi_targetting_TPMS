Our proposed tri-level optimization framework utilizes \\textit{local} predictors, which are trained on a small amount of data, as well as a fair and class-balanced predictor at the middle and lower levels. To effectively overcome saddle points for minority classes, our lower-level formulation incorporates sharpness-aware minimization. Meanwhile, at the upper level, the framework dynamically adjusts the loss function based on validation loss, ensuring a close alignment between the \\textit{global} predictor and local predictors. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the framework's ability to enhance classification and fairness generalization, potentially resulting in improvements in the generalization bound. Empirical results validate the superior performance of our tri-level framework compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Its goal is to keep the model always performing well even when the features happen to evolve. To tackle this problem, canonical methods assume that the old features will vanish simultaneously and the new features themselves will emerge simultaneously as well. They also assume that there is an overlapping period where old and new features both exist when the feature space starts to change. However, in reality, the feature evolution could be unpredictable, which means that the features can vanish or emerge arbitrarily, causing the overlapping period incomplete. In this article, we propose a novel paradigm: prediction with unpredictable feature evolution (PUFE) where the feature evolution is unpredictable. To address this problem, we fill the incomplete overlapping period and formulate it as a new matrix completion problem. We give a theoretical bound on the least number of observed entries to make the overlapping period intact. With this intact overlapping period, we leverage an ensemble method to take the advantage of both the old and new feature spaces without manually deciding which base models should be incorporated. Theoretical and experimental results validate that our method can always follow the best base models and, thus, realize the goal of learning with feature evolution."}}

Though most studies consider data stream with fixed features, in real practice the features may be evolvable. For example, features of data gathered by limited-lifespan sensors will change when these sensors are substituted by new ones. In this article, we propose a novel learning paradigm: Feature Evolvable Streaming Learning where old features would vanish and new features would occur. Rather than relying on only the current features, we attempt to recover the vanished features and exploit it to improve performance. Specifically, we learn a mapping from the overlapping period to recover old features and then we learn two models from the recovered features and the current features, respectively. To benefit from the recovered features, we develop two ensemble methods. In the first method, we combine the predictions from two models and theoretically show that with the assistance of old features, the performance on new features can be improved and we provide a tighter bound when the loss function is exponentially concave. In the second approach, we dynamically select the best single prediction and establish a better performance guarantee when the best model switches. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the effectiveness of our proposal."}}

The crux of this setting lies in how to establish the relationship among features, such that the learner can enjoy 1) reconstructed information of the missed-out old features and 2) a jump-start of learning new features with educated weight initialization. Unfortunately, existing methods mainly assume a linear mapping relationship among features or that the multivariate joint distribution could be modeled as Gaussians, limiting their applicability to the mixed data streams. To fill the gap, we in this paper propose to model the complex joint distribution underlying mixed data with Gaussian copula, where the observed features with arbitrary marginals are mapped onto a latent normal space. The feature correlation is approximated in the latent space through an online EM process. Two base learners trained on the observed and latent features are ensembled to expedite convergence, thereby minimizing prediction risk in an online setting. Theoretical and empirical studies substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Code is released in https://github.com/xiexvying/OVFM."}}

In this paper, we propose a new setting: Storage-Fit Feature-Evolvable streaming Learning (SF2EL) which incorporates the issue of rarely-provided labels into feature evolution. Our framework is able to fit its behavior for different storage budgets when learning with feature evolvable streams with unlabeled data.

We find that finite-state automaton (FSA) that processes sequential data have a more interpretable inner mechanism according to the definition of interpretability and can be learned from RNNs as the interpretable structure. We propose two methods to learn FSA from RNN based on two different clustering methods. With the learned FSA and via experiments on artificial and real data sets, we find that FSA is more trustable than the RNN from which it learned, which gives FSA a chance to substitute RNNs in applications involving humans' lives or dangerous facilities. Besides, we analyze how the number of gates affects the performance of RNN. Our result suggests that gate in RNN is important but the less the better, which could be a guidance to design other RNNs. Finally, we observe that the FSA learned from RNN gives semantic aggregated states, and its transition graph shows us a very interesting vision of how RNNs intrinsically handle text classification tasks."}}

Several recent works have studied feature evolvable learning. They usually assume that features would not vanish or appear in an arbitrary way. For example, when knowing the battery lifespan, old features and new features represented by data gathered by sensors will disappear and emerge at the same time along with the sensors exchanging simultaneously. However, different sensors would have different lifespans, and thus the feature evolution can be unpredictable. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm: Prediction with Unpredictable Feature Evolution (PUFE). We first complete the unpredictable overlapping period into an organized matrix and give a theoretical bound on the least number of observed entries. Then we learn the mapping from the completed matrix to recover the data from old feature space when observing the data from new feature space. With predictions on the recovered data, our model can make use of the advantage of old feature space and is always comparable with any combinations of the predictions on the current instance. Experiments on the synthetic and real datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. "}}
