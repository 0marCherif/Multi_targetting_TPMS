The proposed architecture, in the setting of standard neural network (NN)-based adaptive control, augments an <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">external working memory</i> to the NN. The controller, through a write operation, writes the hidden layer feature vector of the NN to the external working memory and can also update this information with the observed error in the output. Through a read operation, the controller retrieves information from the working memory to modify the final control signal. First, we consider a simpler estimation problem to theoretically study the effect of an external memory and prove that the estimation accuracy can be improved by incorporating memory. We, then, consider a model reference NN adaptive controller for linear systems with matched uncertainty to implement and illustrate our ideas. We prove that the resulting controller leads to a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">uniformly bounded</i> stable closed-loop system. Through extensive simulations and specific metrics, such as peak deviation and settling time, we show that memory augmentation improves learning significantly. Importantly, we also provide evidence for and insights on the mechanism by which this specific memory augmentation improves learning."}}

OCO offers a very powerful online learning framework for many applications. In this context, we study a specific framework of OCO called OCO with long-term constraints. Long-term constraints are introduced typically as an alternative to reduce the complexity of projection at every update step in online optimization. While many algorithmic advances have been made towards online optimization with long-term constraints, these algorithms typically assume that the sequence of cost functions over a certain  <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$T$ </tex-math></inline-formula>  finite steps that determine the cost to the online learner are adversarially generated. In many circumstances, the sequence of cost functions may not be unrelated, and thus predictable from those observed till a point of time. In this letter, we study the setting where the sequences are predictable. We present a novel algorithm for online optimization with long-term constraints that can leverage such predictability for linear cost functions. We show that, with a predictor that can supply the gradient information of the next function in the sequence, our algorithm can achieve an overall regret and constraint violation rate that is strictly less than the rate that is achievable without prediction."}}

A typical DR mechanism requires the DR manager to assign a baseline to the participating consumer, where the baseline is an estimate of the counterfactual consumption of the consumer had it not been called to provide the DR service. A challenge in estimating baseline is the incentive the consumer has to inflate the baseline estimate. We consider the problem of learning online to estimate the baseline and to optimize the operating costs over a period of time under such incentives. We propose an online learning scheme that employs least-squares for estimation with a perturbation to the reward price (for the DR services or load curtailment) that is designed to balance the exploration and exploitation trade-off that arises with online learning. We show that, our proposed scheme is able to achieve a very low regret of $\\mathcal{O}\\left((\\log{T})^2\\right)$ with respect to the optimal operating cost over $T$ days of the DR program with full knowledge of the baseline, and is individually rational for the consumers to participate. Our scheme is significantly better than the averaging type approach, which only fetches $\\mathcal{O}(T^{1/3})$ regret."}}

An IHR is a collection of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and flexible customers within a certain power system zone, endowed with an agent to match. The key idea is to pick the IHR zones so that the power loss effects within the IHRs can be neglected. This simplifies the overall matching problem into independent IHR-level matching problems, and an upper-level optimal power flow problem to meet the IHR-level upstream flow requirements while respecting the grid constraints. Within each IHR, the agent employs a scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to identify matching solutions such that the customer's service constraints are met. The central agent then solves an optimal power flow problem with the IHRs as the nodes, with their active power flow and reactive power limits, and grid constraints to determine the final flows such that matched power can be delivered to the extent the grid constraints are satisfied. The proposed framework is implemented on a test power distribution system, and multiple case studies are presented to substantiate the welfare efficiency of the proposed solution and the satisfaction of the grid and customers' servicing constraints."}}

The goal in online control is to minimize the regret, defined as the difference between cumulative cost over a period T and the cumulative cost for the best policy from a comparator class. For the setting we consider, we generalize the previously proposed online Disturbance Response Controller (DRC) to the adaptive gradient online Disturbance Response Controller. Using the modified controller, we present novel regret guarantees that improves the established regret guarantees for the same setting. We show that the proposed online learning controller is able to achieve intermediate intermediate regret rates between $\\sqrt T$ and log T for intermediate convex conditions, while it recovers the previously established regret results for general convex controller cost and strongly convex controller cost."}}

We show that our algorithm can achieve a sub-linear regret with respect to the class of Disturbance Action Control (DAC) policies, which are a widely studied class of policies for online control of dynamical systems, for any sub-linear number of changes and very general class of systems: (i) matched disturbance system with general convex cost functions, (ii) general system with linear cost functions. Specifically, a (dynamic) regret of $\\Gamma_T^{1/5}T^{4/5}$ can be achieved for these class of systems, where $\\Gamma_T$ is the number of changes of the underlying system and $T$ is the duration of the control episode. That is, the change point detection approach achieves a sub-linear regret for any sub-linear number of changes, which other previous algorithms such as in \\cite{minasyan2021online} cannot. Numerically, we demonstrate that the change point detection approach is superior to a standard restart approach \\cite{minasyan2021online} and to standard online learning approaches for time-invariant dynamical systems. Our work presents the first regret guarantee for unknown time-varying dynamical systems in terms of a stronger notion of variability like the number of changes in the underlying system.

We show that the HTM is competitive to five state-of-the-art algorithms for anomaly detection. Moreover, for the multi-step prediction in the online setting, the same HTM achieves a low 0.0001 normalized mean square error, a low negative log-likelihood score of 1.5 and is also competitive to six state-of-the-art prediction algorithms. We demonstrate that the same HTM model can be used for <i>both the tasks</i> and can learn online in one-pass, in an unsupervised fashion and adapt to changing statistics. <i>The other state-of-the-art algorithms are either less accurate or are limited to one of the tasks or cannot learn online in one-pass, and adapt to changing statistics.</i>"}}
