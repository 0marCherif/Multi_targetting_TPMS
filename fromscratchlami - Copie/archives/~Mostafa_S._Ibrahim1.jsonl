We present a Hierarchical Relational Network that computes relational representations of people, given graph structures describing potential interactions. Each relational layer is fed individual person representations and a potential relationship graph. Relational representations of each person are created based on their connections in this particular graph. We demonstrate the efficacy of this model by applying it in both supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. First, given a video sequence of people doing a collective activity, the relational scene representation is utilized for multi-person activity recognition. Second, we propose a Relational Autoencoder model for unsupervised learning of features for action and scene retrieval. Finally, a Denoising Autoencoder variant is presented to infer missing people in the scene from their context. Empirical results demonstrate that this approach learns relational feature representations that can effectively discriminate person and group activity classes."}}

We build a deep model to capture these dynamics based on LSTM (long short-term memory) models. To make use of these observations, we present a 2-stage deep temporal model for the group activity recognition problem. In our model, a LSTM model is designed to represent action dynamics of individual people in a sequence and another LSTM model is designed to aggregate person-level information for whole activity understanding. We evaluate our model over two datasets: the Collective Activity Dataset and a new volleyball dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model improves group activity recognition performance compared to baseline methods."}}
