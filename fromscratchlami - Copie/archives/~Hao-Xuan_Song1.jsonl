However, due to the presence of noise and erroneous observations from data capturing devices and the inherently ill-posed nature of non-rigid registration with insufficient information, traditional approaches often produce low-quality geometry with holes, bumps, and misalignments. We propose a novel 3D dynamic reconstruction system, named HDR-Net-Fusion, which learns to simultaneously reconstruct and refine the geometry on the fly with a sparse embedded deformation graph of surfels, using a hierarchical deep reinforcement (HDR) network. The latter comprises two parts: a global HDR-Net which rapidly detects local regions with large geometric errors, and a local HDR-Net serving as a local patch refinement operator to promptly complete and enhance such regions. Training the global HDR-Net is formulated as a novel reinforcement learning problem to implicitly learn the region selection strategy with the goal of improving the overall reconstruction quality. The applicability and efficiency of our approach are demonstrated using a large-scale dynamic reconstruction dataset. Our method can reconstruct geometry with higher quality than traditional methods."}}

Our PLIVox encodes scene priors considering both the local geometry and uncertainty parameterized by a deep neural network. With such deep priors, we are able to perform online implicit 3D reconstruction achieving state-of-the-art camera trajectory estimation accuracy and mapping quality, while achieving better storage efficiency compared with previous online 3D reconstruction approaches."}}

Despite the success in model reduction of CNNs, neural network quantization methods have not yet been studied on GANs, which are mainly faced with the issues of both the effectiveness of quantization algorithms and the instability of training GAN models. In this paper, we start with an extensive study on applying existing successful methods to quantize GANs. Our observation reveals that none of them generates samples with reasonable quality because of the underrepresentation of quantized values in model weights, and the generator and discriminator networks show different sensitivities upon quantization methods. Motivated by these observations, we develop a novel quantization method for GANs based on EM algorithms, named as QGAN. We also propose a multi-precision algorithm to help find the optimal number of bits of quantized GAN models in conjunction with corresponding result qualities. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CelebA show that QGAN can quantize GANs to even 1-bit or 2-bit representations with results of quality comparable to original models."}}
