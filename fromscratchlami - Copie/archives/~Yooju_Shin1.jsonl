In this paper, we present a ranking system that rearranges the favorite items according to the user\u2019s actionsusing a multi-armed bandit algorithm. Our solution ranks items according to the user\u2019s interests and determines which features of each item arerelevant in making investment decisions. Users get an extra method for arranging the stocks, and this will be applicable to other features of a tradingapplication wherever stocks are presented in a list format."}}

Recently, self-training methods have been applied to a dataset with few labels to infer the labels of unlabeled augmented instances. Accelerating this trend for time-series data, fully taking advantage of its sequential nature, we propose a novel data augmentation approach called context-additive augmentation, which allows a target instance to be augmented easily by adding preceding and succeeding instances to form an augmented instance. Unlike the existing augmentation techniques which may alter the target instance by directly perturbing its features, it preserves a target instance as is but still gives various augmented instances with varying contexts. Additionally, we propose a cross-window self-training framework based on the context-additive augmentation. The framework first augments target instances by applying context-varying windows over a given time series. Then, the framework derives reliability-based cross-window labels and uses them to maintain consistency among augmented instances across the windows. Extensive experiments using real datasets show that the framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art self-training methods."}}

A few active learning studies have attempted to deal with this open-set noise for sample selection by filtering out the noisy examples. However, because focusing on the purity of examples in a query set leads to overlooking the informativeness of the examples, the best balancing of purity and informativeness remains an important question. In this paper, to solve this purity-informativeness dilemma in open-set active learning, we propose a novel Meta-Query-Net (MQ-Net) that adaptively finds the best balancing between the two factors. Specifically, by leveraging the multi-round property of active learning, we train MQ-Net using a query set without an additional validation set. Furthermore, a clear dominance relationship between unlabeled examples is effectively captured by MQ-Net through a novel skyline regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple open-set active learning scenarios demonstrate that the proposed MQ-Net achieves 20.14% improvement in terms of accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art methods."}}

Since user interest usually evolves over time, the update strategy should be flexible to quickly catch users' current interest from continuously generated new user-item interactions. Existing update strategies focus either on the importance of each user-item interaction or the learning rate for each recommender parameter, but such one-directional flexibility is insufficient to adapt to varying relationships between interactions and parameters. In this paper, we propose MeLON, a meta-learning based novel online recommender update strategy that supports two-directional flexibility. It is featured with an adaptive learning rate for each parameter-interaction pair for inducing a recommender to quickly learn users' up-to-date interest. The procedure of MeLON is optimized following a meta-learning approach: it learns how a recommender learns to generate the optimal learning rates for future updates. Specifically, MeLON first enriches the meaning of each interaction based on previous interactions and identifies the role of each parameter for the interaction; and then combines these two pieces of information to generate an adaptive learning rate. Theoretical analysis and extensive evaluation on three real-world online recommender datasets validate the effectiveness of MeLON."}}
