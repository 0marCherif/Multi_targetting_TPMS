The asymptotic superlinear convergence rate of these quasi-Newton methods has been extensively studied in the literature, but their explicit finite--time local convergence rate is not fully investigated. In this paper, we provide a finite--time (non-asymptotic) convergence analysis for Broyden quasi-Newton algorithms under the assumptions that the objective function is strongly convex, its gradient is Lipschitz continuous, and its Hessian is Lipschitz continuous at the optimal solution. We show that in a local neighborhood of the optimal solution, the iterates generated by both DFP and BFGS converge to the optimal solution at a superlinear rate of $(1/k)^{k/2}$, where $k$ is the number of iterations. We also prove a similar local superlinear convergence result holds for the case that the objective function is self-concordant. Numerical experiments on several datasets confirm our explicit convergence rate bounds. Our theoretical guarantee is one of the first results that provide a non-asymptotic superlinear convergence rate for quasi-Newton methods."}}

Traditional deterministic and stochastic quasi-Newton methods can be executed to solve such problems; however, it is known that their global convergence rate may not be better than first-order methods, and their local superlinear convergence only appears towards the end of the learning process. In this paper, we use an adaptive sample size scheme that exploits the superlinear convergence of quasi-Newton methods globally and throughout the entire learning process. The main idea of the proposed adaptive sample size algorithms is to start with a small subset of data points and solve their corresponding ERM problem within its statistical accuracy, and then enlarge the sample size geometrically and use the optimal solution of the problem corresponding to the smaller set as an initial point for solving the subsequent ERM problem with more samples. We show that if the initial sample size is sufficiently large and we use quasi-Newton methods to solve each subproblem, the subproblems can be solved superlinearly fast (after at most three iterations), as we guarantee that the iterates always stay within a neighborhood that quasi-Newton methods converge superlinearly. Numerical experiments on various datasets confirm our theoretical results and demonstrate the computational advantages of our method."}}
