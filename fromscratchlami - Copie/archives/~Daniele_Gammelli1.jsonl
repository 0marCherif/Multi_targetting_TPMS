The control of these systems is typically formulated as a large network optimization problem, and reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising approach to solve the open challenges in this space. However, current RL-based approaches exclusively focus on learning from online data, fundamentally ignoring the per-sample-cost of interactions within real-world transportation systems. To address these limitations, we propose to formalize the control of AMoD systems through the lens of offline reinforcement learning and learn effective control strategies via solely offline data, thus readily available to current mobility operators. We further investigate design decisions and provide experiments on real-world mobility systems showing how offline learning allows to recover AMoD control policies that (i) exhibit performance on par with online methods, (ii) drastically improve data efficiency, and (iii) completely eliminate the need for complex simulated environments. Crucially, this paper demonstrates that offline reinforcement learning is a promising paradigm for the application of RL-based solutions within economically-critical systems, such as mobility systems."}}

Within this context, time-expansion techniques currently represent a generic approach for solving control problems over dynamic networks. However, the complexity of these methods does not allow traditional approaches to scale to large networks, especially when these need to be solved recursively over a receding horizon (e.g., to yield a sequence of actions in model predictive control). Moreover, tractable optimization-based approaches are often limited to simple linear deterministic settings and are not able to handle environments with stochastic, non-linear, or unknown dynamics. In this work, we present dynamic network flow problems through the lens of reinforcement learning and propose a graph network-based framework that can handle a wide variety of problems and learn efficient algorithms without significantly compromising optimality. Instead of a naive and poorly-scalable formulation, in which agent actions (and thus network outputs) consist of actions on edges, we present a two-phase decomposition. The first phase consists of an RL agent specifying desired outcomes to the actions. The second phase exploits the problem structure to solve a convex optimization problem and achieve (as best as possible) these desired outcomes. This formulation leads to dramatically improved scalability and performance. We further highlight a collection of features that are potentially desirable to system designers, investigate design decisions, and present experiments showing the utility, scalability, and flexibility of our framework."}}

In this paper, as in the case of missing data, we argue that exploiting correlations between multiple outputs can enable models to better address the bias introduced by censored data. To do so, we introduce a heteroscedastic multi-output Gaussian process model which combines the non-parametric flexibility of GPs with the ability to leverage information from correlated outputs under input-dependent noise conditions. To address the resulting inference intractability, we further devise a variational bound to the marginal log-likelihood suitable for stochastic optimization. We empirically evaluate our model against other generative models for censored data on both synthetic and real world tasks and further show how it can be generalized to deal with arbitrary likelihood functions. Results show how the added flexibility allows our model to better estimate the underlying non-censored (i.e. true) process under potentially complex censoring dynamics."}}

Current learning-based approaches for controlling AMoD systems are limited to the single-city scenario, whereby the service operator is allowed to take an unlimited amount of operational decisions within the same transportation system.

In our approach, AMoD controllers are explicitly trained such that a small amount of experience within a new city will produce good system performance.

In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework to control the rebalancing of AMoD systems through graph neural networks. Crucially, we demonstrate that graph neural networks enable reinforcement learning agents to recover behavior policies that are significantly more transferable, generalizable, and scalable than policies learned through other approaches.

Crucially, the efficiency of an MoD system highly depends on how well supply and demand distributions are aligned in spatio-temporal space (i.e., to satisfy user demand, cars have to be available in the correct place and at the desired time). When modelling urban mobility as temporal sequences, current approaches typically rely on either (i) a spatial discretization (e.g. ConvLSTMs), or (ii) a Gaussian mixture model to describe the conditional output distribution.\nIn this paper, we argue that both of these approaches could exhibit structural limitations when faced with highly complex data distributions such as for urban mobility densities. To address this issue, we introduce recurrent flow networks which combine deterministic and stochastic recurrent hidden states with conditional normalizing flows and show how the added flexibility allows our model to generate distributions matching potentially complex urban topologies.
