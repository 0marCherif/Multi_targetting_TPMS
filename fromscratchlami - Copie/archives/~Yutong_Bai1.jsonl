However, we uncover a striking contradiction to this promise: at the first few choices, active learning fails to select data as efficiently as random selection. We identify this as the cold start problem in active learning, caused by a biased and outlier initial query. This paper seeks to address the cold start problem and develops a novel active querying strategy, named HaCon, that can exploit the three advantages of contrastive learning: (1) no annotation is required; (2) label diversity is ensured by pseudo-labels to mitigate bias; (3) typical data is determined by contrastive features to reduce outliers. Experiments on three public medical datasets show that HaCon not only significantly outperforms existing active querying strategies but also surpasses random selection by a large margin.

Our approach is simple: in addition to optimizing the pixel reconstruction loss on masked inputs, we minimize the distance between the intermediate feature map of the teacher model and that of the student model. This design leads to a computationally efficient knowledge distillation framework,  given 1) only a small visible subset of patches is used, and 2) the teacher model only needs to forward propagate inputs through the first few layers for obtaining intermediate feature maps. \n\nCompared to directly distilling fine-tuned models, distilling pre-trained models substantially improves the performance of downstream representation learning, meanwhile incurring little extra pre-training cost. For example, by distilling the knowledge from an MAE pre-trained ViT-L into a ViT-B, our method achieves an 84.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, outperforming the baseline of distilling a fine-tuned ViT-L by 1.2%, with no extra training time at all. More interestingly, our method can robustly tackle different masking ratios: e.g., by pushing to the extreme 95% masking ratio where merely TEN patches are visible during distillation, our ViT-B still secures a top-1 accuracy of 83.8%, meanwhile further reducing total training time by 13% of that of the distilling during fine-tuning baseline.

Specifically, in terms of robustness on out-of-distribution samples, recent research finds that Transformers are inherently more robust than CNNs, regardless of different training setups. Moreover, it is believed that such superiority of Transformers should largely be credited to their \\emph{self-attention-like architectures per se}. In this paper, we question that belief by closely examining the design of Transformers. Our findings lead to three highly effective architecture designs for boosting robustness, yet simple enough to be implemented in several lines of code, namely a) patchifying input images, b) enlarging kernel size, and c) reducing activation layers and normalization layers. Bringing these components together, we are able to build pure CNN architectures without any attention-like operations that are as robust as, or even more robust than, Transformers. We hope this work can help the community better understand the design of robust neural architectures. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/RobustCNN."}}

Nonetheless, AdvProp suffers from the extremely slow training speed, mainly because: a) extra forward and backward passes are required for generating adversarial examples; b) both original samples and their adversarial counterparts are used for training (i.e., 2X data).  In this paper, we introduce Fast AdvProp, which aggressively revamps AdvProp's costly training components, rendering the method nearly as cheap as the vanilla training. Specifically, our modifications in Fast AdvProp are guided by the hypothesis that disentangled learning with adversarial examples is the key for performance improvements, while other training recipes (e.g., paired clean and adversarial training samples, multi-step adversarial attackers) could be largely simplified.   \n\nOur empirical results show that, compared to the vanilla training baseline, Fast AdvProp is able to further model performance on a spectrum of visual benchmarks, without incurring extra training cost. Additionally, our ablations find Fast AdvProp scales better if larger models are used, is compatible with existing data augmentation methods (i.e., Mixup and CutMix), and can be easily adapted to other recognition tasks like object detection.

", "abstract": "Transformer emerges as a powerful tool for visual recognition. In addition to demonstrating competitive performance on a broad range of visual benchmarks,  recent works also argue that Transformers are much more robust than Convolutions Neural Networks (CNNs). Nonetheless, surprisingly, we find these conclusions are drawn from unfair experimental settings, where Transformers and CNNs are compared at different scales and are applied with distinct training frameworks. In this paper, we aim to provide the first fair & in-depth comparisons between Transformers and CNNs, focusing on robustness evaluations. \n\nWith our unified training setup, we first challenge the previous belief that Transformers outshine CNNs when measuring adversarial robustness. More surprisingly, we find CNNs can easily be as robust as Transformers on defending against adversarial attacks, if they properly adopt Transformers' training recipes. While regarding generalization on out-of-distribution samples, we show pre-training on (external) large-scale datasets is not a fundamental request for enabling Transformers to achieve better performance than CNNs. Moreover, our ablations suggest such stronger generalization is largely benefited by the Transformer's self-attention-like architectures per se, rather than by other training setups. We hope this work can help the community better understand and benchmark the robustness of Transformers and CNNs.

However, the advantages of vision Transformers also come with a price: Self-attention, the core part of Transformer, has a quadratic complexity to the input sequence length. This leads to a dramatic increase of computation and memory cost with the increase of sequence length, thus introducing difficulties when applying Transformers to the vision tasks that require dense predictions based on high-resolution feature maps.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a new vision Transformer, named Glance-and-Gaze Transformer (GG-Transformer), to address the aforementioned issues. It is motivated by the Glance and Gaze behavior of human beings when recognizing objects in natural scenes, with the ability to efficiently model both long-range dependencies and local context. In GG-Transformer, the Glance and Gaze behavior is realized by two parallel branches: The Glance branch is achieved by performing self-attention on the adaptively-dilated partitions of the input, which leads to a linear complexity while still enjoying a global receptive field; The Gaze branch is implemented by a simple depth-wise convolutional layer, which compensates local image context to the features obtained by the Glance mechanism. We empirically demonstrate our method achieves consistently superior performance over previous state-of-the-art Transformers on various vision tasks and benchmarks."}}

RL algorithms often encounter the difficulty in defining a reward function in a sparse solution space. Imitation learning (IL) deals with this issue by providing a few expert demonstrations, and then either mimicking the expert's behavior (behavioral cloning, BC) or recovering the reward function by assuming the optimality of the expert (inverse reinforcement learning, IRL). Conventional IL approaches formulate the agent policy by mapping one single state to a distribution over actions, which did not consider sequential information. This strategy can be less accurate especially in IL, a weakly supervised learning environment, especially when the number of expert demonstrations is limited.\n\nThis paper presents an effective approach named Sequential IMItation LEarning (SIMILE). The core idea is to introduce sequential information, so that an agent can refer to both the current state and past state-action pairs to make a decision. We formulate our approach into a recurrent model, and instantiate it using LSTM so as to fuse both long-term and short-term information. SIMILE is a generalized IL framework which is easily applied to BL and IRL, two major types of IL algorithms. Experiments are performed on several robot controlling tasks in OpenAI Gym. SIMILE not only achieves performance gain over the baseline approaches, but also enjoys the benefit of faster convergence and better stability of testing performance. These advantages verify a higher learning efficiency of SIMILE, and implies its potential applications in real-world scenarios, i.e., when the agent-environment interaction is more difficult and/or expensive."}}
