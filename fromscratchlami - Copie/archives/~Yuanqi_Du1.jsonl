Gaussian processes have long been a cornerstone of probabilistic machine learning, affording particular advantages for uncertainty quantification and Bayesian optimisation. Extending Gaussian processes to chemical representations, however, is nontrivial, necessitating kernels defined over structured inputs such as graphs, strings and bit vectors. By defining such kernels in GAUCHE, we seek to open the door to powerful tools for uncertainty quantification and Bayesian optimisation in chemistry. Motivated by scenarios frequently encountered in experimental chemistry, we showcase applications for GAUCHE in molecular discovery and chemical reaction optimisation.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce a flexible SBDD method based on an equivariant diffusion model, which was trained via a broadly applicable training objective and could therefore leverage the large and diverse sets of protein-ligand complexes available. Our approach excels in a wide range of SBDD subtasks, including scaffold hopping, fragment merging, and fragment growing, without requiring specialized training. Additionally, it not only generates hits but can also optimize desirable properties of existing hits, such as binding score and synthetic accessibility. Our optimization framework opens up new opportunities for negative design and increasing target specificity. It can be utilized in both a highly automated and manually controlled manner, offering drug discovery scientists fine-grained control. This versatile method has the potential to be valuable for a broad range of molecular design tasks, serving as a foundation for future advancements in the field."}}

Inspired by their proliferation, tremendous efforts have been devoted to pre-trained graph models (PGMs) recently. Owing to its huge model parameters, PGMs can capture abundant knowledge from massive labeled and unlabeled graph data. The knowledge implicitly encoded in model parameters can benefit various downstream tasks and help to alleviate several fundamental issues of learning on graphs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of PGMs. We first briefly present the limitations of graph representation learning and thus introduce the motivation for graph pre-training. Next, we systematically categorize existing PGMs based on a taxonomy from five different perspectives including the history, model architectures, pre-training strategies, tunning strategies, and applications. Finally, we outline several promising research directions that can serve as a guideline for future studies.\n"}}

Machine learning-based approaches can improve such potentials with better transferability and generalization. Among them, graph neural networks have prevailed as they incorporate the graph structure prior while learning the interatomic interactions. Nevertheless, the simple design choices and heuristics in devising graph neural networks make them lack an explicitly interpretable component to identify the true physical interactions within the underlying system. On the other extreme, physical models can give a rather comprehensive description of a system but are hard to specify. Causal modeling lies in between these two extremes, and can provide us with more modeling flexibility. In this paper, we propose a structural causal molecular dynamics model (SCMD), the first causality-based framework to model interatomic and dynamical interactions in molecular systems by inferring causal relationships among atoms from observational data. Specifically, we leverage the structural causal model (SCM) to model the interaction system of MD. To infer the SCM, we construct the graph in SCM as the dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), which is learned by a sequential generative model named SC-VAE. In the SC-VAE, the encoder and decoder infer the causal structure and temporal dynamics. All components are learned in an end-to-end fashion, and the DBN is learned in an unsupervised way. Furthermore, by concerning the underlying data generation process, inducing the causal structure and temporal dynamics of the system, one can enjoy a robust and flexible MD simulation model to explicitly capture the long-range and time-dependent movement dynamics. We demonstrate the efficacy of SCMD through empirical validations on the complex molecular system (i.e., single-chain coarse-grained polymers in implicit solvent) for long-duration simulation and dynamical property prediction."}}

Recently, prosperous progress has been made in molecular pretraining with different molecular featurizations, including 1D SMILES strings, 2D graphs, and 3D geometries. However, the role of molecular featurizations with their corresponding neural architectures in molecular pretraining remains largely unexamined. In this paper, through two case studies\u2014chirality classification and aromatic ring counting\u2014we first demonstrate that different featurization techniques convey chemical information differently. In light of this observation, we propose a simple and effective MOlecular pretraining framework with COmplementary featurizations (MOCO). MOCO comprehensively leverages multiple featurizations that complement each other and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models that solely relies on one or two featurizations on a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks."}}

Sampling such a transition path is computationally expensive due to the existence of high free energy barriers between the two states. To circumvent this, previous work has focused on simplifying the trajectories to occur along specific molecular descriptors called Collective Variables (CVs). However, finding CVs is non trivial and requires chemical intuition. For larger molecules, where intuition is not sufficient, using these CV-based methods biases the transition along possibly irrelevant dimensions. In this work, we propose a method for sampling transition paths that considers the entire geometry of the molecules. We achieve this by relating the problem to recent works on the Schr\\\"odinger bridge problem and stochastic optimal control. Using this relation, we construct a path integral method that incorporates important characteristics of molecular systems such as second-order dynamics and invariance to rotations and translations. We demonstrate our method on commonly studied protein structures like Alanine Dipeptide, and also consider larger proteins such as Polyproline and Chignolin."}}
