Advanced proprietary LLMs, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have shown great potential for tool usage through sophisticated prompt engineering. Nevertheless, these models typically rely on prohibitive computational costs and publicly inaccessible data. To address these challenges, we propose the GPT4Tools based on self-instruct to enable open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and OPT, to use tools. It generates an instruction-following dataset by prompting an advanced teacher with various multi-modal contexts. By using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) optimization, our approach facilitates the open-source LLMs to solve a range of visual problems, including visual comprehension and image generation. Moreover, we provide a benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLMs to use tools, which is performed in both zero-shot and fine-tuning ways. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various language models, which not only significantly improves the accuracy of invoking seen tools, but also enables the zero-shot capacity for unseen tools.

However, existing corpora in this domain share three limitations: (1) annotated in a scene-oriented fashion, they ignore the coherence within plots; (2) their text lacks empathy and seldom mentions situational context; (3) their video clips fail to cover long-form relationship due to short duration. To address these fundamental issues, using 1,106 TV drama episodes and 24,875 informative plot-focused sentences written by professionals, with the help of 449 human annotators, we constructed PTVD, the first plot-oriented multimodal dataset in the TV domain. It is also the first non-English dataset of its kind. Additionally, PTVD contains more than 26 million bullet screen comments (BSCs), powering large-scale pre-training. Next, aiming to open-source a strong baseline for follow-up works, we developed the multimodal algorithm that attacks different cinema/TV modelling problems with a unified architecture. Extensive experiments on three cognitive-inspired tasks yielded a number of novel observations (some of them being quite counter-intuition), further validating the value of PTVD in promoting multimodal research.

They pursue better performance via utilizing heavier unimodal encoders or multimodal fusion Transformers, resulting in increased parameters with lower efficiency in downstream tasks. In this work, we for the first time introduce an end-to-end VLP model, namely all-in-one Transformer, that embeds raw video and textual signals into joint representations using a unified backbone architecture. We argue that the unique temporal information of video data turns out to be a key barrier hindering the design of a modality-agnostic Transformer. To overcome the challenge, we introduce a novel and effective token rolling operation to encode temporal representations from video clips in a non-parametric manner. The careful design enables the representation learning of both video-text multimodal inputs and unimodal inputs using a unified model. Our pretrained ali-in-one Transformer is transferred to various downstream video-text tasks after fine-tuning, including text-video retrieval, video-question answering, multiple choice and video captioning. State-of-the-art performances with the minimal model FLOPs on ten datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the competitive counterparts.

Although breakthroughs have been made in natural language processing and image representation learning, it is still challenging for video models to reach it due to the increasing uncertainty of spatiotemporal signals. To ease training, existing works leverage image foundation models' prior knowledge and equip them with efficient temporal modules. Despite the satisfactory fine-tuning performance, we empirically find they fall short of out-of-the-box usage, given the even degraded performance in zero-shot/linear protocols compared to their baseline counterparts. In this work, we analyze the factor that leads to degradation from the perspective of language supervision distortion. We argue that tuning a text encoder end-to-end, as done in previous work, is suboptimal since it may overfit in terms of styles, thereby losing its original generalization ability to capture the semantics of various language registers. The overfitted text encoder, in turn, provides a harmful supervision signal, degrading the video representation. To tackle this issue, we propose a degradation-free pre-training strategy to retain the generalization ability of the text encoder via freezing shallow layers while enabling the task-related semantics capturing in tunable deep layers. As for the training objective, we adopted the transcript sorting task in TVTS incorporated with masking techniques to enable scalable training. As a result, we produce a series of models, dubbed TVTSv2, with up to one billion parameters. We achieve new state-of-the-arts on various video benchmarks with a frozen backbone, surpassing the recent ImageBind, InternVideo, etc. Code is available at https://github.com/TencentARC/TVTS."}}

However, the potential of such multi-task learners has not been exploited during transfer learning. In this work, we present a universal parameter-efficient transfer learning method, termed Predict-Interpolate Tuning ($\\pi$-Tuning), for vision, language, and vision-language tasks. It aggregates the parameters of lightweight task-specific experts learned from similar tasks to aid the target downstream task. The task similarities are predicted in a unified modality-independent space, yielding a scalable graph to demonstrate task relationships. $\\pi$-Tuning has several appealing benefits. First, it flexibly explores both intra- and inter-modal transferability between similar tasks to improve the accuracy and robustness of transfer learning, especially in data-scarce scenarios. Second, it offers a systematical solution for transfer learning with multi-task prediction-and-then-interpolation, compatible with diverse types of parameter-efficient experts, such as prompt and adapter. Third, an extensive study of task-level mutual benefits on 14 unimodal and 6 multimodal datasets shows that $\\pi$-Tuning surpasses fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient transfer learning methods both in full-shot and low-shot regimes. The task graph also enables an in-depth interpretable analysis of task transferability across modalities. The code will be available at https://github.com/TencentARC/pi-Tuning."}}

In this work, we address the evaluation of generative comprehension in MLLMs as a preliminary step towards a comprehensive assessment of generative models, by introducing a benchmark named SEED-Bench. SEED-Bench consists of 19K multiple choice questions with accurate human annotations (x 6 larger than existing benchmarks), which spans 12 evaluation dimensions including the comprehension of both the image and video modality. We develop an advanced pipeline for generating multiple-choice questions that target specific evaluation dimensions, integrating both automatic filtering and manual verification processes. Multiple-choice questions with groundtruth options derived from human annotation enables an objective and efficient assessment of model performance, eliminating the need for human or GPT intervention during evaluation. We further evaluate the performance of 18 models across all 12 dimensions, covering both the spatial and temporal understanding. By revealing the limitations of existing MLLMs through evaluation results, we aim for SEED-Bench to provide insights for motivating future research. We will launch and consistently maintain a leaderboard to provide a platform for the community to assess and investigate model capability."}}

To facilitate the development of more powerful algorithms for analyzing stickers, we propose a large-scale Chinese sticker dataset, namely Sticker820K, which consists of 820k image-text pairs. Each sticker has rich and high-quality textual annotations, including descriptions, optical characters, emotional labels, and style classifications. Although vision-language tasks in the domain of natural images have been well studied, directly applying the those models, such as CLIP, to sticker data is not an optimal solution due to the discrepant nature between natural and emotive image data. Therefore, we propose StickerCLIP as a benchmark model on the Sticker820K dataset. For the text-to-image retrieval task, our StickerCLIP demonstrates strong superiority over the CLIP, which achieves an absolute gain of 66.0\\% in mean recall on the Sticker820K test set. Additionally, we endeavor to extend the recently popularized LLM by means of prompt tuning, integrating its ability for sticker retrieval and allowing users to retrieve stickers through instructions. We validate the feasibility of this method, demonstrating the immense potential of prompt tuning in expanding LLM abilities while not affecting the quality of upstream tasks."}}

A growing number of applications based on visual foundation models are emerging, including innovative solutions such as BLIP-2. These applications employ pre-trained CLIP models as upstream feature extractors and train various downstream modules to accomplish diverse tasks. In situations involving system upgrades that require updating the upstream foundation model, it becomes essential to re-train all downstream modules to adapt to the new foundation model, which is inflexible and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce a parameter-efficient and task-agnostic adapter, dubbed TaCA, that facilitates compatibility across distinct foundation models while ensuring enhanced performance for the new models. TaCA allows downstream applications to seamlessly integrate better-performing foundation models without necessitating retraining. We conduct extensive experimental validation of TaCA using different scales of models with up to one billion parameters on various tasks such as video-text retrieval, video recognition, and visual question answering. The results consistently demonstrate the emergent ability of TaCA on hot-plugging upgrades for visual foundation models. Codes and models will be available at https://github.com/TencentARC/TaCA."}}
