Previous research on VLN is primarily conducted on the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset with only English instructions.  The ultimate goal of VLN, however, is to serve people speaking arbitrary languages. Towards multilingual VLN with numerous languages, we collect a cross-lingual R2R dataset, which extends the original benchmark with corresponding Chinese instructions. But it is time-consuming and expensive to collect large-scale human instructions for every existing language. Based on the newly introduced dataset, we propose a general cross-lingual VLN framework to enable instruction-following navigation for different languages. We first explore the possibility of building a cross-lingual agent when no training data of the target language is available. The cross-lingual agent is equipped with a meta-learner to aggregate cross-lingual representations and a visually grounded cross-lingual alignment module to align textual representations of different languages. Under the zero-shot learning scenario, our model shows competitive results even compared to a model trained with all target language instructions. In addition, we introduce an adversarial domain adaption loss to improve the transferring ability of our model when given a certain amount of target language data. Our methods and dataset demonstrate the potentials of building a cross-lingual agent to serve speakers with different languages."}}

Previous work hardly considers to explicitly model the positions of generated words. However, position modeling of output words is an essential problem in non-autoregressive text generation. In this paper, we propose PNAT, which explicitly models positions of output words as latent variables in text generation. The proposed PNATis simple yet effective. Experimental results show that PNATgives very promising results in machine translation and paraphrase generation tasks, outperforming many strong baselines."}}
