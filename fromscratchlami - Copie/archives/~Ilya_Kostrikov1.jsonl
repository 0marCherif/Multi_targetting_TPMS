Our system, FastRLAP, trains autonomously in the real world, without human interventions, and without requiring any simulation or expert demonstrations. Our system integrates a number of important components to make this possible: we initialize the representations for the RL policy and value function from a large prior dataset of other robots navigating in other environments (at low speed), which provides a navigation-relevant representation. From here, a sample-efficient online RL method uses a single low-speed user-provided demonstration to determine the desired driving course, extracts a set of navigational checkpoints, and autonomously practices driving through these checkpoints, resetting automatically on collision or failure. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that with appropriate initialization and choice of algorithm, our system can learn to drive over a variety of racing courses with less than 20 minutes of online training. The resulting policies exhibit emergent aggressive driving skills, such as timing braking and acceleration around turns and avoiding areas which impede the robot's motion, approaching the performance of a human driver using a similar first-person interface over the course of training."}}

However, they can be inconsistent when it comes to completing user specified tasks. This issue can be addressed by finetuning such models via supervised learning on curated datasets, or via reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL motivated method, implicit language Q-learning (ILQL), designed for use on language models, that combines both the flexible utility optimization framework of traditional RL algorithms with supervised learning's ability to leverage existing data and its simplicity and stability. Our method, based on dynamic programming, employs a blend of value conservatism alongside an implicit dataset support constraint in learning value functions, which are then used to guide language model generations towards maximizing utility. In addition to empirically validating ILQL, we present a detailed empirical analysis of situations where offline RL can be useful in natural language generation settings, demonstrating how it can be a more effective utility optimizer than prior approaches for end-to-end dialogue, and how it can effectively optimize high variance reward functions based on subjective judgement, such as whether to label a comment as an example of toxic speech or not."}}

In this paper, we attempt to understand the primary bottleneck in sample-efficient deep RL by examining several potential hypotheses such as non-stationarity, excessive action distribution shift, and overfitting. We perform thorough empirical analysis on state-based DeepMind control suite (DMC) tasks in a controlled and systematic way to show that statistical overfitting on the temporal-difference (TD) error is the main culprit that severely affects the performance of deep RL algorithms, and prior methods that lead to good performance do in fact, control the amount of statistical overfitting. This observation gives us a robust principle for making deep RL efficient: we can hill-climb on a notion of validation temporal-difference error by utilizing any form of regularization techniques from supervised learning. We show that a simple online model selection method that targets the statistical overfitting issue is effective across state-based DMC and Gym tasks."}}

To this end, we show how offline reinforcement learning can be used to learn reward-specific value functions for long-horizon navigation that can then be composed with planning methods to reach distant goals, while still remaining responsive to user-specified navigational preferences. This approach can utilize large amounts of previously collected data, which is relabeled with the task reward. This makes it possible to incorporate diverse data sources and enable effective generalization in the real world, without any simulation, task-specific data collection, or demonstrations. We evaluate our system, ReViND, using a large navigational dataset from prior work, without any data collection specifically for the reward functions that we test.
