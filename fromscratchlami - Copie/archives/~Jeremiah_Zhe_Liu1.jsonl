However their practicality in real-time, industrial-scale applications are limited due to their heavy memory and inference cost. This motivates us to study principled approaches to high-quality uncertainty estimation that require only a single deep neural network (DNN). By formalizing the uncertainty quantification as a minimax learning problem, we first identify distance awareness, i.e., the model\u2019s ability to properly quantify the distance of a testing example from the training data manifold, as a necessary condition for a DNN to achieve high-quality (i.e., minimax optimal) uncertainty estimation. We then propose Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a simple method that improves the distance-awareness ability of modern DNNs, by adding a weight normalization step during training and replacing the output layer with a Gaussian Process. On a suite of vision and language understanding tasks and on modern architectures (Wide-ResNet and BERT), SNGP is competitive with deep ensembles in prediction, calibration and out-of-domain detection, and outperforms the other single-model approaches."}}

However, these seq2seq approaches pose a challenge in quantifying the model\u2019s compositional uncertainty on graph structures due to the gap between seq2seq output probability and structural probability on the graph. This work is the first to quantify and evaluate compositional uncertainty for seq2seq graph parsing tasks. First, we proposed a generic, probabilistically interpretable framework that allows correspondences between seq2seq output probability to structural probability on the graph. This framework serves as a powerful medium for quantifying a seq2seq model's compositional uncertainty on graph elements (i.e., nodes or edges). Second, to evaluate uncertainty quality in terms of calibration, we propose a novel metric called Compositional Expected Calibration Error (CECE) which can measure a model\u2019s calibration behavior in predicting graph structures. By a thorough evaluation for compositional uncertainty on three different tasks across ten domains, we demonstrate that CECE is a better reflection for distributional shift compared to vanilla sequence ECE. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of compositional uncertainty considering the task of collaborative semantic parsing, where the model is allowed to send limited subgraphs for human review. The results show that the collaborative performance based on uncertain subgraph selection consistently outperforms random subgraph selection (30% average error reduction rate) and performs comparably to oracle subgraph selection (only 0.33 difference in average prediction error), indicating that compositional uncertainty is an ideal signal for model errors and can benefit various downstream tasks."}}

Probing these models' abilities in diverse ways is therefore critical to the field. In this paper, we explore the reliability of models, where we define a reliable model as one that not only achieves strong predictive performance but also performs well consistently over many decision-making tasks involving uncertainty (e.g., selective prediction, open set recognition), robust generalization (e.g., accuracy and proper scoring rules such as log-likelihood on in- and out-of-distribution datasets), and adaptation (e.g., active learning, few-shot uncertainty). We devise 10 types of tasks over 38 datasets in order to evaluate different aspects of reliability on both vision and language domains. To improve reliability, we developed ViT-Plex and T5-Plex, pretrained large model extensions (plex) for vision and language modalities, respectively. Plex greatly improves the state-of-the-art across reliability tasks, and simplifies the traditional protocol as it does not require designing scores or tuning the model for each individual task. We demonstrate scaling effects over model sizes up to 1B parameters and pretraining dataset sizes up to 4B examples. We also demonstrate Plex's capabilities on challenging tasks including zero-shot open set recognition, active learning, and uncertainty in conversational language understanding."}}

Rigorous Bayesian nonparametric theorems are derived to guarantee the posterior consistency and asymptotic uncertainty of the proposed approach. Extensive  simulations and experiments on healthcare benchmark datasets confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing classical and recent variable selection methods. "}}

Our exploratory study shows overconfident mispredictions are often distant from training data. That leads us to develop distance-aware GNNs: GNN-SNGP. Through evaluation on CardioTox and three established benchmarks, we demonstrate GNN-SNGP's effectiveness in increasing distance-awareness, reducing overconfident mispredictions and making better calibrated predictions without sacrificing accuracy performance. Our ablation study further reveals the embeddings learned by GNN-SNGP improves distance-preservation over its base architecture and is one major factor for improvements.\n\nArxiv link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12951"}}

In this work, we propose the HetSNGP method for jointly modeling the model and data uncertainty. We show that our proposed model affords a favorable combination between these two complementary types of uncertainty and thus outperforms the baseline methods on some challenging out-of-distribution datasets, including CIFAR-100C, Imagenet-C, and Imagenet-A. Moreover, we propose HetSNGP Ensemble, an ensembled version of our method which adds an additional type of uncertainty and also outperforms other ensemble baselines."}}

In particular, we show that, using a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) configuration, one can utilize a single model's capacity to train multiple subnetworks that independently learn the task at hand. By ensembling the predictions made by the subnetworks, we improve model robustness without increasing compute.

The most promising approaches have been predominantly focused on improving model uncertainty (e.g. deep ensembles and Bayesian neural networks) and post-processing techniques for OOD detection (e.g. ODIN and Mahalanobis distance). However, there has been relatively little investigation into how the parametrization of the probabilities in discriminative classifiers affects the uncertainty estimates, and the dominant method, softmax cross-entropy, results in misleadingly high confidences on OOD data and under covariate shift. We investigate alternative ways of formulating probabilities using (1) a one-vs-all formulation to capture the notion of \"none of the above\", and (2) a distance-based logit representation to encode uncertainty as a function of distance to the training manifold. We show that one-vs-all formulations can improve calibration on image classification tasks, while matching the predictive performance of softmax without incurring any additional training or test-time complexity."}}
