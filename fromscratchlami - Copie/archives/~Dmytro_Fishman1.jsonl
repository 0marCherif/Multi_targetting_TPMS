This exciting class of methods, based on artificial neural networks, quickly became popular due to its competitive performance in prediction problems. In pioneering early work, applying simple network architectures to abundant data already provided gains over traditional counterparts in functional genomics, image analysis, and medical diagnostics. Now, ideas for constructing and training networks and even off-the-shelf models have been adapted from the rapidly developing machine learning subfield to improve performance in a range of computational biology tasks. Here, we review some of these advances in the last 2 years."}}

The traditional approach relies on signal from a DNA stain, or fluorescent transgene expression localised to the nucleus. However, imaging techniques that do not use fluorescence can also carry useful information. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to accurately segment nuclei directly from brightfield images using deep learning. We confirmed that three convolutional neural network architectures can be adapted for this task, with U-Net achieving the best overall performance, Mask R-CNN providing an additional benefit of instance segmentation, and DeepCell proving too slow for practical application. We found that accurate segmentation is possible using as few as 16 training images and that models trained on images from similar cell lines can extrapolate well. Acquiring data from multiple focal planes further helps distinguish nuclei in the samples. Overall, our work liberates a fluorescence channel reserved for nuclear staining, thus providing more information from the specimen, and reducing reagents and time required for preparing imaging experiments."}}

The combination of nonspecifc symptoms and invasive laparoscopic diagnostics have\nprompted researchers to evaluate potential biomarkers that would enable a non-invasive diagnosis of\nendometriosis. Endometriosis is an infammatory disease thus diferent cytokines represent potential\ndiagnostic biomarkers. As panels of biomarkers are expected to enable better separation between\npatients and controls we evaluated 40 diferent cytokines in plasma samples of 210 patients (116\npatients with endometriosis; 94 controls) from two medical centres (Slovenian, Austrian). Results of\nthe univariate statistical analysis showed no diferences in concentrations of the measured cytokines\nbetween patients and controls, confrmed by principal component analysis showing no clear separation\namongst these two groups. In order to validate the hypothesis of a more profound (non-linear)\ndiferentiating dependency between features, machine learning methods were used. We trained four\ncommon machine learning algorithms (decision tree, linear model, k-nearest neighbour, random forest)\non data from plasma levels of proteins and patients\u2019 clinical data. The constructed models, however, did\nnot separate patients with endometriosis from the controls with sufcient sensitivity and specifcity.\nThis study thus indicates that plasma levels of the selected cytokines have limited potential for\ndiagnosis of endometriosis."}}

The use of machine learning approaches for autonomous driving has long been studied, but mostly in the context of perception. In this paper we take a deeper look on the so called end-to-end approaches for autonomous driving, where the entire driving pipeline is replaced with a single neural network. We review the learning methods, input and output modalities, network architectures and evaluation schemes in end-to-end driving literature. Interpretability and safety are discussed separately, as they remain challenging for this approach. Beyond providing a comprehensive overview of existing methods, we conclude the review with an architecture that combines the most promising elements of the end-to-end autonomous driving systems."}}

There have been recent calls for more scrutiny on machine learning performance and possible limitations. Here we present a set of community-wide recommendations aiming to help establish standards of machine learning validation in biology. Adopting a structured methods description for machine learning based on DOME (data, optimization, model, evaluation) will allow both reviewers and readers to better understand and assess the performance and limitations of a method or outcome. The recommendations are complemented by a machine learning summary table which can be easily included in the supplementary material of published papers."}}
