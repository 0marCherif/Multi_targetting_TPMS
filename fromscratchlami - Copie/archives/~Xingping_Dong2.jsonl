This approach is model-agnostic and can be combined with supervised algorithms to learn from unlabeled data. However, it often suffers from label inconsistency or limited diversity, which leads to poor performance. In this work, we prove that the core reason for this is lack of a clustering-friendly property in the embedding space. We address this by minimizing the inter- to intra-class similarity ratio to provide clustering-friendly embedding features, and validate our approach through comprehensive experiments. Note that, despite only utilizing a simple clustering algorithm (k-means) in our embedding space to obtain the pseudo-labels, we achieve significant improvement. Moreover, we adopt a progressive evaluation mechanism to obtain more diverse samples in order to further alleviate the limited diversity problem. Finally, our approach is also model-agnostic and can easily be integrated into existing supervised methods. To demonstrate its generalization ability, we integrate it into two representative algorithms: MAML and EP. The results on three main few-shot benchmarks clearly show that the proposed method achieves significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art models. Notably, our approach also outperforms the corresponding supervised method in two tasks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/xingpingdong/PL-CFE ."}}

Intuitively, we find that instruction disentanglement for each viewpoint along the agent\u2019s path is critical for accurate navigation. However, most methods only utilize the whole complex instruction or inaccurate sub-instructions due to the lack of accurate disentanglement as an intermediate supervision stage. To address this problem, we propose a new Disentanglement framework with Decoupled Labels (DDL) for VLN. Firstly, we manually extend the benchmark dataset Room-to-Room with landmark- and action-aware labels in order to provide fine-grained information for each viewpoint. Furthermore, to enhance the generalization ability, we propose a Decoupled Label Speaker module to generate pseudo-labels for augmented data and reinforcement training. To fully use the proposed fine-grained labels, we design a Disentangled Decoding Module to guide discriminative feature extraction and help alignment of multi-modalities. To reveal the generality of our proposed method, we apply it on a LSTM-based model and two recent Transformer-based models. Extensive experiments on two VLN benchmarks (i.e., R2R and R4R) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods."}}

Most recent Siamese-based trackers typically employ a depth-wise cross-correlation (DW-XCorr) to obtain multi-channel correlation information from the two feature maps (target and search region). However, DW-XCorr has several limitations within Siamese-based tracking: it can easily be fooled by distractors, has fewer activated channels, and provides weak discrimination of object boundaries. Further, DW-XCorr is a handcrafted parameter-free module and cannot fully benefit from offline learning on large-scale data. We propose a learnable module, called the asymmetric convolution (ACM), which learns to better capture the semantic correlation information in offline training on large-scale data. Different from DW-XCorr and its predecessor(XCorr), which regard a single feature map as the convolution kernel, our ACM decomposes the convolution operation on a concatenated feature map into two mathematically equivalent operations, thereby avoiding the need for the feature maps to be of the same size (width and height)during concatenation. Our ACM can incorporate useful prior information, such as bounding-box size, with standard visual features. Furthermore, ACM can easily be integrated into existing Siamese trackers based on DW-XCorror XCorr. To demonstrate its generalization ability, we integrate ACM into three representative trackers: SiamFC, SiamRPN++, and SiamBAN.

Selecting appropriate hyperparameters is often critical for achieving satisfactory performance in many vision problems, such as deep learning-based visual object tracking. However, it is often difficult to determine their optimal values, especially if they are specific to each video input. Most hyperparameter optimization algorithms tend to search a generic range and are imposed blindly on all sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamical hyperparameter optimization method that adaptively optimizes hyperparameters for a given sequence using an action-prediction network leveraged on continuous deep Q-learning. Since the observation space for object tracking is significantly more complex than those in traditional control problems, existing continuous deep Q-learning algorithms cannot be directly applied. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an efficient heuristic strategy to handle high dimensional state space, while also accelerating the convergence behavior. The proposed algorithm is applied to improve two representative trackers, a Siamese-based one and a correlation-filter-based one, to evaluate its generalizability. Their superior performances on several popular benchmarks are clearly demonstrated. Our source code is available at https://github.com/shenjianbing/dqltracking."}}

In this article, we present a novel tracking method by introducing the attention mechanism into the Siamese network to increase its matching discrimination. We propose a new way to compute attention weights to improve matching performance by a sub-Siamese network [Attention Net (A-Net)], which locates attentive parts for solving the searching problem. In addition, features in higher layers can preserve more semantic information while features in lower layers preserve more location information. Thus, in order to solve the tracking failure cases by the higher layer features, we fully utilize location and semantic information by multilevel features and propose a new way to fuse multiscale response maps from each layer to obtain a more accurate position estimation of the object. We further propose a hierarchical attention Siamese network by combining the attention weights and multilayer integration for tracking. Our method is implemented with a pretrained network which can outperform most well-trained Siamese trackers even without any fine-tuning and online updating. The comparison results with the state-of-the-art methods on popular tracking benchmarks show that our method achieves better performance.

Furthermore, we notice that the samples given in the first frame can be viewed as the decisive samples for the sequence since they contain rich sequence-specific information. To make full use of these sequence-specific samples, we propose a compact latent network to quickly adjust the tracking model to adapt to new scenes. A statistic-based compact latent feature is proposed to efficiently capture the sequence-specific information for the fast adjustment. In addition, we design a new training approach based on a diverse sample mining strategy to further improve the discrimination ability of our compact latent network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we apply it to adjust a recent state-of-the-art tracker, SiamRPN++.
