Does there exist better policies outside of this space? By using a novel surrogate objective that employs the sigmoid function (which provides an interesting way of exploration), we found that the answer is \"YES'', and the better policies are in fact located very far from the clipped space. We show that PPO is insufficient in \"off-policyness'', according to an off-policy metric called DEON. Our algorithm explores in a much larger policy space than PPO, and it maximizes the Conservative Policy Iteration (CPI) objective better than PPO during training. To the best of our knowledge, all current PPO methods have the clipping operation and optimize in the clipped policy space. Our method is the first of this kind, which advances the understanding of CPI optimization and policy gradient methods. Code is available at https://github.com/raincchio/P3O."}}

To address the OOD problem, recent works focus on learning an OOD adaptation policy by capturing the causal factors affecting the environmental dynamics. However, these works recover the causal factors with only an entangled or binary form, resulting in a limited generalization of the policy that requires extra data from the testing environments. To break this limitation, we propose Generalizable Causal Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) to learn a disentangled representation of causal factors, on the basis of which we learn a policy that achieves the OOD generalization without extra training. For capturing the causal factors, GCRL deploys a variant of $\\beta$-VAE structure with a two-stage constraint to ensure that all factors can be disentangled. Then, to achieve the OOD generalization through causal factors, we adopt an additional network to establish the dependence of actions on the learned representation. Theoretically, we prove that while the optimal policy can be found in training environments, the established dependence can recover the causal relationship between causal factors and actions. Experimental results show that GCRL achieves the OOD generalization on eight benchmarks from Causal World and Mujoco. Moreover, the policy learned by our model is more explainable, which can be controlled to generate semantic actions by intervening in the representation of causal factors."}}

However, high reward uncertainty still remains a problem when we want to train a satisfactory model, because obtaining high-quality reward feedback is usually expensive and even infeasible. To handle this issue, previous methods mainly focus on passive reward correction. At the same time, recent active reward estimation methods have proven to be a recipe for reducing the effect of reward uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel Distributional Reward Estimation framework for effective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DRE-MARL). Our main idea is to design the multi-action-branch reward estimation and policy-weighted reward aggregation for stabilized training. Specifically, we design the multi-action-branch reward estimation to model reward distributions on all action branches. Then we utilize reward aggregation to obtain stable updating signals during training. Our intuition is that consideration of all possible consequences of actions could be useful for learning policies. The superiority of the DRE-MARL is demonstrated using benchmark multi-agent scenarios, compared with the SOTA baselines in terms of both effectiveness and robustness."}}

To reduce the model error, previous works use a single well-designed network to fit the entire environment dynamics, which treats the environment dynamics as a black box. However, these methods lack to consider the environmental decomposed property that the dynamics may contain multiple sub-dynamics, which can be modeled separately, allowing us to construct the world model more accurately. In this paper, we propose the Environment Dynamics Decomposition (ED2), a novel world model construction framework that models the environment in a decomposing manner. ED2 contains two key components: sub-dynamics discovery (SD2) and dynamics decomposition prediction (D2P). SD2 discovers the sub-dynamics in an environment and then D2P constructs the decomposed world model following the sub-dynamics. ED2 can be easily combined with existing MBRL algorithms and empirical results show that ED2 significantly reduces the model error and boosts the performance of the state-of-the-art MBRL algorithms on various continuous control tasks."}}

The key idea lies in the coordinated adaptation of step size during the policy update process among multiple agents. We prove the monotonicity of policy improvement when optimizing a theoretically-grounded joint objective, and derive a simplified optimization objective based on a set of approximations. We then interpret that such an objective in CoPPO can achieve dynamic credit assignment among agents, thereby alleviating the high variance issue during the concurrent update of agent policies. Finally, we demonstrate that CoPPO outperforms several strong baselines and is competitive with the latest multi-agent PPO method (i.e. MAPPO) under typical multi-agent settings, including cooperative matrix games and the StarCraft II micromanagement tasks.
