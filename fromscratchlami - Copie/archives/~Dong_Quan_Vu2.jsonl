In this setting, the popular multiplicative/ exponential weights algorithm enjoys an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ equilibrium convergence rate; however, this rate is suboptimal in static environments---i.e., when the network is not subject to randomness. In this static regime, accelerated algorithms achieve an $\\mathcal{O}(1/T^{2})$ convergence speed, but they fail to converge altogether in stochastic problems. To fill this gap, we propose a novel,  adaptive exponential weights method---dubbed AdaWeight---that seamlessly interpolates between the $\\mathcal{O}(1/T^{2})$  and $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rates in the static and stochastic regimes respectively. Importantly, this \"best-of-both-worlds\" guarantee does not require any prior knowledge of the problem's parameters or tuning by the optimizer; in addition, the method's convergence speed depends subquadratically on the size of the network (number of vertices and edges), so it scales gracefully to large, real-life urban networks."}}
