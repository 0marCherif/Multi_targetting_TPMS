Unlike existing methods focused on intra-task learning, ICE promotes the transfer of knowledge between tasks for genuine self-evolution, similar to human experience learning. The strategy dynamically investigates planning and execution trajectories, consolidates them into simplified workflows and pipelines, and exploits them for improved task execution. Our experiments on the XAgent framework demonstrate ICE's effectiveness, reducing API calls by as much as 80% and significantly decreasing the demand for the model's capability. Specifically, when combined with GPT-3.5, ICE's performance matches that of raw GPT-4 across various agent tasks. We argue that this self-evolution approach represents a paradigm shift in agent design, contributing to a more robust AI community and ecosystem, and moving a step closer to full autonomy."}}

Although there exist various methods devoted to enhancing the long-context processing ability of large language models (LLMs), they are developed in an isolated manner and lack systematic analysis and integration of their strengths, hindering further developments. In this paper, we introduce UniMem, a unified framework that reformulates existing long-context methods from the view of memory augmentation of LLMs. UniMem is characterized by four key dimensions: Memory Management, Memory Writing, Memory Reading, and Memory Injection, providing a systematic theory for understanding various long-context methods. We reformulate 16 existing methods based on UniMem and analyze four representative methods: Transformer-XL, Memorizing Transformer, RMT, and Longformer into equivalent UniMem forms to reveal their design principles and strengths. Based on these analyses, we propose UniMix, an innovative approach that integrates the strengths of these algorithms. Experimental results show that UniMix achieves superior performance in handling long contexts with significantly lower perplexity than baselines."}}

Towards Implicit User Intention Understanding of Language Model Driven Agents", "abstract": "Current language model-driven agents often lack mechanisms for effective user participation, which is crucial given the vagueness commonly found in user instructions. Although adept at devising strategies and performing tasks, these agents struggle with seeking clarification and grasping precise user intentions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Intention-in-Interaction (IN3), a novel benchmark designed to inspect users' implicit intentions through explicit queries. Next, we propose the incorporation of model experts as the upstream in agent designs to enhance user-agent interaction. Employing IN3, we empirically train Mistral-Interact, a powerful model that proactively assesses task vagueness, inquires user intentions, and refines them into actionable goals before starting downstream agent task execution. Integrating it into the XAgent framework, we comprehensively evaluate the enhanced agent system regarding user instruction understanding and execution, revealing that our approach notably excels at identifying vague user tasks, recovering and summarizing critical missing information, setting precise and necessary agent execution goals, and minimizing redundant tool usage, thus boosting overall efficiency. All the data and codes are released."}}

While traditional approaches focus on ReLU-based LLMs, leveraging zeros in activation values, we broaden the scope of sparse LLMs beyond zero activation values. We introduce a general method that defines neuron activation through neuron output magnitudes and a tailored magnitude threshold, demonstrating that non-ReLU LLMs also exhibit sparse activation. To find the most efficient activation function for sparse computation, we propose a systematic framework to examine the sparsity of LLMs from three aspects: the trade-off between sparsity and performance, the predictivity of sparsity, and the hardware affinity. We conduct thorough experiments on LLMs utilizing different activation functions, including ReLU, SwiGLU, ReGLU, and ReLU$^2$. The results indicate that models employing ReLU$^2$ excel across all three evaluation aspects, highlighting its potential as an efficient activation function for sparse LLMs. We will release the code to facilitate future research."}}

However, as another critical component of programming proficiency, the debugging capability of LLMs remains relatively unexplored. Previous evaluations of LLMs' debugging ability are significantly limited by the risk of data leakage, the scale of the dataset, and the variety of tested bugs. To overcome these deficiencies, we introduce `DebugBench', an LLM debugging benchmark consisting of 4,253 instances. It covers four major bug categories and 18 minor types in C++, Java, and Python. To construct DebugBench, we collect code snippets from the LeetCode community, implant bugs into source data with GPT-4, and assure rigorous quality checks. We evaluate two commercial and three open-source models in a zero-shot scenario. We find that (1) while closed-source models like GPT-4 exhibit inferior debugging performance compared to humans, open-source models such as Code Llama fail to attain any pass rate scores; (2) the complexity of debugging notably fluctuates depending on the bug category; (3) incorporating runtime feedback has a clear impact on debugging performance which is not always helpful. As an extension, we also compare LLM debugging and code generation, revealing a strong correlation between them for closed-source models. These findings will benefit the development of LLMs in debugging."}}

However, existing LLMs, pre-trained on sequences with restricted maximum length, cannot generalize to longer sequences due to the out-of-domain and distraction issues. To alleviate these issues, existing efforts employ sliding attention windows and discard distant tokens to achieve the processing of extremely long sequences. Unfortunately, these approaches inevitably fail to capture long-distance dependencies within sequences to deeply understand semantics. This paper introduces a training-free memory-based method, InfLLM, to unveil the intrinsic ability of LLMs to process streaming long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM stores distant contexts into additional memory units and employs an efficient mechanism to lookup token-relevant units for attention computation. Thereby, InfLLM allows LLMs to efficiently process long sequences while maintaining the ability to capture long-distance dependencies. Without any training, InfLLM enables LLMs pre-trained on sequences of a few thousand tokens to achieve superior performance than competitive baselines continually training these LLMs on long sequences. Even when the sequence length is scaled to $1,024$K, InfLLM still effectively captures long-distance dependencies."}}

However, PT requires much more training time than fine-tuning. Intuitively, knowledge transfer can help to improve the efficiency. To explore whether we can improve PT via prompt transfer, we empirically investigate the transferability of soft prompts across different downstream tasks and PLMs in this work. We find that (1) in zero-shot setting, trained soft prompts can effectively transfer to similar tasks on the same PLM and also to other PLMs with a cross-model projector trained on similar tasks;(2) when used as initialization, trained soft prompts of similar tasks and projected prompts of other PLMs can significantly accelerate training and also improve the performance of PT. Moreover, to explore what decides prompt transferability, we investigate various transferability indicators and find that the overlapping rate of activated neurons strongly reflects the transferability, which suggests how the prompts stimulate PLMs is essential. Our findings show that prompt transfer is promising for improving PT, and further research shall focus more on prompts\u2019 stimulation to PLMs. The source code can be obtained from https://github. com/thunlp/Prompt-Transferability.\n"}}

However, the encoding-task coupling requirement results in the repeated encoding of the same documents for different tasks and queries, which is highly computationally inefficient. To this end, we target to decouple document encoding from downstream tasks, and propose to represent each document as a plug-and-play document module, i.e., a document plugin, for PTMs (PlugD). By inserting document plugins into the backbone PTM for downstream tasks, we can encode a document one time to handle multiple tasks, which is more efficient than conventional encoding-task coupling methods that simultaneously encode documents and input queries using task-specific encoders. Extensive experiments on 8 datasets of 4 typical NLP tasks show that PlugD enables models to encode documents once and for all across different scenarios. Especially, PlugD can save $69\\%$ computational costs while achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art encoding-task coupling methods. Additionally, we show that PlugD can serve as an effective post-processing way to inject knowledge into task-specific models, improving model performance without any additional model training."}}

However, federated learning faces severe optimization difficulty when training samples are not independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.). In this paper, we point out that the client sampling practice plays a decisive role in the aforementioned optimization difficulty. We find that the negative client sampling will cause the merged data distribution of currently sampled clients heavily inconsistent with that of all available clients, and further make the aggregated gradient unreliable. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning rate adaptation mechanism to adaptively adjust the server learning rate for the aggregated gradient in each round, according to the consistency between the merged data distribution of currently sampled clients and that of all available clients. Specifically, we make theoretical deductions to find a meaningful and robust indicator that is positively related to the optimal server learning rate and can effectively reflect the merged data distribution of sampled clients, and we utilize it for the server learning rate adaptation. Extensive experiments on multiple image and text classification tasks validate the great effectiveness of our method."}}

In UNTER, we adopt the decoder as a unified knowledge interface, aligning span representations obtained from the encoder with their corresponding knowledge. This approach enables the encoder to uniformly invoke span-related knowledge from its parameters for downstream applications. Experimental results show that, with both forms of knowledge injected, UNTER gains continuous improvements on a series of knowledge-driven NLP tasks, including entity typing, named entity recognition and relation extraction, especially in low-resource scenarios."}}
