Distribution System Operators (DSOs) aim to achieve grid reliability by verifying the n-1 principle, ensuring continuous operation in case of component failure. Electricity networks' complex graph-based data holds crucial information for n-1 assessment: graph structure and data about stations/cables. Unlike traditional machine learning methods, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) directly handle graph-structured data. This paper proposes using Graph Isomorphic Networks (GINs) for n-1 assessments in medium voltage grids. The GIN framework is designed to generalise to unseen grids and utilise graph structure and data about stations/cables. The proposed GIN approach demonstrates faster and more reliable grid assessments than a traditional mathematical optimisation approach, reducing prediction times by approximately a factor of 1000. The findings offer a promising approach to address computational challenges and enhance the reliability and efficiency of energy grid assessments."}}

Synergy is usually assessed by comparing the response of drug combinations to a predicted non-interactive response from reference (null) models. Possible choices of null models are Loewe additivity, Bliss independence and the recently rediscovered Hand model. A different approach is taken by the MuSyC model, which directly fits a generalization of the Hill model to the data. All of these models, however, fit the dose\u2013response relationship with a parametric model. Results We propose the Hand-GP model, a non-parametric model based on the combination of the Hand model with Gaussian processes. We introduce a new logarithmic squared exponential kernel for the Gaussian process which captures the logarithmic dependence of response on dose. From the monotherapeutic response and the Hand principle, we construct a null reference response and synergy is assessed from the difference between this null reference and the Gaussian process fitted response. Statistical significance of the difference is assessed from the confidence intervals of the Gaussian process fits. We evaluate performance of our model on a simulated data set from Greco, two simulated data sets of our own design and two benchmark data sets from Chou and Talalay. We compare the Hand-GP model to standard synergy models and show that our model performs better on these data sets. We also compare our model to the MuSyC model as an example of a recent method on these five data sets and on two-drug combination screens: Mott et al. anti-malarial screen and O\u2019Neil et al. anti-cancer screen. We identify cases in which the HandGP model is preferred and cases in which the MuSyC model is preferred. Conclusion The Hand-GP model is a flexible model to capture synergy. Its non-parametric and probabilistic nature allows it to model a wide variety of response patterns."}}

In particular, we consider how different particle filtering methods affect the variance of the estimated likelihood. We review and compare particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), RMHMC, fixed-form variational Bayes, and integrated nested Laplace approximation to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters. Additionally, we conduct the review from the point of view of whether these methods are (1) easily adaptable to different model specifications; (2) adaptable to higher dimensions of the model in a straightforward way; (3) feasible in the multivariate case. We show that when using the stochastic volatility model for methods comparison, various data-generating processes have to be considered to make a fair assessment of the methods. Finally, we present a challenging specification of the multivariate stochastic volatility model, which is rarely used to illustrate the methods but constitutes an important practical application.\n"}}

Most popular approaches to modeling count data can be classified into observation and parameter-driven models. In this paper, we review two models from these classes: the log-linear multivariate conditional intensity model (also referred to as an integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic model) and the non-linear state-space model for count data. We compare these models in terms of forecasting performance on simulated data and two real datasets. In simulations, we consider the case of model misspecification. We find that both models have advantages in different situations, and we discuss the pros and cons of inference for both models in detail."}}
