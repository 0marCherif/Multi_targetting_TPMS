Recent advances in representation learning give rise to distance-based OOD detection, where testing samples are detected as OOD if they are relatively far away from the centroids or prototypes of in-distribution (ID) classes. However, prior methods directly take off-the-shelf contrastive losses that suffice for classifying ID samples, but are not optimally designed when test inputs contain OOD samples. In this work, we propose CIDER, a novel representation learning framework that exploits hyperspherical embeddings for OOD detection. CIDER jointly optimizes two losses to promote strong ID-OOD separability: a dispersion loss that promotes large angular distances among different class prototypes, and a compactness loss that encourages samples to be close to their class prototypes. We analyze and establish the unexplored relationship between OOD detection performance and the embedding properties in the hyperspherical space, and demonstrate the importance of dispersion and compactness. CIDER establishes superior performance, outperforming the latest rival by 13.33% in FPR95. Code is available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/cider."}}

Such services require the client to send input data to the service provider, who processes it using a DNN and returns the output predictions to the client. Due to the rich nature of the inputs such as images and speech, the input often contains more information than what is necessary to perform the primary inference task. Consequently, in addition to the primary inference task, a malicious service provider could infer secondary (sensitive) attributes from the input, compromising the client's privacy. The goal of our work is to improve inference privacy by injecting noise to the input to hide the irrelevant features that are not conducive to the primary classification task. To this end, we propose Adaptive Noise Injection (ANI), which uses a light-weight DNN on the client-side to inject noise to each input, before transmitting it to the service provider to perform inference. Our key insight is that by customizing the noise to each input, we can achieve state-of-the-art trade-off between utility and privacy (up to 48.5% degradation in sensitive-task accuracy with <1% degradation in primary accuracy), significantly outperforming existing noise injection schemes. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the sensitive attributes and incurs minimal computational overheads."}}

In this study, we propose a framework for assessing the quality of predictive distributions obtained using deep learning models. The framework enables representation of aleatory and epistemic uncertainty, and relies on simulated data to generate different sources of uncertainty. Finally, it enables quantitative evaluation of the performance of uncertainty estimation techniques. We demonstrate the proposed framework with a case study highlighting the insights one can gain from using this framework."}}

Despite this progress, the potential power of fully complex intermediate computations and representations has not yet been explored for many challenging learning problems. Building on recent advances, we propose a novel mechanism for extracting signals in the frequency domain. As a case study, we perform audio source separation in the Fourier domain. Our extraction mechanism could be regarded as a local ensembling method that combines a complex-valued convolutional version of Feature-Wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) and a signal averaging operation. We also introduce a new explicit amplitude and phase-aware loss, which is scale and time invariant, taking into account the complex-valued components of the spectrogram. Using the Wall Street Journal Dataset, we compare our phase-aware loss to several others that operate both in the time and frequency domains and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed signal extraction method and proposed loss. When operating in the complex-valued frequency domain, our deep complex-valued network substantially outperforms its real-valued counterparts even with half the depth and a third of the parameters. Our proposed mechanism improves significantly deep complex-valued networks' performance and we demonstrate the usefulness of its regularizing effect."}}

In this paper, we propose a framework to generate semantics preserving adversarial examples. First, we present a manifold learning method to capture the semantics of the inputs. The motivating principle is to learn the low-dimensional geometric summaries of the inputs via statistical inference. Then, we perturb the elements of the learned manifold using the Gram-Schmidt process to induce the perturbed elements to remain in the manifold. To produce adversarial examples, we propose an efficient algorithm whereby we leverage the semantics of the inputs as a source of knowledge upon which we impose adversarial constraints. We apply our approach on toy data, images and text, and show its effectiveness in producing semantics preserving adversarial examples which evade existing defenses against adversarial attacks."}}
