Promising alternatives are the piecewise reconstruction approaches, which divide trajectories into several local parts and stitch their individual reconstructions to produce an entire 3D structure. These methods show the state-of-the-art performance, however, most of them are specialized for relatively smooth surfaces and some are quite complicated. Meanwhile, it has been reported numerously in the field of pattern recognition that obtaining consensus from many weak hypotheses can give a strong, powerful result. Inspired by these reports, in this paper, we push the concept of part-based reconstruction to the limit: Instead of considering the parts as explicitly-divided local patches, we draw a large number of small random trajectory sets. From their individual reconstructions, we pull out a statistic of each 3D point to retrieve a strong reconstruction, of which the procedure can be expressed as a sparse l1-norm minimization problem. In order to resolve the reflection ambiguity between weak (and possibly bad) reconstructions, we propose a novel optimization framework which only involves a single eigenvalue decomposition. The proposed method can be applied to any type of data and outperforms the existing methods for the benchmark sequences, even though it is composed of a few, simple steps. Furthermore, it is easily parallelizable, which is another advantage."}}

The main difficulty of the problem lies in choosing the right constraints for the solution. In this paper, we propose new constraints that are more effective for non-rigid shape recovery. Unlike the other proposals which have mainly focused on restricting the deformation space using rank constraints, our proposal constrains the motion parameters so that the 3D shapes are most closely aligned to each other, which makes the rank constraints unnecessary. Based on these constraints, we define a new class of probability distribution called the Procrustean normal distribution and propose a new NRSfM algorithm, EM-PND. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods, and it works well even if there is no temporal dependence between the observed samples."}}

Recently, there have been some approaches that incorporate the problem setting of non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM) into deep learning to learn 3D structure reconstruction. The most important difficulty of NRSfM is to estimate both the rotation and deformation at the same time, and previous works handle this by regressing both of them. In this paper, we resolve this difficulty by proposing a loss function wherein the suitable rotation is automatically determined. Trained with the cost function consisting of the reprojection error and the low-rank term of aligned shapes, the network learns the 3D structures of such objects as human skeletons and faces during the training, whereas the testing is done in a single-frame basis. The proposed method can handle inputs with missing entries and experimental results validate that the proposed framework shows superior reconstruction performance to the state-of-the-art method on the Human 3.6M, 300-VW, and SURREAL dataset, even though the underlying network structure is very simple."}}

In order to utilize these NRSfM techniques in more realistic situations, however, we are now facing two important problems that must be solved: First, general scenes contain complex deformations as well as multiple objects, which violates the usual assumptions of previous NRSfM proposals. Second, there are many unreconstructable regions in the video, either because of the discontinued tracks of 2D trajectories or those regions static towards the camera, which require careful manipulations. In this paper, we show that a consensus-based reconstruction framework can handle these issues effectively. Even though the entire scene is complex, its parts usually have simpler deformations, and even though there are some unreconstructable parts, they can be weeded out to reduce their harmful effect on the entire reconstruction. The main difficulty of this approach lies in identifying appropriate parts, however, it can be effectively avoided by sampling parts stochastically and then aggregate their reconstructions afterwards. Experimental results show that the proposed method renews the state-of-the-art for popular benchmark data under much harsher environments, i.e., narrow camera view ranges, and it can reconstruct video-based real-world data effectively for as many areas as it can without an elaborated user input."}}

In this paper, we propose a point cloud resampling algorithm inspired by the physical characteristics of the repulsion forces between point electrons. The points in the point cloud are considered as electrons that reside on a virtual metallic surface. We iteratively update the positions of the points by simulating the electromagnetic forces between them. Intuitively, the input point cloud becomes evenly distributed by the repulsive forces. We further adopt an acceleration and damping terms in our simulation. This system can be viewed as a momentum method in mathematical optimization and thus increases the convergence stability and uniformity performance. The net force of the repulsion forces may contain a normal directional force with respect to the local surface, which can make the point diverge from the surface. To prevent this, we introduce a simple restriction method that limits the repulsion forces between the points to an approximated local plane. This approach mimics the natural phenomenon in which positive electrons cannot escape from the metallic surface. However, this is still an approximation because the surfaces are often curved rather than being strict planes. Therefore, we project the points to the nearest local surface after the movement. In addition, we approximate the net repulsion force using the K-nearest neighbor to accelerate our algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a new measurement criterion that evaluates the uniformity of the resampled point cloud to compare the proposed algorithm with baselines. In experiments, our algorithm demonstrates superior performance in terms of uniformization, convergence, and run-time."}}

In this paper, we propose a new formulation called the fixed-point iteration (FPI) layer, which facilitates the use of more complicated operations in deep networks. The backward FPI layer, which is motivated by the recurrent backpropagation (RBP) algorithm, is also proposed. However, in contrast to RBP, the backward FPI layer yields the gradient using a small network module without explicitly calculating the Jacobian. In actual applications, both forward and backward FPI layers can be treated as nodes in the computational graphs. All the components of our method are implemented at a high level of abstraction, which allows efficient higher-order differentiations on the nodes. In addition, we present two practical methods, the neural net FPI (FPI_NN) layer and the gradient descent FPI (FPI_GD) layer, whereby the FPI update operations are a small neural network module and a single gradient descent step based on a learnable cost function, respectively. FPI_NN is intuitive and simple, while FPI_GD can be used to efficient train energy function networks that have been studied recently.

In contrast to the existing graph autoencoders with asymmetric decoder parts, the proposed autoencoder has a newly designed decoder which builds a completely symmetric autoencoder form. For the reconstruction of node features, the decoder is designed based on Laplacian sharpening as the counterpart of Laplacian smoothing of the encoder, which allows utilizing the graph structure in the whole processes of the proposed autoencoder architecture. In order to prevent the numerical instability of the network caused by the Laplacian sharpening introduction, we further propose a new numerically stable form of the Laplacian sharpening by incorporating the signed graphs. In addition, a new cost function which finds a latent representation and a latent affinity matrix simultaneously is devised to boost the performance of image clustering tasks. The experimental results on clustering, link prediction and visualization tasks strongly support that the proposed model is stable and outperforms various state-of-the-art algorithms."}}
