We utilize a representation theoretic\nmechanism that canonically associates multiple independent vector bundles over\na common base manifold, which provides multiple views for the geometry of the\nunderlying manifold. The consistency across these fibre bundles provide a common\nbase for performing unsupervised manifold co-learning through the redundancy\ncreated artificially across irreducible representations of the transformation group.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithmic paradigm through drastically improved robust nearest neighbor identification in cryo-electron microscopy image analysis and the clustering accuracy in community detection"}}
