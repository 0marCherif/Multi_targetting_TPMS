The current architectures are bottlenecked because they fail to effectively capture the hierarchical processing of visual stimuli that takes place in the human brain. Motivated by that fact, we introduce a novel neural network architecture for the problem of neural decoding. Our architecture uses Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders (HVAEs) to learn meaningful representations of natural images and leverages their latent space hierarchy to learn voxel-to-image mappings. By mapping the early stages of the visual pathway to the first set of latent variables and the higher visual cortex areas to the deeper layers in the latent hierarchy, we are able to construct a latent variable neural decoding model that replicates the hierarchical visual information processing. Our model achieves better reconstructions compared to the state of the art and our ablation study indicates that the hierarchical structure of the latent space is responsible for that performance.

We extend the maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning framework to account for StTL constraints and show how to encode them via a minimal set of mixed-integer linear constraints. Our method is based on a cut-and-generate algorithm that iterates between two phases: in the cut phase, we use cutting hyperplanes to approximate the feasible region of the non-linear constraint that encodes atomic predicates and in the generate phase, we propagate these hyperplanes through the schematics to generate constraints for arbitrary formulas. Our algorithmic contributions are validated in different environments and specifications."}}

By enforcing Pareto stationarity, a first-order condition for Pareto optimality, we are able to design a simple policy gradient algorithm that approximates the Pareto front and infers the unknown preferences. Our method relies on a projected gradient descent solver that identifies common ascent directions for all objectives. Leveraging the solution of that solver, we introduce Pareto Policy Adaptation (PPA), a loss function that adapts the policy to be optimal with respect to any distribution over preferences. PPA uses implicit differentiation to back-propagate the loss gradient bypassing the operations of the projected gradient descent solver. Our approach is straightforward, easy to implement and can be used with all existing policy gradient and actor-critic methods. We evaluate our method in a series of reinforcement learning tasks"}}

To deal with this issue, we propose a method to learn representations of persistence diagrams on hyperbolic spaces, more specifically on the Poincare ball. By representing features of infinite persistence infinitesimally close to the boundary of the ball, their distance to non-essential features approaches infinity, thereby their relative importance is preserved.

Initially, we propose a fractional order dynamical system for capturing longterm memory observed in complex network dynamics. Then, we formalize an energy and cost-efficient AP problem, wherein heterogeneous placement costs are assumed. A Gramian-based metric originating from the minimum control energy state transfer problem acts as the objective function and the total placement cost is upper bounded by a knapsack constraint. Leveraging recent advances in non-submodular optimization under knapsack constrains, we address the AP problem via a greedy algorithm with approximation guarantees that depend on quantities that measure how far the Gramianbased metric is from being submodular. From extensive experimental results for Erdos-R\u00e9nyi, and Barab\u00e1si-Albert comple\u1e8d networks, we observe that the proposed algorithm achieves on average 95% of the global optimal objective value."}}

We introduce two quantities, namely stability and fairness, to characterize an allocation. Our definition of stability is motivated by the famous stable marriage problem and measures the incentive that the agents have to deviate from the allocation. Furthermore, we quantify the fairness using the maximin fairness ratio which stems from the maximin fair shares. These shares represent an ideal scenario wherein each agent is given the option to maximize her worst possible outcome. Following that, we design an efficient greedy round-robin algorithm for the submodular allocations problem. We prove that our algorithm gives a stable allocation and we extract a curvature-dependant maximin fairness ratio. To demonstrate the empirical performance of our algorithm, we conduct experimental studies and observe that the empirical fairness ratio is higher than 95% of the solution given by a brute-force approach, which outperforms the theoretical guarantee."}}

Additionally, we propose using the robustness value as the objective function to be maximized by a stochastic optimization algorithm for the purpose of controller design. Finally, we formulate an algorithm for parameter inference for Parameteric-StTL specifications, which allows specifications to be mined from output traces of the underlying system. We demonstrate and validate our framework on two case studies inspired by the automotive domain."}}
