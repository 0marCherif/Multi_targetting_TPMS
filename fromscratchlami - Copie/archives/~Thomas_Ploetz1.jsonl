Many automated actions taken by a smart home are governed by the output of an underlying activity recognition system. However, activity recognition systems may not be perfectly accurate, and therefore inconsistencies in smart home operations can lead users reliant on smart home predictions to wonder \u201cWhy did the smart home do that?\u201d In this work, we build on insights from Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques and introduce an explainable activity recognition framework in which we leverage leading XAI methods (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Anchors) to generate natural language explanations that explain what about an activity led to the given classification. We evaluate our framework in the context of a commonly targeted smart home scenario: autonomous remote caregiver monitoring for individuals who are living alone or need assistance. Within the context of remote caregiver monitoring, we perform a two-step evaluation: (a) utilize Machine Learning experts to assess the sensibility of explanations and (b) recruit non-experts in two user remote caregiver monitoring scenarios, synchronous and asynchronous, to assess the effectiveness of explanations generated via our framework. Our results show that the XAI approach, SHAP, has a 92% success rate in generating sensible explanations. Moreover, in 83% of sampled scenarios users preferred natural language explanations over a simple activity label, underscoring the need for explainable activity recognition systems. Finally, we show that explanations generated by some XAI methods can lead users to lose confidence in the accuracy of the underlying activity recognition model, while others lead users to gain confidence. Taking all studied factors into consideration, we make a recommendation regarding which existing XAI method leads to the best performance in the domain of smart home automation and discuss a range of topics for future work to further improve explainable activity recognition."}}
