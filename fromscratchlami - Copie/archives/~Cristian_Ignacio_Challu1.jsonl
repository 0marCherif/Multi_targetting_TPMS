Yet, long-horizon forecasting remains a very difficult task. Two common challenges afflicting the task are the volatility of the predictions and their computational complexity. We introduce N-HiTS, a model which addresses both challenges by incorporating novel hierarchical interpolation and multi-rate data sampling techniques. These techniques enable the proposed method to assemble its predictions sequentially, emphasizing components with different frequencies and scales while decomposing the input signal and synthesizing the forecast. We prove that the hierarchical interpolation technique can efficiently approximate arbitrarily long horizons in the presence of smoothness. Additionally, we conduct extensive large-scale dataset experiments from the long-horizon forecasting literature, demonstrating the advantages of our method over the state-of-the-art methods, where N-HiTS provides an average accuracy improvement of almost 20% over the latest Transformer architectures while reducing the computation time by an order of magnitude (50 times).

We propose SpectraNet, a novel multivariate time-series forecasting model that dynamically infers a latent space spectral decomposition to capture current temporal dynamics and correlations on the recent observed history. A Convolution Neural Network maps the learned representation by sequentially mixing its components and refining the output. Our proposed approach can simultaneously produce forecasts and interpolate past observations and can, therefore, greatly simplify production systems by unifying imputation and forecasting tasks into a single model. SpectraNet achieves SoTA performance simultaneously on both tasks on five benchmark datasets, compared to forecasting and imputation models, with up to 92% fewer parameters and comparable training times. On settings with up to 80% missing data, SpectraNet has average performance improvements of almost 50% over the second-best alternative."}}

While numerous anomaly detection methods have been proposed in the literature, a recent survey concluded that no single method is the most accurate across various datasets. To make matters worse, anomaly labels are scarce and rarely available in practice. The practical problem of selecting the most accurate model for a given dataset without labels has received little attention in the literature. This paper answers this question \\textit{i.e.} Given an unlabeled dataset and a set of candidate anomaly detectors, how can we select the most accurate model? To this end, we identify three classes of surrogate (unsupervised) metrics, namely, \\textit{prediction error}, \\textit{model centrality}, and \\textit{performance on injected synthetic anomalies}, and show that some metrics are highly correlated with standard supervised anomaly detection performance metrics such as the $F_1$ score, but to varying degrees. We formulate metric combination with multiple imperfect surrogate metrics as a robust rank aggregation problem. We then provide theoretical justification behind the proposed approach. Large-scale experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed unsupervised approach is as effective as selecting the most accurate model based on partially labeled data."}}

Among reconstruction-based models, almost all previous work has focused on Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work presents DGHL, a new family of generative models for time-series anomaly detection, trained by maximizing the observed likelihood directly by posterior sampling and alternating gradient-descent. A top-down Convolution Network maps time-series windows to a novel hierarchical latent space, exploiting temporal dynamics to encode information efficiently. Despite relying on posterior sampling, it is computationally more efficient than current approaches, with up to 10x shorter training times than RNN based models. Our method outperformed other state-of-the-art models on four popular benchmark datasets. Finally, DGHL is robust to variable features between entities and accurate even with large proportions of missing values, settings with increasing relevance with IoT. We demonstrate the superior robustness of DGHL with novel occlusion experiments in this literature."}}
