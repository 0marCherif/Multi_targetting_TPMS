One of the most challenging aspects of this task is handling the independently moving objects as they break the rigid-scene assumption. For the first time, we show that pixel positional information can be exploited to learn SVDE (Single View Depth Estimation) from videos. Our proposed moving object (MO) masks, which are induced by depth variance to shifted $positional information$ (SPI) and referred to as `SPIMO' masks, are very robust and consistently remove the independently moving objects in the scenes, allowing for better learning of SVDE from videos. Additionally, we introduce a new adaptive quantization scheme that assigns the best per-pixel quantization curve for our depth discretization. Finally, we employ existing boosting techniques in a new way to further self-supervise the depth of the moving objects. With these features, our pipeline is robust against moving objects and generalizes well to high-resolution images, even when trained with small patches, yielding state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with 4 to 8x fewer parameters than the previous SOTA that learns from videos. We present extensive experiments on KITTI and CityScapes that show the effectiveness of our method. "}}

Our proposed two-stage learning strategy first aims to obtain a coarse depth prior by training an auto-encoder network for a stereoscopic view synthesis task. This prior knowledge is then boosted and used to self-supervise the model in the second stage of training in our novel ambiguity boosting loss. Our ambiguity boosting loss is a confidence-guided type of data augmentation loss that improves the accuracy and consistency of generated depth maps under several transformations of the single-image input. To show the benefits of the proposed two-stage training strategy with boosting, our two previous depth estimation (DE) networks, one with t-shaped adaptive kernels and the other with exponential disparity volumes, are extended with our new learning strategy, referred to as DBoosterNet-t and DBoosterNet-e, respectively. Our self-supervised DBoosterNets are competitive, and in some cases even better, compared to the most recent supervised SOTA methods, and are remarkably superior to the previous self-supervised methods for monocular DE on the challenging KITTI dataset. We present intensive experimental results, showing the efficacy of our method for the self-supervised monocular DE task."}}

Previous works rely on rigid photometric assumptions or on the SIDE network to infer depth and occlusions, resulting in limited performance. On the other hand, we propose a method to \"Forget About the LiDAR\" (FAL), with Mirrored Exponential Disparity (MED) probability volumes for the training of monocular depth estimators from stereo images. Our MED representation allows us to obtain geometrically inspired occlusion maps with our novel Mirrored Occlusion Module (MOM), which does not impose a learning burden on our FAL-net. Contrary to the previous methods that learn SIDE from stereo pairs by regressing disparity in the linear space, our FAL-net regresses disparity by binning it into the exponential space, which allows for better detection of distant and nearby objects. We define a two-step training strategy for our FAL-net: It is first trained for view synthesis and then fine-tuned for depth estimation with our MOM. Our FAL-net is remarkably light-weight and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods with 8\u00d7 fewer parameters and 3\u00d7 faster inference speeds on the challenging KITTI dataset.

However, solving the single-image-based view synthesis is still an open problem. In particular, the generation of new images at parallel camera views given a single input image is of great interest, as it enables 3D visualization of the 2D input scenery. We propose a novel network architecture to perform stereoscopic view synthesis at arbitrary camera positions along the X-axis, or \u201cDeep 3D Pan\u201d, with \u201ct-shaped\u201d adaptive kernels equipped with globally and locally adaptive dilations. Our proposed network architecture, the monster-net, is devised with a novel t-shaped adaptive kernel with globally and locally adaptive dilation, which can efficiently incorporate global camera shift into and handle local 3D geometries of the target image\u2019s pixels for the synthesis of naturally looking 3D panned views when a 2-D input image is given. Extensive experiments were performed on the KITTI, CityScapes, and our VICLAB_STEREO indoors dataset to prove the efficacy of our method. Our monster-net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method (SOTA) by a large margin in all metrics of RMSE, PSNR, and SSIM. Our proposed monster-net is capable of reconstructing more reliable image structures in synthesized images with coherent geometry. Moreover, the disparity information that can be extracted from the \u201ct-shaped\u201d kernel is much more reliable than that of the SOTA for the unsupervised monocular depth estimation task, confirming the effectiveness of our method."}}
