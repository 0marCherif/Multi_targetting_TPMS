The control barrier function is a useful tool to guarantee\nsafety if we have access to the ground-truth system dynamics. In practice, we\nhave inaccurate knowledge of the system dynamics, which can lead to unsafe\nbehaviors due to unmodeled residual dynamics. Learning the residual dynamics\nwith deterministic machine learning models can prevent the unsafe behavior but can\nfail when the predictions are imperfect. In this situation, a probabilistic learning\nmethod that reasons about the uncertainty of its predictions can help provide\nrobust safety margins. In this work, we use a Gaussian process to model the\nprojection of the residual dynamics onto a control barrier function. We propose a\nnovel optimization procedure to generate safe controls that can guarantee safety\nwith high probability. The safety filter is provided with the ability to reason\nabout the uncertainty of the predictions from the GP. We show the efficacy of this\nmethod through experiments on Segway and Quadrotor simulations. Our proposed\nprobabilistic approach is able to reduce the number of safety violations significantly\nas compared to the deterministic approach with a neural network."}}

The system consists of roughly 2400 controllable observation units, which we call the cobras, and the cobra control problem is to reach the targets while avoiding collisions. We decompose this problem into cobra assignment and trajectory planning. The cobra assignment adopts an efficient near-optimal algorithm that maximizes the target acquisition and completely avoids final-position collisions by losing only 0.9% of the target acquisition. The trajectory planning uses a collision-based search which lowers the in-transit collisions to almost zero."}}

We propose a deep reinforcement learning agent with sequence neural networks embedded in the agent to adapt to robotic arms that have a varying number of links. Further, with the additional tool of domain randomization, this agent adapts to different configurations. We perform simulations on a 2D N-link arm to show the ability of our network to transfer and generalize efficiently."}}

This paper investigates tuning the feedback gains of a PID controller via back-calculation and automatic differentiation tools. In particular, we episodically use a cost function to generate gradients and perform gradient descent to improve controller performance. We provide a theoretical framework for analyzing this non-convex optimization and establish a relationship between back-calculation and disturbance feedback policies. We include numerical experiments on linear systems with actuator saturation to show the efficacy of this approach."}}

The stability of the convex combination is achieved using an adaptation law obtained from the appropriate derivatives of the spectral radius.

Although great progress has been made in improving the accuracy of object detection in recent years due to the rise of deep neural networks, the state-of-the-art algorithms are highly computationally intensive. In order to address this challenge, we make two important observations in the context of videos: (i) Objects often occupy only a small fraction of the area in each video frame, and (ii) There is a high likelihood of strong temporal correlation between consecutive frames. Based on these observations, we propose Pack and Detect (PaD), an approach to reduce the computational requirements of object detection in videos. In PaD, only selected video frames called anchor frames are processed at full size. In the frames that lie between anchor frames (inter-anchor frames), regions of interest (ROIs) are identified based on the detections in the previous frame. We propose an algorithm to pack the ROIs of each inter-anchor frame together into a reduced-size frame. The computational requirements of the detector are reduced due to the lower size of the input. In order to maintain the accuracy of object detection, the proposed algorithm expands the ROIs greedily to provide additional background around each object to the detector. PaD can use any underlying neural network architecture to process the full-size and reduced-size frames. Experiments using the ImageNet video object detection dataset indicate that PaD can potentially reduce the number of FLOPS required for a frame by $4\\times$. This leads to an overall increase in throughput of $1.25\\times$ on a 2.1 GHz Intel Xeon server with a NVIDIA Titan X GPU at the cost of $1.1\\%$ drop in accuracy."}}

In particular, proximity-based services are commonly used to help a user interact with other users nearby. However, these services endanger the privacy of users as the location information is provided to the service provider. This paper proposes a novel private proximity detection scheme based on partial GPS range measurement information. We develop an efficient algorithm for proximity detection and theoretically analyze the false alarm performance. Simulation and empirical results validate this scheme and evaluate its performance."}}
