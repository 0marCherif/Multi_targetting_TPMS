The theories for normalization's effectiveness and new forms of normalization have always been hot topics in research. To better understand normalization, one question can be whether normalization is indispensable for training deep neural network? In this paper, we study what would happen when normalization layers are removed from the network, and show how to train deep neural networks without normalization layers and without performance degradation. Our proposed method can achieve the same or even slightly better performance in a variety of tasks: image classification in ImageNet, object detection and segmentation in MS-COCO, video classification in Kinetics, and machine translation in WMT English-German, etc. Our study may help better understand the role of normalization layers and can be a competitive alternative to normalization layers. Codes are available."}}

It poses a great challenge due to its ill-posed property which is critically lack of depth information in the 2D image plane. While there exist approaches leveraging off-the-shelve depth estimation or relying on LiDAR sensors to mitigate this problem, the dependence on the additional depth model or expensive equipment severely limits their scalability to generic 3D perception. In this paper, we propose a stereo-guided monocular 3D object detection framework, dubbed SGM3D, adapting the robust 3D features learned from stereo inputs to enhance the feature for monocular detection. We innovatively present a multi-granularity domain adaptation (MG-DA) mechanism to exploit the network\u2019s ability to generate stereo-mimicking features given only on monocular cues. Coarse BEV feature-level, as well as the fine anchor-level domain adaptation, are both leveraged for guidance in the monocular domain. In addition, we introduce an IoU matching-based alignment (IoU-MA) method for object-level domain adaptation between the stereo and monocular predictions to alleviate the mismatches while adopting the MG-DA. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on KITTI and Lyft datasets. Code and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/zhouzheyuan/sgm3d"}}

In this paper, we dig into the 3D object detection task and reformulate it as the sub-tasks of object localization and appearance perception, which benefits to a deep excavation of reciprocal information underlying the entire task. We introduce a Dynamic Feature Reflecting Network, named DFR-Net, which contains two novel standalone modules: (i) the Appearance-Localization Feature Reflecting module (ALFR) that first separates taskspecific features and then self-mutually reflects the reciprocal features; (ii) the Dynamic Intra-Trading module (DIT) that adaptively realigns the training processes of various sub-tasks via a self-learning manner. Extensive experiments on the challenging KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of DFR-Net. We rank 1st among all the monocular 3D object detectors in the KITTI test set (till March 16th, 2021). The proposed method is also easy to be plug-and-play in many cutting-edge 3D detection frameworks at negligible cost to boost"}}

We understand a scene by decomposing the scene into different concepts (e.g., shape and position of an object) and learning the respective laws of these concepts, which may be either natural (e.g., laws of motion) or man-made (e.g., laws of a game). The automatic parsing of these laws indicates the model's ability to understand the scene, which makes law parsing play a central role in many visual tasks. This paper proposes a deep latent variable model for Compositional LAw Parsing (CLAP), which achieves the human-like compositionality ability through an encoding-decoding architecture to represent concepts in the scene as latent variables. CLAP employs concept-specific latent random functions instantiated with Neural Processes to capture the law of concepts. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLAP outperforms the baseline methods in multiple visual tasks such as intuitive physics, abstract visual reasoning, and scene representation. The law manipulation experiments illustrate CLAP's interpretability by modifying specific latent random functions on samples. For example, CLAP learns the laws of position-changing and appearance constancy from the moving balls in a scene, making it possible to exchange laws between samples or compose existing laws into novel laws."}}

Existing methods, while enjoying many practical successes, are unable of explaining experimental observations, including different performances of UST algorithms in preserving the spatial structure of content images. In addition, methods are limited to cumbersome global controls on stylization, so that they require additional spatial masks for desired stylization. In this work, we provide a systematic Fourier analysis on a general framework for UST. We present an equivalent form of the framework in the frequency domain. The form implies that existing algorithms treat all frequency components and pixels of feature maps equally, except for the zero-frequency component. We connect Fourier amplitude and phase with Gram matrices and a content reconstruction loss in style transfer, respectively. Based on such equivalence and connections, we can thus interpret different structure preservation behaviors between algorithms with Fourier phase. Given the interpretations we have, we propose two manipulations in practice for structure preservation and desired stylization. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of our method against the state-of-the-art methods. We also conduct experiments to demonstrate (1) the abovementioned equivalence, (2) the interpretability based on Fourier amplitude and phase and (3) the controllability associated with frequency components."}}

Unfortunately, directly applying such AR models to edit/change local image regions, may suffer from the problems of missing global information, slow inference speed, and information leakage of local guidance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model -- image Local Autoregressive Transformer (iLAT), to better facilitate the locally guided image synthesis. Our iLAT learns the novel local discrete representations, by the newly proposed local autoregressive (LA) transformer of the attention mask and convolution mechanism. Thus iLAT can efficiently synthesize the local image regions by key guidance information. Our iLAT is evaluated on various locally guided image syntheses, such as pose-guided person image synthesis and face editing. Both quantitative and qualitative results show the efficacy of our model."}}

While significant progress has been achieved with expensive LiDAR point clouds, it poses a great challenge for 3D object detection given only a monocular image. While there exist different alternatives for tackling this problem, it is found that they are either equipped with heavy networks to fuse RGB and depth information or empirically ineffective to process millions of pseudo-LiDAR points. With in-depth examination, we realize that these limitations are rooted in inaccurate object localization. In this paper, we propose a novel and lightweight approach, dubbed {\\em Progressive Coordinate Transforms} (PCT) to facilitate learning coordinate representations. Specifically, a localization boosting mechanism with confidence-aware loss is introduced to progressively refine the localization prediction. In addition, semantic image representation is also exploited to compensate for the usage of patch proposals. Despite being lightweight and simple, our strategy allows us to establish a new state-of-the-art among the monocular 3D detectors on the competitive KITTI benchmark. At the same time, our proposed PCT shows great generalization to most coordinate-based 3D detection frameworks."}}

To explain how the model handles semantic compositions, we study hierarchical explanation of neural network predictions. We identify non-additivity and context independent importance attributions within hierarchies as two desirable properties for highlighting word and phrase compositions. We show some prior efforts on hierarchical explanations, e.g. contextual decomposition, do not satisfy the desired properties mathematically, leading to inconsistent explanation quality in different models. In this paper, we start by proposing a formal and general way to quantify the importance of each word and phrase. Following the formulation, we propose Sampling and Contextual Decomposition (SCD) algorithm and Sampling and Occlusion (SOC) algorithm. Human and metrics evaluation on both LSTM models and BERT Transformer models on multiple datasets show that our algorithms outperform prior hierarchical explanation algorithms. Our algorithms help to visualize semantic composition captured by models, extract classification rules and improve human trust of models."}}
