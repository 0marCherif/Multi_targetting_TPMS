Two important algorithmic techniques have shown promise for enabling efficient inference - sparsity and binarization. These techniques translate into weight sparsity and weight repetition at the hardware-software level enabling the deployment of DNNs with critically low power and latency requirements. We propose a new method called signed-binary networks to improve efficiency further (by exploiting both weight sparsity and weight repetition together) while maintaining similar accuracy. Our method achieves comparable accuracy on ImageNet and CIFAR10 datasets with binary and can lead to 69% sparsity. We observe real speedup when deploying these models on general-purpose devices and show that this high percentage of unstructured sparsity can lead to a further reduction in energy consumption on ASICs."}}

This development calls for cluster schedulers that are not only general, but also evolvable. Unfortunately, most existing cluster schedulers are not evolvable: when confronted with new requirements, they need major rewrites to support these requirements. Examples include gang-scheduling support in Kubernetes [6, 39] or task-affinity in Spark [39]. Some cluster schedulers [14, 30] expose physical resources to applications to address this. While these approaches are evolvable, they push the burden of implementing scheduling mechanisms in addition to the policies entirely to the application. ESCHER is a cluster scheduler design that achieves both evolvability and application-level simplicity. ESCHER uses an abstraction exposed by several recent frameworks (which we call ephemeral resources) that lets the application express scheduling constraints as resource requirements. These requirements are then satisfied by a simple mechanism matching resource demands to available resources. We implement ESCHER on Kubernetes and Ray, and show that this abstraction can be used to express common policies offered by monolithic schedulers while allowing applications to easily create new custom policies hitherto unsupported."}}

To scale these resource-intensive tasks with an increasing number of deployment targets, Once-For-All (OFA) proposed an approach to jointly train several models at once with a constant training cost. However, this cost remains as high as 40-50 GPU days and also suffers from a combinatorial explosion of sub-optimal model configurations. We seek to reduce this search space -- and hence the training budget -- by constraining search to models close to the accuracy-latency Pareto frontier. We incorporate insights of compound relationships between model dimensions to build CompOFA, a design space smaller by several orders of magnitude. Through experiments on ImageNet, we demonstrate that even with simple heuristics we can achieve a 2x reduction in training time and 216x speedup in model search/extraction time compared to the state of the art, without loss of Pareto optimality! We also show that this smaller design space is dense enough to support equally accurate models for a similar diversity of hardware and latency targets, while also reducing the complexity of the training and subsequent extraction algorithms."}}
