However, this permutation variant operation is not appropriate for direct application to sets. In this paper, we proposed an $O(n)$ complexity sampled transformer that can process point set elements directly without any additional inductive bias. Our sampled transformer introduces random element sampling, which randomly splits point sets into subsets, followed by applying a shared Hamiltonian self-attention mechanism to each subset. The overall attention mechanism can be viewed as a Hamiltonian cycle in the complete attention graph, and the permutation of point set elements is equivalent to randomly sampling Hamiltonian cycles. This mechanism implements a Monte Carlo simulation of the $O(n^2)$ dense attention connections. We show that it is a universal approximator for continuous set-to-set functions.  Experimental results for classification and few-shot learning on point-clouds show comparable or better accuracy with significantly reduced computational complexity compared to the dense transformer or alternative sparse attention schemes."}}

First, we define the PMBP process via its conditional intensity and derive the regularity conditions for subcriticality. We show that both the Hawkes process and the MBP process (Rizoiu et al. (2021)) are special cases of the PMBP process. Second, we provide numerical schemes that enable calculating the conditional intensity and sampling event histories of the PMBP process. Third, we demonstrate the applicability of the PMBP process by empirical testing using synthetic and real-world datasets: We test the capability of the PMBP process to recover multivariate Hawkes parameters given sample event histories of the Hawkes process. Next, we evaluate the PMBP process on the Youtube popularity prediction task and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art Hawkes Intensity process (Rizoiu et al. (2017b)). Lastly, on a curated dataset of COVID19 daily case counts and COVID19-related news articles for a sample of countries, we show that clustering on the PMBP-fitted parameters enables a categorization of countries with respect to the country-level interaction of cases and news reporting."}}

Such data records the aggregated counts of events solely during specific time intervals -- such as the number of patients admitted to the hospital or the volume of vehicles passing traffic loop detectors -- and not the exact occurrence time of the events. First, we establish the Mean Behavior Poisson (MBP) process, a novel Poisson process with a direct parameter correspondence to the popular self-exciting Hawkes process. The event intensity function of the MBP is the expected intensity over all possible Hawkes realizations with the same parameter set. We fit MBP in the interval-censored setting using an interval-censored Poisson log-likelihood (IC-LL). We use the parameter equivalence to uncover the parameters of the associated Hawkes process. Second, we introduce two novel exogenous functions to distinguish the exogenous from the endogenous events. We propose the multi-impulse exogenous function when the exogenous events are observed as event time and the latent homogeneous Poisson process exogenous function when the exogenous events are presented as interval-censored volumes. Third, we provide several approximation methods to estimate the intensity and compensator function of MBP when no analytical solution exists. Fourth and finally, we connect the interval-censored loss of MBP to a broader class of Bregman divergence-based functions. Using the connection, we show that the current state of the art in popularity estimation (Hawkes Intensity Process (HIP) (Rizoiu et al.,2017b)) is a particular case of the MBP process. We verify our models through empirical testing on synthetic data and real-world data. We find that on real-world datasets that our MBP process outperforms HIP for the task of popularity prediction."}}

(2020) introduced a new approach to fairness that corrects the data distribution itself. The approach is computationally appealing, but its approximation guarantees with respect to the target distribution can be quite loose as they need to rely on a (typically limited) number of constraints on data-based aggregated statistics; also resulting in a fairness guarantee which can be data dependent. Our paper makes use of a mathematical object recently introduced in privacy -- mollifiers of distributions -- and a popular approach to machine learning -- boosting -- to get an approach in the same lineage as Celis et al. but without the same impediments, including in particular, better guarantees in terms of accuracy and finer guarantees in terms of fairness. The approach involves learning the sufficient statistics of an exponential family. When the training data is tabular, the sufficient statistics can be defined by decision trees whose interpretability can provide clues on the source of (un)fairness. Experiments display the quality of the results for simulated and real-world data."}}
