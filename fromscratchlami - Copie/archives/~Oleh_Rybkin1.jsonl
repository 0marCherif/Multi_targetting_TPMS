However, learning a model that captures the dynamics of complex skills represents a major challenge: if the agent needs a good model to perform these skills, it might never be able to collect the experience on its own that is required to learn these delicate and complex behaviors. Instead, we can imagine augmenting the training set with observational data of other agents, such as humans. Such data is likely more plentiful, but represents a different embodiment. For example, videos of humans might show a robot how to use a tool, but (i) are not annotated with suitable robot actions, and (ii) contain a systematic distributional shift due to the embodiment differences between humans and robots. We address the first challenge by formulating the corresponding graphical model and treating the action as an observed variable for the interaction data and an unobserved variable for the observation data, and the second challenge by using a domain-dependent prior. In addition to interaction data, our method is able to leverage videos of passive observations in a driving dataset and a dataset of robotic manipulation videos. A robotic planning agent equipped with our method can learn to use tools in a tabletop robotic manipulation setting by observing humans without ever seeing a robotic video of tool use. "}}

As a result, it is difficult to collect sufficiently diverse experiences that are needed for robots to generalize broadly. Videos of humans, on the other hand, are a readily available source of broad and interesting experiences. In this paper, we consider the question: can we perform reinforcement learning directly on experience collected by humans? This problem is particularly difficult, as such videos are not annotated with actions and exhibit substantial visual domain shift relative to the robot's embodiment. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for reinforcement learning with videos (RLV). RLV learns a policy and value function using experience collected by humans in combination with data collected by robots. In our experiments, we find that RLV is able to leverage such videos to learn challenging vision-based skills with less than half as many samples as RL methods that learn from scratch. "}}

To approach this challenge practically, we outline two key desiderata: 1) to facilitate generalization, exploration should be task agnostic; 2) to facilitate scalability, exploration policies should collect large quantities of data without costly centralized retraining. Combining these two properties, we introduce the reward-free deployment efficiency setting, a new paradigm for RL research. We then present CASCADE, a novel approach for self-supervised exploration in this new setting. CASCADE seeks to learn a world model by collecting data with a population of agents, using an information theoretic objective inspired by Bayesian Active Learning. CASCADE achieves this by specifically maximizing the diversity of trajectories sampled by the population through a novel cascading objective. We provide theoretical intuition for CASCADE which we show in a tabular setting improves upon na\u00efve approaches that do not account for population diversity. We then demonstrate that CASCADE collects diverse task-agnostic datasets and learns agents that generalize zero-shot to novel, unseen downstream tasks on Atari, MiniGrid, Crafter and the DM Control Suite.

We decompose this question into two problems, global exploration of the environment and learning to reliably reach situations found during exploration. We introduce the Explore Achieve Network (ExaNet), a unified solution to these by learning a world model from the high-dimensional images and using it to train an explorer and an achiever policy from imagined trajectories. Unlike prior methods that explore by reaching previously visited states, our explorer plans to discover unseen surprising states through foresight, which are then used as diverse targets for the achiever. After the unsupervised phase, ExaNet solves tasks specified by goal images without any additional learning. We introduce a challenging benchmark spanning across four standard robotic manipulation and locomotion domains with a total of over 40 test tasks. Our agent substantially outperforms previous approaches to unsupervised goal reaching and achieves goals that require interacting with multiple objects in sequence. Finally, to demonstrate the scalability and generality of our approach, we train a single general agent across four distinct environments.

Recent work has achieved significant progress on building agents that can predict and plan from raw visual observations. However, existing visual planning methods still require a densely shaped reward that provides the algorithm with a short-term signal that is always easy to optimize. These algorithms fail when the shaped reward is not available as they use simplistic planning methods such as sampling-based random shooting and are unable to plan for a distant goal. Instead, to achieve long-horizon visual control, we propose to use collocation-based planning, a powerful optimal control technique that plans forward a sequence of states while constraining the transitions to be physical. We propose a planning algorithm that adapts collocation to visual planning by leveraging probabilistic latent variable models. A model-based reinforcement learning agent equipped with our planning algorithm significantly outperforms prior model-based agents on challenging visual control tasks with sparse rewards and long-term goals.
