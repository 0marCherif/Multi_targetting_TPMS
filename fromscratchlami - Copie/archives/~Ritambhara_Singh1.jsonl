In particular, the organization of chromatin into A and B compartments segregates its active regions from inactive regions. Therefore, these compartments can shed light on cell type-specific activities of the genome. However, obtaining Hi-C data for all cell and tissue types of interest is prohibitively expensive, which has limited the widespread consideration of compartment status. We present a  prediction tool called Compartment prediction using Recurrent Neural Network (CoRNN) that models the relationship between the compartmental organization of the genome and histone modification enrichment. Our model predicts A/B compartments, in a cross-cell type setting, with an average area under the ROC curve of 90.9%. Our cell type-specific compartment predictions show high overlap with known functional elements. We investigate our predictions by systematically removing combinations of histone marks and find that H3K27ac and H3K36me3 are the most predictive marks. We perform a detailed analysis of loci where compartment status cannot be accurately predicted from these marks. These regions represent chromatin with ambiguous compartmental status, likely due to variations in status within the population of cells. These ambiguous loci also show highly variable compartmental status between biological replicates in the same GM12878 cell type. Finally, we demonstrate the generalizability of our model by predicting compartments in independent tissue samples. Available at: https://github.com/rsinghlab/CoRNN"}}

Jointly studying multiple genomic features can help us understand gene regulatory mechanisms. Although there are experimental challenges to jointly profile multiple genomic features on the same single-cell, computational methods have been develop to align unpaired single-cell multi-omic datasets. Despite the success of these alingment methods, studying how genomic features interact in gene regulation requires the alignment of features, too. However, most single-cell multi-omic alignment tools can only align cells across different measurements. Here, we introduce \\textsc{SCOOTR}, which aligns both cells and features of the single-cell multi-omic datasets. Our preliminary results show that \\textsc{SCOOTR} provides quality alignments for datasets with sparse correspondences, and for datasets with more complex relationships, supervision on one level (e.g. cells) improves alignment performance on the other level (e.g. features)."}}

However, when modeling the effects of regulatory factors, most deep learning models either neglect long-range interactions or fail to capture the inherent 3D structure of the underlying genomic organization. To address these limitations, we present a Graph Convolutional Model for Epigenetic Regulation of Gene Expression (GC-MERGE). Using a graph-based framework, the model incorporates important information about long-range interactions via a natural encoding of genomic spatial interactions into the graph representation. It integrates measurements of both the global genomic organization and the local regulatory factors, specifically histone modifications, to not only predict the expression of a given gene of interest but also quantify the importance of its regulatory factors. We apply GC-MERGE to data sets for three cell lines\u2014GM12878 (lymphoblastoid), K562 (myelogenous leukemia), and HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial)\u2014and demonstrate its state-of-the-art predictive performance. Crucially, we show that our model is interpretable in terms of the observed biological regulatory factors, highlighting both the histone modifications and the interacting genomic regions contributing to a gene's predicted expression. We provide model explanations for multiple exemplar genes and validate them with evidence from the literature. Our model presents a novel setup for predicting gene expression by integrating multimodal data sets in a graph convolutional framework. More importantly, it enables interpretation of the biological mechanisms driving the model's predictions."}}

Single-cell alignment using optimal transport (SCOT) is an unsupervised algorithm that addresses this limitation by using optimal transport to align single-cell multiomics data. First, it preserves the local geometry by constructing a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graph for each data set (or domain) to capture the intra-domain distances. SCOT then finds a probabilistic coupling matrix that minimizes the discrepancy between the intra-domain distance matrices. Finally, it uses the coupling matrix to project one single-cell data set onto another through barycentric projection, thus aligning them. SCOT requires tuning only two hyperparameters and is robust to the choice of one. Furthermore, the Gromov-Wasserstein distance in the algorithm can guide SCOT's hyperparameter tuning in a fully unsupervised setting when no orthogonal alignment information is available. Thus, SCOT is a fast and accurate alignment method that provides a heuristic for hyperparameter selection in a real-world unsupervised single-cell data alignment scenario. We provide a tutorial for SCOT and make its source code publicly available on GitHub."}}

CO-optimal transport (COOT) takes this comparison further by inferring an alignment between features as well. While this approach leads to better alignments and generalizes both OT and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, we provide a theoretical result showing that it is sensitive to outliers that are omnipresent in real-world data. This prompts us to propose unbalanced COOT for which we provably show its robustness to noise in the compared datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result for OT methods in incomparable spaces. With this result in hand, we provide empirical evidence of this robustness for the challenging tasks of heterogeneous domain adaptation with and without varying proportions of classes and simultaneous alignment of samples and features across single-cell measurements."}}
