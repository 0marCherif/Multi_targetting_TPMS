Our goal is to pinpoint correct and incorrect concepts in student answers in order to achieve better student learning gains. Although automatic methods for providing personalized feedback exist, they do not explicitly inform students about which concepts in their answers are correct or incorrect. Our approach involves decomposing students answers using neural discourse segmentation and classification techniques. This decomposition yields a relational graph over all discourse units covered by the reference solutions and student answers. We use this inferred relational graph structure and a neural classifier to match student answers with reference solutions and generate personalized feedback. Although the process is completely automated and data-driven, the personalized feedback generated is highly contextual, domain-aware and effectively targets each student's misconceptions and knowledge gaps. We test our method in a dialogue-based ITS and demonstrate that our approach results in high-quality feedback and significantly improved student learning gains."}}
