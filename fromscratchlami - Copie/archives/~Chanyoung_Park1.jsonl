To this end, identifying cell types of cells with clustering techniques becomes an important task for downstream analysis. However, challenges of scRNA-seq data such as pervasive dropout phenomena hinder obtaining robust clustering outputs. Although existing studies try to alleviate these problems, they fall short of fully leveraging the relationship information and mainly rely on reconstruction-based losses that highly depend on the data quality, which is sometimes noisy. This work proposes a graph-based prototypical contrastive learning method, named scGPCL. Specifically, scGPCL encodes the cell representations using Graph Neural Networks on cell\u2013gene graph that captures the relational information inherent in scRNA-seq data and introduces prototypical contrastive learning to learn cell representations by pushing apart semantically dissimilar pairs and pulling together similar ones. Through extensive experiments on both simulated and real scRNA-seq data, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of scGPCL."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel mixup augmentation for node classification called Structural Mixup (S-Mixup). The core idea is to take into account the structural information while mixing nodes. Specifically, S-Mixup obtains pseudo-labels for unlabeled nodes in a graph along with their prediction confidence via a Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier. These serve as the criteria for the composition of the mixup pool for both inter and intra-class mixups. Furthermore, we utilize the edge gradient obtained from the GNN training and propose a gradient-based edge selection strategy for selecting edges to be attached to the nodes generated by the mixup. Through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of S-Mixup evaluated on the node classification task. We observe that S-Mixup enhances the robustness and generalization performance of GNNs, especially in heterophilous situations.

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a promising paradigm to address this challenge. Most recent bipartite graph SSL methods are based on contrastive learning which learns embeddings by discriminating positive and negative node pairs. Contrastive learning usually requires a large number of negative node pairs, which could lead to computational burden and semantic errors. In this paper, we introduce a novel synergistic representation learning model (STERLING) to learn node embeddings without negative node pairs. STERLING preserves the unique synergies in bipartite graphs. The local and global synergies are captured by maximizing the similarity of the inter-type and intra-type positive node pairs, and maximizing the mutual information of co-clusters respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that STERLING could preserve the synergies in the embedding space. Extensive empirical evaluation on various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of STERLING for extracting node embeddings."}}

Previous efforts in user modeling mainly focus on learning a task-specific user representation that is designed for a single task. However, since learning task-specific user representations for every task is infeasible, recent studies introduce the concept of universal user representation, which is a more generalized representation of a user that is relevant to a variety of tasks. Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches for learning universal user representations are impractical in real-world applications due to the data requirement, catastrophic forgetting and the limited learning capability for continually added tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel continual user representation learning method, called TERACON, whose learning capability is not limited as the number of learned tasks increases while capturing the relationship between the tasks. The main idea is to introduce an embedding for each task, i.e., task embedding, which is utilized to generate task-specific soft masks that not only allow the entire model parameters to be updated until the end of training sequence, but also facilitate the relationship between the tasks to be captured. Moreover, we introduce a novel knowledge retention module with pseudo-labeling strategy that successfully alleviates the long-standing problem of continual learning, i.e., catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on public and proprietary real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and practicality of TERACON. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sein-Kim/TERACON."}}

In this work, we propose CMRL that is robust to the distributional shift in molecular relational learning by detecting the core substructure that is causally related to chemical reactions. To do so, we first assume a causal relationship based on the domain knowledge of molecular sciences and construct a structural causal model (SCM) that reveals the relationship between variables. Based on the SCM, we introduce a novel conditional intervention framework whose intervention is conditioned on the paired molecule. With the conditional intervention framework, our model successfully learns from the causal substructure and alleviates the confounding effect of shortcut substructures that are spuriously correlated to chemical reactions. Extensive experiments on various tasks with real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMRL over state-of-the-art baseline models.

Among various GNN models, graph contrastive learning (GCL) based methods specifically suffer from adversarial attacks due to their inherent design that highly depends on the self-supervision signals derived from the original graph, which however already contains noise when the graph is attacked. To achieve adversarial robustness against such attacks, existing methods adopt adversarial training (AT) to the GCL framework, which considers the attacked graph as an augmentation under the GCL framework. However, we find that existing adversarially trained GCL methods achieve robustness at the expense of not being able to preserve the node feature similarity. In this paper, we propose a similarity-preserving adversarial graph contrastive learning (SP-AGCL) framework that contrasts the clean graph with two auxiliary views of different properties (i.e., the node similarity-preserving view and the adversarial view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SP-AGCL achieves a competitive performance on several downstream tasks, and shows its effectiveness in various scenarios, e.g., a network with adversarial attacks, noisy labels, and heterophilous neighbors.

Recently, graph neural networks have recently shown great success in molecular relational learning by modeling a molecule as a graph structure, and considering atom-level interactions between two molecules. Despite their success, existing molecular relational learning methods tend to overlook the nature of chemistry, i.e., a chemical compound is composed of multiple substructures such as functional groups that cause distinctive chemical reactions. In this work, we propose a novel relational learning framework, called CGIB, that predicts the interaction behavior between a pair of graphs by detecting core subgraphs therein. The main idea is, given a pair of graphs, to find a subgraph from a graph that contains the minimal sufficient information regarding the task at hand conditioned on the paired graph based on the principle of conditional graph information bottleneck. We argue that our proposed method mimics the nature of chemical reactions, i.e., the core substructure of a molecule varies depending on which other molecule it interacts with.

Specifically, it first obtains a warmed-up cell-gene matrix via Hard Feature Propagation which fully utilizes known gene transcripts. Then, we refine the k-Nearest Neighbor(kNN) of the cell-cell graph with a warmed-up cell-gene matrix, followed by Soft Feature Propagation which now allows known gene transcripts to be further denoised through their neighbors.
