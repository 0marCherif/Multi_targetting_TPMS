This is usually tackled through the computation of sum of squares decompositions which rely on efficient numerical solvers for semidefinite programming. This method faces two difficulties. The first one is that the certificates obtained this way are approximate and then nonexact. The second one is due to the fact that not all nonnegative polynomials are sums of squares. In this paper, we build on previous works by Parrilo and Nie, Demmel, and Sturmfels who introduced certificates of nonnegativity modulo gradient ideals. We prove that, actually, such certificates can be obtained exactly over the rationals if the polynomial under consideration has rational coefficients, and we provide exact algorithms to compute them. We analyze the bit complexity of these algorithms and deduce bitsize bounds of such certificates."}}

The main conclusion is that both sparse hierarchies based on the Schm\\\"udgen and Putinar Positivstellens\\\"atze enjoy a polynomial rate of convergence that depends on the size of the largest clique in the sparsity graph but not on the ambient dimension. Interestingly, the sparse bounds outperform the best currently available bounds for the dense hierarchy when the maximum clique size is sufficiently small compared to the ambient dimension and the performance is measured by the running time of an interior point method required to obtain a bound on the global minimum of a given accuracy."}}

An example of this task is finding the maximum number of infected people in an epidemic model with a nonzero incubation period. The variables of this peak estimation problem include the stopping time and the original history (restricted to a class of admissible histories). The original nonconvex DDE peak estimation problem is approximated by an infinite-dimensional Linear Program (LP) in occupation measures, inspired by existing measure-based methods in peak estimation and optimal control. This LP is approximated from above by a sequence of Semidefinite Programs (SDPs) through the moment-Sum of Squares (SOS) hierarchy. Effectiveness of this scheme in providing peak estimates for DDEs is demonstrated with provided examples"}}

As a result, such moment relaxations can be solved efficiently by first-order methods that exploit CTP, e.g., the conditional gradient-based augmented Lagrangian method. We also extend this CTP-exploiting framework to large-scale POPs with different sparsity structures. The efficiency and scalability of our framework are illustrated on some moment relaxations for various randomly generated POPs, especially second-order moment relaxations for quadratically constrained quadratic programs."}}

Its novelty is to exploit simultaneously correlative sparsity and term sparsity by combining advantages of two existing frameworks for sparse polynomial optimization. The former is due to Waki et\u00a0al. [40] while the latter was initially proposed by Wang et\u00a0al. [42] and later exploited in the TSSOS hierarchy [46, 47]. In doing so we obtain CS-TSSOS\u2014a two-level hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations with (i) the crucial property to involve blocks of SDP matrices and (ii) the guarantee of convergence to the global optimum under certain conditions. We demonstrate its efficiency and scalability on several large-scale instances of the celebrated Max-Cut problem and the important industrial optimal power flow problem, involving up to six thousand variables and tens of thousands of constraints."}}
