Most existing algorithms assume that the underlying task distribution is stationary. Here we consider a more realistic and challenging setting in that task distributions evolve over time. We name this problem as Semi-supervised meta-learning with Evolving Task diStributions, abbreviated as SETS. Two key challenges arise in this more realistic setting: (i) how to use unlabeled data in the presence of a large amount of unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) data; and (ii) how to prevent catastrophic forgetting on previously learned task distributions due to the task distribution shift. We propose an OOD Robust and knowleDge presErved semi-supeRvised meta-learning approach (ORDER) (we use ORDER to denote the task distributions sequentially arrive with some ORDER), to tackle these two major challenges. Specifically, our ORDER introduces a novel mutual information regularization to robustify the model with unlabeled OOD data and adopts an optimal transport regularization to remember previously learned knowledge in feature space. In addition, we test our method on a very challenging dataset: SETS on large-scale non-stationary semi-supervised task distributions consisting of (at least) 72K tasks. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate the proposed ORDER alleviates forgetting on evolving task distributions and is more robust to OOD data than related strong baselines."}}

The widely adopted memory replay approach could gradually become less effective for long data streams, as the model may memorize the stored examples and overfit the memory buffer. Second, existing methods overlook the high uncertainty in the memory data distribution since there is a big gap between the memory data distribution and the distribution of all the previous data examples. To address these problems, for the first time, we propose a principled memory evolution framework to dynamically evolve the memory data distribution by making the memory buffer gradually harder to be memorized with distributionally robust optimization (DRO). We then derive a family of methods to evolve the memory buffer data in the continuous probability measure space with Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF). The proposed DRO is wrt the worst-case evolved memory data distribution, thus guarantees the model performance and learns significantly more robust features than existing memory-replay-based methods. Extensive experiments on existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for alleviating forgetting. As a by-product of the proposed framework, our method is more robust to adversarial examples than existing task-free CL methods."}}

A typical setting across current meta learning algorithms assumes a stationary task distribution during meta training. In this paper, we explore a more practical and challenging setting where task distribution changes over time with domain shift. Particularly, we consider realistic scenarios where task distribution is highly imbalanced with domain labels unavailable in nature. We propose a kernel-based method for domain change detection and a difficulty-aware memory management mechanism that jointly considers the imbalanced domain size and domain importance to learn across domains continuously. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient adaptive task sampling method during meta training, which significantly reduces task gradient variance with theoretical guarantees. Finally, we propose a challenging benchmark with imbalanced domain sequences and varied domain difficulty. We have performed extensive evaluations on the proposed benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method."}}

However, the most widely used memory-replay approach often suffers from memory overfitting. To mitigate the memory overfitting, we propose a continuous and reversible memory transformation method so that the memory data is hard to overfit, thus improving generalization. The transformation is achieved by optimizing a bi-level optimization objective that jointly learns the CL model and memory transformer. Specifically, we propose a deterministic continuous memory transformer (DCMT) modeled by an ordinary differential equation, allowing for infinite memory transformation and generating diverse and hard memory data. Furthermore, we inject uncertainty into the transformation function and propose a stochastic continuous memory transformer (SCMT) modeled by a stochastic differential equation, which substantially enhances the diversity of the transformed memory buffer. The proposed neural transformation approaches have significant advantages over existing ones: (1) we can obtain infinite many transformed data, thus significantly increasing the memory buffer diversity; (2) the proposed continuous transformations are reversible, i.e., the original raw memory data could be restored from the transformed memory data without the need to make a replica of the memory data. Extensive experiments on both task-aware and task-free CL show significant improvement with our approach compared to strong baselines.  "}}

However, we can only use many available pre-trained models without accessing their training data in practice. We often need a single model to solve different tasks simultaneously as this is much more convenient to deploy the models. Our work aims to meta-learn a model initialization from these pre-trained models without using corresponding training data. We name this challenging problem setting Data-Free Learning To Learn (DFL2L). We propose a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework to learn a black-box model to fuse and compress all the pre-trained models into a single network to address this problem. The proposed DRO framework diversifies the learned task embedding associated with each pre-trained model to cover the diversity in the underlying training task distributions, encouraging good generalization to unseen new tasks. We sample a meta-initialization from the black-box network during meta-testing for fast adaptation to unseen new tasks. Extensive experiments on offline and online DFL2L settings and several real image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. "}}

Compared with traditional machine learning models, deep learning based approaches achieve superior performance on risk prediction task. However, none of existing work explicitly takes prior medical knowledge (such as the relationships between diseases and corresponding risk factors) into account. In medical domain, knowledge is usually represented by discrete and arbitrary rules. Thus, how to integrate such medical rules into existing risk prediction models to improve the performance is a challenge. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel and general framework called PRIME for risk prediction task, which can successfully incorporate discrete prior medical knowledge into all of the state-of-the-art predictive models using posterior regularization technique. Different from traditional posterior regularization, we do not need to manually set a bound for each piece of prior medical knowledge when modeling desired distribution of the target disease on patients. Moreover, the proposed PRIME can automatically learn the importance of different prior knowledge with a log-linear model.Experimental results on three real medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for the task of risk prediction"}}

In the traditional settings of metric learning, an implicit assumption is that the associated labels of the instances are deterministic. However, in many real-world applications, the associated labels come naturally with probabilities instead of deterministic values. Thus, the existing metric learning methods cannot work well in these applications. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we study how to effectively learn the distance metric from datasets that contain probabilistic information, and then propose two novel metric learning mechanisms for two types of probabilistic labels, i.e., the instance-wise probabilistic label and the group-wise probabilistic label. Compared with the existing metric learning methods, our proposed mechanisms are capable of learning distance metrics directly from the probabilistic labels with high accuracy. We also theoretically analyze the two proposed mechanisms and provide theoretical bounds on the sample complexity for both of them. Additionally, extensive experiments based on real-world datasets are conducted to verify the desirable properties of the proposed mechanisms."}}
