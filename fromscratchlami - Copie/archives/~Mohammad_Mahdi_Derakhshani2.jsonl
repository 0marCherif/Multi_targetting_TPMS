Most existing methods approach it as a multi-class classification problem, which restricts the outcome to a predefined closed-set of curated answers. We focus on open-ended VQA and motivated by the recent advances in language models consider it as a generative task. Leveraging pre-trained language models, we introduce a novel method particularly suited for small, domain-specific, medical datasets. To properly communicate the medical images to the language model, we develop a network that maps the extracted visual features to a set of learnable tokens. Then, alongside the question, these learnable tokens directly prompt the language model. We explore recent parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for language models, which allow for resource- and data-efficient fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach on the prime medical VQA benchmarks, namely, Slake, OVQA and PathVQA. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods across various training settings while also being computationally efficient."}}

However, they cannot handle the ever-changing clinical environment, bringing newly annotated medical data from different sources. To exploit the incoming streams of data, these models would benefit largely from sequentially learning from new samples, without forgetting the previously obtained knowledge. In this paper we introduce LifeLonger, a benchmark for continual disease classification on the MedMNIST collection, by applying existing state-of-the-art continual learning methods. In particular, we consider three continual learning scenarios, namely, task and class incremental learning and the newly defined cross-domain incremental learning. Task and class incremental learning of diseases address the issue of classifying new samples without re-training the models from scratch, while cross-domain incremental learning addresses the issue of dealing with datasets originating from different institutions while retaining the previously obtained knowledge. We perform a thorough analysis of the performance and examine how the well-known challenges of continual learning, such as the catastrophic forgetting exhibit themselves in this setting. The encouraging results demonstrate that continual learning has a major potential to advance disease classification and to produce a more robust and efficient learning framework for clinical settings. The code repository, data partitions and baseline results for the complete benchmark are publicly available $$^{1}$$ ( https://github.com/mmderakhshani/LifeLonger )."}}

(2021) has recently emerged as a strong continual learner due to its non-parametric ability to tackle task interference and catastrophic forgetting. Unfortunately its success comes at the expense of an explicit memory to store samples from past tasks, which hampers scalability to continual learning settings with a large number of tasks. In this paper, we introduce generative kernel continual learning, which explores and exploits the synergies between generative models and kernels for continual learning. The generative model is able to produce representative samples for kernel learning, which removes the dependence on memory in kernel continual learning. Moreover, as we replay only on the generative model, we avoid task interference while being computationally more efficient compared to previous methods that need replay on the entire model. We further introduce a supervised contrastive regularization, which enables our model to generate even more discriminative samples for better kernel-based classification performance. We conduct extensive experiments on three widely-used continual learning benchmarks that demonstrate the abilities and benefits of our contributions.

For each block, we first try to predict its intensities based on previous blocks; then, we store a residual with respect to the input image. Our technique reuses JPEG's legacy compression and decompression routines. Both our artifact removal and our image compression techniques use the same deep network, but with different training weights. Our technique is simple and fast and it significantly improves the performance of artifact removal and image compression."}}
