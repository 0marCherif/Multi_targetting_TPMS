However, due to domain shift caused by the visual gap (potentially due to lighting, indoor scene change, pool floor color etc.) between the training swimming pool and the test swimming pool, the robustness of such algorithms has been questionable. To address this issue, we propose a domain-aware data augmentation pipeline based on Gaussian Poisson Generative Adversarial Network (GP-GAN). Combined with YOLOv8, we demonstrate that such a domain adaptation technique can significantly improve the model performance (from 0.24 mAP to 0.82 mAP) on new test scenes."}}

To reduce the data gap caused by usually expensive simulations or experimentation, active learning has been identified as a promising solution for the scientific computing community. However, the deep active learning (DAL) literature is currently dominated by image classification problems and pool-based methods, which are not directly transferrable to scientific computing problems, dominated by regression problems with no pre-defined 'pool' of unlabeled data. Here for the first time, we investigate the robustness of DAL methods for scientific computing problems using ten state-of-the-art DAL methods and eight benchmark problems. We show that, to our surprise, the majority of the DAL methods are not robust even compared to random sampling when the ideal pool size is unknown. We further analyze the effectiveness and robustness of DAL methods and suggest that diversity is necessary for a robust DAL for scientific computing problems."}}

SAM can segment objects in input imagery based upon cheap input prompts, such as one (or more) points, a bounding box, or a mask. The authors examined the zero-shot image segmentation accuracy of SAM on a large number of vision benchmark tasks and found that SAM usually achieved recognition accuracy similar to, or sometimes exceeding, vision models that had been trained on the target tasks. The impressive generalization of SAM for segmentation has major implications for vision researchers working on natural imagery. In this work, we examine whether SAM's impressive performance extends to overhead imagery problems, and help guide the community's response to its development. We examine SAM's performance on a set of diverse and widely-studied benchmark tasks. We find that SAM does often generalize well to overhead imagery, although it fails in some cases due to the unique characteristics of overhead imagery and the target objects. We report on these unique systematic failure cases for remote sensing imagery that may comprise useful future research for the community. Note that this is a working paper, and it will be updated as additional analysis and results are completed."}}

A crucial resource for targeting further investment of public and private resources, as well as tracking the progress of universal electrification goals, is shared access to high-quality data on individual SHS installations including information such as location and power capacity. Though recent studies utilizing satellite imagery and machine learning to detect solar panels have emerged, they struggle to accurately locate many SHS due to limited image resolution (some small solar panels only occupy several pixels in satellite imagery). In this work, we explore the viability and cost-performance tradeoff of using automatic SHS detection on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery as an alternative to satellite imagery. More specifically, we explore three questions: (i) what is the detection performance of SHS using drone imagery; (ii) how expensive is the drone data collection, compared to satellite imagery; and (iii) how well does drone-based SHS detection perform in real-world scenarios? To examine these questions, we collect and publicly-release a dataset of high-resolution drone imagery encompassing SHS imaged under a variety of real-world conditions and use this dataset and a dataset of imagery from Rwanda to evaluate the capabilities of deep learning models to recognize SHS, including those that are too small to be reliably recognized in satellite imagery. The results suggest that UAV imagery may be a viable alternative to identify very small SHS from perspectives of both detection accuracy and financial costs of data collection. UAV-based data collection may be a practical option for supporting electricity access planning strategies for achieving sustainable development goals and for monitoring the progress towards those goals."}}

Unfortunately, actionable information about energy systems is often of limited availability, incomplete, or only accessible for a substantial fee or through a non-disclosure agreement. Recently, remotely sensed data (e.g., satellite imagery, aerial photography) have emerged as a potentially rich source of energy systems information. However, the use of these data is frequently challenged by its sheer volume and complexity, precluding manual analysis. Recent breakthroughs in machine learning have enabled automated and rapid extraction of useful information from remotely sensed data, facilitating large-scale acquisition of critical energy system variables. Here we present a systematic review of the literature on this emerging topic, providing an in-depth survey and review of papers published within the past two decades. We first taxonomize the existing literature into ten major areas, spanning the energy value chain. Within each research area, we distill and critically discuss major features that are relevant to energy researchers, including, for example, key challenges regarding the accessibility and reliability of the methods. We then synthesize our findings to identify limitations and trends in the literature as a whole, and discuss opportunities for innovation. These include the opportunity to extend the methods beyond electricity to broader energy systems and wider geographic areas; and the ability to expand the use of these methods in research and decision making as satellite data become cheaper and easier to access. We also find that there are persistent challenges: limited standardization and rigor of performance assessments; limited sharing of code, which would improve replicability; and a limited consideration of the ethics and privacy of data."}}

Recent research has demonstrated that representations learned through self-supervision transfer better than representations learned on supervised classification tasks. However, little research has focused explicitly on applying self-supervised encoders to remote sensing tasks. Using three diverse remote sensing datasets, we compared the performance of encoders pre-trained through both supervision and self-supervision on ImageNet, then fine-tuned on a final remote sensing task. Furthermore, we explored whether performance benefited from further pre-training on remote sensing data. Our experiments used SwAV due to its comparably lower computational requirements, as this method would prove most easily replicable by practitioners. We show that an encoder pre-trained on ImageNet using self-supervision transfers better than one pre-trained using supervision on three diverse remote sensing applications. Moreover, self-supervision on the target data alone as a pre-training step seldom boosts performance beyond this transferred encoder. We attribute this inefficacy to the lower diversity and size of remote sensing datasets, compared to ImageNet. In conclusion, we recommend that researchers use self-supervised representations for transfer learning on remote sensing data and that future research should focus on ways to increase performance further using self-supervision."}}

Inverse modeling is the task whereby one seeks to determine the control parameters of a natural system that produce a given set of observed measurements. Recent work has shown impressive results using deep learning, but we note that there is a trade-off between model performance and computational time. For some applications, the computational time at inference for the best performing inverse modeling method may be overly prohibitive to its use. We present a new method that leverages multiple manifolds as a mixture of backward (e.g., inverse) models in a forward-backward model architecture. These multiple backwards models all share a common forward model, and their training is mitigated by generating training examples from the forward model. The proposed method thus has two innovations: 1) the multiple Manifold Mixture Network (MMN) architecture, and 2) the training procedure involving augmenting backward model training data using the forward model. We demonstrate the advantages of our method by comparing to several baselines on four benchmark inverse problems, and we furthermore provide analysis to motivate its design."}}

To reduce the data gap, active learning has been identified as a promising solution for DL in the scientific computing community. However, the deep active learning (DAL) literature is dominated by image classification problems and pool-based methods. Here we investigate the robustness of pool-based DAL methods for scientific computing problems (dominated by regression) where DNNs are increasingly used. We show that modern pool-based DAL methods all share an untunable hyperparameter, termed the pool ratio, denoted $\\gamma$, which is often assumed to be known apriori in the literature. We evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art DAL methods on six benchmark problems if we assume $\\gamma$ is \\textit{not} known - a more realistic assumption for scientific computing problems. Our results indicate that this reduces the performance of modern DAL methods and that they sometimes can even perform worse than random sampling, creating significant uncertainty when used in real-world settings. To overcome this limitation we propose, to our knowledge, the first query synthesis DAL method for regression, termed NA-QBC. NA-QBC removes the sensitive $\\gamma$ hyperparameter and we find that, on average, it outperforms the other DAL methods on our benchmark problems. Crucially, NA-QBC always outperforms random sampling, providing more robust performance benefits."}}
