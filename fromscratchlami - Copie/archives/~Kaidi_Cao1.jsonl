Here we propose AutoTransfer, an AutoML solution that improves search efficiency by transferring the known architectural design knowledge to the novel task of interest. Our key insights are a task-model bank that captures the training performance over a diverse set of GNN architectures and tasks, and a computationally efficient task embedding that can accurately measure the similarity between different tasks. Based on the task-model bank and the task embeddings, we estimate the design priors of desirable models of the novel task, by aggregating a similarity-weighted sum of the top-K design distributions on tasks that are similar to the task of interest. The computed design priors can be used with any AutoML search algorithm. We evaluate AutoTransfer on six datasets in the graph machine learning domain. Experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed task embedding can be computed efficiently, and that tasks with similar embeddings have similar best-performing architectures; (ii) AutoTransfer significantly improves search efficiency with the transferred design priors, reducing the number of explored architectures by an order of magnitude.

However, such simplistic training strategies may be sub-optimal as they neglect that certain nodes are much harder to make accurate predictions on than others. Here we present TuneUp, a curriculum learning strategy for better training GNNs. Crucially, TuneUp trains a GNN in two stages. The first stage aims to produce a strong base GNN. Such base GNNs tend to perform well on head nodes (nodes with large degrees) but less so on tail nodes (nodes with small degrees). So, the second stage of TuneUp specifically focuses on improving prediction on tail nodes. Concretely, TuneUp synthesizes many additional supervised tail node data by dropping edges from head nodes and reusing the supervision on the original head nodes. TuneUp then minimizes the loss over the synthetic tail nodes to finetune the base GNN. TuneUp is a general training strategy that can be used with any GNN architecture and any loss, making TuneUp applicable to a wide range of prediction tasks. Extensive evaluation of TuneUp on two GNN architectures, three types of prediction tasks, and both inductive and transductive settings shows that TuneUp significantly improves the performance of the base GNN on tail nodes, while often even improving the performance on head nodes, which together leads up to 58.5% relative improvement in GNN predictive performance. Moreover, TuneUp significantly outperforms its variants without the two-stage curriculum learning, existing graph data augmentation techniques, as well as other specialized methods for tail nodes."}}

However, this assumption rarely holds for data in-the-wild, where instances belonging to novel classes may appear at testing time. Here, we introduce a novel open-world semi-supervised learning setting that formalizes the notion that novel classes may appear in the unlabeled test data. In this novel setting, the goal is to solve the class distribution mismatch problem between labeled and unlabeled data, where at the test time every input instance either needs to be classified into one of the existing classes or a new unseen class needs to be initialized and the instance assigned to it. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose ORCA, an end-to-end approach that assigns instances to previously seen classes or  forms novel classes by grouping similar instances without assuming any prior knowledge. The key idea in ORCA is to utilize uncertainty adaptive margin to circumvent the bias towards seen classes caused by learning seen classes faster than the novel classes. In this way, ORCA gradually increases the discriminability of the model during the training and reduces the gap between intra-class variance of seen with respect to novel classes. Extensive experiments on image classification datasets and a single-cell dataset demonstrate that ORCA consistently outperforms alternative baselines, achieving 25% improvement on seen and 96% improvement on novel classes of the ImageNet dataset.

This presents an opportunity to extend multi-task learning to utilize data point\u2019s labels from other auxiliary tasks, and this way improves performance on the new task. Here we introduce a novel relational multi-task learning setting where we leverage data point labels from auxiliary tasks to make more accurate predictions on the new task. We develop MetaLink, where our key innovation is to build a knowledge graph that connects data points and tasks and thus allows us to leverage labels from auxiliary tasks. The knowledge graph consists of two types of nodes: (1) data nodes, where node features are data embeddings computed by the neural network, and (2) task nodes, with the last layer\u2019s weights for each task as node features. The edges in this knowledge graph capture data-task relationships, and the edge label captures the label of a data point on a particular task. Under MetaLink, we reformulate the new task as a link label prediction problem between a data node and a task node. The MetaLink framework provides flexibility to model knowledge transfer from auxiliary task labels to the task of interest. We evaluate MetaLink on 6 benchmark datasets in both biochemical and vision domains. Experiments demonstrate that MetaLink can successfully utilize the relations among different tasks, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods under the proposed relational multi-task learning setting, with up to 27% improvement in ROC AUC."}}

However, the real world is often open and dynamic, and thus novel previously unseen classes may appear in the test data or during the model deployment. Here, we introduce a new open-world semi-supervised learning setting in which the model is required to recognize previously seen classes, as well as to discover novel classes never seen in the labeled dataset. To tackle the problem, we propose ORCA, an approach that jointly learns a feature representation and a classifier on the labeled and unlabeled subsets of the data. The key idea in ORCA is in introducing uncertainty based adaptive margin that effectively circumvents the bias caused by the imbalance of variance between seen and novel classes. We demonstrate that ORCA accurately discovers novel classes and assigns samples to previously seen classes on standard benchmark image classification datasets, including  CIFAR and ImageNet. Remarkably, despite solving the harder task ORCA outperforms semi-supervised methods on seen classes, as well as novel class discovery methods on unseen classes, achieving 7% and 151% improvements on seen and unseen classes of the ImageNet dataset."}}

Heteroskedasticity and imbalance challenge deep learning algorithms due to the difficulty of distinguishing among mislabeled, ambiguous, and rare examples. Addressing heteroskedasticity and imbalance simultaneously is under-explored. We propose a data-dependent regularization technique for heteroskedastic datasets that regularizes different regions of the input space differently. Inspired by the theoretical derivation of the optimal regularization strength in a one-dimensional nonparametric classification setting, our approach adaptively regularizes the data points in higher-uncertainty, lower-density regions more heavily. We test our method on several benchmark tasks, including a real-world heteroskedastic and imbalanced dataset, WebVision. Our experiments corroborate our theory and demonstrate a significant improvement over other methods in noise-robust deep learning. "}}

Although great progress has been made, existing techniques are very limited in providing theoretical guarantees for the performance of the neural networks trained with noisy labels. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach with strong theoretical guarantees for robust training of neural networks trained with noisy labels. The key idea behind our method is to select subsets of clean data points that provide an approximately low-rank Jacobian matrix. We then prove that gradient descent applied to the subsets cannot overfit the noisy labels, without regularization or early stopping. Our extensive experiments corroborate our theory and demonstrate that deep networks trained on our subsets achieve a significantly superior performance, e.g., 7% increase in accuracy on mini Webvision with 50% noisy labels, compared to state-of-the art."}}
