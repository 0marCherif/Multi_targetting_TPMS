Annotations are time-consuming and laborious to collect, and may not be feasibly obtained in certain situations. However there is a growing amount of freely available unlabeled video data which has spurred interest in unsupervised video representation learning. In this work we focus on the setting in which there is no/little access to labeled videos for video object segmentation. To this end we leverage large-scale image segmentation datasets and adversarial learning to train 2D/3D networks for video object segmentation. We first motivate the treatment of images and videos as two separate domains by analyzing the performance gap of an image segmentation network trained on images and applied to videos. Through studies using several image and video segmentation datasets, we show how an adversarial loss placed at various locations within the network can make feature representations invariant to these domains and improve the performance when the network has access to only labeled images and unlabeled videos. To prevent the loss of discriminative semantic class information we apply our adversarial loss within clusters of features and show this boosts our method's performance within Transformer-based models."}}

Retail environments present unique challenges compared to typical indoor scenes owing to the vast number of densely packed, unique yet similar objects. The problem becomes even more difficult when only RGB input is available, especially for data-hungry tasks such as instance segmentation. To address the lack of datasets for retail, we present StandardSim, a large-scale photorealistic synthetic dataset featuring annotations for semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection. Our dataset provides multiple views per scene, enabling multi-view representation learning. Further, we introduce a novel task central to autonomous checkout called change detection, requiring pixel-level classification of takes, puts and shifts in objects over time. We benchmark widely-used models for segmentation and depth estimation on our dataset, show that our test set constitutes a difficult benchmark compared to current smaller-scale datasets and that our training set provides models with crucial information for autonomous checkout tasks. Our code and data can be found at https://standard-ai.github.io/Standard-Sim/ ."}}

To understand how well both machines and humans perform on single-image 2D hand-pose reconstruction from RGB images, we collected a challenging dataset of hands interacting with 148 objects. We used a novel methodology that provides the same hand in the same pose both with the object being present and occluding the hand and without the object occluding the hand. Additionally, we collected a wide range of grasps for each object designing the data collection methodology to ensure this diversity. Using this dataset we measured the performance of two state-of-the-art hand-pose recognition methods showing that both are extremely brittle when faced with even light occlusion from an object. This is not evident in previous datasets because they often avoid hand-object occlusions and because they are collected from videos where hands are often between objects and mostly unoccluded. We annotated a subset of the dataset and used that to show that humans are robust with respect to occlusion, and also to characterize human hand perception, the space of grasps that seem to be considered, and the accuracy of reconstructing occluded portions of hands. We expect that such data will be of interest to both the vision community for developing more robust hand-pose algorithms and to the robotic grasp planning community for learning such grasps. The dataset is available at occludedhands.com ."}}
