The latest end-to-end image-to-text approaches simultaneously predict the two structures by two decoders, where the prediction of the physical structure (the bounding boxes of the cells) is based on the representation of the logical structure. However, the previous methods struggle with imprecise bounding boxes as the logical representation lacks local visual information. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end sequential modeling framework for table structure recognition called VAST. It contains a novel coordinate sequence decoder triggered by the representation of the non-empty cell from the logical structure decoder. In the coordinate sequence decoder, we model the bounding box coordinates as a language sequence, where the left, top, right and bottom coordinates are decoded sequentially to leverage the inter-coordinate dependency. Furthermore, we propose an auxiliary visual-alignment loss to enforce the logical representation of the non-empty cells to contain more local visual details, which helps produce better cell bounding boxes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art results in both logical and physical structure recognition. The ablation study also validates that the proposed coordinate sequence decoder and the visual-alignment loss are the keys to the success of our method."}}

Supervised by the semantics of action labels, recent works adapt the visual branch of VLMs to learn video representations. Despite the effectiveness proved by these works, we believe that the potential of VLMs has yet to be fully harnessed. In light of this, we exploit the semantic units (SU) hiding behind the action labels and leverage their correlations with fine-grained items in frames for more accurate action recognition. SUs are entities extracted from the language descriptions of the entire action set, including body parts, objects, scenes, and motions. To further enhance the alignments between visual contents and the SUs, we introduce a multi-region module (MRA) to the visual branch of the VLM. The MRA allows the perception of region-aware visual features beyond the original global feature. Our method adaptively attends to and selects relevant SUs with visual features of frames. With a cross-modal decoder, the selected SUs serve to decode spatiotemporal video representations. In summary, the SUs as the medium can boost discriminative ability and transferability. Specifically, in fully-supervised learning, our method achieved 87.8\\% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400. In K=2 few-shot experiments, our method surpassed the previous state-of-the-art by +7.1% and +15.0% on HMDB-51 and UCF-101, respectively."}}

However, traditional clustering methods, such as K-means, DBSCAN and HAC, impose oversimplifying assumptions and thus are not well-suited to face clustering. To adapt to the distribution of realistic problems, a natural approach is to use Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to enhance features for clustering. However, GCNs can only utilize local information, which ignores the overall characteristics of the clusters. In this paper, we propose a Density-Aware Feature Embedding Network (DA-Net) for the task of face clustering, which utilizes both local and non-local information, to learn a robust feature embedding. Specifically, DA-Net uses GCNs to aggregate features locally, and then incorporates non-local information using a density chain, which is a chain of faces from low density to high density. This density chain exploits the non-uniform distribution of face images in the dataset. Then, an LSTM takes the density chain as input to generate the final feature embedding. Once this embedding is generated, traditional clustering methods, such as density-based clustering, can be used to obtain the final clustering results. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed feature embedding method, which can achieve state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks."}}

The representation has four polynomial curves to fit a text's top, bottom, left, and right sides, which can capture a text with a complex shape by varying polynomial coefficients.  PB has appealing features compared with conventional representations: 1)  It can model different curvatures with a fixed number of parameters, while polygon-points-based methods need to utilize a different number of points.  2) It can distinguish adjacent or overlapping texts as they have apparent different curve coefficients, while segmentation-based methods suffer from adhesive spatial positions. PBFormer combines the PB with the transformer, which can directly generate smooth text contours sampled from predicted curves without interpolation.  To leverage the advantage of PB,  PBFormer has a parameter-free cross-scale pixel attention module.  The module can enlarge text features and suppress irrelevant areas to benefit from detecting texts with diverse scale variations.  Furthermore, PBFormer is trained with a shape-contained loss, which not only enforces the piecewise alignment between the ground truth and the predicted curves but also makes curves' position and shapes consistent with each other.  Without bells and whistles about text pre-training, our method is superior to the previous state-of-the-art text detectors on the arbitrary-shaped CTW1500 and Total-Text datasets. Codes will be public."}}

Taking it to a next level requires substantially larger data, which would involve prohibitive annotation cost. Hence, exploiting unlabeled data becomes an appealing alternative. Recent works have shown that clustering unlabeled faces is a promising approach, often leading to notable performance gains. Yet, how to effectively cluster, especially on a large-scale (ie million-level or above) dataset, remains an open question. A key challenge lies in the complex variations of cluster patterns, which make it difficult for conventional clustering methods to meet the needed accuracy. This work explores a novel approach, namely, learning to cluster instead of relying on hand-crafted criteria. Specifically, we propose a framework based on graph convolutional network, which combines a detection and a segmentation module to pinpoint face clusters. Experiments show that our method yields significantly more accurate face clusters, which, as a result, also lead to further performance gain in face recognition."}}

In this task, the correct camera pose is the key to generating accurate lanes, which can transform an image from perspective-view to the top-view. With this transformation, we can get rid of the perspective effects so that 3D lanes would look similar and can accurately be fitted by low-order polynomials. However, mainstream 3D lane detectors rely on perfect camera poses provided by other sensors, which is expensive and encounters multi-sensor calibration issues. To overcome this problem, we propose to predict 3D lanes by estimating camera pose from a single image with a two-stage framework. The first stage aims at the camera pose task from perspective-view images. To improve pose estimation, we introduce an auxiliary 3D lane task and geometry constraints to benefit from multi-task learning, which enhances consistencies between 3D and 2D, as well as compatibility in the above two tasks. The second stage targets the 3D lane task. It uses previously estimated pose to generate top-view images containing distance-invariant lane appearances for predicting accurate 3D lanes. Experiments demonstrate that, without ground truth camera pose, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art perfect-camera-pose-based methods and has the fewest parameters and computations.

Current methods for estimating such similarity require a large number of labeled samples for supervised training. In this paper, we present a pseudo-pair based self-similarity learning approach for unsupervised person re-ID without human annotations. Unlike conventional unsupervised re-ID methods that use pseudo labels based on global clustering, we construct patch surrogate classes as initial supervision, and propose to assign pseudo labels to images through the pairwise gradient-guided similarity separation. This can cluster images in pseudo pairs, and the pseudos can be updated during training. Based on pseudo pairs, we propose to improve the generalization of similarity function via a novel self-similarity learning:it learns local discriminative features from individual images via intra-similarity, and discovers the patch correspondence across images via inter-similarity. The intra-similarity learning is based on channel attention to detect diverse local features from an image. The inter-similarity learning employs a deformable convolution with a non-local block to align patches for cross-image similarity. Experimental results on several re-ID benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-arts."}}
