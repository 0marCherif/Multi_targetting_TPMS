At the lower level, there is a visual front-end with a limited temporal receptive field that processes the raw pixels depicting the lips or faces. At the higher level, there is an encoder that attends to the embeddings produced by the front-end over a large temporal receptive field. Previous work has focused on improving the visual front-end of the model to extract more useful features for speech recognition. Surprisingly, our work shows that complex visual front-ends are not necessary. Instead of allocating resources to a sophisticated visual front-end, we find that a linear visual front-end paired with a larger Conformer encoder results in lower latency, more efficient memory usage, and improved WER performance. We achieve a new state-of-the-art of $12.8\\%$ WER for visual speech recognition on the TED LRS3 dataset, which rivals the performance of audio-only models from just four years ago."}}

However, since alignment information between speech and text is rarely available during training, models need to learn it in a completely self-supervised way. In practice, the exponential number of possible alignments makes this extremely challenging, with models often learning peaky or sub-optimal alignments. Prima facie, the exponential nature of the alignment space makes it difficult to even quantify the uncertainty of a model's alignment distribution. Fortunately, it has been known for decades that the entropy of a probabilistic finite state transducer can be computed in time linear to the size of the transducer via a dynamic programming reduction based on semirings. In this work, we revisit the entropy semiring for neural speech recognition models, and show how alignment entropy can be used to supervise models through regularization or distillation. We also contribute an open-source implementation of CTC and RNN-T in the semiring framework that includes numerically stable and highly parallel variants of the entropy semiring. Empirically, we observe that the addition of alignment distillation improves the accuracy and latency of an already well-optimized teacher-student distillation model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Librispeech dataset in the streaming scenario."}}

In this work, we propose learnable loss mixup (LLM), a simple and effortless training diagram, to improve the generalization of deep learning-based speech enhancement models. Loss mixup, of which learnable loss mixup is a special variant, optimizes a mixture of the loss functions of random sample pairs to train a model on virtual training data constructed from these pairs of samples. In learnable loss mixup, by conditioning on the mixed data, the loss functions are mixed using a non-linear mixing function automatically learned via neural parameterization. Our experimental results on the VCTK benchmark show that learnable loss mixup achieves 3.26 PESQ, outperforming the state-of-the-art."}}

Many worry that it can one day develop the ability to recursively self-improve itself, leading to an intelligence explosion known as the Singularity. Autogenerative networks, or neural networks generating neural networks, is one major plausible pathway towards realizing this possibility. The object of this thesis is to study various challenges and applications of small-scale autogenerative networks in domains such as artificial life, reinforcement learning, neural network initialization and optimization, gradient-based meta-learning, and logical networks. Chapters 2 and 3 describe novel mechanisms for generating neural network weights and embeddings. Chapters 4 and 5 identify problems and propose solutions to fix optimization difficulties in differentiable mechanisms of neural network generation known as Hypernetworks. Chapters 6 and 7 study implicit models of network generation like backpropagating through gradient descent itself and integrating discrete solvers into continuous functions. Together, the chapters in this thesiscontribute novel proposals for non-differentiable neural network generation mechanisms, significant improvements to existing differentiable network generation mechanisms, and an assimilation of different learning paradigms in autogenerative networks."}}

It had been shown to solve Sudoku puzzles visually from examples of puzzle digit images, and was heralded as an impressive achievement towards the longstanding AI goal of combining pattern recognition with logical reasoning. In this paper, we clarify SATNet's capabilities by showing that in the absence of intermediate labels that identify individual Sudoku digit images with their logical representations, SATNet completely fails at visual Sudoku (0% test accuracy). More generally, the failure can be pinpointed to its inability to learn to assign symbols to perceptual phenomena, also known as the symbol grounding problem, which has long been thought to be a prerequisite for intelligent agents to perform real-world logical reasoning. We propose an MNIST based test as an easy instance of the symbol grounding problem that can serve as a sanity check for differentiable symbolic solvers in general. Naive applications of SATNet on this test lead to performance worse than that of models without logical reasoning capabilities. We report on the causes of SATNet\u2019s failure and how to prevent them."}}

Nevertheless, dropout is often harmful to model performance when used in networks with batch normalization layers [Li et al., 2018], which are an indispensable part of modern neural networks. We construct a general variational family for ensemble-based Bayesian neural networks that encompasses dropout as a special case. We further present two specific members of this family that work well with batch normalization layers, while retaining the benefits of low parameter and programming overhead, comparable to non-Bayesian training. Our proposed methods improve predictive accuracy and achieve almost perfect calibration on a ResNet-18 trained with ImageNet."}}
