Currently, the predictive results of deep learning (DL)-based models are better than or as good as standard survival methods, they are often disregarded because of their lack of transparency and little interpretability, which is crucial to their adoption in clinical applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel, easily deployable approach, called EXplainable CEnsored Learning (EXCEL), to iteratively exploit critical variables and simultaneously implement (DL) model training based on these variables. First, on a toy dataset, we illustrate the principle of EXCEL; then, we mathematically analyze our proposed method, and we derive and prove tight generalization error bounds; next, on two semi-synthetic datasets, we show that EXCEL has good anti-noise ability and stability; finally, we apply EXCEL to a variety of real-world survival datasets including clinical data and genetic data, demonstrating that EXCEL can effectively identify critical features and achieve performance on par with or better than the original models. It is worth pointing out that EXCEL is flexibly deployed in existing or emerging models for explainable survival data in the presence of right censoring."}}

The full circadian rhythm orchestration of gene expression in the human brain and its inherent associations with AD remain largely unknown. We present a novel comprehensive approach, PRIME, to detect and analyze rhythmic oscillation patterns in untimed high-dimensional gene expression data across multiple datasets. To demonstrate the utility of PRIME, firstly, we validate it by a time course expression dataset from mouse liver as a cross-species and cross-organ validation. Then, we apply it to study oscillation patterns in untimed genome-wide gene expression from 19 human brain regions of controls and AD patients. Our findings reveal clear, synchronized oscillation patterns in 15 pairs of brain regions of control, while these oscillation patterns either disappear or dim for AD. It is worth noting that PRIME discovers the circadian rhythmic patterns without requiring the sample's timestamps. The codes for PRIME, along with codes to reproduce the figures in this paper, are available at https://github.com/xinxingwu-uk/PRIME."}}

Link prediction is a relatively under-studied graph learning task, with current state-of-the-art models based on one- or two-layer shallow graph auto-encoder (GAE) architectures. In this paper, we overcome the limitation of current methods for link prediction of non-Euclidean network data, which can only use shallow GAEs and variational GAEs. Our proposed methods innovatively incorporate standard auto-encoders (AEs) into the architectures of GAEs to capitalize on the intimate coupling of node and edge information in complex network data. Empirically, extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed approach. Theoretically, we prove that our deep extensions can inclusively express multiple polynomial filters with different orders.

Algorithmic stability is a key characteristic of an algorithm regarding its sensitivity to perturbations of input samples. In this paper, we propose an innovative unsupervised feature selection algorithm attaining this stability with provable guarantees. The architecture of our algorithm consists of a feature scorer and a feature selector. The scorer trains a neural network (NN) to globally score all the features, and the selector adopts a dependent sub-NN to locally evaluate the representation abilities for selecting features. Further, we present algorithmic stability analysis and show that our algorithm has a performance guarantee via a generalization error bound. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate superior generalization performance of our proposed algorithm to strong baseline methods. Also, the properties revealed by our theoretical analysis and the stability of our algorithm-selected features are empirically confirmed."}}
