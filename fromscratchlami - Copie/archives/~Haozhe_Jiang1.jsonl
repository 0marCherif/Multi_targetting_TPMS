Our main contribution is designing families of two-layer neural networks that practically outperform classical algorithms in high-noise, low-dimension regimes. We consider three settings where the numbers of LPN samples are abundant, very limited, and in between. In each setting we provide neural network models that solve LPN as fast as possible. For some settings we are also able to provide theories that explain the rationale of the design of our models. Comparing with the previous experiments of Esser, Kubler, and May (CRYPTO 2017), for dimension $n = 26$, noise rate $\\tau = 0.498$, the ''Guess-then-Gaussian-elimination'' algorithm takes 3.12 days on 64 CPU cores, whereas our neural network algorithm takes 66 minutes on 8 GPUs. Our algorithm can also be plugged into the hybrid algorithms for solving middle or large dimension LPN instances."}}

The existing dataset coverage assumption in offline general-sum games inevitably incurs a dependency on the number of actions, which can be exponentially large in congestion games. We consider three different types of feedback with decreasing revealed information. Starting from the facility-level (a.k.a., semi-bandit) feedback, we propose a novel one-unit deviation coverage condition and show a pessimism-type algorithm that can recover an approximate NE. For the agent-level (a.k.a., bandit) feedback setting, interestingly, we show the one-unit deviation coverage condition is not sufficient. On the other hand, we convert the game to multi-agent linear bandits and show that with a generalized data coverage assumption in offline linear bandits, we can efficiently recover the approximate NE. Lastly, we consider a novel type of feedback, the game-level feedback where only the total reward from all agents is revealed. Again, we show the coverage assumption for the agent-level feedback setting is insufficient in the game-level feedback setting, and with a stronger version of the data coverage assumption for linear bandits, we can recover an approximate NE. Together, our results constitute the first study of offline congestion games and imply formal separations between different types of feedback."}}

Recent offline meta-RL methods typically use task-dependent behavior policies (e.g., training RL agents on each individual task) to collect a multi-task dataset and learn an offline meta-policy. However, these methods always require extra information for fast adaptation, such as offline context for testing tasks or oracle reward functions. Offline meta-RL with few-shot online adaptation remains an open problem. In this paper, we first formally characterize a unique challenge under this setting: data distribution mismatch between offline training and online adaptation. This distribution mismatch may lead to unreliable offline policy evaluation and the regular adaptation methods of online meta-RL will suffer. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel mechanism of data distribution correction, which ensures the consistency between offline and online evaluation by filtering out out-of-distribution episodes in online adaptation. As few-shot out-of-distribution episodes usually have lower returns, we propose a Greedy Context-based data distribution Correction approach, called GCC, which greedily infers how to solve new tasks. GCC diversely samples \u201ctask hypotheses\u201d from the current posterior belief and selects a greedy hypothesis with the highest return to update the task belief. Our method is the first to provide an effective online adaptation without additional information, and can be combined with off-the-shelf context-based offline meta-training algorithms. Empirical experiments show that GCC achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Meta-World ML1 benchmark compared to baselines with/without offline adaptation. "}}

Model-based approaches learn forward dynamics models with conservatism quantifications and then generate imaginary trajectories to extend the offline datasets. However, due to limited samples in offline datasets, conservatism quantifications often suffer from overgeneralization in out-of-support regions.

To encourage more conservatism, we propose a novel model-based offline RL framework, called Reverse Offline Model-based Imagination (ROMI). We learn a reverse dynamics model in conjunction with a novel reverse policy,  which can generate rollouts leading to the target goal states within the offline dataset. These reverse imaginations provide informed data augmentation for model-free policy learning and enable conservative generalization beyond the offline dataset.
