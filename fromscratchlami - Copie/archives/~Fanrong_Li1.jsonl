While quantization is a powerful approach to reducing GNNs complexity, most previous works on GNNs quantization fail to exploit the unique characteristics of GNNs, suffering from severe accuracy degradation. Through an in-depth analysis of the topology of GNNs, we observe that the topology of the graph leads to significant differences between nodes, and most of the nodes in a graph appear to have a small aggregation value. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose the Aggregation-Aware mixed-precision Quantization ($\\rm A^2Q$) for GNNs, where an appropriate bitwidth is automatically learned and assigned to each node in the graph. To mitigate the vanishing gradient problem caused by sparse connections between nodes, we propose a Local Gradient method to serve the quantization error of the node features as the supervision during training. We also develop a Nearest Neighbor Strategy to deal with the generalization on unseen graphs. Extensive experiments on eight public node-level and graph-level datasets demonstrate the generality and robustness of our proposed method. Compared to the FP32 models, our method can achieve up to $18.8\\times$ (i.e., 1.70bits) compression ratio with negligible accuracy degradation. Moreover, compared to the state-of-the-art quantization method, our method can achieve up to $11.4\\%$ and $9.5\\%$ accuracy improvements on the node-level and graph-level tasks, respectively, and up to $2\\times$ speedup on a dedicated hardware accelerator."}}

Throughout existing SNNs, the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model is commonly adopted to formulate the spiking neuron and evolves into numerous variants with different biological features. However, most LIF-based neurons support only single biological feature in different neuronal behaviors, limiting their expressiveness and neuronal dynamic diversity. In this paper, we propose GLIF, a unified spiking neuron, to fuse different bio-features in different neuronal behaviors, enlarging the representation space of spiking neurons. In GLIF, gating factors, which are exploited to determine the proportion of the fused bio-features, are learnable during training. Combining all learnable membrane-related parameters, our method can make spiking neurons different and constantly changing, thus increasing the heterogeneity and adaptivity of spiking neurons. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that our method obtains superior performance compared with other SNNs by simply changing their neuronal formulations to GLIF. In particular, we train a spiking ResNet-19 with GLIF and achieve $77.35\\%$ top-1 accuracy with six time steps on CIFAR-100, which has advanced the state-of-the-art.

However, existing works only explore the redundancy from a single point of the network, limiting the performance. In this paper, we propose dual gating, a new dynamic computing method, to reduce the model complexity at run-time. For each convolutional block, dual gating identifies the informative features along two separate dimensions, spatial and channel. Specifically, the spatial gating module estimates which areas are essential, and the channel gating module predicts the salient channels that contribute more to the results. Then the computation of both unimportant regions and irrelevant channels can be skipped dynamically during inference. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve higher accuracy under similar computing budgets compared with other dynamic execution methods. In particular, dynamic dual gating can provide 59.7% saving in computing of ResNet50 with 76.41% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which has advanced the state-of-the-art.

However, the irregular sparse patterns introduced by both weights and activations are much more challenging for efficient computation. For example, due to the issues of access contention, workload imbalance, and tile fragmentation, the state-of-the-art sparse accelerator SCNN fails to fully leverage the benefits of sparsity, leading to nonoptimal results for both speedup and energy efficiency. In this article, we propose an efficient sparse CNN accelerator for both weights and activations, namely finegrained systolic accelerator (FSA), which jointly optimizes both hardware dataflow and software partitioning and scheduling strategy. Specifically, to deal with the access contentions problem, we present a fine-grained systolic dataflow, in which the activations move rhythmically along the horizontal processing element array while the weights are fed into the array in a fine-grained order. We then propose a hybrid network partitioning strategy that sets different partitioning strategies for different layers to balance the workload and alleviate the fragmentation problem caused by both sparse weights and activations. Finally, we present a scheduling search strategy to find the optimized schedules for neural networks, which can further improve energy efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed FSA consistently outperforms SCNN over AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet with an average speedup of 1.74\u00d7 and up to 13.86\u00d7 energy efficiency."}}

However, state-of-the-art algorithms are both computation and memory intensive. Though many lightweight networks are developed for a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, it is still a challenge to make it practical on an embedded device. In this paper, we present a system-level solution for efficient object detection on a heterogeneous embedded device. The detection network is quantized to low bits and allows efficient implementation with shift operators. In order to make the most of the benefits of low-bit quantization, we design a dedicated accelerator with programmable logic. Inside the accelerator, a hybrid dataflow is exploited according to the heterogeneous property of different convolutional layers. We adopt a straightforward but resource-friendly column-prior tiling strategy to map the computation-intensive convolutional layers to the accelerator that can support arbitrary feature size. Other operations can be performed on the low-power CPU cores, and the entire system is executed in a pipelined manner. As a case study, we evaluate our object detection system on a real-world surveillance video with input size of 512x512, and it turns out that the system can achieve an inference speed of 18 fps at the cost of 6.9W (with display) with an mAP of 66.4 verified on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset."}}
