Can we say that some of them are better than others, or, ideally, choose one measure that is best in all situations? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic analysis of classification performance measures: we formally define a list of desirable properties and theoretically analyze which measures satisfy which properties. We also prove an impossibility theorem: some desirable properties cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Finally, we propose a new family of measures satisfying all desirable properties except one. This family includes the Matthews Correlation Coefficient and a so-called Symmetric Balanced Accuracy that was not previously used in classification literature. We believe that our systematic approach gives an important tool to practitioners for adequately evaluating classification results."}}

We demonstrate that this problem is crucial: there are many disagreements among the indices, these disagreements do affect which algorithms are chosen in applications, and this can lead to degraded performance in real-world systems. We propose a theoretical solution to this problem: we develop a list of desirable properties and theoretically verify which indices satisfy them. This allows for making an informed choice: given a particular application, one can first make a selection of properties that are desirable for a given application and then identify indices satisfying these. We observe that many popular indices have significant drawbacks. Instead, we advocate using other ones that are not so widely adopted but have beneficial properties."}}
