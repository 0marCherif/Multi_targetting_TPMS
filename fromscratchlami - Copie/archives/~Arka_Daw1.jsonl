This is reflected in several recent studies on characterizing and mitigating the ``failure modes'' of PINNs. While most of these studies have focused on balancing loss functions or adaptively tuning PDE coefficients, what is missing is a thorough understanding of the connection between failure modes of PINNs and sampling strategies used for training PINNs. In this paper, we provide a novel perspective of failure modes of PINNs by hypothesizing that the training of PINNs rely on successful ``propagation'' of solution from initial and/or boundary condition points to interior points. We show that PINNs with poor sampling strategies can get stuck at trivial solutions if there are propagation failures. We additionally demonstrate that propagation failures are characterized by highly imbalanced PDE residual fields where very high residuals are observed over very narrow regions. To mitigate propagation failures, we propose a novel evolutionary sampling (Evo) method that can incrementally accumulate collocation points in regions of high PDE residuals with little to no computational overhead. We provide an extension of Evo to respect the principle of causality while solving time-dependent PDEs. We theoretically analyze the behavior of Evo and empirically demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency in comparison with baselines on a variety of PDE problems."}}

While it is well understood that the complex behavior of the atmospheric dispersion of such pollutants is governed by the Advection-Diffusion equation, it is difficult to directly apply the governing equations to identify the source location and magnitude (inverse problem) because of the spatially sparse and noisy observations, i.e., the pollution concentration is known only at the sensor locations and sensors sensitivity is limited. Here, we develop a multi-task learning framework that can provide high-fidelity reconstruction of the concentration field and identify emission characteristics of the pollution sources such as their location, emission strength, etc. from sparse sensor observations.

This allows us to integrate such models with state of the art uncertainty estimation approaches such as Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout without sacrificing the physical consistency of our results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in ensuring better generalizability as well as physical consistency in MC estimates over data collected from Lake Mendota in Wisconsin and Falling Creek Reservoir in Virginia, even with limited training data. We further show that our MC estimates correctly match the distribution of ground-truth observations, thus making the PGA paradigm amenable to physically grounded uncertainty quantification."}}
