In this paper, we introduce multilingual addressee and response selection. In this task, a conversational system predicts an appropriate addressee and response for an input message in multiple languages. A key to developing such multilingual responding systems is how to utilize high-resource language data to compensate for low-resource language data. We present several knowledge transfer methods for conversational systems. To evaluate our methods, we create a new multilingual conversation dataset. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods."}}

However, handling unconstrained spoken instructions is challenging due to (1) complex structures and the wide variety of expressions used in spoken language, and (2) inherent ambiguity of human instructions. In this paper, we propose the first comprehensive system for controlling robots with unconstrained spoken language, which is able to effectively resolve ambiguity in spoken instructions. Specifically, we integrate deep learning-based object detection together with natural language processing technologies to handle unconstrained spoken instructions, and propose a method for robots to resolve instruction ambiguity through dialogue. Through our experiments on both a simulated environment as well as a physical industrial robot arm, we demonstrate the ability of our system to understand natural instructions from human operators effectively, and show how higher success rates of the object picking task can be achieved through an interactive clarification process."}}

Even with state-of-the-art RL algorithms, building a well-learned agent often requires too many trials, mainly due to the difficulty of matching its actions with rewards in the distant future. A remedy for this is to train an agent with real-time feedback from a human observer who immediately gives rewards for some actions. This study tackles a series of challenges for introducing such a human-in-the-loop RL scheme. The first contribution of this work is our experiments with a precisely modeled human observer: binary, delay, stochasticity, unsustainability, and natural reaction. We also propose an RL method called DQN-TAMER, which efficiently uses both human feedback and distant rewards. We find that DQN-TAMER agents outperform their baselines in Maze and Taxi simulated environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate a real-world human-in-the-loop RL application where a camera automatically recognizes a user's facial expressions as feedback to the agent while the agent explores a maze."}}

We investigated several types of corpus-wide information for the words, such as word embeddings and POS tag distributions. Since these statistics are encoded as dense continuous features, it is not trivial to combine these features comparing with sparse discrete features. Our tagger is designed as a combination of a linear model for discrete features and a feed-forward neural network that captures the non-linear interactions among the continuous features. By using several recent advances in the activation functions for neural networks, the proposed method marks new state-of-the-art accuracies for English POS tagging tasks."}}

Especially in the real data set, an outlier worker was found by applying the proposed method."}}
