An important question being asked by the AI community today is about the capabilities and limits of these models, and it is clear that evaluating generative AI is very challenging. Most studies on generative LLMs have been restricted to English and it is unclear how capable these models are at understanding and generating text in other languages. We present the first comprehensive benchmarking of generative LLMs - MEGA, which evaluates models on standard NLP benchmarks, covering 16 NLP datasets across 70 typologically diverse languages. We compare the performance of generative LLMs including Chat-GPT and GPT4 to State of the Art (SOTA) non-autoregressive models on these tasks to determine how well generative models perform compared to the previous generation of LLMs. We present a thorough analysis of the performance of models across languages and tasks and discuss challenges in improving the performance of generative LLMs on low-resource languages. We create a framework for evaluating generative LLMs in the multilingual setting and provide directions for future progress in the field."}}

We study Multilingual KGC for KGs that associate entities and relations with surface forms from different languages. In such a setting, an entity (or relation) may be mentioned as separate IDs in different KGs, necessitating entity alignment (EA) and relation alignment (RA). In addition to EA and RA being important subtasks for Multilingual KGC, we posit that high confidence fact predictions may also, in turn, add valuable information for alignment tasks, and vice versa. In response, we present the novel task of jointly training multilingual KGC, EA and RA models. Our approach, AlignKGC, uses mBERT-based surface form overlap for EA, and combines it with a KGC approach, extended to the multiple KG setting via a loss term that incentivizes RA. On experiments with DBPedia in five languages, we find that ALIGNKGC achieves upto 17% absolute MRR improvements in KGC compared to a strong completion model that combines all facts. It also outperforms an mBERT-only alignment baseline for EA, underscoring the value of joint training for these tasks.\n"}}

While time-agnostic KB completion (KBC) has witnessed significant research, temporal KB completion (TKBC) is in its early days. In this paper, we consider predicting missing entities (link prediction) and missing time intervals (time prediction) as joint TKBC tasks where entities, relations, and time are all embedded in a uniform, compatible space. We present TIMEPLEX, a novel time-aware KBC method, that also automatically exploits the recurrent nature of some relations and temporal interactions between pairs of relations. TIMEPLEX achieves state-of-the-art performance on both prediction tasks. We also find that existing TKBC models heavily overestimate link prediction performance due to imperfect evaluation mechanisms. In response, we propose improved TKBC evaluation protocols for both link and time prediction tasks, dealing with subtle issues that arise from the partial overlap of time intervals in gold instances and system predictions."}}

Several recent KBCpapers propose architectural changes, new training methods, or even new formulations. KBC systems are usually evaluated on standard benchmark datasets: FB15k, FB15k-237, WN18, WN18RR, and Yago3-10. Most existing methods train with a small number of negative samples for each positive instance in these datasets to save computational costs. This paper discusses how recent developments allow us to use all available negative samples for training. We show that Complex, when trained using all available negative samples, gives near state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets. We call this approach COMPLEX-V2. We also highlight how various multiplicative KBC methods, recently proposed in the literature, benefit from this train-ing regime and become indistinguishable in terms of performance on most datasets. Our work calls for a reassessment of their individual value, in light of these findings."}}

Is there a single model that performs well across datasets? If not, what characteristics of a dataset determine the performance of MF and TF models? Is there a joint TF+MF model that performs robustly on all datasets? We perform an extensive evaluation to compare popular KB inference models across popular datasets in the literature. In addition to answering the questions above, we remove a limitation in the standard evaluation protocol for MF models, propose an extension to MF models so that they can better handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) entity pairs, and develop a novel combination of TF and MF models. We also analyze and explain the results based on models and dataset characteristics. Our best model is robust, and obtains strong results across all datasets."}}

Researchers have proposed a variety of centrality measures to identify individuals that are, for example, often visited by a random walk, infected in an epidemic, or receive many messages from friends. Recent research suggests that a social media users' capacity to respond to an incoming message is constrained by their finite attention, which they divide over all incoming information, i.e., information sent by users they follow. We propose a new measure of centrality - limited-attention version of Bonacich's Alpha-centrality - that models the effect of limited attention on epidemic diffusion. The new measure describes a process in which nodes broadcast messages to their out-neighbors, but the neighbors' ability to receive the message depends on the number of in-neighbors they have. We evaluate the proposed measure on real-world online social networks and show that it can better reproduce an empirical influence ranking of users than other popular centrality measures."}}

In this work, we understand the characteristics and risks of mobile numbers shared on OSNs either via profile or public posts and focus on Indian mobile numbers. We collected 76,347 unique mobile numbers posted by 85,905 users on Twitter and Facebook and analyzed 2,997 numbers, prefixed with +91. We observed that most users shared their own mobile numbers to spread urgent information and to market products, IT facilities and escort business. Users resorted to applications like Twitterfeed and TweetDeck to post and popularize mobile numbers on multiple OSNs. To assess risks associated with mobile numbers exposed on OSNs, we used mobile numbers to gain sensitive information (e.g. name, Voter ID) about their owners. We communicated the observed risks to the owners by calling them on their mobile number. Few users were surprised to know the online presence of their number, while few users intentionally put it online for business purposes. With these observations, we highlight that there is a need to monitor leakage of mobile numbers via profile and public posts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploratory study to critically investigate the exposure of mobile numbers on OSNs."}}

Users utilized other OSN platforms and third party applications like Twitterfeed, to post mobile numbers on multiple OSNs. In contrast to the user's perception of numbers spreading quickly on OSN, we observed that except for emergency, most numbers did not diffuse deep. To assess risks associated with mobile numbers exposed on OSNs, we used numbers to gain sensitive information about their owners (e.g. name, Voter ID) by collating publicly available data from OSNs, Truecaller, OCEAN. On using the numbers on WhatApp, we obtained a myriad of sensitive details (relationship status, BBM pins) of the number owner. We communicated the observed risks to the owners by calling. Few users were surprised to know about the online presence of their number, while a few others intentionally posted it online for business purposes. We observed, 38.3% of users who were unaware of the online presence of their number have posted their number themselves on the social network. With these observations, we highlight that there is a need to monitor leakage of mobile numbers via profile and public posts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploratory study to critically investigate the exposure of Indian mobile numbers on OSNs."}}
