As a result, researchers have been devoted to deepfake detection. Previous studies have identified the importance of local low-level cues and temporal information in pursuit to generalize well across deepfake methods, however, they still suffer from robustness problem against post-processings. In this work, we  propose the Local- & Temporal-aware Transformer-based Deepfake Detection (LTTD) framework, which adopts a local-to-global learning protocol with a particular focus on the valuable temporal information within local sequences. Specifically, we propose a Local Sequence Transformer (LST), which models the temporal consistency on sequences of restricted spatial regions, where low-level information is hierarchically enhanced with shallow layers of learned 3D filters. Based on the local temporal embeddings, we then achieve the final classification in a global contrastive way. Extensive experiments on popular datasets validate that our approach effectively spots local forgery cues and achieves state-of-the-art performance."}}

While previous works mostly map speech audio to human skeletons (e.g., 2D keypoints), directly generating speakers' gestures in the image domain remains unsolved. In this work, we formally define and study this challenging problem of audio-driven co-speech gesture video generation, i.e., using a unified framework to generate speaker image sequence driven by speech audio. Our key insight is that the co-speech gestures can be decomposed into common motion patterns and subtle rhythmic dynamics. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Audio-driveN Gesture vIdeo gEneration (ANGIE), to effectively capture the reusable co-speech gesture patterns as well as fine-grained rhythmic movements. To achieve high-fidelity image sequence generation, we leverage an unsupervised motion representation instead of a structural human body prior (e.g., 2D skeletons). Specifically, 1) we propose a vector quantized motion extractor (VQ-Motion Extractor) to summarize common co-speech gesture patterns from implicit motion representation to codebooks. 2) Moreover, a co-speech gesture GPT with motion refinement (Co-Speech GPT) is devised to complement the subtle prosodic motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework renders realistic and vivid co-speech gesture video. Demo video and more resources can be found in: https://alvinliu0.github.io/projects/ANGIE"}}

However, it is not easy to devise an effective cross-modal fusion structure due to the variations of feature dimensions and semantics, especially when the inputs even come from different sensors, as in the field of audio-visual learning. In this work, we propose SepFusion, a novel framework that can smoothly produce optimal fusion structures for visual-sound separation. The framework is composed of two components, namely the model generator and the evaluator. To construct the generator, we devise a lightweight architecture space that can adapt to different input modalities. In this way, we can easily obtain audio-visual fusion structures according to our demands. For the evaluator, we adopt the idea of neural architecture search to select superior networks effectively. This automatic process can significantly save human efforts while achieving competitive performances. Moreover, since our SepFusion provides a series of strong models, we can utilize the model family for broader applications, such as further promoting performance via model assembly, or providing suitable architectures for the separation of certain instrument classes. These potential applications further enhance the competitiveness of our approach."}}

Then through exploring the motion model\u2019s properties, we further propose an Implicit Emotion Displacement Learner to represent emotion-related facial dynamics as linearly additive displacements to the previously acquired motion representations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that by incorporating the results from both modules, our method can generate satisfactory talking face results on arbitrary subjects with realistic emotion patterns."}}

In this paper, we propose the Granularly Controlled Audio-Visual Talking Heads (GC-AVT), which controls lip movements, head poses, and facial expressions of a talking head in a granular manner. Our insight is to decouple the audio-visual driving sources through prior-based pre-processing designs. Detailedly, we disassemble the driving image into three complementary parts including: 1) a cropped mouth that facilitates lip-sync; 2) a masked head that implicitly learns pose; and 3) the upper face which works corporately and complementarily with a time-shifted mouth to contribute the expression. Interestingly, the encoded features from the three sources are integrally balanced through reconstruction training. Extensive experiments show that our method generates expressive faces with not only synced mouth shapes, controllable poses, but precisely animated emotional expressions as well."}}

Previous studies often synthesize pose movement in a holistic manner, where poses of all joints are generated simultaneously. Such a straightforward pipeline fails to generate fine-grained co-speech gestures. One observation is that the hierarchical semantics in speech and the hierarchical structures of human gestures can be naturally described into multiple granularities and associated together. To fully utilize the rich connections between speech audio and human gestures, we propose a novel framework named Hierarchical Audio-to-Gesture (HA2G) for co-speech gesture generation. In HA2G, a Hierarchical Audio Learner extracts audio representations across semantic granularities. A Hierarchical Pose Inferer subsequently renders the entire human pose gradually in a hierarchical manner. To enhance the quality of synthesized gestures, we develop a contrastive learning strategy based on audio-text alignment for better audio representations. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate that the proposed method renders realistic co-speech gestures and out-performs previous methods in a clear margin.

While face swapping has drawn much attention, the task of head swapping has rarely been explored, particularly under the few-shot setting. It is inherently challenging due to its unique needs in head modeling and background blending. In this paper, we present the Head Swapper (HeSer), which achieves few-shot head swapping in the wild through two delicately de-signed modules. Firstly, a Head2Head Aligner is devised to holistically migrate pose and expression information from the target to the source head by examining multi-scale in-formation. Secondly, to tackle the challenges of skin color variations and head-background mismatches in the swapping procedure, a Head2Scene Blender is introduced to si-multaneously modify facial skin color and fill mismatched gaps on the background around the head. Particularly, seamless blending is achieved with the help of a Semantic-Guided Color Reference Creation procedure and a Blending UNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method produces superior head swapping results on a variety of scenes."}}

However, in real world scenarios, audios are usually contaminated by off screen sound and background noise. They will interfere with the procedure of identifying desired sources and building visual sound connections, making previous studies nonapplicable. In this work, we propose the Interference Eraser (IEr) framework, which tackles the problem of audiovisual sound source localization in the wild. The key idea is to eliminate the interference by redefining and carving discriminative audio representations. Specifically, we observe that the previous practice of learning only a single audio representation is insufficient due to the additive nature of audio signals. We thus extend the audio representation with our Audio Instance Identifier module, which clearly distinguishes sounding instances when audio signals of different volumes are unevenly mixed. Then we erase the influence of the audible but off screen sounds and the silent but visible objects by a Cross modal Referrer module with cross modality distillation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our framework achieves superior results on sound localization tasks, especially under real world scenarios."}}

In this work, we focus on a more general and challenging scenario, namely the separation of unknown musical instruments, where the categories in training and testing phases have no overlap with each other. To tackle this new setting, we propose the Separation-with-Consistency (SeCo) framework, which can accomplish the separation on unknown categories by exploiting the consistency constraints. Furthermore, to capture richer characteristics of the novel melodies, we devise an online matching strategy, which can bring stable enhancements with no cost of extra parameters. Experiments demonstrate that our SeCo framework exhibits strong adaptation ability on the novel musical categories and outperforms the baseline methods by a significant margin."}}

While most previous studies rely on accurate explicit structural information, recent works explore the implicit scene representation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for realistic generation. In order to capture the inconsistent motions as well as the semantic difference between human head and torso, some work models them via two individual sets of NeRF, leading to unnatural results. In this work, we propose Semantic-aware Speaking Portrait NeRF (SSP-NeRF), which creates delicate audio-driven portraits using one unified set of NeRF. The proposed model can handle the detailed local facial semantics and the global head-torso relationship through two semantic-aware modules. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Aware Dynamic Ray Sampling module with an additional parsing branch that facilitates audio-driven volume rendering. Moreover, to enable portrait rendering in one unified neural radiance field, a Torso Deformation module is designed to stabilize the large-scale non-rigid torso motions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed approach renders realistic video portraits. Demo video and more resources can be found in https://alvinliu0.github.io/projects/SSP-NeRF ."}}
