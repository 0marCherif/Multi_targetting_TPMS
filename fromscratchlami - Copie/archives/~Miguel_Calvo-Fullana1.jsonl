The need to impose requirements on learning is therefore paramount, especially as it reaches critical applications in social, industrial, and medical domains. However, the non-convexity of most modern statistical problems is only exacerbated by the introduction of constraints. Whereas good unconstrained solutions can often be learned using empirical risk minimization, even obtaining a model that satisfies statistical constraints can be challenging. All the more so, a good one. In this paper, we overcome this issue by learning in the empirical dual domain, where constrained statistical learning problems become unconstrained and deterministic. We analyze the generalization properties of this approach by bounding the empirical duality gap\u2014i.e., the difference between our approximate, tractable solution and the solution of the original (non-convex) statistical problem\u2014and provide a practical constrained learning algorithm. These results establish a constrained counterpart to classical learning theory, enabling the explicit use of constraints in learning. We illustrate this theory and algorithm in rate-constrained learning applications arising in fairness and adversarial robustness."}}

This is, we aim to control a Markov decision process of which we do not know the transition probabilities, but we have access to sample trajectories through experience. We define safety as the agent remaining in a desired safe set with high probability during the operation time. The drawbacks of this formulation are twofold. The problem is nonconvex and computing the gradients of the constraints with respect to the policies is prohibitive. Hence, we propose an ergodic relaxation of the constraints with the following advantages. 1) The safety guarantees are maintained in the case of episodic tasks and they hold until a given time horizon for continuing tasks. 2) The constrained optimization problem despite its nonconvexity has arbitrarily small duality gap if the parametrization of the controller is rich enough. 3) The gradients of the Lagrangian associated with the safe learning problem can be computed using standard reinforcement learning results and stochastic approximation tools. Leveraging these advantages, we exploit primal-dual algorithms to find policies that are safe and optimal. We test the proposed approach in a navigation task in a continuous domain. The numerical results show that our algorithm is capable of dynamically adapting the policy to the environment and the required safety levels."}}

At its core, the idea behind multi-task learning is to exploit the intrinsic similarity across data sources to aid in the learning process for each individual domain. In this paper we draw intuition from the two extreme learning scenarios -- a single function for all tasks, and a task-specific function that ignores the other tasks dependencies -- to propose a bias-variance trade-off. To control the relationship between the variance (given by the number of i.i.d. samples), and the bias (coming from data from other task), we introduce a constrained learning formulation that enforces domain specific solutions to be close to a central function. This problem is solved in the dual domain, for which we propose a stochastic primal-dual algorithm. Experimental results for a multi-domain classification problem with real data show that the proposed procedure outperforms both the task specific, as well as the single classifiers."}}

Due to the nature of these systems, coordination among agents via communication is frequently necessary. Indeed, Perception-Action-Communication (PAC) loops, or Perception-Action loops closed over a communication channel, are a critical component of multi-robot systems. However, we lack appropriate tools for simulating PAC loops. To that end, in this letter, we introduce ROS-NetSim, a ROS package that acts as an interface between robotic and network simulators. With ROS-NetSim, we can attain high-fidelity representations of both robotic and network interactions by accurately simulating the PAC loop. Our proposed approach is lightweight, modular and adaptive. Furthermore, it can be used with many available network and physics simulators by making use of our proposed interface. In summary, ROS-NetSim is (i) Transparent to the ROS target application, (ii) Agnostic to the specific network and physics simulator being used, and (iii) Tunable in fidelity and complexity. As part of our contribution, we have made available an open-source implementation of ROS-NetSim to the community."}}
