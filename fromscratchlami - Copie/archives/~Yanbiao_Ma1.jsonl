However, recent studies have shown that tail classes are not always hard to learn, and model bias has been observed on sample-balanced datasets, suggesting the existence of other factors that affect model bias. In this work, we systematically propose a series of geometric measurements for perceptual manifolds in deep neural networks, and then explore the effect of the geometric characteristics of perceptual manifolds on classification difficulty and how learning shapes the geometric characteristics of perceptual manifolds. An unanticipated finding is that the correlation between the class accuracy and the separation degree of perceptual manifolds gradually decreases during training, while the negative correlation with the curvature gradually increases, implying that curvature imbalance leads to model bias. Therefore, we propose curvature regularization to facilitate the model to learn curvature-balanced and flatter perceptual manifolds. Evaluations on multiple long-tailed and non-long-tailed datasets show the excellent performance and exciting generality of our approach, especially in achieving significant performance improvements based on current state-of-the-art techniques. Our work opens up a geometric analysis perspective on model bias and reminds researchers to pay attention to model bias on non-long-tailed and even sample-balanced datasets. The code and model will be made public."}}

Due to the prevalence of semantic scale imbalance, we propose semantic-scale-balanced learning, including a general loss improvement scheme and a dynamic re-weighting training framework that overcomes the challenge of calculating semantic scales in real-time during iterations. Comprehensive experiments show that dynamic semantic-scale-balanced learning consistently enables the model to perform superiorly on large-scale long-tailed and non-long-tailed datasets, which is a good starting point for mitigating the prevalent but unnoticed model bias.

Multisource, multitemporal, and multimodal remote sensing images can provide rich information about the target area, so using multisource remote sensing images for accurate detection of human settlements without electricity is a feasible solution. In this paper two separate detection tasks are formulated: building two attention SENet for settlements detection and light detection using the Sentinel-2 dataset and the Suomi Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) night time dataset, respectively. In addition, we study a new outlier removal method based on the pixel distribution characteristics of the VIIRS dataset for data pre-processing, and propose a post-processing method based on region continuity for further correction of the results. Experiments show that our method can maximize the use of multisource data information and rank first in the detection of settlements without electricity challenge track (Track DSE) of the 2021 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest."}}

ASD is mainly characterized by developmental disorders, as well as abnormalities in social skills, communication skills, interests, and behavioral patterns. ASD is a congenital developmental disorder that cannot be completely cured by existing medical methods, and only after-day intervention can relieve its symptoms. In addition, the sooner you get the intervention, the better the patient's recovery. However, when most patients with ASD show the symptoms, they have missed the best intervention period. In order to allow the subject to be diagnosed earlier with ASD, we applied deep learning techniques to evaluate neural networks in ASD under functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) imaging. At the same time, we also compared the accuracy of detection under the principle of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) imaging. Our experiments show that neural networks perform much better on fMRI data than sMRI data."}}
