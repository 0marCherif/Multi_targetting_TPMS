To address this challenge, we organize these visual features into facets, which intuitively group features of the same kind (e.g. features that are relevant to shape, color, or texture). This is motivated from the assumption that (i) the importance of each facet differs from category to category and (ii) it is possible to predict facet importance from a pre-trained embedding of the category names. In particular, we propose an adaptive similarity measure, relying on predicted facet importance weights for a given set of categories.

As new bibliographic datasets are created as a result of the upward growth of publication records worldwide, more problems arise when considering the effects of errors resulting from missing data fields, duplicate entities, misspellings, extra characters, etc. As these concerns tend to be of large-scale, both the general consistency and the quality of electronic data are largely affected. This paper presents an approach to handle these name ambiguity problems through the use of crowdsourcing as a complementary means to traditional unsupervised approaches. To this end, we present \u201cAuthCrowd\u201d, a crowdsourcing system with the ability to decompose named entity disambiguation and entity matching tasks. Experimental results on a real-world dataset of publicly available papers published in peer-reviewed venues demonstrate the potential of our proposed approach for improving author name disambiguation. The findings further highlight the importance of adopting hybrid crowd-algorithm collaboration strategies, especially for handling complexity and quantifying bias when working with large amounts of data."}}

This is a challenging task, as the available examples may not be enough to unambiguously determine which visual features are most characteristic of the considered categories. To alleviate this issue, we propose a method that additionally takes into account the names of the image classes. While the use of class names has already been explored in previous work, our approach differs in two key aspects. First, while previous work has aimed to directly predict visual prototypes from word embeddings, we found that better results can be obtained by treating visual and text-based prototypes separately. Second, we propose a simple strategy for learning class name embeddings using the BERT language model, which we found to substantially outperform the GloVe vectors that were used in previous work. We furthermore propose a strategy for dealing with the high dimensionality of these vectors, inspired by models for aligning cross-lingual word embeddings. We provide experiments on miniImageNet, CUB and tieredImageNet, showing that our approach consistently improves the state-of-the-art in metric-based FSL."}}

To overcome the shortcomings in the existing automatic depression detection methods, we propose a novel computational framework for automatic depression detection that initially selects relevant content through a hybrid extractive and abstractive summarization strategy on the sequence of all user tweets leading to a more fine-grained and relevant content.

Despite some attempts to empirically examine the evolution and identity of the field of CSCW and its related communities and disciplines, the scarcity of scientometric studies on the IEEE CSCWD research productivity is noteworthy. To fill this gap, this study reports on an exploratory quantitative analysis of the literature published in the IEEE CSCWD conference proceedings with the purpose of visualizing and understanding its structure and evolution for the 2001-2019 period. The findings offer valuable insights into the paper and author distribution, country and citation-level productivity indicators, degree of collaboration, and collaboration index. Through this analysis we also expect to get an initial overview of the IEEE CSCWD conference concerning the main topics being presented, most cited papers, and variances in the number of keywords, full-text views, and references."}}

However, most of the existing models suffer from the off-topic problem, namely, the models are prone to generate some unrelated clauses that are somehow involved with certain input terms regardless of the given input data. This problem seriously degrades the quality of the generation results. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic topic tracker for solving this problem. Different from existing models, our proposed model learns a global hidden representation for topics and recognizes the corresponding topic during each generation step. The recognized topic is used as additional information to guide the generation process and thus alleviates the off-topic problem. The experimental results show that our proposed model can enhance the performance of sentence generation and the off-topic problem is significantly mitigated."}}

However, most of the existing machine learning methods provide no interpretability for depression prediction, hence their predictions are obscure to human. In this work, we propose interpretive Multi-Modal Depression Detection with Hierarchical Attention Network MDHAN, for detection depressed users on social media and explain the model prediction. We have considered user posts along with Twitter-based multi-modal features, specifically, we encode user posts using two levels of attention mechanisms applied at the tweet-level and word-level, calculate each tweet and words' importance, and capture semantic sequence features from the user timelines (posts). Our experiments show that MDHAN outperforms several popular and robust baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining deep learning with multi-modal features. We also show that our model helps improve predictive performance when detecting depression in users who are posting messages publicly on social media. MDHAN achieves excellent performance and ensures adequate evidence to explain the prediction."}}

This is motivated by a fundamental interest in the field of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) in developing theoretical frameworks useful for representing situated practices observed from in-depth studies and other related approaches in order to inform the design of useful systems. To this end, we conducted an online survey with 90 researchers from 26 different countries to gather information on their motivations, expectations, and difficulties experienced when working in scientific domains. Using the conceptual background of the well-established technology acceptance model (TAM), our preliminary results show that TAM can predict a substantial proportion of the intention to use crowdsourcing and human-centered algorithms in research-based activities although there is some reluctance regarding the suitability of general crowds for specialized tasks. Our findings contribute to the literature by reporting problems related to data collection, quality control, and inaccuracies of current mechanisms for information seeking. These factors, in tandem with the ethical concerns about the negative impacts of such technologies when deployed inappropriately, highlight some areas of improvement and implications for design as a point of departure for continued empirical investigations."}}
