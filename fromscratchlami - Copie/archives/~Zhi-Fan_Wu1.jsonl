Existing SSL typically requires all classes have labels. However, in many real-world applications, there may exist some classes that are difficult to label or newly occurred classes that cannot be labeled in time, resulting in there are unseen classes in unlabeled data. Unseen classes will be misclassified as seen classes, causing poor classification performance. The performance of seen classes is also harmed by the existence of unseen classes. This limits the practical and wider application of SSL. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new SSL approach that can classify not only seen classes but also unseen classes. Our approach consists of two modules: unseen class classification and learning pace synchronization. Specifically, we first enable the SSL methods to classify unseen classes by exploiting pairwise similarity between examples and then synchronize the learning pace between seen and unseen classes by proposing an adaptive threshold with distribution alignment. Extensive empirical results show our approach achieves significant performance improvement in both seen and unseen classes compared with previous studies."}}

In this work, we focus on the application scenarios where unlabeled data are continuously fed into the category discovery system. We refer to it as the {\\bf Continuous Category Discovery} ({\\bf CCD}) problem, which is significantly more challenging than the static setting. A common challenge faced by novel category discovery is that different sets of features are needed for classification and category discovery: class discriminative features are preferred for classification, while rich and diverse features are more suitable for new category mining. This challenge becomes more severe for dynamic setting as the system is asked to deliver good performance for known classes over time, and at the same time continuously discover new classes from unlabeled data. To address this challenge, we develop a framework of {\\bf Grow and Merge} ({\\bf GM}) that works by alternating between a growing phase and a merge phase: in the growing phase, it increases the diversity of features through a continuous self-supervised learning for effective category mining, and in the merging phase, it merges the grown model with a static one to ensure satisfying performance for known classes. Our extensive studies verify that the proposed GM framework is significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art approaches for continuous category discovery."}}

There have been plenty of works concentrated on learning with indistribution (IND) noisy labels in the last decade, i.e., some training samples are assigned incorrect labels that do not correspond to their true classes. Nonetheless, in real application scenarios, it is necessary to consider the influence of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, i.e., samples that do not belong to any known classes, which has not been sufficiently explored yet. To remedy this, we study a new problem setup, namely Learning with Open-world Noisy Data (LOND). The goal of LOND is to simultaneously learn a classifier and an OOD detector from datasets with mixed IND and OOD noise. In this paper, we propose a new graph-based framework, namely Noisy Graph Cleaning (NGC), which collects clean samples by leveraging geometric structure of data and model predictive confidence. Without any additional training effort, NGC can detect and reject the OOD samples based on the learned class prototypes directly in testing phase. We conduct experiments on multiple benchmarks with different types of noise and the results demonstrate the superior performance of our method against state of the arts."}}
