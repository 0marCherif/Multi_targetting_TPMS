Unfortunately, these methods can hardly be extended to the multi-label learning scenario. Because each instance is associated with multiple semantic labels, neither the prediction logits nor the feature maps obtained from the whole example can accurately transfer knowledge for each label. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-label knowledge distillation method. On one hand, it exploits the informative semantic knowledge from the logits by label decoupling with the one-versus-all reduction strategy; on the other hand, it enhances the distinctiveness of the learned feature representations by leveraging the structural information of label-wise embeddings. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets validate that the proposed method can avoid knowledge counteraction among labels, and achieve superior performance against diverse comparing methods."}}
