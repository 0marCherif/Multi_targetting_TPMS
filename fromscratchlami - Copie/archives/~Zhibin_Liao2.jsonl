A common criticism of CNNs is their opaque learning and reasoning process, making it difficult to trust machine diagnosis and the subsequent adoption of such algorithms in clinical setting. This is especially true when the CNN is trained with limited amount of medical data, which is a common issue as curating sufficiently large amount of annotated medical imaging data is a long and costly process. While interest has been devoted to explaining CNN learnt knowledge by visualizing network attention, the utilization of the visualized attention to improve network learning has been rarely investigated. This paper explores the effectiveness of regularizing CNN network with human-provided attention guidance on where in the image the network should look for answering clues. On two orthopedics radiographic fracture classification datasets, through extensive experiments we demonstrate that explicit human-guided attention indeed can direct correct network attention and consequently significantly improve classification performance.

Although deep models have demonstrated superior performance in medical image segmentation, they commonly require a large amount of annotated data, which are hard to obtain due to the extensive labor costs and expertise required. In this paper, we propose an intra- and inter-pair consistency-based semi-supervised (I <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> CS) model that can be trained on both labeled and unlabeled histology images for gland segmentation. Considering that each image contains glands and hence different images could potentially share consistent semantics in the feature space, we introduce a novel intra- and inter-pair consistency module to explore such consistency for learning with unlabeled data. It first characterizes the pixel-level relation between a pair of images in the feature space to create an attention map that highlights the regions with the same semantics but on different images. Then, it imposes a consistency constraint on the attention maps obtained from multiple image pairs, and thus filters low-confidence attention regions to generate refined attention maps that are then merged with original features to improve their representation ability. In addition, we also design an object-level loss to address the issues caused by touching glands. We evaluated our model against several recent gland segmentation methods and three typical semi-supervised methods on the GlaS and CRAG datasets. Our results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed due consistency module and Obj-Dice loss, but also indicate that the proposed I <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> CS model achieves state-of-the-art gland segmentation performance on both benchmarks."}}

Rapid and accurate detection of viral pneumonia using chest X-rays can be of significant value for large-scale screening and epidemic prevention, particularly when other more sophisticated imaging modalities are not readily accessible. However, the emergence of novel mutated viruses causes a substantial dataset shift, which can greatly limit the performance of classification-based approaches. In this paper, we formulate the task of differentiating viral pneumonia from non-viral pneumonia and healthy controls into a one-class classification-based anomaly detection problem. We therefore propose the confidence-aware anomaly detection (CAAD) model, which consists of a shared feature extractor, an anomaly detection module, and a confidence prediction module. If the anomaly score produced by the anomaly detection module is large enough, or the confidence score estimated by the confidence prediction module is small enough, the input will be accepted as an anomaly case (i.e., viral pneumonia). The major advantage of our approach over binary classification is that we avoid modeling individual viral pneumonia classes explicitly and treat all known viral pneumonia cases as anomalies to improve the one-class model. The proposed model outperforms binary classification models on the clinical X-VIRAL dataset that contains 5,977 viral pneumonia (no COVID-19) cases, 37,393 non-viral pneumonia or healthy cases. Moreover, when directly testing on the X-COVID dataset that contains 106 COVID-19 cases and 107 normal controls without any fine-tuning, our model achieves an AUC of 83.61% and sensitivity of 71.70%, which is comparable to the performance of radiologists reported in the literature."}}
