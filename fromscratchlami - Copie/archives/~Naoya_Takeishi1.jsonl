Estimating the individual treatment effect (ITE) using counterfactual long-term prediction is practical to evaluate such interventions. However, most of the conventional frameworks did not consider the time-varying complex structure of multi-agent relationships and covariate counterfactual prediction. This may sometimes lead to erroneous assessments of ITE and interpretation problems. Here we propose an interpretable, counterfactual recurrent network in multi-agent systems to estimate the effect of the intervention. Our model leverages graph variational recurrent neural networks and theory-based computation with domain knowledge for the ITE estimation framework based on long-term prediction of multi-agent covariates and outcomes, which can confirm under the circumstances under which the intervention is effective. On simulated models of an automated vehicle and biological agents with time-varying confounders, we show that our methods achieved lower estimation errors in counterfactual covariates and the most effective treatment timing than the baselines. Furthermore, using real basketball data, our methods performed realistic counterfactual predictions and evaluated the counterfactual passes in shot scenarios."}}

As gait motion always follows the physical laws, a generative model should also produce outputs that comply with the physical laws, particularly rigid body dynamics with contact and friction. We propose a deep generative model combined with a differentiable physics engine, which outputs physically plausible signals by construction. The proposed model is also equipped with a policy network conditioned on each sample. We show an example of the application of such a model to style transfer of gait."}}

Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a powerful tool for extracting coherent patterns, but the original DMD and most of its variants do not consider label information, which is often available as side information of spatio-temporal data. In this work, we propose a new method for extracting distinctive coherent patterns from labeled spatio-temporal data collections, such that they contribute to major differences in a labeled set of dynamics. We achieve such pattern extraction by incorporating discriminant analysis into DMD. To this end, we define a kernel function on subspaces spanned by sets of dynamic modes and develop an objective to take both reconstruction goodness as DMD and class-separation goodness as discriminant analysis into account. We illustrate our method using a synthetic dataset and several real-world datasets. The proposed method can be a useful tool for exploratory data analysis for understanding spatio-temporal data."}}

Nevertheless, we have just visited tens of asteroids while we have discovered more than one million bodies. As our current observation and knowledge should be biased, it is essential to explore multiple asteroids directly to better understand the remains of planetary building materials. One of the mission design solutions is utilizing asteroid flyby cycler trajectories with multiple Earth gravity assists. An asteroid flyby cycler trajectory design problem is a subclass of global trajectory optimization problems with multiple flybys, involving a trajectory optimization problem for a given flyby sequence and a combinatorial optimization problem to decide the sequence of the flybys. As the number of flyby bodies grows, the computation time of this optimization problem expands maliciously. This paper presents a new method to design asteroid flyby cycler trajectories utilizing a surrogate model constructed by deep neural networks approximating trajectory optimization results. Since one of the bottlenecks of machine learning approaches is the computation time to generate massive trajectory databases, we propose an efficient database generation strategy by introducing pseudo-asteroids satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The numerical result applied to JAXA's DESTINY+ mission shows that the proposed method is practically applicable to space mission design and can significantly reduce the computational time for searching asteroid flyby sequences."}}

However, existing methods can only handle the stability of an equilibrium. In this paper, we propose a method to ensure that a dynamics model has a stable invariant set of general classes such as limit cycles and line attractors. We start with the approach by Manek and Kolter (2019), where they use a learnable Lyapunov function to make a model stable with regard to an equilibrium. We generalize it for general sets by introducing projection onto them. To resolve the difficulty of specifying a to-be stable invariant set analytically, we propose defining such a set as a primitive shape (e.g., sphere) in a latent space and learning the transformation between the original and latent spaces. It enables us to compute the projection easily, and at the same time, we can maintain the model's flexibility using various invertible neural networks for the transformation. We present experimental results that show the validity of the proposed method and the usefulness for long-term prediction."}}
