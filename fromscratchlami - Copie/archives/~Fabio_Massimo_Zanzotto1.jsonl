To succeed, machine learning needs a large amount of data, often including personal data. Therefore, machine learning applied to precision medicine is on a cliff edge: if it does not learn to fly, it will deeply fall down. In this paper, we present Active Informed Consent (AIC) as a novel hybrid legal-technological tool to foster the gathering of a large amount of data for machine learning. We carefully analyzed the compliance of this technological tool to the legal intricacies protecting the privacy of European Citizens."}}

The gigantic datasets used for pre-training seem to be the key for their success on existing tasks. In this paper, we explore how a range of pre-trained natural language understanding models perform on truly novel and unexplored data, provided by classification tasks over a DarkNet corpus. Surprisingly, results show that syntactic and lexical neural networks largely outperform pre-trained Transformers. This seems to suggest that pre-trained Transformers have serious difficulties in adapting to radically novel texts."}}

In this paper, we hypothesized how massive use of syntax can reduce the prejudice effect in HSRs. To explore this hypothesis, we propose Unintended-bias Visualizer based on Kermit modeling (KERM-HATE): a syntax-based HSR, which is endowed with syntax heat parse trees used as a post-hoc explanation of classifications. KERM-HATE significantly outperforms BERT-based, RoBERTa-based and XLNet-based HSR on standard datasets. Surprisingly this result is not sufficient. In fact, the post-hoc analysis on novel datasets on recent divisive topics shows that even KERM-HATE carries the prejudice distilled from the initial corpus. Therefore, although tests on standard datasets may show higher performance, syntax alone cannot drive the \u201cattention\u201d of HSRs to ethically-unbiased features."}}

On Facebook or LinkedIn, for example, people usually appear with their real names. On other standard websites, such as forums, people often use nicknames to protect their real identities. Aliases are used when users are trying to protect their anonymity. This can be a challenge to law enforcement trying to identify users who often change nicknames. In unmonitored contexts, such as the dark web, users expect strong identity protection. Thus, without censorship, these users may create parallel social networks where they can engage in potentially malicious activities that could pose security threats. In this paper, we propose a solution to the need to recognize people who anonymize themselves behind nicknames\u2014the authorship attribution (AA) task\u2014in the challenging context of the dark web: specifically, an English-language Islamic forum dedicated to discussions of issues related to the Islamic world and Islam, in which members of radical Islamic groups are present. We provide extensive analysis by testing models based on transformers, styles, and syntactic features. Downstream of the experiments, we show how models that analyze syntax and style perform better than pre-trained universal language models."}}

Nevertheless, it seems that it is not the right way to progress in AI. The structure of symbols\u2014the operations by which the intellectual solution is realized\u2014and the search for strategic reference points evoke important issues in the analysis of AI. Studying how knowledge can be represented through methods of theoretical generalization and empirical observation is only the latest step in a long process of evolution. For many years, humans, seeing language as innate, have carried out symbolic theories. Everything seems to have skipped ahead with the advent of Machine Learning. In this paper, after a long analysis of history, the rule-based and the learning-based vision, we would investigate the syntax as possible meeting point between the different learning theories. Finally, we propose a new vision of knowledge in AI models based on a combination of rules, learning, and human knowledge."}}
