However, they are designed on the homophilic assumption of graph and clustering on heterophilic graph is overlooked. Due to the lack of labels, it is impossible to first identify a graph as homophilic or heterophilic before a suitable GNN model can be found. Hence, clustering on real-world graph with various levels of homophily poses a new challenge to the graph research community. To fill this gap, we propose a novel graph clustering method, which contains three key components: graph reconstruction, a mixed filter, and dual graph clustering network. To be graph-agnostic, we empirically construct two graphs which are high homophily and heterophily from each data. The mixed filter based on the new graphs extracts both low-frequency and high-frequency information. To reduce the adverse coupling between node attribute and topological structure, we separately map them into two subspaces in dual graph clustering network. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark graphs demonstrate our promising performance. In particular, our method dominates others on heterophilic graphs."}}

However, in many real-world scenarios, the graph structure of data is not given or the quality of initial graph is poor. Additionally, existing methods largely neglect the high-order neighborhood information that characterizes complex intrinsic interactions. To tackle these problems, we introduce an approach called high-order multi-view clustering (HMvC) to explore the topology structure information of generic data. Firstly, graph filtering is applied to encode structure information, which unifies the processing of attributed graph data and non-graph data in a single framework. Secondly, up to infinity-order intrinsic relationships are exploited to enrich the learned graph. Thirdly, to explore the consistent and complementary information of various views, an adaptive graph fusion mechanism is proposed to achieve a consensus graph. Comprehensive experimental results on both non-graph and attributed graph data show the superior performance of our method with respect to various state-of-the-art techniques, including some deep learning methods."}}

Most existing multi-view clustering techniques either focus on the scenario of multiple graphs or multi-view attributes. In this paper, we propose a generic framework to cluster multi-view attributed graph data. Specifically, inspired by the success of contrastive learning, we propose multi-view contrastive graph clustering (MCGC) method to learn a consensus graph since the original graph could be noisy or incomplete and is not directly applicable. Our method composes of two key steps: we first filter out the undesirable high-frequency noise while preserving the graph geometric features via graph filtering and obtain a smooth representation of nodes; we then learn a consensus graph regularized by graph contrastive loss. Results on several benchmark datasets show the superiority of our method with respect to state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, our simple approach outperforms existing deep learning-based methods."}}
