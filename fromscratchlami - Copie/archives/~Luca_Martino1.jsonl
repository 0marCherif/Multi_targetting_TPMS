The nodes of the quadrature are sequentially chosen\nby maximizing a suitable acquisition function, which takes into account the current approximation of the\nposterior and the positions of the nodes. This maximization does not require additional evaluations of the\ntrue posterior. We introduce two speci\u001cc schemes based on Gaussian and Nearest Neighbors bases. For\nthe Gaussian case, we also provide a novel procedure for \u001ctting the bandwidth parameter, in order to build\na suitable emulator of a density function. With both techniques, we always obtain a positive estimation of\nthe marginal likelihood (a.k.a., Bayesian evidence). An equivalent importance sampling interpretation is\nalso described, which allows the design of extended schemes. Several theoretical results are provided and\ndiscussed. Numerical results showthe advantage of the proposed approach, including a challenging inference\nproblem in an astronomic dynamical model, with the goal of revealing the number of planets orbiting a star."}}
