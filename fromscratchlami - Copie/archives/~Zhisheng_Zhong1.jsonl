We first investigate and identify the main challenges of addressing this issue through pixel rebalance. Then a simple and yet effective region rebalance scheme is derived based on our analysis. In our solution, pixel features belonging to the same class are grouped into region features, and a rebalanced region classifier is applied via an auxiliary region rebalance branch during training. To verify the flexibility and effectiveness of our method, we apply the region rebalance module into various semantic segmentation methods, such as Deeplabv3+, OCRNet, and Swin. Our strategy achieves consistent improvement on the challenging ADE20K and COCO-Stuff benchmark. In particular, with the proposed region rebalance scheme, state-of-the-art BEiT receives +0.7% gain in terms of mIoU on the ADE20K val set."}}

Given the promising performance of contrastive learning, we propose Rebalanced Siamese Contrastive Mining (ResCom) to tackle imbalanced recognition. Based on the mathematical analysis and simulation results, we claim that supervised contrastive learning suffers a dual class-imbalance problem at both the original batch and Siamese batch levels, which is more serious than long-tailed classification learning. In this paper, at the original batch level, we introduce a class-balanced supervised contrastive loss to assign adaptive weights for different classes. At the Siamese batch level, we present a class-balanced queue, which maintains the same number of keys for all classes. Furthermore, we note that the imbalanced contrastive loss gradient with respect to the contrastive logits can be decoupled into the positives and negatives, and easy positives and easy negatives will make the contrastive gradient vanish. We propose supervised hard positive and negative pairs mining to pick up informative pairs for contrastive computation and improve representation learning. Finally, to approximately maximize the mutual information between the two views, we propose Siamese Balanced Softmax and joint it with the contrastive loss for one-stage training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResCom outperforms the previous methods by large margins on multiple long-tailed recognition benchmarks.

Based on theoretical analysis, we observe that supervised contrastive loss tends to bias high-frequency classes and thus increases the difficulty of imbalanced learning. We introduce a set of parametric class-wise learnable centers to rebalance from an optimization perspective. Further, we analyze our GPaCo/PaCo loss under a balanced setting. Our analysis demonstrates that GPaCo/PaCo can adaptively enhance the intensity of pushing samples of the same class close as more samples are pulled together with their corresponding centers and benefit hard example learning. Experiments on long-tailed benchmarks manifest the new state-of-the-art for long-tailed recognition. On full ImageNet, models from CNNs to vision transformers trained with GPaCo loss show better generalization performance and stronger robustness compared with MAE models. Moreover, GPaCo can be applied to the semantic segmentation task and obvious improvements are observed on the 4 most popular benchmarks.

Previous methods tackle the problem from either the aspect of input space (re-sampling classes with different frequencies) or loss space (re-weighting classes with different weights), suffering from heavy over-fitting to tail classes or hard optimization during training. To alleviate these issues, we propose a more fundamental perspective for long-tailed recognition, i.e., from the aspect of parameter space, and aims to preserve specific capacity for classes with low frequencies. From this perspective, the trivial solution utilizes different branches for the head, medium, and tail classes respectively, and then sums their outputs as the final results is not feasible. Instead, we design the effective residual fusion mechanism -- with one main branch optimized to recognize images from all classes, another two residual branches are gradually fused and optimized to enhance images from medium+tail classes and tail classes respectively. Then the branches are aggregated into final results by additive shortcuts. We test our method on several benchmarks, i.e., long-tailed version of CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Places, ImageNet, and iNaturalist 2018. Experimental results manifest the effectiveness of our method.

To optimize these four components, a joint rate-distortion framework was proposed, and many deep neural network-based methods achieved great success in image compression. However, almost all convolutional neural network-based methods treat channel-wise feature maps equally, reducing the flexibility in handling different types of information. In this paper, we propose a channel-level variable quantization network to dynamically allocate more bitrates for significant channels and withdraw bitrates for negligible channels. Specifically, we propose a variable quantization controller. It consists of two key components: the channel importance module, which can dynamically learn the importance of channels during training, and the splitting-merging module, which can allocate different bitrates for different channels. We also formulate the quantizer into a Gaussian mixture model manner. Quantitative and qualitative experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance and can produce much better visual reconstructions."}}
