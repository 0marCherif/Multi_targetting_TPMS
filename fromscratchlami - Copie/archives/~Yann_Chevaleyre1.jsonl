To address this, recent works propose evaluating generative models using precision and recall, where precision measures quality of samples and recall measures the coverage of the target distribution. Although a variety of discrepancy measures between the target and estimated distribution are used to train generative models, it is unclear what precision-recall trade-offs are achieved by various choices of the discrepancy measures. In this paper, we show that achieving a specified precision-recall trade-off corresponds to minimising -divergences from a family we call the {\\em PR-divergences }. Conversely, any -divergence can be written as a linear combination of PR-divergences and therefore correspond to minimising a weighted precision-recall trade-off. Further, we propose a novel generative model that is able to train a normalizing flow to minimise any -divergence, and in particular, achieve a given precision-recall trade-off."}}

To defend against adversarial attacks, probabilistic classifiers have been proposed as an alternative to deterministic ones. However, literature has conflicting findings on the effectiveness of probabilistic classifiers in comparison to deterministic ones. In this paper, we clarify the role of randomization in building adversarially robust classifiers. Given a base hypothesis set of deterministic classifiers, we show the conditions under which a randomized ensemble outperforms the hypothesis set in adversarial risk, extending previous results. Additionally, we show that for any probabilistic classifier (including randomized ensembles), there exists a deterministic classifier that outperforms it. Finally, we give an explicit description of the deterministic hypothesis set that contains such a deterministic classifier for many types of commonly used probabilistic classifiers, i.e. randomized ensembles and parametric/input noise injection."}}

Nevertheless, this method has recently been proven to suffer from important information theoretic limitations. In this paper, we argue that these limitations are not intrinsic, but merely a byproduct of current certification methods. We first show that these certificates use too little information about the classifier, and are in particular blind to the local curvature of the decision boundary. This leads to severely sub-optimal robustness guarantees as the dimension of the problem increases. We then show that it is theoretically possible to bypass this issue by collecting more information about the classifier. More precisely, we show that it is possible to approximate the optimal certificate with arbitrary precision, by probing the decision boundary with several noise distributions. Since this process is executed at certification time rather than at test time, it entails no loss in natural accuracy while enhancing the quality of the certificates. This result fosters further research on classifier-specific certification and demonstrates that randomized smoothing is still worth investigating. Although classifier-specific certification may induce more computational cost, we also provide some theoretical insight on how to mitigate it."}}

We focus on randomized classifiers (i.e. classifiers that output random variables) and provide a thorough analysis of their behavior through the lens of statistical learning theory and information theory. To this aim, we introduce a new notion of robustness for randomized classifiers, enforcing local Lipschitzness using probability metrics. Equipped with this definition, we make two new contributions. The first one consists in devising a new upper bound on the adversarial generalization gap of randomized classifiers. More precisely, we devise bounds on the generalization gap and the adversarial gap i.e. the gap between the risk and the worst-case risk under attack) of randomized classifiers. The second contribution presents a yet simple but efficient noise injection method to design robust randomized classifiers. We show that our results are applicable to a wide range of machine learning models under mild hypotheses. We further corroborate our findings with experimental results using deep neural networks on standard image datasets, namely CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. On these tasks, we manage to design robust models that simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (over 0.82 clean accuracy on CIFAR-10) and enjoy guaranteed robust accuracy bounds (0.45 against $$\\ell _{2}$$ \u2113 2 adversaries with magnitude 0.5 on CIFAR-10)."}}
