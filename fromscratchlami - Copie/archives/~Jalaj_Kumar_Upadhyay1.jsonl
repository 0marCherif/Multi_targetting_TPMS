We show that a well-studied continuous time algorithm from statistical physics, called Langevin diffusion (LD), simultaneously provides optimal privacy/utility trade-offs for both DP-ERM and DP-SCO, under $\\epsilon$-DP, and $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP both for convex and strongly convex loss functions. We provide new time and dimension independent uniform stability properties of LD, with which we provide the corresponding optimal excess population risk guarantees for $\\epsilon$-DP.  An important attribute of our DP-SCO guarantees for $\\epsilon$-DP is that they match the non-private optimal bounds as $\\epsilon\\to\\infty$. "}}

We show that in this model, the price of ensuring differential privacy is minimal. Furthermore, since differential privacy is preserved under post-processing, our results can be used as a subroutine in many tasks, including Lipschitz learning on graphs, cut functions, and spectral clustering."}}

We give first efficient $o(W)$ space differentially private algorithms for spectral approximation, principal component analysis, and linear regression. We also initiate and show efficient differentially private algorithms for two important variants of principal component analysis: sparse principal component analysis and non-negative principal component analysis. Prior to our work, no such result was known for sparse and non-negative differentially private principal component analysis even in the static data setting. These algorithms are obtained by identifying sufficient conditions on positive semidefinite matrices formed from streamed matrices. We also show a lower bound on space required to compute low-rank approximation even if the algorithm gives multiplicative approximation and incurs additive error. This follows via reduction to a certain communication complexity problem."}}

One issue is whether the user can verify that the server is actually storing the file, and typically a challenge-response protocol is employed to convince the user that the file is indeed being stored correctly. The security of these schemes is phrased in terms of an extractor which will recover the file given any \u201cproving algorithm\u201d that has a sufficiently high success probability. This forms the basis of proof-of-retrievability (PoR) systems. In this paper, we study multiple server PoR systems. We formalize security definitions for two possible scenarios: (i) A threshold of servers succeeds with high enough probability (worst case), and (ii) the average of the success probability of all the servers is above a threshold (average case). We also motivate the study of confidentiality of the outsourced message. We give MPoR schemes which are secure under both these security definitions and provide reasonable confidentiality guarantees even when there is no restriction on the computational power of the servers. We also show how classical statistical techniques previously used by us can be extended to evaluate whether the responses of the provers are accurate enough to permit successful extraction. We also look at one specific instantiation of our construction when instantiated with the unconditionally secure version of the Shacham\u2013Waters scheme. This scheme gives reasonable security and privacy guarantee. We show that, in the multi-server setting with computationally unbounded provers, one can overcome the limitation that the verifier needs to store as much secret information as the provers."}}

We consider various settings that are close to the real world applications of low-rank factorization: (i) the manner in which matrices are updated (row by row or in an arbitrary manner), (ii) whether matrices are distributed or not, and (iii) how the output is produced (once at the end of all updates, also known as \\emph{one-shot algorithms} or continually). Even though these settings are well studied without privacy, surprisingly, there are no private algorithm for these settings (except when a matrix is updated row by row). We present the first set of differentially private algorithms for all these settings. Our algorithms when private matrix is updated in an arbitrary manner promise differential privacy with respect to two stronger privacy guarantees than previously studied, use space and time \\emph{comparable} to the non-private algorithm, and achieve \\emph{optimal accuracy}. To complement our positive results, we also prove that the space required by our algorithms is optimal up to logarithmic factors. When data matrices are distributed over multiple servers, we give a non-interactive differentially private algorithm with communication cost independent of dimension. In concise, we give algorithms that incur {\\em optimal cost across all parameters of interest}. We also perform experiments to verify that all our algorithms perform well in practice and outperform the best known algorithm until now for large range of parameters."}}
