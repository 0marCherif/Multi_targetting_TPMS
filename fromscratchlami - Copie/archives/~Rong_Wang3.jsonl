The main focus of this task is to effectively model the interaction between the hand and an object. To this end, existing works either rely on interaction constraints in a computationally-expensive iterative optimization, or consider only a sparse correlation between sampled hand and object keypoints. In contrast, we propose a novel dense mutual attention mechanism that is able to model fine-grained dependencies between the hand and the object. Specifically, we first construct the hand and object graphs according to their mesh structures. For each hand node, we aggregate features from every object node by the learned attention and vice versa for each object node. Thanks to such dense mutual attention, our method is able to produce physically plausible poses with high quality and real-time inference speed. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on large benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
