One of these\nchallenges is the rapidly growing number of tourists in space-limited regions such\nas historical city centers, museums, or geographical bottlenecks like narrow val-\nleys. In this context, a proper and accurate prediction of tourism volume and\ntourism flow within a certain area is important and critical for visitor management\ntasks such as sustainable treatment of the environment and prevention of over-\ncrowding. Static flow control methods like conventional low-level controllers or\nlimiting access to overcrowded venues could not solve the problem yet. In this\npaper, we empirically evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep-learning\nmethods such as RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers as well as the classic statistical\nARIMA method. Granular limited data supplied by a tourism region is extended\nby exogenous data such as geolocation trajectories of individual tourists, weather\nand holidays. In the field of visitor flow prediction with sparse data, we are thereby\ncapable of increasing the accuracy of our predictions, incorporating modern input\nfeature handling as well as mapping geolocation data on top of discrete POI data."}}
