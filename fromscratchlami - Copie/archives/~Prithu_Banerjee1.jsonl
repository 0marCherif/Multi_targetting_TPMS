In reality, however, majority of these trajectories are collected at a low sampling rate and only provide partial observations on their actually traversed routes. Consequently, they are mired with uncertainty. In this paper, we develop a technique called InferTra to infer uncertain trajectories from network-constrained partial observations. Rather than predicting the most likely route, the inferred uncertain trajectory takes the form of an edge-weighted graph and summarizes all probable routes in a holistic manner. For trajectory inference, InferTra employs Gibbs sampling by learning a Network Mobility Model (NMM) from a database of historical trajectories. Extensive experiments on real trajectory databases show that the graph-based approach of InferTra is up to 50% more accurate, 20 times faster, and immensely more versatile than state-of-the-art techniques."}}

The goal is to select a small number of users to adopt an item such that it results in a large cascade of adoptions by others. Existing works have three key limitations. (1) They do not account for economic considerations of a user in buying/adopting items. (2) Most studies on multiple items focus on competition, with complementary items receiving limited attention. (3) For the network owner, maximizing social welfare is important to ensure customer loyalty, which is not addressed in prior work in the IM literature. In this paper, we address all three limitations and propose a novel model called UIC that combines utility-driven item adoption with influence propagation over networks. Focusing on the mutually complementary setting, we formulate the problem of social welfare maximization in this novel setting. We show that while the objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular, surprisingly a simple greedy allocation algorithm achieves a factor of (1\u22121/e\u2212\u03f5) of the optimum expected social welfare. We develop \\textsf{bundleGRD}, a scalable version of this approximation algorithm, and demonstrate, with comprehensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, that it significantly outperforms all baselines."}}

It aims to select a small number of seed users to adopt an item such that adoption propagates to a large number of users in the network. Competitive IM focuses on the propagation of competing items in the network. Existing works on competitive IM have several limitations. (1) They fail to incorporate economic incentives in users' decision making in item adoptions. (2) Majority of the works aim to maximize the adoption of one particular item, and ignore the collective role that different items play. (3) They focus mostly on one aspect of competition -- pure competition. To address these concerns we study competitive IM under a utility-driven propagation model called UIC, and study social welfare maximization. The problem in general is not only NP-hard but also NP-hard to approximate within any constant factor. We, therefore, devise instant dependent efficient approximation algorithms for the general case as well as a (1\u22121/e\u2212\u03f5)-approximation algorithm for a restricted setting. Our algorithms outperform different baselines on competitive IM, both in terms of solution quality and running time on large real networks under both synthetic and real utility configurations."}}

Given the prevailing road conditions, a sub-trajectory is temporally anomalous if its travel time deviates significantly from the expected time. Mining these patterns requires us to delve into the sub-trajectory space, which is not scalable for real-time analytics. To overcome this scalability challenge, we design a technique called MANTRA. We study the properties unique to anomalous sub-trajectories and utilize them in MANTRA to iteratively refine the search space into a disjoint set of sub-trajectory islands. The expensive enumeration of all possible sub-trajectories is performed only on the islands to compute the answer set of maximal anomalous sub-trajectories. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets establish MANTRA as more than 3 orders of magnitude faster than baseline techniques. Moreover, through trajectory classification and segmentation, we demonstrate that the proposed model conforms to human intuition."}}
