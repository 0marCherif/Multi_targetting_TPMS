The validity of results using such techniques rely on the assumptions encoded by the graph holding true; however, verification of these assumptions has not received sufficient attention in prior work. In this paper, we provide new insights on the testable implications of three broad classes of missing data graphical models, and design goodness-of-fit tests for them. The classes of models explored are: sequential missing-at-random and  missing-not-at-random models which can be used for modeling longitudinal studies with dropout/censoring, and a  no self-censoring model which can be applied to cross-sectional studies and surveys."}}

Here, we consider a MNAR model that generalizes several prior popular MNAR models in two ways: first, it is less restrictive in terms of statistical independence assumptions imposed on the underlying joint data distribution, and second, it allows for all variables in the observed sample to have missing values. This MNAR model corresponds to a so-called criss-cross structure considered in the literature on graphical models of missing data that prevents nonparametric identification of the entire missing data model. Nonetheless, part of the complete-data distribution remains nonparametrically identifiable. By exploiting this fact and considering a rich class of exponential family distributions, we establish sufficient conditions for identification of the complete-data distribution as well as the entire missingness mechanism. We then propose methods for testing the independence restrictions encoded in such models using odds ratio as our parameter of interest. We adopt two semiparametric approaches for estimating the odds ratio parameter and establish the corresponding asymptotic theories: one involves maximizing a conditional likelihood with order statistics and the other uses estimating equations. The utility of our methods is illustrated via simulation studies."}}

However, in certain applications, treatments of interest are continuous and multidimensional. For example, understanding the causal relationship between severity of radiation therapy, summarized by a multidimensional vector of radiation exposure values and post-treatment side effects is a problem of clinical interest in radiation oncology. An appropriate strategy for making interpretable causal conclusions is to reduce the dimension of treatment. If individual elements of a multidimensional treatment vector weakly affect the outcome, but the overall relationship between treatment and outcome is strong, careless approaches to dimension reduction may not preserve this relationship. Further, methods developed for regression problems do not directly transfer to causal inference due to confounding complications. In this paper, we use semiparametric inference theory for structural models to give a general approach to causal sufficient dimension reduction of a multidimensional treatment such that the cause-effect relationship between treatment and outcome is preserved. We illustrate the utility of our proposals through simulations and a real data application in radiation oncology. "}}

However, the key assumptions -- (i) the existence of a variable (or set of variables) that fully mediates the effect of the treatment on the outcome, and (ii) which simultaneously does not suffer from similar issues of confounding as the treatment-outcome pair -- are often deemed implausible. This paper explores the testability of these assumptions. We show that under mild conditions involving an auxiliary variable, the assumptions encoded in the front-door model (and simple extensions of it) may be tested via generalized equality constraints a.k.a Verma constraints. We propose two goodness-of-fit tests based on this observation, and evaluate the efficacy of our proposal on real and synthetic data. We also provide theoretical and empirical comparisons to instrumental variable approaches to handling unmeasured confounding."}}

These constraints are typically complex nonlinear functionals of the observed data distribution. Focusing on the path-specific causal constraints, we introduce new theoretical results and optimization techniques to make model training easier and more accurate. Specifically, we show how to reparameterize the observed data likelihood such that fairness constraints correspond directly to parameters that appear in the likelihood, transforming a complex constrained optimization objective into a simple optimization problem with box constraints. We also exploit methods from empirical likelihood theory in statistics to improve predictive performance by constraining baseline covariates, without requiring parametric models. We combine the merits of both proposals to optimize a hybrid reparameterized likelihood. The techniques presented here should be applicable more broadly to fair prediction proposals that impose constraints on predictive models. "}}

This type of inference has been very successful in a variety of applications, including image and video analysis, speech recognition, machine translation, autonomous vehicle control, game playing, and validating hypotheses in the empirical sciences. As statistical and machine learning models become an increasingly ubiquitous part of our lives, policymakers, regulators, and advocates have expressed fears about the harmful impact of deployment of such models that encode harmful and discriminatory biases of their creators. A growing community is now addressing issues of fairness and transparency in data analysis in part by defining, analyzing, and mitigating harmful effects of algorithmic bias from a variety of perspectives and frameworks [3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 18]. \r\nIn this paper, we consider the problem of fair statistical inference involving outcome variables. Examples include classification and regression problems, and estimating treatment effects in randomized trials or observational data. The issue of fairness arises in such problems where some covariates or treatments are \"sensitive\", in the sense of having potential of creating discrimination. In this paper, we argue that the presence of discrimination in our setting can be formalized in a sensible way as the presence of an effect of a sensitive covariate on the outcome along certain causal pathways, a view which generalizes [16]. We discuss a number of complications that arise in classical statistical inference due to this view, and suggest workarounds, based on recent work in causal and semi-parametric inference."}}
