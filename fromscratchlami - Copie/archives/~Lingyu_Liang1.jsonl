In this paper, we propose a multi-scale detection framework to detect out-of-distribution skin disease image data to ensure the robustness of the system. Our framework extracts features from different layers of the neural network. In the early layers, rectified activation is used to make the output features closer to the well-behaved distribution, and then an one-class SVM is trained to detect OOD data; in the penultimate layer, an adapted Gram matrix is used to calculate the features after rectified activation, and finally the layer with the best performance is chosen to compute a normality score.

Most of previous methods formulate FBP as a classification, regression or ranking problem of machine learning. However, humans not only represent facial attractiveness as a score, but also perceive the relative aesthetics of faces. Inspired by this observation, we formulate FBP as a specific regression problem guided by ranking information. Specifically, we propose a general CNN architecture, called R <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^3$</tex-math></inline-formula> CNN, to integrate the relative ranking of faces in terms of aesthetics to improve performance of FBP. As R <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^3$</tex-math></inline-formula> CNN consists of both regression and ranking components, it is challenging to train and fine-tune it by existing techniques. To tackle this problem, we propose the following learning schemes for R <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^3$</tex-math></inline-formula> CNN: 1) a hard pair sampling strategy that generates challenging-to-predicted image pairs and pseudo ranking labels from true rating scores; 2) an assemble loss function that combines regression loss and pairwise ranking loss (PR-Loss), where PR-Loss can be a hinge-form loss or a log-sum-exp pairwise loss; 3) a cascaded fine-tuning method that further improves prediction. Moreover, we build a benchmark dataset, called SCUT-FBP5500, containing 5,500 facial images with diverse properties (male/female, Asian/Caucasian, ages) and labels (face landmarks, rating scores within [1, 5], rating score distribution). Experiments were performed on both the SCUT-FBP and the SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark datasets, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on different evaluation settings. Comparisons with related CNN models highlight the effectiveness of the R <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^3$</tex-math></inline-formula> CNN architecture for FBP."}}

However, the models of filtering and propagation were based on diverse mathematical formulations, which have not been fully understood. This article aims to explore the properties of both filtering and propagation models from a partial differential equation (PDE) learning perspective. We propose a unified PDE learning framework based on nonlinear reaction\u2013diffusion with a guided map, graph Laplacian, and reaction weight. It reveals that: 1) the guided map and reaction weight determines whether the PDE produces filtering or propagation diffusion and 2) the kernel of graph Laplacian controls the diffusion pattern. Based on the proposed PDE framework, we derive the mathematical relations between different models, including learning to diffusion (LTD) model, label propagation, edit propagation, and edge-aware filter. In practical verification, we apply the PDE framework to design diffusion operations with the adaptive kernel to tackle the ill-posed problem of facial intrinsic image analysis (FIIA). A flexible task-aware FIIA system is built to achieve various facial rendering effects, such as face image relighting and delighting, artistic illumination transfer, illumination-aware face swapping, or transfiguring. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show the effectiveness and flexibility of task-aware FIIA and provide new insights on PDE learning for visual analysis and rendering."}}

These variances should be reduced for reliable recognition. We propose a fine-grained recognition system that incorporates localization, segmentation, alignment, and classification in a unified deep neural network. The input to the classification module includes functions that enable backward-propagation (BP) in constructing the solver. Our major contribution is to propose a valve linkage function (VLF) for BP chaining and form our deep localization, segmentation, alignment, and classification (LSAC) system. The VLF can adaptively compromise errors of classification and alignment when training the LSAC model. It in turn helps to update the localization and segmentation. We evaluate our framework on two widely used fine-grained object data sets. The performance confirms the effectiveness of our LSAC system."}}

Extensive studies have focused on the low-light image enhancement (LIE) problem. However, we observe that even though the state-of-the-art LIE methods may oversharpen the low-light image and introduce visual artifacts. To reduce the overshoot effects of LIE, this paper proposes an illumination-aware image quality assessment, called LIE-IQA, for the enhanced low-light images. Since directly using the IQA of degraded image may fail to perform well, the proposed LIE-IQA is an illumination-aware and learnable metric. At first, the reflectance and shading components of both the enhanced low-light image and reference image are extracted by intrinsic image decomposition. Then, we use the weighted similarity between the VGG-based feature of enhanced low-light image and reference image to obtain LIE-IQA, where the weight of the measurement can be learned from pairs of data on benchmark dataset. Qualitative and quantitative experiments illustrate the superiority of the LIE-IQA to measure the image quality of LIE on different datasets, including a new IQA dataset built for LIE. We also use the LIE-IQA as a regularization of a loss function to optimize an end-to-end LIE method, and the results indicate the potential of the optimization framework with LIE-IQA to reduce the overshoot effects of low-light enhancement."}}
