While traditional control methods can manage fleets of vehicles, they do not address the issues of dynamic road conditions and scalability (i.e., sophisticated control law redesign and physics modeling). We propose a modular framework that averts daunting retrains of an image-to-action neural network, provides flexibility in transferring to different robots/cars, while also being more transparent than previous approaches. First, a convolutional neural network was trained to localize in an indoor setting with dynamic foreground/background. Then, we design a new deep reinforcement learning algorithm named Momentum Policy Gradient (MPG) for continuous control tasks and prove its convergence. MPG is sucessfully applied to the platooning problem with obstacle avoidance and intra-group collision avoidance."}}

We design Pair-wise Multi-Q network for Q value estimation to model each state-action pair and to capture the interdependence between actions. Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)and Entropy are incorporated into the loss function for balancing the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration. Experiments show that Re-tailNet efficiently produces the near-optimal solution, providing practitioners valuable guidance on their inventory replenishment, pricing, and products display strategies in the retailing industry."}}
