Unlike previous specialized architectures for each specific task, we formulate all three tasks as a unified dense correspondence matching problem, which can be solved with a single model by directly comparing feature similarities. Such a formulation calls for discriminative feature representations, which we achieve using a Transformer, in particular the cross-attention mechanism. We demonstrate that cross-attention enables integration of knowledge from another image via cross-view interactions, which greatly improves the quality of the extracted features. Our unified model naturally enables cross-task transfer since the model architecture and parameters are shared across tasks. We outperform RAFT with our unified model on the challenging Sintel dataset, and our final model that uses a few additional task-specific refinement steps outperforms or compares favorably to recent state-of-the-art methods on 10 popular flow, stereo and depth datasets, while being simpler and more efficient in terms of model design and inference speed."}}

The key to our approach lies in the explicitly modeled correspondence matching information, so as to provide the geometry prior to the prediction of NeRF color and density for volume rendering. The explicit correspondence matching is quantified with the cosine similarity between image features sampled at the 2D projections of a 3D point on different views, which is able to provide reliable cues about the surface geometry. Unlike previous methods where image features are extracted independently for each view, we consider modeling the cross-view interactions via Transformer cross-attention, which greatly improves the feature matching quality. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on different evaluation settings, with the experiments showing a strong correlation between our learned cosine feature similarity and volume density, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

To alleviate this, the state-of-the-art framework RAFT gradually improves its prediction quality by using a large number of iterative refinements, achieving remarkable performance but introducing linearly increasing inference time. To enable both high accuracy and efficiency, we completely revamp the dominant flow regression pipeline by reformulating optical flow as a global matching problem, which identifies the correspondences by directly comparing feature similarities. Specifically, we propose a GMFlow framework, which consists of three main components: a customized Transformer for feature enhancement, a correlation and softmax layer for global feature matching, and a self-attention layer for flow propagation. We further introduce a refinement step that reuses GMFlow at higher feature resolution for residual flow prediction. Our new framework outperforms 31-refinements RAFT on the challenging Sintel benchmark, while using only one refinement and running faster, suggesting a new paradigm for accurate and efficient optical flow estimation.

In this paper, we resolve these two challenges simultaneously. First, we propose to represent the non-rigid transformation with a point-wise combination of several rigid transformations. This representation not only makes the solution space well-constrained but also enables our method to be solved iteratively with a recurrent framework, which greatly reduces the difficulty of learning. Second, we introduce a differentiable loss function that measures the 3D shape similarity on the projected multi-view 2D depth images so that our full framework can be trained end-to-end without ground truth supervision. Extensive experiments on several different datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin."}}

In this paper, we take inspiration from Transformers and propose a new method for high-resolution optical flow estimation with significantly less computation. Specifically, a 1D attention operation is first applied in the vertical direction of the target image, and then a simple 1D correlation in the horizontal direction of the attended image is able to achieve 2D correspondence modeling effect. The directions of attention and correlation can also be exchanged, resulting in two 3D cost volumes that are concatenated for optical flow estimation. The novel 1D formulation empowers our method to scale to very high-resolution input images while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments on Sintel, KITTI and real-world 4K (2160 \u00d7 3840) resolution images demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

Current state-of-the-art stereo models are mostly based on costly 3D convolutions, the cubic computational complexity and high memory consumption make it quite expensive to deploy in real-world applications. In this paper, we aim at completely replacing the commonly used 3D convolutions to achieve fast inference speed while maintaining comparable accuracy. To this end, we first propose a sparse points based intra-scale cost aggregation method to alleviate the well-known edge-fattening issue at disparity discontinuities. Further, we approximate traditional cross-scale cost aggregation algorithm with neural network layers to handle large textureless regions. Both modules are simple, lightweight, and complementary, leading to an effective and efficient architecture for cost aggregation. With these two modules, we can not only significantly speed up existing top-performing models (e.g., 41x than GC-Net, 4x than PSMNet and 38x than GA-Net), but also improve the performance of fast stereo models (e.g., StereoNet). We also achieve competitive results on Scene Flow and KITTI datasets while running at 62ms, demonstrating the versatility and high efficiency of the proposed method.

Supervised methods are limited by a small amount of ground truth or labeled data and unsupervised methods for monocular videos are mostly based on the static scene assumption, not performing well on real world scenarios with the presence of dynamic objects. In this paper, we propose a new learning based method consisting of DepthNet, PoseNet and Region Deformer Networks (RDN) to estimate depth from unconstrained monocular videos without ground truth supervision. The core contribution lies in RDN for proper handling of rigid and non-rigid motions of various objects such as rigidly moving cars and deformable humans. In particular, a deformation based motion representation is proposed to model individual object motion on 2D images. This representation enables our method to be applicable to diverse unconstrained monocular videos. Our method can not only achieve the state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks KITTI and Cityscapes, but also show promising results on a crowded pedestrian tracking dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the deformation based motion representation.
