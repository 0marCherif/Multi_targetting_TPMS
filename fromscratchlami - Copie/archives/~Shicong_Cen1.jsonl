While there has been substantial progress on understanding the global convergence of policy optimization methods in single-agent RL, designing and analysis of efficient policy optimization algorithms in the MARL setting present significant challenges and new desiderata, which unfortunately, remain highly inadequately addressed by existing theory. In this paper, we focus on the most basic setting of competitive multi-agent RL, namely two-player zero-sum Markov games, and study equilibrium finding algorithms in both the infinite-horizon discounted setting and the finite-horizon episodic setting. We propose a single-loop policy optimization method with symmetric updates from both agents, where the policy is updated via the entropy-regularized optimistic multiplicative weights update (OMWU) method and the value is updated on a slower timescale. We show that, in the full-information tabular setting, the proposed method achieves a finite-time last-iterate linear convergence to the quantal response equilibrium of the regularized problem, which translates to a sublinear convergence to the Nash equilibrium by controlling the amount of regularization. Our convergence results improve upon the best known iteration complexities, and lead to a better understanding of policy optimization in competitive Markov games."}}

While significant efforts have been made in understanding zero-sum two-player matrix games, the performance in zero-sum multi-agent games remains inadequately explored, especially in the presence of delayed feedbacks, leaving the scalability and resiliency of gradient play open to questions. In this paper, we make progress by studying asynchronous gradient plays in zero-sum polymatrix games under delayed feedbacks. We first establish that the last iterate of entropy-regularized optimistic multiplicative weight updates (OMWU) method converges linearly to the quantal response equilibrium (QRE), the solution concept under bounded rationality, in the absence of delays. The linear convergence continues to hold even when the feedbacks are randomly delayed under mild statistical assumptions, albeit at a slower rate. Moving beyond random delays, we further demonstrate entropy-regularized OMWU with two-timescale learning rates enjoys faster last-iterate convergence under fixed delays, and continues to converge provably even when the delays are arbitrarily bounded. Our methods also lead to finite-time guarantees to approximate the Nash equilibrium (NE) by moderating the amount of regularization. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that aims to understand asynchronous gradient play in zero-sum polymatrix games under a wide range of delay assumptions.\n "}}

This class of methods is often applied in conjunction with entropy regularization -- an algorithmic scheme that encourages exploration -- and is closely related to soft policy iteration and trust region policy optimization. Despite the empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings for NPG methods remain limited even for the tabular setting. This paper develops $\\textit{non-asymptotic}$ convergence guarantees for entropy-regularized NPG methods under softmax parameterization, focusing on discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs). Assuming access to exact policy evaluation, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges linearly -- or even quadratically once it enters a local region around the optimal policy -- when computing optimal value functions of the regularized MDP. Moreover, the algorithm is provably stable vis-\\`a-vis inexactness of policy evaluation. Our convergence results accommodate a wide range of learning rates, and shed light upon the role of entropy regularization in enabling fast convergence."}}

We assume that only noisy gradient and Hessian information of the smooth part of the objective function is available via calling stochastic first and second order oracles. The proposed method can be seen as a hybrid approach combining stochastic semismooth Newton steps and stochastic proximal gradient steps. Two inexact growth conditions are incorporated to monitor the convergence and the acceptance of the semismooth Newton steps and it is shown that the algorithm converges globally to stationary points in expectation and almost surely. We present numerical results and comparisons on l1-regularized logistic regression and nonconvex binary classification that demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm."}}

When the data size is large and disjointly stored on different machines, it becomes imperative to distribute the implementation of such variance reduced methods. In this paper, we consider a general framework that directly distributes popular stochastic variance reduced methods in the master/slave model, by assigning outer loops to the parameter server, and inner loops to worker machines. This framework is natural and friendly to implement, but its theoretical convergence is not well understood. We obtain a comprehensive understanding of algorithmic convergence with respect to data homogeneity by measuring the smoothness of the discrepancy between the local and global loss functions. We establish the linear convergence of distributed versions of a family of stochastic variance reduced algorithms, including those using accelerated and recursive gradient updates, for minimizing strongly convex losses. Our theory captures how the convergence of distributed algorithms behaves as the number of machines and the size of local data vary. Furthermore, we show that when the data are less balanced, regularization can be used to ensure convergence at a slower rate. We also demonstrate that our analysis can be further extended to handle nonconvex loss functions."}}
