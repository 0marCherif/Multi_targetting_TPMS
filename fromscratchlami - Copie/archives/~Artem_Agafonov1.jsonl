We exploit statistical similarity between the summands and the whole sum to construct a distributed accelerated cubic-regularized Newton\u2019s method that achieves lower communication complexity bound for this setting and improves upon existing upper bound. Further, we use this algorithm to obtain convergence rate bounds for the original stochastic optimization problem and compare our bounds with the existing ones in several regimes when the goal is to minimize the number of communication rounds and improve the parallelization when increasing the number of workers."}}

We introduce inexact model of the objective, which as a particular cases includes inexact oracle [16] and relative smoothness condition [36]. We analyze gradient method which uses this inexact model and obtain convergence rates for convex and strongly convex problems. To show potential applications of our general framework we consider three particular problems. The first one is clustering by electorial model introduced in [41]. The second one is approximating optimal transport distance, for which we propose a Proximal Sinkhorn algorithm. The third one is devoted to approximating optimal transport barycenter and we propose a Proximal Iterative Bregman Projections algorithm. We also illustrate the practical performance of our algorithms by numerical experiments."}}
