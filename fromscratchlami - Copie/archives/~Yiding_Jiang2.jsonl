Despite a wide range of potential applications, including learned optimization, processing implicit neural representations, network editing, and policy evaluation, there are few unifying principles for designing effective architectures that process the weights of other networks. We approach the design of neural functionals through the lens of symmetry, in particular by focusing on the permutation symmetries that arise in the weights of deep feedforward networks because hidden layer neurons have no inherent order. We introduce a framework for building permutation equivariant neural functionals, whose architectures encode these symmetries as an inductive bias. The key building blocks of this framework are NF-Layers (neural functional layers) that we constrain to be permutation equivariant through an appropriate parameter sharing scheme. In our experiments, we find that permutation equivariant neural functionals are effective on a diverse set of tasks that require processing the weights of MLPs and CNNs, such as predicting classifier generalization, producing \"winning ticket\" sparsity masks for initializations, and editing the weights of implicit neural representations (INRs). In addition, we provide code for our models and experiments at https://github.com/AllanYangZhou/nfn."}}

We investigate the potential reasons behind the poor generalization performance of value-based methods and discover that exploration plays a crucial role in these settings. Exploration is helpful not only for finding optimal solutions to the training environments, but also for acquiring knowledge that helps generalization to other unseen environments. We show how to make value-based methods competitive with policy optimization methods in these settings by using uncertainty-driven exploration and distribtutional RL. Our algorithm is the first value-based method to achieve state-of-the-art on both Procgen and Crafter, two challenging benchmarks for generalization in RL. "}}

While a useful tool for model selection (i.e., the model most likely to perform the best OOD is the one with highest ID accuracy), this fact does not help to estimate the actual OOD performance of models without access to a labeled OOD validation set. In this paper, we show a similar surprising phenomena also holds for the agreement between pairs of neural network classifiers: whenever accuracy-on-the-line holds, we observe that the OOD agreement between the predictions of any two pairs of neural networks (with potentially different architectures) also observes a strong linear correlation with their ID agreement. Furthermore, we observe that the slope and bias of OOD vs ID agreement closely matches that of OOD vs ID accuracy. This phenomenon which we call agreement-on-the-line, has important practical applications: without any labeled data, we can predict the OOD accuracy of classifiers, since OOD agreement can be estimated with just unlabeled data. Our prediction algorithm outperforms previous methods both in shifts where agreement-on-the-line holds and, surprisingly, when accuracy is not on the line. This phenomenon also provides new insights into neural networks: unlike accuracy-on-the-line, agreement-on-the-line only appears to hold for neural network classifiers."}}

This builds on -- and is a stronger version of -- the observation in Nakkiran&Bansal 20, which requires the runs to be on separate training sets. We further theoretically show that this peculiar phenomenon arises from the well-calibrated nature of ensembles of SGD-trained models. This finding not only provides a simple empirical measure to directly predict the test error using unlabeled test data, but also establishes a new conceptual connection between generalization and calibration."}}

Despite their strong performance on many sparse-reward tasks, existing curiosity approaches rely on an overly holistic view of state transitions, and do not allow for a structured understanding of specific aspects of the environment. In this paper, we formulate curiosity based on grounded question answering by encouraging the agent to ask questions about the environment and be curious when the answers to these questions change. We show that natural language questions encourage the agent to uncover specific knowledge about their environment such as the physical properties of objects as well as their spatial relationships with other objects, which serve as valuable curiosity rewards to solve sparse-reward tasks more efficiently."}}
