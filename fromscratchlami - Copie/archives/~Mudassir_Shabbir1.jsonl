{"id": "N6iz-EQkuar", "cdate": 1663850231824, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Network Controllability Perspectives on Graph Representation", "abstract": "Graph representations in fixed dimensional feature space are vital in applying learning tools and data mining algorithms to perform graph analytics. Such representations must encode the graph's topological and structural information at the local and global scales without posing significant computation overhead. This paper employs a unique approach grounded in networked control system theory to obtain expressive graph representations with desired properties. We consider graphs as networked dynamical systems and study their controllability properties to explore the underlying graph structure. The controllability of a networked dynamical system profoundly depends on the underlying network topology, and we exploit this relationship to design novel graph representations using controllability Gramian and related metrics. We discuss the merits of this new approach in terms of the desired properties (for instance, permutation and scale invariance) of the proposed representations. Our evaluation of various benchmark datasets in the graph classification framework demonstrates that the proposed representations either outperform (sometimes by more than 6%), or give similar results to the state-of-the-art embeddings.

Formally, given a set of candidate sites S and existing sites E, the Optimal Site Selection (OSS) problem aims to find the optimal location $$s \\in S$$ s \u2208 S that serves maximum customers. In this paper, we study the OSS problem for predicting school location from a set of available sites in the Urban areas. We leverage deep neural networks to solve this problem in a resource and time-efficient way\u2014using a dataset of 47,926 schools across 36 districts of the Punjab province. The dataset includes numerous features such as no. of teachers, no. of classrooms, and no. of sections associated with each school site. We also incorporate a novel feature called site influence that gives the expected number of potential students for a particular school. Our proposed model performs exceedingly well with the addition of this feature. We approach this problem by defining class labels based on a given school\u2019s capacity\u2014and further train a deep neural network using the aforementioned features to achieve accuracy values up to 82%. Overall, this study facilitates optimal school site selection in the Urban areas, thereby, adding to communal prosperity and growth."}}
