Prior work has trained the dialog models solely on VisDial data via supervised learning or leveraged pre-training on related vision-and-language datasets. This paper presents a semi-supervised learning approach for VisDial, called Generative Self-Training (GST), to enhance the pre-training. Specifically, GST generates synthetic dialog data for unlabeled images via multimodal conditional text generation and trains the dialog model on the synthetic and the original VisDial data. Moreover, we also propose perplexity-based data selection and multimodal consistency regularization for robust training of the synthetic data. Evaluation on VisDial v1.0 dataset shows that GST improves the pre-training and achieves new state-of-the-art results.  "}}

KLUE is a collection of eight Korean natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, including Topic Classification, Semantic Textual Similarity, Natural LanguageInference, Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Dependency Parsing, Machine Reading Comprehension, and Dialogue State Tracking. We create all of the datasets from scratch in a principled way. We design the tasks to have diverse formats and each task to be built upon various source corpora that respect copyrights. Also, we propose suitable evaluation metrics and organize annotation protocols in a way to ensure quality. To prevent ethical risks in KLUE, we proactively remove examples reflecting social biases, containing toxic content or personally identifiable information (PII). Along with the benchmark datasets, we release pre-trained language models (PLM) for Korean, KLUE-BERT and KLUE-RoBERTa, and find KLUE-Roberta-large outperforms other baselines including multilingual PLMs and existing open-source Korean PLMs. The fine-tuning recipes are publicly open for anyone to reproduce our baseline result. We believe our work will facilitate future research on cross-lingual as well as Korean language models and the creation of similar resources for other languages. KLUE is available at https://klue-benchmark.com.\n\n"}}

There has been increasing interest in what knowledge these LMs contain and how we can extract that knowledge, treating LMs as knowledge bases (KBs). While there has been much work on probing LMs in the general domain, there has been little attention to whether these powerful LMs can be used as domain-specific KBs. To this end, we create the BioLAMA benchmark, which is comprised of 49K biomedical factual knowledge triples for probing biomedical LMs. We find that biomedical LMs with recently proposed probing methods can achieve up to 18.51% Acc@5 on retrieving biomedical knowledge. Although this seems promising given the task difficulty, our detailed analyses reveal that most predictions are highly correlated with prompt templates without any subjects, hence producing similar results on each relation and hindering their capabilities to be used as domain-specific KBs. We hope that BioLAMA can serve as a challenging benchmark for biomedical factual probing."}}

With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora."}}

However, they are inefficient in that they predict the dialogue state at every turn from scratch. Here, we consider dialogue state as an explicit fixed-sized memory and propose a selectively overwriting mechanism for more efficient DST. This mechanism consists of two steps: (1) predicting state operation on each of the memory slots, and (2) overwriting the memory with new values, of which only a few are generated according to the predicted state operations. Our method decomposes DST into two sub-tasks and guides the decoder to focus only on one of the tasks, thus reducing the burden of the decoder. This enhances the effectiveness of training and DST performance. Our SOM-DST (Selectively Overwriting Memory for Dialogue State Tracking) model achieves state-of-the-art joint goal accuracy with 51.72% in MultiWOZ 2.0 and 53.01% in MultiWOZ 2.1 in an open vocabulary-based DST setting. In addition, we analyze the accuracy gaps between the current and the ground truth-given situations and suggest that it is a promising direction to improve state operation prediction to boost the DST performance."}}

However, such performance may not be replicated in the actual setting, for which we need to diagnose the cause, which is non-trivial due to the complexity of model. We thus propose a web-based UI that provides how each model contributes to QA performances, by integrating visualization and analysis tools for model explanation. We expect this framework can help QA model researchers to refine and improve their models."}}
