The point cloud data acquisition procedures manifest themselves as significant domain discrepancies and geometric variations among both similar and dissimilar classes. The standard domain adaptation methods developed for images do not directly translate to point cloud data because of their complex geometric nature. To address this challenge, we leverage the idea of multimodality and alignment between distributions. We propose a new UDA architecture for point cloud classification that benefits from multimodal contrastive learning to get better class separation in both domains individually. Further, the use of optimal transport (OT) aims at learning source and target data distributions jointly to reduce the cross-domain shift and provide a better alignment. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on PointDA-10 and GraspNetPC-10 and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on GraspNetPC-10 (with approx 4-12% margin) and best average performance on PointDA-10. Our ablation studies and decision boundary analysis also validate the significance of our contrastive learning module and OT alignment."}}

We describe a method for O.O.D. generalization that, through training, encourages models to only preserve features in the network that are well reused across multiple training domains. Our method combines two complementary neuron-level regularizers with a probabilistic differentiable binary mask over the network, to extract a modular sub-network that achieves better O.O.D. performance than the original network. Preliminary evaluation on two benchmark datasets corroborates the promise of our method."}}

Various attacks and defenses are proposed to improve the adversarial robustness of modern-day deep learning architectures. While all these approaches help improve the robustness, one promising direction for improving adversarial robustness is unexplored, i.e., the complex topology of the neural network architecture. In this work, we address the following question: \"Can the complex topology of a neural network give adversarial robustness without any form of adversarial training?\". We answer this empirically by experimenting with different hand-crafted and NAS-based architectures. Our findings show that, for small-scale attacks, NAS-based architectures are more robust for small-scale datasets and simple tasks than hand-crafted architectures. However, as the size of the dataset or the complexity of task increases, hand-crafted architectures are more robust than NAS-based architectures. Our work is the first large-scale study to understand adversarial robustness purely from an architectural perspective. Our study shows that random sampling in the search space of DARTS (a popular NAS method) with simple ensembling can improve the robustness to PGD attack by nearly 12%. We show that NAS, which is popular for achieving SoTA accuracy, can provide adversarial accuracy as a free add-on without any form of adversarial training. Our results show that leveraging the search space of NAS methods with methods like ensembles can be an excellent way to achieve adversarial robustness without any form of adversarial training. We also introduce a metric that can be used to calculate the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness.

Pool-based AL techniques start with a small initial labeled pool and then iteratively pick batches of the most informative samples for labeling. Generally, the initial pool is sampled randomly and labeled to seed the AL iterations. While recent studies have focused on evaluating the robustness of various query functions in AL, little to no attention has been given to the design of the initial labeled pool for deep active learning. Given the recent successes of learning representations in self-supervised/unsupervised ways, we study if an intelligently sampled initial labeled pool can improve deep AL performance. We investigate the effect of intelligently sampled initial labeled pools, including the use of self-supervised and unsupervised strategies, on deep AL methods. The setup, hypotheses, methodology, and implementation details were evaluated by peer review before experiments were conducted. Experimental results could not conclusively prove that intelligently sampled initial pools are better for AL than random initial pools in the long run, although a Variational Autoencoder-based initial pool sampling strategy showed interesting trends that merit deeper investigation."}}
