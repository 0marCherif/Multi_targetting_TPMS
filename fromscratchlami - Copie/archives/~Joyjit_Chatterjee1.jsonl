However, wind turbines regularly suffer from operational inconsistencies, leading to significant costs and challenges in operations and maintenance (O&M). Condition-based monitoring (CBM) and performance assessment/analysis of turbines are vital aspects for ensuring efficient O&M planning and cost minimisation. Data-driven decision making techniques have witnessed rapid evolution in the wind industry for such O&M tasks during the last decade, from applying signal processing methods in early 2010 to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, especially deep learning in 2020. In this article, we utilise statistical computing to present a scientometric review of the conceptual and thematic evolution of AI in the wind energy sector, providing evidence-based insights into present strengths and limitations of data-driven decision making in the wind industry. We provide a perspective into the future and on current key challenges in data availability and quality, lack of transparency in black box-natured AI models, and prevailing issues in deploying models for real-time decision support, along with possible strategies to overcome these problems. We hope that a systematic analysis of the past, present and future of CBM and performance assessment can encourage more organisations to adopt data-driven decision making techniques in O&M towards making wind energy sources more reliable, contributing to the global efforts of tackling climate change."}}

The wind energy sector is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy, yet turbines regularly suffer from failures and operational inconsistencies, leading to downtimes and significant maintenance costs. Addressing these issues requires rapid interpretation of complex and dynamic data patterns under time-critical conditions. In this article, we present a novel approach that leverages interactive, natural language-based decision support for operations & maintenance (O&M) of wind turbines. The proposed interactive QA system allows engineers to pose domain-specific questions in natural language, and provides answers (in natural language) based on the automated retrieval of information on turbine sub-components, their properties and interactions, from a bespoke domain-specific knowledge graph. As data for specific faults is often sparse, we propose the use of paraphrase generation as a way to augment the existing dataset. Our QA system leverages encoder-decoder models to generate Cypher queries to obtain domain-specific facts from the KG database in response to user-posed natural language questions. Experiments with an attention-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model and a transformer show that the transformer accurately predicts up to 89.75% of responses to input questions, outperforming the Seq2Seq model marginally by 0.76%, though being 9.46 times more computationally efficient. The proposed QA system can help support engineers and technicians during O&M to reduce turbine downtime and operational costs, thus improving the reliability of wind energy as a source of renewable energy."}}

Condition-Based Monitoring (CBM) has been utilised in the past to monitor operational inconsistencies in turbines by applying signal processing techniques to vibration data. The last decade has witnessed growing interest in leveraging Supervisory Control & Acquisition (SCADA) data from turbine sensors towards CBM. Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been utilised to predict incipient faults in turbines and forecast vital operational parameters with high accuracy by leveraging SCADA data and alarm logs. More recently, Deep Learning (DL) methods have outperformed conventional ML techniques, particularly for anomaly prediction. Despite demonstrating immense promise in transitioning to Artificial Intelligence (AI), such models are generally black-boxes that cannot provide rationales behind their predictions, hampering the ability of turbine operators to rely on automated decision making. We aim to help combat this challenge by providing a novel perspective on Explainable AI (XAI) for trustworthy decision support. This thesis revolves around three key strands of XAI - DL, Natural Language Generation (NLG) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which are investigated by utilising data from an operational turbine. We leverage DL and NLG to predict incipient faults and alarm events in the turbine in natural language as well as generate human-intelligible O&M strategies to assist engineers in fixing/averting the faults. We also propose specialised DL models which can predict causal relationships in SCADA features as well as quantify the importance of vital parameters leading to failures. The thesis finally culminates with an interactive Question- Answering (QA) system for automated reasoning that leverages multimodal domain-specific information from a KG, facilitating engineers to retrieve O&M strategies with natural language questions. By helping make turbines more reliable, we envisage wider adoption of wind energy sources towards tackling climate change."}}

Wind turbines consist of several electrical and mechanical components and experience an enormous amount of irregular loads, making their operational behaviour at times inconsistent. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) is a key factor in monitoring such inconsistent behaviour of the turbines in order to predict and prevent any incipient faults which may occur in the near future. Machine learning has been applied to the domain of wind energy over the last decade for analysing, diagnosing and predicting wind turbine faults. In particular, we follow the idea of modelling a turbine's performance as a power curve where any power outputs that fall off the curve can be seen as performance errors. Existing work using this idea has used data from a turbine's Supervisory Control & Acquisition (SCADA) system to filter and analyse fault & alarm data using regression techniques. In contrast to previous work, we explore how deep learning can be applied to fault prediction from open access meteorological data only."}}

However, existing studies do not present a concrete basis to facilitate explainable decision support in operations and maintenance (O&M), particularly for automated decision support through recommendation of appropriate maintenance action reports corresponding to failures predicted by CBM techniques. Knowledge graph databases (KGs) model a collection of domain-specific information and have played an intrinsic role for real-world decision support in domains such as healthcare and finance, but have seen very limited attention in the wind industry. We propose XAI4Wind, a multimodal knowledge graph for explainable decision support in real-world operational turbines and demonstrate through experiments several use-cases of the proposed KG towards O&M planning through interactive query and reasoning and providing novel insights using graph data science algorithms. The proposed KG combines multimodal knowledge like SCADA parameters and alarms with natural language maintenance actions, images etc. By integrating our KG with an Explainable AI model for anomaly prediction, we show that it can provide effective human-intelligible O&M strategies for predicted operational inconsistencies in various turbine sub-components. This can help instil better trust and confidence in conventionally black-box AI models. We make our KG publicly available and envisage that it can serve as the building ground for providing autonomous decision support in the wind industry."}}

Machine learning has been applied to fault prediction in wind turbines, but these predictions have not been supported with suggestions on how to avert and fix faults. We present a data-to-text generation system utilising transformers for generating corrective maintenance strategies for faults using SCADA data capturing the operational status of turbines. We achieve this in two stages: a first stage identifies faults based on SCADA input features and their relevance. A second stage performs content selection for the language generation task and creates maintenance strategies based on phrase-based natural language templates. Experiments show that our dual transformer model achieves an accuracy of up to 96.75% for alarm prediction and up to 75.35% for its choice of maintenance strategies during content-selection. A qualitative analysis shows that our generated maintenance strategies are promising. We make our human- authored maintenance templates publicly available, and include a brief video explaining our approach."}}

At present, most of the work in this area utilizes extraction of discriminatory features for the purpose of classification of emotions into various categories. Most of the present work involves use of only Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as an integral feature for emotion recognition. In some other works, the utterance of words is used for lexical analysis for emotion recognition, which is language dependent. In this paper, two different techniques are utilized for classifying emotions into Angry, Happy or Neutral categories. In the first technique, the maximum cross correlation between audio files is computed for labeling the speech data into one of the three emotion categories. Accordingly, a function is developed in MATLAB for Identification of an emotion for any audio file passed as an argument. The second technique makes use of six discriminatory features, namely, Energy, Volume, MFCC, Zero Crossing Rate, Formants and Spectral Centroid. These features are used as predictors for the purpose of classification of emotions. A variety of classifiers are used through the MATLAB classification learner toolbox, and an accuracy of 91.3% is achieved using the Cubic SVM Classifier. The proposed techniques pave way for a real-time prototype for speech emotion recognition in the near future."}}
