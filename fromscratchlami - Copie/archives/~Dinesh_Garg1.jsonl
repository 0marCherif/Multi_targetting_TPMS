In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural architecture, called TAP (Translucent Answer Prediction), to identify answers and evidence (in the form of supporting facts) in an RCQA task requiring multi-hop reasoning. TAP comprises two loosely coupled networks\u2013Local and Global Interaction eXtractor (LoGIX) and Answer Predictor (AP). LoGIX predicts supporting facts, whereas AP consumes these predicted supporting facts to predict the answer span. The novel design of LoGIX is inspired by two key design desiderata\u2013local context and global interaction\u2013that we identified by analyzing examples of multi-hop RCQA task. The loose coupling between LoGIX and the AP reveals the set of sentences used by the AP in predicting an answer. Therefore, answer predictions of TAP can be interpreted in a translucent manner. TAP offers state-of-the-art performance on the HotpotQA (Yang et al. 2018) dataset\u2013an apt dataset for multi-hop RCQA task\u2013as it occupies Rank-1 on its leaderboard (https://hotpotqa. github. io/) at the time of submission."}}

Neuro-symbolic approaches has been quite effective in solving such tasks as they offer better modularity, interpretability, and generalizability. A noteworthy such approach is NSCL [10] developed for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA). We extend NSCL for the image manipulation task and propose a solution referred to as NEUROSIM. Unlike previous works, which either require supervised data training or can only deal with simple reasoning instructions over single object scenes; NEUROSIM can perform complex multi-hop reasoning over multi-object scenes and requires only weak supervision in the form of annotated data for the VQA task. On the language side, NEUROSIM contains neural modules that parse an instruction into a symbolic program over a Domain Specific Language (DSL) comprising manipulation operations that guide the manipulation. On the perceptual side, NEUROSIM contains neural modules which first generate a scene graph of the input image and then change the scene graph representation following the parsed instruction. To train these modules, we design novel loss functions capable of testing the correctness of manipulated object and scene graph representations via query networks. An image decoder is trained to render the final image from the manipulated scene graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NEUROSIM is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised baselines."}}

Recent work on neuro-symbolic approaches (Mao et al., 2019) (NSCL) has been quite effective for solving VQA as they offer better modularity, interpretability, and generalizability. We extend NSCL for the image manipulation task and propose a solution referred to as NeuroSIM. Previous work either requires supervised training data in the form of manipulated images or can only deal with very simple reasoning instructions over single object scenes. In contrast, NeuroSIM can perform complex multi-hop reasoning over multi-object scenes and only requires weak supervision in the form of annotated data for VQA. NeuroSIM parses an instruction into a symbolic program, based on a Domain Specific Language (DSL) comprising of object attributes and manipulation operations, that guides the manipulation. We design neural modules for manipulation, as well as novel loss functions that are capable of testing the correctness of manipulated object and scene graph representations via query networks trained merely on VQA data. An image decoder is trained to render the final image from the manipulated scene graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuroSIM, without using target images as supervision, is highly competitive with SOTA baselines that make use of supervised data for manipulation."}}

Whereas the prior work has mostly focused on proposing QA models for this dataset, our aim is to retrieve as well as generate explanation for a given (question, correct answer choice, incorrect answer choices) tuple from this dataset. Our explanation definition is based on certain desiderata, and translates an explanation into a set of positive and negative common-sense properties (aka facts) which not only explain the correct answer choice but also refute the incorrect ones. We human-annotate a first-of-its-kind dataset (called ECQA) of positive and negative properties, as well as free-flow explanations, for $11K$ QA pairs taken from the CQA dataset. We propose a latent representation based property retrieval model as well as a GPT-2 based property generation model with a novel two step fine-tuning procedure. We also propose a free-flow explanation generation model. Extensive experiments show that our retrieval model beats BM25 baseline by a relative gain of 100% in $F_1$ score, property generation model achieves a respectable $F_1$ score of 36.4, and free-flow generation model achieves a similarity score of 61.9, where last two scores are based on a human correlated semantic similarity metric."}}

These methods embed any given KB into a vector space by exploiting statistical similarities among its entities and predicates but without any guarantee of preserving the underlying logical structure of the KB. This, in turn, results in poor performance of logical reasoning tasks that are solved using such distributional representations. We present a novel approach called Embed2Reason (E2R) that embeds a symbolic KB into a vector space in a logical structure preserving manner. This approach is inspired by the theory of Quantum Logic. Such an embedding allows answering membership based complex logical reasoning queries with impressive accuracy improvements over popular SRL baselines."}}
