The model sampled from the posterior distribution can be used for providing ensemble predictions and quantifying prediction uncertainty. It is well-known that deep learning models with lower sharpness have better generalization ability. However, existing posterior inferences are not aware of sharpness/flatness in terms of formulation, possibly leading to high sharpness for the models sampled from them. In this paper, we develop theories, the Bayesian setting, and the variational inference approach for the sharpness-aware posterior. Specifically, the models sampled from our sharpness-aware posterior, and the optimal approximate posterior estimating this sharpness-aware posterior, have better flatness, hence possibly possessing higher generalization ability. We conduct experiments by leveraging the sharpness-aware posterior with state-of-the-art Bayesian Neural Networks, showing that the flat-seeking counterparts outperform their baselines in all metrics of interest."}}

This also poses a central difficulty in the field of CL, termed as Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). In an attempt to address this problem, Bayesian methods provide a powerful principle, focusing on the inference scheme to estimate the importance of weights. Variational inference (VI), one of the most widely used methods within this vein, approximates the intractable posterior by a factorized distribution, thus offering computational efficiency. Notwithstanding many state-of-the-art performances in practice, this simple assumption about the posterior distribution typically limits the model capacity to some extent. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to mitigate forgetting in the Bayesian approach via enriching the posterior distribution with mixture models, which intuitively promotes neural networks to acquire knowledge from multiple tasks at a time. Moreover, in order to reduce the model\u2019s complexity growth when the number of components increases, we propose a solution that conducts low-rank decomposition on the variance of each component based on neural matrix factorization. Extensive experiments show that our method yields significant improvements compared to prior works on different benchmarks."}}

Compared to training tasks separately, MTL significantly reduces computational costs, improves data efficiency, and potentially enhances model performance by leveraging knowledge across tasks. Hence, it has been adopted in a variety of applications, ranging from computer vision to natural language processing and speech recognition. Among them, there is an emerging line of work in MTL that focuses on manipulating the task gradient to derive an ultimate gradient descent direction to benefit all tasks. Despite achieving impressive results on many benchmarks, directly applying these approaches without using appropriate regularization techniques might lead to suboptimal solutions on real-world problems. In particular, standard training that minimizes the empirical loss on the training data can easily suffer from overfitting to low-resource tasks or be spoiled by noisy-labeled ones, which can cause negative transfer between tasks and overall performance drop. To alleviate such problems, we propose to leverage a recently introduced training method, named Sharpness-aware Minimization, which can enhance model generalization ability on single-task learning. Accordingly, we present a novel MTL training methodology, encouraging the model to find task-based flat minima for coherently improving its generalization capability on all tasks. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of applications to demonstrate the merit of our proposed approach to existing gradient-based MTL methods, as suggested by our developed theory."}}

Existing works used a single centroid adapted with incoming data streams to characterize a class. This approach possibly exposes limitations when the incoming data stream of a class is naturally multimodal. To address this issue, in this work, we first propose an online mixture model learning approach based on nice properties of the mature optimal transport theory (OT-MM). Specifically, the centroids and covariance matrices of the mixture model are adapted incrementally according to incoming data streams. The advantages are two-fold: (i) we can characterize more accurately complex data streams and (ii) by using centroids for each class produced by OT-MM, we can estimate the similarity of an unseen example to each class more reasonably when doing inference. Moreover, to combat the catastrophic forgetting in the CIL scenario, we further propose Dynamic Preservation. Particularly, after performing the dynamic preservation technique across data streams, the latent representations of the classes in the old and new tasks become more condensed themselves and more separate from each other. Together with a contraction feature extractor, this technique facilitates the model in mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. The experimental results on real-world datasets show that our proposed method can significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art baselines."}}

To alleviate these problems, recent approaches leverage distributional robustness optimization (DRO) to find the most challenging distribution, and then minimize loss function over this most challenging distribution. Regardless of achieving some improvements, these DRO approaches have some obvious limitations. First, they purely focus on local regularization to strengthen model robustness, missing a global regularization effect which is useful in many real-world applications (e.g., domain adaptation, domain generalization, and adversarial machine learning). Second, the loss functions in the existing DRO approaches operate in only the most challenging distribution, hence decouple with the original distribution, leading to a restrictive modeling capability. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization technique, following the veins of Wasserstein-based DRO framework. Specifically, we define a particular joint distribution and Wasserstein-based uncertainty, allowing us to couple the original and most challenging distributions for enhancing modeling capability and applying both local and global regularizations. Empirical studies on different learning problems demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing regularization approaches in various domains: semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, domain generalization, and adversarial machine learning."}}
