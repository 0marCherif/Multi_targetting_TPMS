Subsequently, we propose the Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked Auto-Encoder (CAV-MAE) by combining contrastive learning and masked data modeling, two major self-supervised learning frameworks, to learn a joint and coordinated audio-visual representation.\nOur experiments show that the contrastive audio-visual correspondence learning objective not only enables the model to perform audio-visual retrieval tasks, but also helps the model learn a better joint representation. As a result, our fully self-supervised pretrained CAV-MAE achieves a new SOTA accuracy of 65.9% on VGGSound, and is comparable with the previous best supervised pretrained model on AudioSet in the audio-visual event classification task.

One challenge in training such models is that they need to jointly learn semantic concepts and their relationships across different input representations. Capsule networks have been shown to perform well in context of capturing the relation between low-level input features and higher-level concepts. However, capsules have so far mainly been used only in small-scale fully supervised settings due to the resource demand of conventional routing algorithms. We present a new multimodal capsule network that allows us to leverage the strength of capsules in the context of a multimodal learning framework on large amounts of video data. To adapt the capsules to large-scale input data, we propose a novel routing by self-attention mechanism that selects relevant capsules which are then used to generate a final joint multimodal feature representation. This allows not only for robust training with noisy video data, but also to scale up the size of the capsule network compared to traditional routing methods while still being computationally efficient. We evaluate the proposed architecture by pretraining it on a large-scale multimodal video dataset and applying it on four datasets in two challenging downstream tasks. Results show that the proposed multimodal capsule network is not only able to improve results compared to other routing techniques, but also achieves competitive performance on the task of multimodal learning."}}

We investigate the existence of sparse subnetworks in pre-trained speech SSL models that achieve even better low-resource ASR results. However, directly applying widely adopted pruning methods such as the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) is suboptimal in the computational cost needed. Moreover, we show that the discovered subnetworks yield minimal performance gain compared to the original dense network.\nWe present Prune-Adjust-Re-Prune (PARP), which discovers and finetunes subnetworks for much better performance, while only requiring a single downstream ASR finetuning run. PARP is inspired by our surprising observation that subnetworks pruned for pre-training tasks need merely a slight adjustment to achieve a sizeable performance boost in downstream ASR tasks. Extensive experiments on low-resource ASR verify (1) sparse subnetworks exist in mono-lingual/multi-lingual pre-trained speech SSL, and (2) the computational advantage and performance gain of PARP over baseline pruning methods.\nIn particular, on the 10min Librispeech split without LM decoding, PARP discovers subnetworks from wav2vec 2.0 with an absolute 10.9%/12.6% WER decrease compared to the full model. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of PARP via: cross-lingual pruning without any phone recognition degradation, the discovery of a multi-lingual subnetwork for 10 spoken languages in 1 finetuning run, and its applicability to pre-trained BERT/XLNet for natural language tasks1."}}

Due to the lack of RGB-depth image pairs, unsupervised learning methods aim at deriving depth information with alternative supervision such as stereo pairs. However, most existing works fail to model the geometric structure of objects, which generally results from considering pixel-level objective functions during training. In this paper, we propose SceneNet to overcome this limitation with the aid of semantic understanding from segmentation. Moreover, our proposed model is able to perform region-aware depth estimation by enforcing semantics consistency between stereo pairs. In our experiments, we qualitatively and quantitatively verify the effectiveness and robustness of our model, which produces favorable results against the state-of-the-art approaches do."}}

In addition, the resulting feature representation exhibits superior performance of unsupervised domain adaptation, which also verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model in learning disentangled features for describing cross-domain data."}}
