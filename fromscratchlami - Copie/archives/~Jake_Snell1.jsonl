Previous work has largely focused on bounding the expected loss of a predictor, but this is not sufficient in many risk-sensitive applications where the distribution of errors is important. In this work, we propose a flexible framework to produce a family of bounds on quantiles of the loss distribution incurred by a predictor. Our method takes advantage of the order statistics of the observed loss values rather than relying on the sample mean alone. We show that a quantile is an informative way of quantifying predictive performance, and that our framework applies to a variety of quantile-based metrics, each targeting important subsets of the data distribution. We analyze the theoretical properties of our proposed method and demonstrate its ability to rigorously control loss quantiles on several real-world datasets."}}

Recent progress in few-shot classification has featured meta-learning, in which a parameterized model for a learning algorithm is defined and trained on episodes representing different classification problems, each with a small labeled training set and its corresponding test set. In this work, we advance this few-shot classification paradigm towards a scenario where unlabeled examples are also available within each episode. We consider two situations: one where all unlabeled examples are assumed to belong to the same set of classes as the labeled examples of the episode, as well as the more challenging situation where examples from other distractor classes are also provided. To address this paradigm, we propose novel extensions of Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) that are augmented with the ability to use unlabeled examples when producing prototypes. These models are trained in an end-to-end way on episodes, to learn to leverage the unlabeled examples successfully. We evaluate these methods on versions of the Omniglot and miniImageNet benchmarks, adapted to this new framework augmented with unlabeled examples. We also propose a new split of ImageNet, consisting of a large set of classes, with a hierarchical structure. Our experiments confirm that our Prototypical Networks can learn to improve their predictions due to unlabeled examples, much like a semi-supervised algorithm would."}}

The use of attributes also facilitates learning of new concepts with zero or few examples. However, the zero-shot learning paradigm assumes that the set of attributes are known and fixed, which is a limitation if a test-time task depends on a previously irrelevant attribute. In this work we study rapid learning of attributes that are previously not labeled in the dataset. Compared to standard few-shot learning of semantic classes, learning new attributes imposes a stiffer challenge. We found that directly supervising the model with a set of training attributes does not generalize well on the test attributes, whereas self-supervised pre-training brings significant improvement. We further experimented with random splits of the attribute space and found that the predictability of attributes provides an informative estimate of a model's ability to generalize."}}

Typically, the learner observes data only from a fixed number of classes at training time and is asked to generalize to a new set of classes at test time. Two examples from the same class would always be assigned the same labels in any episode. In this work, we consider a realistic setting where the relationship between examples can change from episode to episode depending on the task context, which is not given to the learner.  We define two new benchmark datasets for this flexible few-shot scenario, where the tasks are based on images of faces (Celeb-A) and shoes (Zappos50K). While classification baselines learn representations that work well for standard few-shot learning, they suffer in our flexible tasks since the classification criteria shift from training to testing. On the other hand, unsupervised contrastive representation learning with instance-based invariance objectives preserves such flexibility. A combination of instance and class invariance learning objectives is found to perform best on our new flexible few-shot learning benchmarks, and a novel variant of Prototypical Networks is proposed for selecting useful feature dimensions."}}

Bayesian methods are well-suited to tackling the fundamental issue of overfitting in the few-shot scenario because they allow practitioners to specify prior beliefs and update those beliefs in light of observed data. Contemporary approaches to Bayesian few-shot classification maintain a posterior distribution over model parameters, which is slow and requires storage that scales with model size. Instead, we propose a Gaussian process classifier based on a novel combination of P\u00f3lya-Gamma augmentation and the one-vs-each softmax approximation that allows us to efficiently marginalize over functions rather than model parameters. We demonstrate improved accuracy and uncertainty quantification on both standard few-shot classification benchmarks and few-shot domain transfer tasks."}}

In this work, we consider few-shot classification, and aim to shed light on what makes some novel classes easier to learn than others, and what types of learned representations generalize better. To this end, we define a new paradigm in terms of attributes -- simple building blocks of which concepts are formed -- as a means of quantifying the degree of relatedness of different concepts. Our empirical analysis reveals that supervised learning generalizes poorly to new attributes, but a combination of self-supervised pretraining with supervised finetuning leads to stronger generalization. The benefit of self-supervised pretraining and supervised finetuning is further investigated through controlled experiments using random splits of the attribute space, and we find that predictability of test attributes provides an informative estimate of a model's generalization ability."}}

However, the high dimensionality of these representations makes them difficult to interpret and prone to over-fitting. We propose a simple, intuitive and scalable dimension reduction framework that takes into account the soft probabilistic interpretation of standard deep models for classification. When applying our framework to visualization, our representations more accurately reflect inter-class distances than standard visualization techniques such as t-SNE. We show experimentally that our framework improves generalization performance to unseen categories in zero-shot learning. We also provide a finite sample error upper bound guarantee for the method."}}

Hyperbolic geometry is especially suited to hierarchically-structured datasets, which are prevalent in the real world. Current hyperbolic representation learning methods compare examples with the Poincar\\'e distance metric. They formulate the problem as minimizing the distance of each node in a hierarchy with its descendants while maximizing its distance with other nodes. This formulation produces node representations close to the centroid of their descendants. We exploit the fact that the centroid w.r.t the squared Lorentzian distance can be written in closed-form. We show that the Euclidean norm of such a centroid decreases as the curvature of the hyperbolic space decreases. This property makes it appropriate to represent hierarchies where parent nodes minimize the distances to their descendants and have smaller Euclidean norm than their children. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results in retrieval and classification tasks on different datasets. "}}
