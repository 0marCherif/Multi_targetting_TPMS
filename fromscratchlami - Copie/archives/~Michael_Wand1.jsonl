In this paper, we examine the question of how well we could perform short-term (up to 180 min) forecasts using exclusively multi-spectral satellite images and past lighting events as data. We employ representation learning based on deep convolutional neural networks in an \u201cend-to-end\u201d fashion. Here, a crucial problem is handling the imbalance of the positive and negative classes appropriately in order to be able to obtain predictive results (which is not addressed by many previous machine-learning-based approaches). The resulting network outperforms previous methods based on physically based features and optical flow methods (similar to operational prediction models) and generalizes across different years. A closer examination of the classifier performance over time and under masking of input data indicates that the learned model actually draws most information from structures in the visible spectrum, with infrared imaging sustaining some classification performance during the night."}}

An inherent problem of steerable representations is that general nonlinear layers break equivariance, thus restricting architectural choices. Our paper applies harmonic distortion analysis to illuminate the effect of nonlinearities on Fourier representations of SO(2). We develop a novel FFT-based algorithm for computing representations of non-linearly transformed activations while maintaining band-limitation. It yields exact equivariance for polynomial (approximations of) nonlinearities, as well as approximate solutions with tunable accuracy for general functions. We apply the approach to build a fully E(3)-equivariant network for sampled 3D surface data. In experiments with 2D and 3D data, we obtain results that compare favorably to the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy while permitting continuous symmetry and exact equivariance."}}

Although schedules such as 1-cycle offer substantial gains over base-line methods, the effect of LR-curves on the training process is not very well understood. In order to gain more insight into the training process, we combine information theoretic ideas and probabilistic optimization, namely simulated annealing. In more detail, we introduce the activation pattern temperature, which (i) captures changes in the non-linear behavior of ReLU networks and (ii) is free of hyperparameters and thus is more interpretable. Examining the training process, 1-cycle simply yields a linear decrease in temperature, reminiscent of successful cooling strategies in simulated annealing. In order to test a causal connection, we devise ActCooLR, an automatic LR-scheduler that produces declining temperature profiles. In experiments with various CNN architectures and different image classification data sets, we obtain results that perform favorably or exceed the performance of hand-tuned schedules."}}

Specifically, we devise a tailored autoencoder architecture, trained end-to-end, that maps transient images directly to a depth map representation. Training is done using an efficient transient renderer for diffuse three-bounce indirect light transport that enables the quick generation of large amounts of training data for the network. We examine the performance of our method on a variety of synthetic and experimental datasets and its dependency on the choice of training data and augmentation strategies, as well as architectural features.
