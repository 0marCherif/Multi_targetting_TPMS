In this work, we focus on federated training of dual encoding models on decentralized data composed of many small, non-IID (independent and identically distributed) client datasets. Existing approaches require large and diverse training batches to work well and perform poorly when naively adapted to the setting of small, non-IID client datasets using federated averaging. We observe that large-batch loss computation can be simulated on small individual clients for loss functions that are based on encoding statistics. Based on this insight, we propose a novel federated training approach, Distributed Cross Correlation Optimization (DCCO), which trains dual encoding models using encoding statistics aggregated across clients, without sharing individual samples or encodings.

We show that we can identify informative and diverse subsets of data that lead to deep learning models with similar performance as the ones trained with the original dataset. Prior methods have exploited diversity and uncertainty in submodular objective functions for choosing subsets. In addition to these measures, we show that balancing constraints on predicted class labels and decision boundaries are beneficial. We propose a novel formulation of these constraints using matroids, an algebraic structure that generalizes linear independence in vector spaces, and present an efficient greedy algorithm with constant approximation guarantees. We outperform competing baselines on standard classification datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, as well as long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR-100-LT."}}

In this work, we focus on the task of image-based mutual gaze detection, and propose a simple and effective approach to boost the performance by using an auxiliary 3D gaze estimation task during the training phase. We achieve the performance boost without additional labeling cost by training the 3D gaze estimation branch using pseudo 3D gaze labels deduced from mutual gaze labels. By sharing the head image encoder between the 3D gaze estimation and the mutual gaze detection branches, we achieve better head features than learned by training the mutual gaze detection branch alone. Experimental results on three image datasets show that the proposed approach improves the detection performance significantly without additional annotations. This work also introduces a new image dataset that consists of 33.1K pairs of humans annotated with mutual gaze labels in 29.2K images."}}

However, not every camera user possesses the knowledge and expertise required for capturing well-composed photos. While post-capture cropping can improve the composition sometimes, it does not work in many common scenarios in which the photographer needs to adjust the camera view to capture the best shot. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based approach that provides suggestions to the photographer on how to adjust the camera view before capturing. By optimizing the composition before a photo is captured, our system helps photographers to capture better photos. As there is no publicly-available dataset for this task, we create a view adjustment dataset by repurposing existing image cropping datasets. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage semi-supervised approach that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled images for training a view adjustment model. Experiment results show that the proposed semi-supervised approach outperforms the corresponding supervised alternatives, and our user study results show that the suggested view adjustment improves image composition 79% of the time."}}

While recent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based semantic segmentation approaches have achieved impressive results by using large amounts of labeled training data, their performance drops significantly as the amount of labeled data decreases. This happens because deep CNNs trained with the de facto cross-entropy loss can easily overfit to small amounts of labeled data. To address this issue, we propose a simple and effective contrastive learning-based training strategy in which we first pretrain the network using a pixel-wise, label-based contrastive loss, and then fine-tune it using the cross-entropy loss. This approach increases intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, thereby resulting in a better pixel classifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training strategy using the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation datasets. Our results show that pretraining with the proposed contrastive loss results in large performance gains (more than 20% absolute improvement in some settings) when the amount of labeled data is limited. In many settings, the proposed contrastive pretraining strategy, which does not use any additional data, is able to match or outperform the widely-used ImageNet pretraining strategy that uses more than a million additional labeled images."}}

However, due to the quadratic computational and memory complexities of self-attention, these works either apply attention only to low-resolution feature maps in later stages of a deep network or restrict the receptive field of attention in each layer to a small local region. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a new global self-attention module, referred to as the GSA module, which is efficient enough to serve as the backbone component of a deep network. This module consists of two parallel layers: a content attention layer that attends to pixels based only on their content and a positional attention layer that attends to pixels based on their spatial locations. The output of this module is the sum of the outputs of the two layers. Based on the proposed GSA module, we introduce new standalone global attention-based deep networks that use GSA modules instead of convolutions to model pixel interactions. Due to the global extent of the proposed GSA module, a GSA network has the ability to model long-range pixel interactions throughout the network. Our experimental results show that GSA networks outperform the corresponding convolution-based networks significantly on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets while using less number of parameters and computations.
