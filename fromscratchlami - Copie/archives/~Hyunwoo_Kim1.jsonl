We observe that the LLMs provide effective priors in exploiting linguistic shortcuts for temporal and causal reasoning in Video Question Answering (VideoQA). However, such priors often cause suboptimal results on VideoQA by leading the model to over-rely on questions, i.e., linguistic bias, while ignoring visual content. This is also known as \u2018ungrounded guesses\u2019 or \u2018hallucinations\u2019. To address this problem while leveraging LLMs\u2019 prior on VideoQA, we propose a novel framework, Flipped-VQA, encouraging the model to predict all the combinations of \u27e8V, Q, A\u27e9 triplet by flipping the source pair and the target label to understand their complex relationships, i.e., predict A, Q, and V given a VQ, VA, and QA pairs, respectively. In this paper, we develop LLaMA-VQA by applying Flipped-VQA to LLaMA, and it outperforms both LLMs-based and non-LLMs-based models on five challenging VideoQA benchmarks. Furthermore, our Flipped-VQA is a general framework that is applicable to various LLMs (OPT and GPT-J) and consistently improves their performances. We empirically demonstrate that Flipped-VQA not only enhances the exploitation of linguistic shortcuts but also mitigates the linguistic bias, which causes incorrect answers over-relying on the question.

Despite the success, it is challenging to directly apply Transformers on point clouds due to their quadratic cost in the number of points. In this paper, we present a Self-Positioning point-based Transformer (SPoTr), which is designed to capture both local and global shape contexts with reduced complexity. Specifically, this architecture consists of local self-attention and self-positioning point-based global cross-attention. The self-positioning points, adaptively located based on the input shape, consider both spatial and semantic information with disentangled attention to improve expressive power. With the self-positioning points, we propose a novel global cross-attention mechanism for point clouds, which improves the scalability of global self-attention by allowing the attention module to compute attention weights with only a small set of self-positioning points. Experiments show the effectiveness of SPoTr on three point cloud tasks such as shape classification, part segmentation, and scene segmentation. In particular, our proposed model achieves an accuracy gain of 2.6% over the previous best models on shape classification with ScanObjectNN. We also provide qualitative analyses to demonstrate the interpretability of self-positioning points. The code of SPoTr is available at this https URL."}}

Recent works have shown that optimization in a latent space through deep generative models such as variational autoencoders leads to effective and efficient Bayesian optimization for structured or discrete data. However, as the optimization does not take place in the input space, it leads to an inherent gap that results in potentially suboptimal solutions. To alleviate the discrepancy, we propose Correlated latent space Bayesian Optimization (CoBO), which focuses on learning correlated latent spaces characterized by a strong correlation between the distances in the latent space and the distances within the objective function. Specifically, our method introduces Lipschitz regularization, loss weighting, and trust region recoordination to minimize the inherent gap around the promising areas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several optimization tasks in discrete data, such as molecule design and arithmetic expression fitting, and achieve high performance within a small budget."}}

Since most studies on foundation models mainly focus on the pretraining phase, a naive strategy to minimize a single task-specific loss is adopted for fine-tuning. However, such fine-tuning methods do not fully leverage other losses that are potentially beneficial for the target task. Therefore, we propose MEta Loss TRansformer (MELTR), a plug-in module that automatically and non-linearly combines various loss functions to aid learning the target task via auxiliary learning. We formulate the auxiliary learning as a bi-level optimization problem and present an efficient optimization algorithm based on Approximate Implicit Differentiation (AID). For evaluation, we apply our framework to various video foundation models (UniVL, Violet and All-in-one), and show significant performance gain on all four downstream tasks: text-to-video retrieval, video question answering, video captioning, and multi-modal sentiment analysis. Our qualitative analyses demonstrate that MELTR adequately `transforms' individual loss functions and `melts' them into an effective unified loss.

Since each image contains transient occluders, decomposing the static and transient components is necessary to construct radiance fields with such in-the-wild photographs where existing methods require a lot of training data. We introduce SF-NeRF, aiming to disentangle those two components with only a few images given, which exploits semantic information without any supervision. The proposed method contains an occlusion filtering module that predicts the transient color and its opacity for each pixel, which enables the NeRF model to solely learn the static scene representation. This filtering module learns the transient phenomena guided by pixel-wise semantic features obtained by a trainable image encoder that can be trained across multiple scenes to learn the prior of transient objects. Furthermore, we present two techniques to prevent ambiguous decomposition and noisy results of the filtering module. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods on Phototourism dataset in a few-shot setting."}}

This limitation stems from the fixed query set size of the transformer decoder, which restricts the model\u2019s inference capacity. To overcome this challenge, we propose Recurrent Detection Transformer (Recurrent DETR), an object detector that iterates the decoder block to render more predictions with a finite number of query tokens. Recurrent DETR can adaptively control the number of decoder block iterations based on the image\u2019s crowdedness or complexity, resulting in a variable-size prediction set. This is enabled by our novel Pondering Hungarian Loss, which helps the model to learn when additional computation is required to identify all the objects in a crowded scene. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Recurrent DETR on two datasets: COCO 2017, which represents a standard setting, and CrowdHuman, which features a crowded setting. Our experiments on both datasets show that Recurrent DETR achieves significant performance gains of 0.8 AP and 0.4 AP, respectively, over its base architectures. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive analyses under different query set size constraints to provide a thorough evaluation of our proposed method."}}

These methods aim to adapt the pre-trained models by introducing learnable prompts while keeping pre-trained weights frozen. However, learnable prompts can affect the internal representation within the self-attention module, which may negatively impact performance variance and generalization, especially in data-deficient settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, Read-only Prompt Optimization (RPO). RPO leverages masked attention to prevent the internal representation shift in the pre-trained model. Further, to facilitate the optimization of RPO, the read-only prompts are initialized based on special tokens of the pre-trained model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RPO outperforms CLIP and CoCoOp in base-to-new generalization and domain generalization while displaying better robustness. Also, the proposed method achieves better generalization on extremely data-deficient settings, while improving parameter efficiency and computational overhead.
