Prior work in this model has largely focused on protocols that use a single round of communication to compute algorithmic primitives like means, histograms, and counts. In this work, we present interactive shuffle protocols for stochastic convex optimization. Our optimization protocols rely on a new noninteractive protocol for summing vectors of bounded $\\ell_2$ norm. By combining this sum subroutine with techniques including mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, accelerated gradient descent, and Nesterov's smoothing method, we obtain loss guarantees for a variety of convex loss functions that significantly improve on those of the local model and sometimes match those of the central model."}}

The introduction of reserve prices, however, usually do not help improve total welfare of the auctioneer and the bidders. In this paper, we focus on value maximizing bidders with return on spend constraints---a paradigm that has drawn considerable attention recently as more advertisers adopt auto-bidding algorithms in advertising platforms---and show that the introduction of reserve prices has a novel impact on the market. Namely, by choosing reserve prices appropriately the auctioneer can improve not only the total revenue but also the total welfare. Our results also demonstrate that reserve prices are robust to bidder types, i.e., reserve prices work well for different bidder types, such as value maximizers and utility maximizers, without using bidder type information. We generalize these results for a variety of auction mechanisms such as VCG, GSP, and first-price auctions. Moreover, we show how to combine these results with additive boosts to improve the welfare of the outcomes of the auction further. Finally, we complement our theoretical observations with an empirical study confirming the effectiveness of these ideas using data from online advertising auctions. "}}

While a social planner would balance \u201cexploration\u201d and \u201cexploitation\u201d using a multi-armed bandit algorithm, users' incentives may tilt this balance in favor of exploitation. We consider Bayesian Exploration: a simple model in which the recommendation system (the \u201cprincipal\u201d) controls the information flow to the users (the \u201cagents\u201d) and strives to incentivize exploration via information asymmetry. A single round of this model is a version of a well-known \u201cBayesian Persuasion game\u201d from [24]. We allow heterogeneous users, relaxing a major assumption from prior work that users have the same preferences from one time step to another. The goal is now to learn the best personalized recommendations. One particular challenge is that it may be impossible to incentivize some of the user types to take some of the actions, no matter what the principal does or how much time she has. We consider several versions of the model, depending on whether and when the user types are reported to the principal, and design a near-optimal \u201crecommendation policy\u201d for each version. We also investigate how the model choice and the diversity of user types impact the set of actions that can possibly be \u201cexplored\u201d by each type."}}

An agent has a prior over her value for each item and can pay a cost to learn the instantiation of her value. After exploring a subset of items, the agent chooses one and obtains a payoff equal to its value minus the search cost. We consider a sequential model of consumer search in which agents' values are correlated and each agent updates her priors based on the exploration of past agents before performing her search. Specifically, we assume the value is the sum of a common-value component, called the quality, and a subjective score. Fixing the variance of the total value, we say a population is more diverse if the subjective score has a larger variance. We ask how diversity impacts average utility. We show that intermediate diversity levels yield significantly higher social utility than the extreme cases of no diversity (when agents under-explore) or full diversity (when agents are unable to learn from each other) and quantify how the impact of the diversity level changes depending on the time spent searching."}}

In this problem, a learner is trying to learn a Lipschitz function $f:[0,1]^d \\rightarrow [0,1]$ over the course of $T$ rounds. On round $t$, an adversary provides the learner with an input $x_t$, the learner submits a guess $y_t$ for $f(x_t)$, and learns whether $y_t &gt; f(x_t)$ or $y_t \\leq f(x_t)$. The learner's goal is to minimize their total loss $\\sum_t\\ell(f(x_t), y_t)$ (for some loss function $\\ell$). The problem is motivated by \\textit{contextual dynamic pricing}, where a firm must sell a stream of differentiated products to a collection of buyers with non-linear valuations for the items and observes only whether the item was sold or not at the posted price. For the symmetric loss $\\ell(f(x_t), y_t) = \\vert f(x_t) - y_t \\vert$, we provide an algorithm for this problem achieving total loss $O(\\log T)$ when $d=1$ and $O(T^{(d-1)/d})$ when $d&gt;1$, and show that both bounds are tight (up to a factor of $\\sqrt{\\log T}$). For the pricing loss function $\\ell(f(x_t), y_t) = f(x_t) - y_t {\\bf 1}\\{y_t \\leq f(x_t)\\}$ we show a regret bound of $O(T^{d/(d+1)})$ and show that this bound is tight. We present improved bounds in the special case of a population of linear buyers."}}
