Modeling the 3D genome structure can not only elucidate vital biological processes, but also reveal structural disruptions linked to disease. In the absence of experimental techniques able to determine 3D chromatin structure, this task is achieved computationally by exploiting chromatin interaction frequencies as measured by high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. However, existing methods are unsupervised, and limited by underlying assumptions. In this work, we present a novel framework for 3D chromatin structure prediction from Hi-C data. The framework consists of, a novel synthetic data generation module that simulates realistic structures and corresponding Hi-C matrices, and ChromFormer, a transformer-based model to predict 3D chromatin structures from standalone Hi-C data, while providing local structural-level confidence estimates. Our solution outperforms existing methods when tested on unseen synthetic data, and achieves comparable results on experimental data for a full eukaryotic genome. "}}

For example, in biology, recent advances allow us to obtain single-cell expression data under multiple interventions such as drugs or gene knockouts. However, a key challenge is that often the targets of the interventions are uncertain or unknown. Thus, standard causal discovery methods can no longer be used.\nTo fill this gap, we propose a Bayesian framework (BaCaDI) for discovering the causal structure that underlies data generated under various unknown experimental/interventional conditions.\nBaCaDI is fully differentiable and operates in the continuous space of latent probabilistic representations of both causal structures and interventions. This enables us to approximate complex posteriors via gradient-based variational inference and to reason about the epistemic uncertainty in the predicted structure.\nIn experiments on synthetic causal discovery tasks and simulated gene-expression data, BaCaDI outperforms related methods in identifying causal structures and intervention targets. Finally, we demonstrate that, thanks to its rigorous Bayesian approach, our method provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates."}}

We endow each of these sets with a geometric structure, inducing the notions of closeness and symmetries, by turning them into a vertex set of an appropriate metagraph. Building on this, we describe the class of priors that respect this structure and are analogous to the Euclidean isotropic processes, like squared exponential or Mat\\'ern. We propose an efficient computational technique for the ostensibly intractable problem of evaluating these priors' kernels, making such Gaussian processes usable within the usual toolboxes and downstream applications. We go further to consider sets of equivalence classes of unweighted graphs and define the appropriate versions of priors thereon. We prove a hardness result, showing that in this case, exact kernel computation cannot be performed efficiently. However, we propose a simple Monte Carlo approximation for handling moderately sized cases. Inspired by applications in chemistry, we illustrate the proposed techniques on a real molecular property prediction task in the small data regime."}}

This paper introduces a multi-scale graph construction of a protein -- HoloProt -- connecting surface to structure and sequence. The surface captures coarser details of the protein, while sequence as primary component and structure -- comprising secondary and tertiary components -- capture finer details. Our graph encoder then learns a multi-scale representation by allowing each level to integrate the encoding from level(s) below with the graph at that level. We test the learned representation on different tasks, (i.) ligand binding affinity (regression), and (ii.) protein function prediction (classification). On the regression task, contrary to previous methods, our model performs consistently and reliably across different dataset splits, outperforming all baselines on most splits. On the classification task, it achieves a performance close to the top-performing model while using 10x fewer parameters. To improve the memory efficiency of our construction, we segment the multiplex protein surface manifold into molecular superpixels and substitute the surface with these superpixels at little to no performance loss."}}

We developed a computational approach which allows incorporating prior knowledge about the single cell similarity into the training process, and ultimately achieve significant better clustering performance compared to baseline methods. This single cell similarity can be defined to benefit specific needs of the modeling goal, for example to either cluster cell type or tissue type, respectively. In addition, we are able to generate new realistic single cell data from a respective mode of the phenotype due to the architecture of the model, which consists of smaller sub-models learning the different modes of the data. Compared to competitor methods, we show significantly better results on clustering and generation of handwritten digits of the MNIST data set, on clustering seven different mouse organs from single-cell RNA sequencing measurements, and on clustering cell types in over 272 different datasets of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell measured via CyTOF."}}
