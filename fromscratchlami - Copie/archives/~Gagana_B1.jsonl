In spite of considerable strides, it still suffers from the curse of false matches in the presence of variations in terms of parameters such as affine, scale, rotation and illumination. Since, real world images inherently consists of such variations, an effective FR system, should handle such variations deftly. Hence, in this paper, we propose a robust, yet simple and cost effective technique for overcoming some of the aforementioned challenges. The first stage of the proposed system deals with illumination variations by performing logarithm transform on the input face images. Further, the Non-subsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT) is used to decompose the logarithm transformed facial images into low frequency and high frequency components. Subsequently, histogram equalization is carried out on the low frequency components. Finally, we employ Affine Scale Invariant Feature Transform (ASIFT) to find corresponding points that are translation and scale invariant. We will demonstrate by carrying out extensive experimentations on the benchmark datasets: ORL, Grimace, Face95 and Yale, that the proposed technique is more robust and yields comparable efficacy to most of the contemporary approaches."}}

Hence, Hinton et al, proposed a layered architecture called Capsule Networks (Capsnets) which outperform traditional systems by replacing pooling techniques with dynamic routing abilities. Capsnets are, thus, en-route to proving themselves as prospective future benchmarks in visual imagery tasks by surpassing existing state-of-theart results on the MNIST dataset. The two novel aspects inspected in this paper are: the enhancement of this performance on CIFAR-10 through regularization and hyperparameter optimization which, henceforth, augment applicability to stochastic numeric healthcare data helping uncover newer challenges of predictive neural networks."}}
