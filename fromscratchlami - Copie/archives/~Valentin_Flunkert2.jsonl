However, other criteria such as training time or latency are critical in many real-world applications. We therefore address the question of how to choose an appropriate forecasting model for a given dataset among the plethora of available forecasting methods when accuracy is only one of many criteria. For this, our contributions are two-fold. First, we present a comprehensive benchmark, evaluating 7 classical and 6 deep learning forecasting methods on 44 heterogeneous, publicly available datasets. The benchmark code is open-sourced along with evaluations and forecasts for all methods. These evaluations enable us to answer open questions such as the amount of data required for deep learning models to outperform classical ones. Second, we leverage the benchmark evaluations to learn good defaults that consider multiple objectives such as accuracy and latency. By learning a mapping from forecasting models to performance metrics, we show that our method ParetoSelect is able to accurately select models from the Pareto front \u2014 alleviating the need to train or evaluate many forecasting models for model selection. To the best of our knowledge, ParetoSelect constitutes the first method to learn default models in a multi-objective setting."}}

However, the accuracy of these methods suffers greatly when modeling out-of-sample time series, significantly limiting their applicability compared to classical forecasting methods. To bridge this gap, we adopt a meta-learning view of the time series forecasting problem. We introduce a novel forecasting method, called Meta Global- Local Auto-Regression (Meta-GLAR), that adapts to each time series by learning in closed-form the mapping from the representations produced by a recurrent neural network (RNN) to one-step-ahead forecasts. Crucially, the parameters of the RNN are learned across multiple time series by backpropagating through the closed-form adaptation mechanism. In our extensive empirical evaluation we show that our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art in out-of-sample forecasting accuracy reported in earlier work."}}

In this paper we present PSA-GAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) that generates long time series samples of high quality using progressive growing of GANs and self-attention. We show that PSA-GAN can be used to reduce the error in several downstream forecasting tasks over baselines that only use real data. We also introduce a Frechet-Inception Distance-like score for time series, Context-FID, assessing the quality of synthetic time series samples. We find that Context-FID is indicative for downstream performance. Therefore, Context-FID could be a useful tool to develop time series GAN models. "}}

In particular, such corpora often allow to distinguish between \\emph{exogenous} signals that describe a context which influences a given appliance and \\emph{endogenous} signals that describe the internal state of the appliance. We propose a temporal convolution network based embedding that improves on the state-of-the-art by incorporating recent advances in contrastive learning to the time series domain and by adopting a multi-resolution approach. Employing techniques borrowed from domain-adversarial learning, we achieve an invariance of the embeddings with respect to the context provided by the exogenous signal. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we contribute new data sets to the research community and use both new as well as existing data sets to empirically verify that we can separate normal from abnormal internal appliance behaviour independent of the external signals in data sets from IoT and DevOps."}}
