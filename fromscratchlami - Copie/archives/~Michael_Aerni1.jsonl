In contrast, modern overparameterized models can yield small test error despite interpolating noise \u2014 a phenomenon often called \"benign overfitting\" or \"harmless interpolation\". This paper argues that the degree to which interpolation is harmless hinges upon the strength of an estimator's inductive bias, i.e., how heavily the estimator favors solutions with a certain structure: while strong inductive biases prevent harmless interpolation, weak inductive biases can even require fitting noise to generalize well. Our main theoretical result establishes tight non-asymptotic bounds for high-dimensional kernel regression that reflect this phenomenon for convolutional kernels, where the filter size regulates the strength of the inductive bias. We further provide empirical evidence of the same behavior for deep neural networks with varying filter sizes and rotational invariance."}}

However, this narrative has been challenged by empirical observations indicating that adversarially trained deep neural networks suffer from robust overfitting. While existing explanations attribute this phenomenon  to noise or problematic samples in the training data set, we prove that even on entirely noiseless data, achieving a vanishing adversarial logistic training loss is suboptimal compared to regularized counterparts."}}

These findings suggest that ridge regularization has vanishing benefits in high dimensions.  We challenge this narrative by showing that, even in the absence of noise, avoiding interpolation through ridge regularization can significantly improve generalization.  We prove this phenomenon for the robust risk of both linear regression and classification, and hence provide the first theoretical result on \\emph{robust overfitting}."}}
