Existing methods mainly rely on a variety of constraints to achieve the pose transfer over 3D meshes, e.g., the need for manually encoding for shape and pose disentanglement. In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach to conduct the pose transfer between any arbitrate given 3D meshes. Specifically, a novel Intrinsic-Extrinsic Preserved Generative Adversarial Network (IEP-GAN) is presented for both intrinsic (i.e., shape) and extrinsic (i.e., pose) information preservation. Extrinsically, we propose a co-occurrence discriminator to capture the structural/pose invariance from distinct Laplacians of the mesh. Meanwhile, intrinsically, a local intrinsic-preserved loss is introduced to preserve the geodesic priors while avoiding heavy computations. At last, we show the possibility of using IEP-GAN to manipulate 3D human meshes in various ways, including pose transfer, identity swapping and pose interpolation with latent code vector arithmetic. The extensive experiments on various 3D datasets of humans, animals and hands qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the generality of our approach. Our proposed model produces better results and is substantially more efficient compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

However, optimization on Riemannian manifolds is nontrivial thus most of the existing hyperbolic networks build the network operations on the tangent space of the manifold, which is a Euclidean local approximation. This distorts the learnt features, limits the representation capacity of the network and makes it hard to optimize the network. In this work, we introduce a fully hyperbolic graph convolutional network (GCN), referred to as SRBGCN, which performs neural computations such as feature transformation and aggregation directly on the manifold, using manifold-preserving Lorentz transformations that include spatial rotation (SR) and boost (B) operations. Experiments conducted on static graph datasets for node classification and link prediction tasks validate the performance of the proposed method."}}

The current protocol of FSCIL is built by mimicking the general class-incremental learning setting, while it is not totally appropriate due to the different data configuration, i.e., novel classes are all in the limited data regime. In this paper, we rethink the configuration of FSCIL with the open-set hypothesis by reserving the possibility in the first session for incoming categories. To assign better performances on both close-set and open-set recognition to the model, Hyperbolic Reciprocal Point Learning module (Hyper-RPL) is built on Reciprocal Point Learning (RPL) with hyperbolic neural networks. Besides, for learning novel categories from limited labeled data, we incorporate a hyperbolic metric learning (Hyper-Metric) module into the distillation-based framework to alleviate the overfitting issue and better handle the trade-off issue between the preservation of old knowledge and the acquisition of new knowledge. The comprehensive assessments of the proposed configuration and modules on three benchmark datasets are executed to validate the effectiveness concerning three evaluation indicators."}}

However, most recent powerful graph convolution networks (GCNs) separate the spatial and temporal modeling into isolated processes, where GCN models spatial interactions using partially fixed adjacent matrices and 1D convolution captures temporal dynamics, which is insufficient for emotion recognition. In this work, we propose the 3D-Shift GCN, which enables interactions of joints within a spatial-temporal volume for global feature extraction. Besides, we further develop a multiscale architecture, the MS-Shift GCN, to fuse features captured under different temporal ranges for modeling richer dynamics. After conducting evaluation on two regular action recognition benchmarks and two gesture based emotion recognition datasets, the results show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods."}}

This task plays an important role in self-driving cars and autonomous drones. In SS, many works have shown that most misclassified pixels are commonly near object boundaries with high uncertainties. However, existing SS loss functions are not tailored to handle these uncertain pixels during training, as these pixels are usually treated equally as confidently classified pixels and cannot be embedded with arbitrary low distortion in Euclidean space, thereby degenerating the performance of SS. To overcome this problem, this paper designs a \"Hyperbolic Uncertainty Loss\" (HyperUL), which dynamically highlights the misclassified and high-uncertainty pixels in Hyperbolic space during training via the hyperbolic distances. The proposed HyperUL is model agnostic and can be easily applied to various neural architectures. After employing HyperUL to three recent SS models, the experimental results on Cityscapes and UAVid datasets reveal that the segmentation performance of existing SS models can be consistently improved."}}

Most works recognize MEs by taking RGB videos or images as input. In fact, the activated facial regions in ME images are very small and the subtle motion can be easily submerged in the unrelated information. Facial landmarks are a low-dimensional and compact modality, which leads to much lower computational cost and can potentially concentrate more on ME-related features. However, the discriminability of landmarks for MER is not clear. Thus, this paper explores the contribution of facial landmarks and constructs a new framework to efficiently recognize MEs with sole facial landmark information. Specially, we design a separate structure module to separately aggregate the spatial and temporal information in the geometric movement graph based on facial landmarks, and a Geometric Two-Stream Graph Network is constructed to aggregate the low-order geometric information and high-order semantic information of facial landmarks. Furthermore, two core components are proposed to enhance features. Specifically, a semantic adjacency matrix can automatically model the relationship between nodes even long-distance nodes in a self-learning fashion; and an Adaptive Action Unit loss is introduced to guide the learning process such that the learned features are forced to have a synchronized pattern with facial action units. Notably, this work tackles MER only utilizing geometric features, processed based on a graph model, which provides a new idea with much higher efficiency to promote MER. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve competitive or even superior performance with a significantly reduced computational cost, and facial landmarks can significantly contribute to MER and are worth further study for efficient ME analysis."}}

Currently, benefiting from the graph convolutional networks (GCN), the performance of this task is dramatically improved due to the powerful ability of GCN for modeling the Non-Euclidean data. However, most of these works are designed for the clean skeleton data while one unavoidable drawback is such data is usually noisy in reality, since most of such data is obtained using depth camera or even estimated from RGB camera, rather than recorded by the high quality but extremely costly Motion Capture (MoCap) [1] system. Under this circumstance, we propose a novel GCN framework with adversarial training to deal with the noisy skeleton data. With the guiding of the clean data in the semantic level, a reliable graph embedding can be extracted for noisy skeleton data. Besides, a discriminator is introduced such that the feature representation could further improved since it is learned with an adversarial learning fashion. We empirically demonstrate the proposed framework based on two current largest scale skeleton-based action recognition datasets. Comparison results show the superiority of our method when compared to the state-of-the-art methods under the noisy settings."}}
