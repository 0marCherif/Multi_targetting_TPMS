{"id": "ayPPc0SyLv1", "cdate": 1663850385719, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Do We Really Need Complicated Model Architectures For Temporal Networks?", "abstract": "Recurrent neural network (RNN) and self-attention mechanism (SAM) are the de facto methods to extract spatial-temporal information for temporal graph learning. Interestingly, we found that although both RNN and SAM could lead to a good performance, in practice neither of them is always necessary. In this paper, we propose GraphMixer, a conceptually and technically simple architecture that consists of three components: (1) a link-encoder that is only based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) to summarize the information from temporal links, (2) a node-encoder that is only based on neighbor mean-pooling to summarize node information, and (3) an MLP-based link classifier that performs link prediction based on the outputs of the encoders. Despite its simplicity, GraphMixer attains an outstanding performance on temporal link prediction benchmarks with faster convergence and better generalization performance. These results motivate us to rethink the importance of simpler model architecture."}}

To learn quality embeddings efficiently, adaptive learning rate algorithms have demonstrated superior empirical performance over SGD, largely accredited to their token-dependent learning rate. However, the underlying mechanism for the efficiency of token-dependent learning rate remains underexplored. We show that incorporating frequency information of tokens in the embedding learning problems leads to provably efficient algorithms, and demonstrate that common adaptive algorithms implicitly exploit the frequency information to a large extent. Specifically, we propose (Counter-based) Frequency-aware Stochastic Gradient Descent, which applies a frequency-dependent learning rate for each token, and exhibits provable speed-up compared to SGD when the token distribution is imbalanced. Empirically, we show the proposed algorithms are able to improve or match the performance of adaptive algorithms on benchmark recommendation tasks and a large-scale industrial recommendation system, closing the performance gap between SGD and adaptive algorithms. Our results are the first to show token-dependent learning rate provably improves convergence for non-convex embedding learning problems."}}

Unfortunately, large amounts of noise as well as a highly varying image quality make the automatic tracking and segmentation of the mitral valve in two-dimensional echocardiographic videos challenging. In this paper, we present a fully automatic and unsupervised method for segmentation of the mitral valve in two-dimensional echocardiographic videos, independently of the echocardiographic view. We propose a bias-free variant of the robust non-negative matrix factorization (RNMF) along with a window-based localization approach, that is able to identify the mitral valve in several challenging situations. We improve the average f1-score on our dataset of 10 echocardiographic videos by 0.18 to a f1-score of 0.56."}}
