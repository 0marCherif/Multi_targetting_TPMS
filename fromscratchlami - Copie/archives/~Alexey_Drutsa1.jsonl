To keep these models useful, one has to constantly train, evaluate, and monitor these models using freshly annotated data, which can be done using crowdsourcing. In this tutorial we will present a portion of our six-year experience in solving real-world tasks with human-in-the-loop pipelines that combine efforts made by humans and machines. We will introduce data labeling via public crowdsourcing marketplaces and present the critical components of efficient data labeling. Then, we will run a practical session, where participants address a challenging real-world Information Retrieval for e-Commerce task, experiment with selecting settings for the labeling process, and launch their label collection project on real crowds within the tutorial session. We will present useful quality control techniques and provide the attendees with an opportunity to discuss their annotation ideas. Methods and techniques described in this tutorial can be applied to any crowdsourced data and are not bound to any specific crowdsourcing platform."}}

Namely, for each task shown in the list, one needs to have an estimated value of the user's performance (i.e., hourly earnings and completion time) that will be if she selects this task. We address this problem on real crowd tasks completed on one of the global crowdsourcing marketplaces by (1) conducting a survey and an A/B test on real users; the results confirm the dominance of monetary incentives and importance of knowledge on hourly earnings for users; (2) an in-depth analysis of user behavior that shows that the prediction problem is challenging: (a) users and projects are highly heterogeneous, (b) there exists the so-called \"learning effect\" of a user selected a new task; and (3) the solution to the problem of predicting user performance that demonstrates improvement of prediction quality by up to 25% for hourly earnings and up to $32%$ completion time w.r.t. a naive baseline which is based solely on historical performance of users on tasks. In our experimentation, we use data about 18 million real crowdsourcing tasks performed by $161$ thousand users on the crowd platform; we publish this dataset. The hourly earning prediction has been deployed in Yandex.Toloka."}}

A significant source of such labels for OCR data sets is (re)CAPTCHA, which distinguishes humans from automated bots by asking them to recognize text and, at the same time, receives new labeled data in this way. An important component of such approach to data collection is the reduction of noisy labels produced by bots and non-qualified users. In this paper, we address the problem of labeling text images via CAPTCHA, where user identification is generally impossible. We propose a new algorithm to aggregate multiple guesses collected through CAPTCHA. We employ incremental relabeling to minimize the number of guesses needed for obtaining the recognized text of a good accuracy. The aggregation model and the stopping rule for our incremental relabeling are based on novel machine learning techniques and use meta features of CAPTCHA tasks and accumulated guesses. Our experiments show that our approach can provide a large amount of accurately recognized texts using a minimal number of user guesses. Finally, we report the great improvements of an optical character recognition model after implementing our approach in Yandex."}}

Answers to pairwise tasks are known to be affected by the position of items on the screen, however, previous models for aggregation of pairwise comparisons do not focus on modeling such kind of biases. We introduce a new aggregation model factorBT for pairwise comparisons, which accounts for certain factors of pairwise tasks that are known to be irrelevant to the result of comparisons but may affect workers' answers due to perceptual reasons. By modeling biases that influence workers, factorBT is able to reduce the effect of biased pairwise comparisons on the resulted ranking. Our empirical studies on real-world data sets showed that factorBT produces more accurate ranking from crowdsourced pairwise comparisons than previously established models."}}
