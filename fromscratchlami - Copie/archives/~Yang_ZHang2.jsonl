In this work, we propose a framework for sensor placement to maximize the information gain called Two-step Uncertainty Network(TUN). TUN encodes an arbitrary number of measurements, models the conditional distribution of high dimensional data, and estimates the task-specific information gain at un-observed locations. Experiments on the synthetic data show that TUN outperforms the random sampling strategy and Gaussian Process-based strategy consistently."}}

In particular, we learn a camouflage pattern to hide vehicles from being detected by state-of-the-art convolutional neural network based detectors. Our approach alternates between two threads. In the first, we train a neural approximation function to imitate how a simulator applies a camouflage to vehicles and how a vehicle detector performs given images of the camouflaged vehicles. In the second, we minimize the approximated detection score by searching for the optimal camouflage. Experiments show that the learned camouflage can not only hide a vehicle from the image-based detectors under many test cases but also generalizes to different environments, vehicles, and object detectors."}}
