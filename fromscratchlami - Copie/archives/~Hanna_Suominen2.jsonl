Nevertheless, the question of how to quantify the comprehensive of the collection persists. We propose leveraging computational modelling to provide a supplementary metric to address this question in a low-resource language setting. We apply our proposed methods to the Papuan language Nen. Nen is actively in the process of being described and documented. Given the enormity of the task of language documentation, we focus on one subdomain, namely Nen verbal morphology. This study examines four verb types: copula, positional, middle, and transitive. We propose model-based paradigm generation for each verb type as a new way to measure completeness, where accuracy is analogous to the coverage of the paradigm. We contrast the paradigm attestation within the corpus (constructed from fieldwork data) and the accuracy of the paradigm generated by Transformer models trained for inflection. This analysis is extended by extrapolating from the learning curve established to provide predictions for the quantity of data required to generate a complete paradigm correctly. We also explore the correlation between high-frequency morphosyntactic features and model accuracy. We see a positive correlation between high-frequency feature combinations and model accuracy, but this is only sometimes the case. We also see high accuracy for low-frequency morphosyntactic features. Our results show that model coverage is significantly higher for the middle and transitive verbs but not the positional verb. This is an interesting finding, as the positional verb paradigm is the smallest of the four."}}

The paper evaluates a range of models, starting from simpler and shallower ones and progressing to deeper and more complex architectures. Additionally, the performance of these models is compared against naive predictions and variations of classical GARCH models. The prediction of volatility for five assets, namely S&P500, NASDAQ100, gold, silver, and oil, is specifically addressed using GARCH models, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Recurrent Neural Networks, Temporal Convolutional Networks, and the Temporal Fusion Transformer. In the majority of cases, the Temporal Fusion Transformer, followed by variants of the Temporal Convolutional Network, outperformed classical approaches and shallow networks. These experiments were repeated, and the differences observed between the competing models were found to be statistically significant, thus providing strong encouragement for their practical application."}}

They combine continuous glucose monitoring and control algorithms for automatic insulin administration to maintain glucose homeostasis. The estimation of an appropriate control action\u2014or\u2014insulin infusion rate is a complex optimisation problem for which Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are currently being explored due to their performance capabilities in complex, uncertain environments. However, insulin requirements vary markedly according to sleep patterns, meal and exercise events. Hence, a large dynamic range of insulin infusion rates is required necessitating a large continuous action space which is challenging for RL algorithms. In this study, we introduced the use of non-linear continuous action spaces as a method to tackle the problem of efficiently exploring the large dynamic range of insulin towards learning effective control policies. Three non-linear action space formulations inspired by clinical patterns of insulin delivery were explored and analysed based on their impact to performance and efficiency in learning. We implemented a state-of-the-art RL algorithm and evaluated the performance of the proposed action spaces in-silico using an open-source T1D simulator based on the UVA/Padova 2008 model. The proposed exponential action space achieved a 24% performance improvement over the linear action space commonly used in practice, while portraying fast and steady learning. The proposed action space formulation has the potential to enhance the performance of RL algorithms for\u00a0APS."}}
