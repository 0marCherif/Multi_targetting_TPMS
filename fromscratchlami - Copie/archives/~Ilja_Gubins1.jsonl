Abstract Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is an imaging technique that allows us to three-dimensionally visualize both the structural details of macro-molecular assemblies under near-native conditions and its cellular context. Electrons strongly interact with biological samples, limiting electron dose. The latter limits the signal-to-noise ratio and hence resolution of an individual tomogram to about 50 (5\u00a0nm). Biological molecules can be obtained by averaging volumes, each depicting copies of the molecule, allowing for resolutions beyond 4 (0.4\u00a0nm). To this end, the ability to localize and classify components is crucial, but challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. Computational innovation is key to mine biological information from cryo-electron tomography. To promote such innovation, we provide a novel simulated dataset to benchmark different methods of localization and classification of biological macromolecules in cryo-electron tomograms. Our publicly available dataset contains ten tomographic reconstructions of simulated cell-like volumes. Each volume contains twelve different types of complexes, varying in size, function and structure. In this paper, we have evaluated seven different methods of finding and classifying proteins. Six research groups present results obtained with learning-based methods and trained on the simulated dataset, as well as a baseline template matching, a traditional method widely used in cryo-ET research. We find that method performance correlates with particle size, especially noticeable for template matching which performance degrades rapidly as the size decreases. We learn that neural networks can achieve significantly better localization and classification performance, in particular convolutional networks with focus on high-resolution details such as those based on U-Net architecture."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task neural network architecture designed for combining sequential image processing tasks. We extend U-Net by additional decoding pathways for each individual task, and explore deep cascading of outputs and connectivity from one pathway to another. We demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed approach on denoising and semantic segmentation, as well as on progressive coarse-to-fine semantic segmentation, and achieve better performance than multiple individual or jointly-trained networks, with lower number of trainable parameters."}}

They are automatically rigged with facial blendshapes for animation, and can be used across platforms for applications including virtual reality, augmented reality, remote collaboration, gaming and more. From a set of input facial photos, our approach is to be able to create a photorealistic, fully rigged character in less than seven minutes. The facial mesh reconstruction is based on state-of-the art photogrammetry approaches. Automatic landmarking coupled with ICP registration with regularization provide direct correspondence and registration from a given generic mesh to the acquired facial mesh. Then, using deformation transfer, existing blendshapes are transferred from the generic to the reconstructed facial mesh. The reconstructed face is then fit to the full body generic mesh. Extra geometry such as jaws, teeth and nostrils are retargeted and transferred to the character. An automatic iris color extraction algorithm is performed to colorize a separate eye texture, animated with dynamic UVs. Finally, an extra step applies a style to the photorealis-tic face to enable blending of personalized facial features into any other character. The user's face can then be adapted to any human or non-human generic mesh. A pilot user study was performed to evaluate the utility of our approach. Up to 65% of the participants were successfully able to discern the presence of one's unique facial features when the style was not too far from a humanoid shape."}}

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has the ability to three-dimensionally visualize the cellular architecture as well as the structural details of macro-molecular assemblies under near-native conditions. Due to beam sensitivity of biological samples, an inidividual tomogram has a maximal resolution of 5 nanometers. By averaging volumes, each depicting copies of the same type of a molecule, resolutions beyond 4 \u00c5 have been achieved. Key in this process is the ability to localize and classify the components of interest, which is challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. Innovation in computational methods remains key to mine biological information from the tomograms. To promote such innovation, we organize this SHREC track and provide a simulated dataset with the goal of establishing a benchmark in localization and classification of biological particles in cryo-electron tomograms. The publicly available dataset contains ten reconstructed tomograms obtained from a simulated cell-like volume. Each volume contains twelve different types of proteins, varying in size and structure. Participants had access to 9 out of 10 of the cell-like ground-truth volumes for learning-based methods, and had to predict protein class and location in the test tomogram. Five groups submitted eight sets of results, using seven different methods. While our sample size gives only an anecdotal overview of current approaches in cryo-ET classification, we believe it shows trends and highlights interesting future work areas. The results show that learning-based approaches is the current trend in cryo-ET classification research and specifically end-to-end 3D learning-based approaches achieve the best performance."}}
