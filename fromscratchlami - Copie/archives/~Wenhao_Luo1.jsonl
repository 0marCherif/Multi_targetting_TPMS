The LOS connectivity between pairwise robots is preserved when two robots stay within the limited communication range and their LOS remains occlusion-free from static obstacles while moving. By using control barrier functions (CBF) and minimum volume enclosing ellipsoids (MVEE), we first introduce the LOS connectivity barrier certificate (LOS-CBC) to characterize the state-dependent admissible control space for pairwise robots, from which their resulting motion will keep the two robots LOS connected over time. We then propose the Minimum Line-of-Sight Connectivity Constraint Spanning Tree (MLCCST) as a step-wise bilevel optimization framework to jointly optimize (a) the minimum set of LOS edges to actively maintain, and (b) the control revision with respect to a nominal multi-robot controller due to LOS connectivity maintenance. As proved in the theoretical analysis, this allows the robots to improvise the optimal composition of LOS-CBC control constraints that are least constraining around the nominal controllers, and at the same time enforce the global and subgroup LOS connectivity through the resulting preserved set of pairwise LOS edges. The framework thus leads to robots staying as close to their nominal behaviors, while exhibiting dynamically changing LOS-connected network topology that provides the greatest flexibility for the existing multi-robot tasks in real time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations with up to 64 robots."}}

However, given the exploration nature of the learning process and the presence of model uncertainty, it is challenging to apply them to safety-critical control tasks due to the lack of safety guarantee. On the other hand, while combining control-theoretical approaches with learning algorithms has shown promise in safe RL applications, the sample efficiency of safe data collection process for control is not well addressed. In this paper, we propose a \\emph{provably} sample efficient episodic safe learning framework for online control tasks that leverages safe exploration and exploitation in an unknown, nonlinear dynamical system. In particular, the framework 1) extends control barrier functions (CBFs) in a stochastic setting to achieve provable high-probability safety under uncertainty during model learning and 2) integrates an optimism-based exploration strategy to efficiently guide the safe exploration process with learned dynamics for \\emph{near optimal} control performance. We provide formal analysis on the episodic regret bound against the optimal controller and probabilistic safety with theoretical guarantees. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm."}}

In this paper, we introduce the Parametric Control Barrier Function (Parametric-CBF), a novel variant of the traditional Control Barrier Function to extend its expressivity in describing different safe behaviors among heterogeneous robots. Instead of assuming cooperative and homogeneous robots using the same safe controllers, the ego robot is able to model the neighboring robots\u2019 underlying safe controllers through different Parametric-CBFs with observed data. Given learned parametric-CBF and proved forward invariance, it provides greater flexibility for the ego robot to better coordinate with other heterogeneous robots with improved efficiency while enjoying formally provable safety guarantees. We demonstrate the usage of Parametric-CBF in behavior prediction and adaptive safe control in the ramp merging scenario from the applications of autonomous driving. Compared to traditional CBF, Parametric-CBF has the advantage of capturing varying drivers\u2019 characteristics given richer description of robot behavior in the context of safe control. Numerical simulations are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

The sheep agents have no knowledge about the presence of the high-value unit and follow flocking dynamics to reach their goal. We take recourse to control barrier functions to pose this problem and exploit the interaction dynamics between the sheep and dogs to find dogs\u2019 velocities that result in the sheep getting repelled from the zone.

We provide a theoretical proof of the feasibility of our strategy for the one dog/one sheep case.

Among them, Exponential CBF (eCBF) is particularly popular due to its realistic applicability to high-relative-degree systems. However, for most of the optimization-based controllers utilizing CBF-based constraints, solution feasibility is a common issue arising from potential conflict among different constraints. Moreover, how to incorporate uncertainty into the eCBF-based constraints in high-relative-degree systems to account for safety remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present a novel approach to extend an eCBF-based safe critical controller to a probabilistic setting to handle potential motion uncertainty from system dynamics. More importantly, we leverage an optimization-based technique to provide a solution feasibility guarantee in run time, while ensuring probabilistic safety. Lane changing and intersection handling are demonstrated as two use cases, and experiment results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}
