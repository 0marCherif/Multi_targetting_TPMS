We first applied image classification models of various sizes on mel-spectrogram representations of the vocal bursts, as is standard in sound event detection literature. Results from these models show an increase of 21.24% over the baseline system with respect to the harmonic mean of the task metrics, and comprise our team's main submission to the MultiTask track. We then sought to characterize the headroom in the MultiTask track by applying a large pre-trained Conformer model that previously achieved state-of-the-art results on paralinguistic tasks like speech emotion recognition and mask detection. We additionally investigated the relationship between the sub-tasks of emotional expression, country of origin, and age prediction, and discovered that the best performing models are trained as single-task models, questioning whether the problem truly benefits from a multitask setting."}}

Although successfully used for applications such as improving keyboard query suggestions, it is not studied systematically for modeling affective computing tasks which are often laden with subjective labels and high variability across individuals/raters or even by the same participant. In this paper, we study the federated averaging algorithm FedAvg to model self-reported emotional experience and perception labels on a variety of speech, video and text datasets. We identify two learning paradigms that commonly arise in affective computing tasks: modeling of self-reports (user-as-client), and modeling perceptual judgments such as labeling sentiment of online comments (rater-as-client). In the user-as-client setting, we show that FedAvg generally performs on-par with a non-federated model in classifying self-reports. In the rater-as-client setting, FedAvg consistently performed poorer than its non-federated counterpart. We found that the performance of FedAvg degraded for classes where the inter-rater agreement was moderate to low. To address this finding, we propose an algorithm FedRater that learns client-specific label distributions in federated settings. Our experimental results show that FedRater not only improves the overall classification performance compared to FedAvg but also provides insights for estimating proxies of inter-rater agreement in distributed settings."}}

One of the principal benefits of counterfactual explanations is allowing users to explore \"what-if\" scenarios through what does not and cannot exist in the data, a quality that many other forms of explanation such as heatmaps and influence functions are inherently incapable of doing. However, most previous work on generative explainability cannot disentangle important concepts effectively, produces unrealistic examples, or fails to retain relevant information. We propose a novel approach, DISSECT, that jointly trains a generator, a discriminator, and a concept disentangler to overcome such challenges using little supervision. DISSECT generates Concept Traversals (CTs), defined as a sequence of generated examples with increasing degrees of concepts that influence a classifier's decision. By training a generative model from a classifier's signal, DISSECT offers a way to discover a classifier's inherent \"notion\" of distinct concepts automatically rather than rely on user-predefined concepts. We show that DISSECT produces CTs that (1) disentangle several concepts, (2) are influential to a classifier's decision and are coupled to its reasoning due to joint training (3), are realistic, (4) preserve relevant information, and (5) are stable across similar inputs. We validate DISSECT on several challenging synthetic and realistic datasets where previous methods fall short of satisfying desirable criteria for interpretability and show that it performs consistently well. Finally, we present experiments showing applications of DISSECT for detecting potential biases of a classifier and identifying spurious artifacts that impact predictions."}}

In this work, we show that explicitly quantifying the uncertainty in such settings has interpretability benefits. We use a simple modification of a classical network inference using Monte Carlo dropout to give measures of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. We identify a significant correlation between aleatoric uncertainty and human annotator disagreement (r\u2248.3). Additionally, we demonstrate how difficult and subjective training samples can be identified using aleatoric uncertainty and how epistemic uncertainty can reveal data bias that could result in unfair predictions. We identify the total uncertainty as a suitable surrogate for model calibration, i.e. the degree we can trust model's predicted confidence. In addition to explainability benefits, we observe modest performance boosts from incorporating model uncertainty."}}
