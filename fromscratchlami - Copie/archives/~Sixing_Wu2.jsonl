Nonetheless, previous Seq2Seq-based generative dialogue systems often generate safe but meaningless responses, such as \u2018I don't know\u2019 or \u2018I think so\u2019. To this end, researchers proposed to infuse external knowledge into dialogue generation, and such knowledge-enhanced methods have achieved remarkable improvements in the open-domain dialogue systems. External knowledge is an exogenous input, where the estrangement inevitably exists between knowledge and dialogue context. Although previous knowledge-enhanced works can already use commonsense knowledge to generate informative responses, they always use knowledge in a single-channel paradigm, which is hard to accurately handle different data-flows and then tends to generate irrational dialogue responses. Thus, they tend to be confused and generate strange responses when infusing the knowledge into dialogue generation, such as \u2018I just ate a basketball,\u2019 dramatically degrading the user experience. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Channel-Aware Knowledge Fusing</i> Network (CAKF). Rather than following the traditional single-channel paradigm, CAKF employs three unique channels to handle different data-flows more clearly and rationally: a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">base</i> channel serves like a vanilla Seq2Seq decoder; a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">context</i> channel to utilize the contextual information, and a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">knowledge</i> channel to infuse commonsense knowledge into the dialogue generation. Above such three channels, a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Sequential Manager</i> is built to maintain the global sequential decision state, aggregate the local data-flows, and make the final prediction.

To this end, researchers proposed to enhance dialogue generation by integrating external knowledge. Although such methods have achieved remarkable gains, the use of only single-source knowledge often makes existing knowledge-enhanced methods degenerate into traditional models in real scenarios because of the insufficient knowledge coverage of single-source knowledge. To improve the applicability of knowledge-enhanced methods, we propose two novel frameworks to use heterogeneous knowledge from multiple sources. We first propose an MHKD-Seq2Seq framework, which can use different heterogeneous knowledge by identifying abstract-level knowledge behaviors; meanwhile, a Diffuse-Aggregate scheme is used to process multiple knowledge simultaneously and produce a unified result. The next framework MHKD-ARPLM can leverage the advantages of pretrained language models with Knowledge Linearization techniques. In experiments, we collected dialogues from previously open-released datasets and built a multi-source knowledge-aligned dataset TriKE-Weibo, which involves three knowledge sources: commonsense, texts, and infobox tables. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the performance leadership of our approaches against competitive baseline models."}}

To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a novel infobox knowledge-aware dialogue generation approach, HITA-Graph, with three unique features. First, open-domain infobox tables that describe entities with relevant attributes are adopted as the knowledge source. An order-irrelevance Hierarchical Infobox Table Encoder is proposed to represent an infobox table at three levels of granularity. In addition, an Infobox-Dialogue Interaction Graph Network is built to effectively integrate the infobox context and the dialogue context into a unified infobox representation. Second, a Hierarchical Infobox Attribute Attention mechanism is developed to access the encoded infobox knowledge at different levels of granularity. Last but not least, a Dynamic Mode Fusion strategy is designed to allow the Decoder to select a vocabulary word or copy a word from the given infobox/query. We extract infobox tables from Chinese Wikipedia and construct an infobox knowledge base. Extensive evaluation on an open-released Chinese corpus demonstrates the superior performance of our approach against several representative methods."}}

This paper presents a dual adversarial learning framework for cross-lingual entity alignment, DAEA, with two original contributions. First, in order to address the structural and attribute feature inconsistency between entities in two knowledge graphs (KGs), an adversarial kernel embedding technique is proposed to extract graph-invariant information in an unsupervised manner, and project two KGs into the common embedding space. Second, in order to further improve successful rate of entity alignment, we propose to produce multiple random walks through each entity to be aligned and mask these entities in random walks. With the guidance of known aligned entities in the context of multiple random walks, an adversarial knowledge translation model is developed to fill and translate masked entities in pairwise random walks from two KGs. Extensive experiments performed on real-world datasets show that DAEA can well solve the feature inconsistency and sequence context unawareness issues and significantly outperforms thirteen state-of-the-art entity alignment methods."}}

However, noises in web data can disturb the training process, as well as can impact the performance. Consequently, dialogue models tend to be brittle when receiving noisy inputs during the inference. This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Path Training (MPT), for training a robust dialogue response generation system. MPT improves the robustness to the noisy training data and the noisy inference queries using three paths. Experimental results show MPT can outperform baselines using the same backbone model, and also prove MPT can improve the robustness to the noise in both the training and inference stage."}}

For alleviating this issue, Recent studies proposed to retrieve and introduce knowledge facts from knowledge graphs. While this paradigm works to a certain extent, it usually retrieves knowledge facts only based on the entity word itself, without considering the specific dialogue context. Thus, the introduction of the context-irrelevant knowledge facts can impact the quality of generations. To this end, this paper proposes a novel commonsense knowledge-aware dialogue generation model, ConKADI. We design a Felicitous Fact mechanism to help the model focus on the knowledge facts that are highly relevant to the context; furthermore, two techniques, Context-Knowledge Fusion and Flexible Mode Fusion are proposed to facilitate the integration of the knowledge in the ConKADI. We collect and build a large-scale Chinese dataset aligned with the commonsense knowledge for dialogue generation. Extensive evaluations over both an open-released English dataset and our Chinese dataset demonstrate that our approach ConKADI outperforms the state-of-the-art approach CCM, in most experiments."}}
