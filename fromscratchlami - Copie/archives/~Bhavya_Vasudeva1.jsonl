Most loss functions are designed by considering the distance between the embeddings to induce certain properties without exploring how such losses would impact the movement of the said embeddings via their gradients during optimization. In this work, we analyze the gradients of various ML loss functions and propose a gradient-based loss for ML (GradML). Instead of directly formulating the loss, we first formulate the gradients of the loss and use them to derive the loss to be optimized. It has a simple formulation and lowers the computational cost as compared to other methods. We evaluate our approach on three datasets and find that the performance is data-dependent on properties like inter-class variance."}}

Such approaches face different challenges and can lead to biased embeddings in the former case, and (i) harder optimization (ii) slower training speed (iii) higher model complexity in the latter case. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that looks for optimal hard negatives (LoOp) in the embedding space, taking full advantage of each tuple by calculating the minimum distance between a pair of positives and a pair of negatives. Unlike mining-based methods, our approach considers the entire space between pairs of embeddings to calculate the optimal hard negatives. Extensive experiments combining our approach and representative metric learning losses reveal a significant boost in performance on three benchmark datasets."}}

Although state-of-the-art deep learning based methods have been able to obtain fast, high-quality reconstruction of CS-MR images, their main drawback is that they treat complex-valued MRI data as real-valued entities. Most methods either extract the magnitude from the complex-valued entities or concatenate them as two real-valued channels. In both the cases, the phase content, which links the real and imaginary parts of the complex-valued entities, is discarded. In order to address the fundamental problem of real-valued deep networks, i.e. their inability to process complex-valued data, we propose a novel framework based on a complex-valued generative adversarial network (Co-VeGAN). Our model can process complex-valued input, which enables it to perform high-quality reconstruction of the CS-MR images. Further, considering that phase is a crucial component of complex-valued entities, we propose a novel complex-valued activation function, which is sensitive to the phase of the input. Extensive evaluation of the proposed approach on different datasets using various sampling masks demonstrates that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing CS-MRI reconstruction techniques in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio as well as structural similarity index. Further, it uses significantly fewer trainable parameters to do so, as compared to the real-valued deep learning based methods."}}
