A mathematical model based on Physarum\u2019s behavior, known as the Physarum Directed Dynamics, can solve positive linear programs. In this paper, we present a family of Physarum-based dynamics extending the previous work and introduce a new algorithm to solve positive Semi-Definite Programs (SDP). The Physarum dynamics are governed by orthogonal projections (w.r.t. timedependent scalar products) on the affine subspace defined by the linear constraints. We present a natural generalization of the scalar products used in the LP case to the matrix space for SDPs,\nwhich boils down to the linear case when all matrices in the SDP are diagonal, thus, representing an LP. We investigate the behavior of the induced dynamics theoretically and experimentally, highlight challenges arising from the non-commutative nature of matrix products, and prove soundness and convergence under mild conditions. Moreover, we consider a more abstract view on the dynamics that suggests a slight variation to guarantee unconditional soundness and convergence-to-optimality. By simulating these dynamics using suitable \ndiscretizations, one obtains numerical algorithms for solving positive SDPs, which have applications in discrete optimization, e.g., for computing the Goemans-Williamson approximation for MaxCut or the Lov\u00b4asz theta number for determining the clique/chromatic number in perfect graphs."}}
