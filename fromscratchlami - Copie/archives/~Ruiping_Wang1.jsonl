To equip AI system with the ability to understand dynamic ENVironments, we build a video Question Answering dataset named Env-QA. Env-QA contains 23K egocentric videos, where each video is composed of a series of events about exploring and in- teracting in the environment. It also provides 85K ques- tions to evaluate the ability of understanding the composi- tion, layout, and state changes of the environment presented by the events in videos. Moreover, we propose a video QA model, Temporal Segmentation and Event Attention network (TSEA), which introduces event-level video representation and corresponding attention mechanisms to better extract environment information and answer questions. Compre- hensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and show the formidable challenges of Env-QA in terms of long-term state tracking, multi-event temporal reasoning and event counting, etc."}}

Although ZSL has made great progress in recent years, most existing approaches are easy to overfit the sources classes in generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) task, which indicates that they learn little knowledge about target classes. To tackle such problem, we propose a novel Transferable Contrastive Network (TCN) that explicitly transfers knowledge from the source classes to the target classes. It automatically contrasts one image with different classes to judge whether they are consistent or not. By exploiting the class similarities to make knowledge transfer from source images to similar target classes, our approach is more robust to recognize the target images. Experiments on five benchmark datasets show the superiority of our approach for GZSL."}}

Recent studies mainly focus on two challenges. For one thing, such translation is inherently multimodal due to variations of domain-specific information (e.g., the domain of house cat has multiple fine-grained subcategories). For another, existing multimodal approaches have limitations in handling more than two domains, i.e. they have to independently build one model for every pair of domains. To address these problems, we propose the Hierarchical Image-to-image Translation (HIT) method which jointly formulates the multimodal and multi-domain problem in a semantic hierarchy structure, and can further control the uncertainty of multimodal. Specifically, we regard the domain-specific variations as the result of the multi-granularity property of domains, and one can control the granularity of the multimodal translation by dividing a domain with large variations into multiple subdomains which capture local and fine-grained variations. With the assumption of Gaussian prior, variations of domains are modeled in a common space such that translations can further be done among multiple domains within one model. To learn such complicated space, we propose to leverage the inclusion relation among domains to constrain distributions of parent and children to be nested. Experiments on several datasets validate the promising results and competitive performance against state-of-the-arts."}}

Disentangling such underlying primitives is the long objective of representation learning. It is observed that categories have the natural multi-granularity or hierarchical characteristics, i.e. any two objects can share some common primitives in a particular category granularity while they may possess their unique ones in another granularity. However, previous works usually operate in a flat manner (i.e. in a particular granularity) to disentangle the representations of objects. Though they may obtain the primitives to constitute objects as the categories in that granularity, their results are obviously not efficient and complete. In this paper, we propose the hierarchical disentangle network (HDN) to exploit the rich hierarchical characteristics among categories to divide the disentangling process in a coarse-to-fine manner, such that each level only focuses on learning the specific representations in its granularity and finally the common and unique representations in all granularities jointly constitute the raw object. Specifically, HDN is designed based on an encoder-decoder architecture. To simultaneously ensure the disentanglement and interpretability of the encoded representations, a novel hierarchical generative adversarial network (GAN) is elaborately designed. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on four object datasets validate the effectiveness of our method."}}

To alleviate this problem, we treat relationship as an abstract object, exploring not only significative visual pattern but contextual information for it, which are two key aspects when considering object recognition. Our observation on current datasets reveals that there exists intimate association among relationships. Therefore, inspired by the successful application of context to object-oriented tasks, we especially construct context for relationships where all of them are gathered so that the recognition could benefit from their association. Moreover, accurate recognition needs discriminative visual pattern for object, and so does relationship. In order to discover effective pattern for relationship, traditional relationship feature extraction methods such as using union region or combination of subject-object feature pairs are replaced with our proposed intersection region which focuses on more essential parts. Therefore, we present our so-called Relationship Context - InterSeCtion Region (CISC) method. Experiments for scene graph generation on Visual Genome dataset and visual relationship prediction on VRD dataset indicate that both the relationship context and intersection region improve performances and realize anticipated functions."}}

In this work we propose an object detection algorithm that not only considers object visual appearance, but also makes use of two kinds of context including scene contextual information and object relationships within a single image. Therefore, object detection is regarded as both a cognition problem and a reasoning problem when leveraging these structured information. Specifically, this paper formulates object detection as a problem of graph structure inference, where given an image the objects are treated as nodes in a graph and relationships between the objects are modeled as edges in such graph. To this end, we present a so-called Structure Inference Network (SIN), a detector that incorporates into a typical detection framework (e.g. Faster R-CNN) with a graphical model which aims to infer object state. Comprehensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets indicate that scene context and object relationships truly improve the performance of object detection with more desirable and reasonable outputs."}}

Recently most ZSL approaches focus on learning visual-semantic embeddings to transfer knowledge from the auxiliary datasets to the novel classes. However, few works study whether the semantic information is discriminative or not for the recognition task. To tackle such problem, we propose a coupled dictionary learning approach to align the visual-semantic structures using the class prototypes, where the discriminative information lying in the visual space is utilized to improve the less discriminative semantic space. Then, zero-shot recognition can be performed in different spaces by the simple nearest neighbor approach using the learned class prototypes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}

Taking sample covariance matrix as set model in the light of its recent promising success, we present a Discriminative Covariance oriented Representation Learning (DCRL) framework to bridge the above gap. The framework constructs a feature learning network (e.g. a CNN) to project the face images into a target representation space, and the network is trained towards the goal that the set covariance matrix calculated in the target space has maximum discriminative ability. To encode the discriminative ability of set covariance matrices, we elaborately design two different loss functions, which respectively lead to two different representation learning schemes, i.e., the Graph Embedding scheme and the Softmax Regression scheme. Both schemes optimize the whole network containing both image representation mapping and set model classification in a joint learning manner. The proposed method is extensively validated on three challenging and large scale databases for the task of face recognition with image sets, i.e., YouTube Celebrities, YouTube Face DB and Point-and-Shoot Challenge."}}

Considering the scale of modern datasets, hashing is favorable for its low complexity. However, most existing hashing methods are designed to preserve one single kind of similarity, thus incapable of dealing with the different tasks simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new hashing method, named Dual Purpose Hashing (DPH), which jointly preserves the category and attribute similarities by exploiting the convolutional networks (CNN) to hierarchically capture the correlations between category and attributes. Since images with both category and attribute labels are scarce, our method is designed to take the abundant partially labelled images on the Internet as training inputs. With such a framework, the binary codes of new-coming images can be readily obtained by quantizing the network outputs of a binary-like layer, and the attributes can be recovered from the codes easily. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show that our dual purpose hash codes can achieve comparable or even better performance than those state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for each individual retrieval task, while being more compact than the compared methods."}}

Moreover, attributes are often correlated with each other, which makes it less desirable to learn each attribute independently. In this paper, we propose to learn a latent attribute space, which is not only discriminative but also semantic-preserving, to perform the ZSL task. Specifically, a dictionary learning framework is exploited to connect the latent attribute space with attribute space and similarity space.
