BLaDE is a natural extension of Bootstrap Your Own Latents for Exploration (BYOL-Explore) which is a multi-step prediction-error method at the latent level that learns a world representation, the world dynamics,  and provides an intrinsic-reward all-together by optimizing a single prediction loss with no additional auxiliary objective.  Contrary to BYOL-Explore that predicts future latents from past latents and future open-loop actions, BLaDE predicts, via a diffusion model, future latents from past observations, future open-loop actions and a noisy version of future latents. Leaking information about future latents allows to control the variance of the distribution of future latents which makes the method agnostic to stochastic traps.  Our experiments on different noisy versions of Montezuma\u2019s Revenge show that BLaDE handles stochasticity better than Random Network Distillation, Intrinsic Curiosity Module and BYOL-Explore without degrading the performance of BYOL-Explore in the non-noisy and fairly deterministic Montezuma\u2019s Revenge."}}

BYOL-Explore learns the world representation, the world dynamics and the exploration policy all-together by optimizing a single prediction loss in the latent space with no additional auxiliary objective. We show that BYOL-Explore is effective in DM-HARD-8, a challenging partially-observable continuous-action hard-exploration benchmark with visually rich 3-D environment. On this benchmark, we solve the majority of the tasks purely through augmenting the extrinsic reward with BYOL-Explore intrinsic reward, whereas prior work could only get off the ground with human demonstrations. As further evidence of the generality of BYOL-Explore, we show that it achieves superhuman performance on the ten hardest exploration games in Atari while having a much simpler design than other competitive agents.

However, to achieve state-of-the-art performance, methods often need large numbers of negative examples and rely on complex augmentations.  This can be prohibitively expensive, especially for large graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce Bootstrapped Graph Latents (BGRL) - a graph representation learning method that learns by predicting alternative augmentations of the input. BGRL uses only simple augmentations and alleviates the need for contrasting with negative examples, and thus is scalable by design. BGRL outperforms or matches prior methods on several established benchmarks, while achieving a 2-10x reduction in memory costs. Furthermore, we show that BGRL can be scaled up to extremely large graphs with hundreds of millions of nodes in the semi-supervised regime, achieving state-of-the-art performance and improving over supervised baselines where representations are shaped only through label information.  In particular, our solution centered on BGRL constituted one of the winning entries to the Open Graph Benchmark -Large Scale Challenge at KDD Cup 2021, on a graph orders of magnitudes larger than all previously available benchmarks, thus demonstrating the scalability and effectiveness of our approach."}}

As such, they heavily depend on the construction of augmentations and negative examples. Increasing the number of negative pairs improves performance, thereby requiring quadratic computation and memory cost to achieve peak performance. Inspired by BYOL, a recently introduced method for self-supervised learning that does not require negative pairs, we present Bootstrapped Graph Latents, BGRL, a self-supervised graph representation method that gets rid of this potentially quadratic bottleneck. BGRL outperforms or matches the previous unsupervised state-of-the-art results on several established benchmarks. Moreover, it enables the effective usage of graph attentional (GAT) encoders, allowing us to further improve the state of the art, in particular achieving 70.49% Micro-F1 on the PPI dataset using the linear evaluation protocol."}}

Given a domain-specific language (DSL), a dataset is multimodal if there is no single program in the DSL that generalizes over all the examples. Further, even if the examples in the dataset were generalized in terms of a set of programs, the domains of these programs may not be disjoint, thereby leading to ambiguity in synthesis. MultiSynth is a framework that incorporates concepts of synthesizing programs with minimum generality, while addressing the need of accurate prediction. We show how these can be achieved through (i) transformation driven partitioning of the dataset, (ii) least general generalization, for a generalized specification of the input and the output, and (iii) learning to rank, for estimating feature weights in order to map an input to the most appropriate mode in case of ambiguity. We show the effectiveness of our framework in two domains: in the first case, we extend an existing approach for synthesizing programs for XML tree transformations to ambiguous multimodal datasets. In the second case, MultiSynth is used to preorder words for machine translation, by learning permutations of productions in the parse trees of the source side sentences. Our evaluations reflect the effectiveness of our approach."}}
