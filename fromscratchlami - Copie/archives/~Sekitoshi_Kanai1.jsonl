While it has a wide range of applications in machine learning, in some cases the sampled data from only one of the domains will have class labels such as unsupervised domain adaptation. In this kind of problem setting, a group-sparse regularizer is frequently leveraged as a regularization term to handle class labels. In particular, it can preserve the label structure on the data samples by corresponding the data samples with the same class label to one group-sparse regularization term. As a result, we can measure the distance while utilizing label information by solving the regularized optimization problem with gradient-based algorithms. However, the gradient computation is expensive when the number of classes or data samples is large because the number of regularization terms and their respective sizes also turn out to be large. This paper proposes fast discrete OT with group-sparse regularizers. Our method is based on two ideas. The first is to safely skip the computations of the gradients that must be zero. The second is to efficiently extract the gradients that are expected to be nonzero. Our method is guaranteed to return the same value of the objective function as that of the original method. Experiments show that our method is up to 8.6 times faster than the original method without degrading accuracy."}}

To enhance its performance, recent methods impose high weights on the cross-entropy loss for important data points near the decision boundary. However, these importance-aware methods are vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, e.g., Auto-Attack. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the cause of their vulnerability via margins between logits for the true label and the other labels because they should be large enough to prevent the largest logit from being flipped by the attacks. Our experiments reveal that the histogram of the logit margins of naive adversarial training has two peaks. Thus, the levels of difficulty in increasing logit margins are roughly divided into two: difficult samples (small logit margins) and easy samples (large logit margins). On the other hand, only one peak near zero appears in the histogram of importance-aware methods, i.e., they reduce the logit margins of easy samples. To increase logit margins of difficult samples without reducing those of easy samples, we propose switching one-versus-the-rest loss (SOVR), which switches from cross-entropy to one-versus-the-rest loss (OVR) for difficult samples. We derive trajectories of logit margins for a simple problem and prove that OVR increases logit margins two times larger than the weighted cross-entropy loss. Thus, SOVR increases logit margins of difficult samples, unlike existing methods. We experimentally show that SOVR achieves better robustness against Auto-Attack than importance-aware methods."}}

Since adversarial training has difficulties, e.g., necessity of high model capacity, focusing on important data points by weighting cross-entropy loss has attracted much attention. However, they are vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, e.g., Auto-Attack. This paper experimentally reveals that the cause of their vulnerability is their small margins between logits for the true label and the other labels. Since neural networks classify the data points based on the logits, logit margins should be large enough to avoid flipping the largest logit by the attacks. Importance-aware methods do not increase logit margins of important samples but decrease those of less-important samples compared with cross-entropy loss. To increase logit margins of important samples, we propose switching one-vs-the-rest loss (SOVR), which switches from cross-entropy to one-vs-the-rest loss for important samples that have small logit margins. We prove that one-vs-the-rest loss increases logit margins two times larger than the weighted cross-entropy loss for a simple problem.

However, it is difficult to train gates to capture extremely long time scales due to gradient vanishing of the bounded function for large inputs, which is known as the saturation problem. We closely analyze the relation between saturation of the gate function and efficiency of the training. We prove that the gradient vanishing of the gate function can be mitigated by accelerating the convergence of the saturating function, i.e., making the output of the function converge to 0 or 1 faster. Based on the analysis results, we propose a gate function called fast gate that has a doubly exponential convergence rate with respect to inputs by simple function composition. We empirically show that our method outperforms previous methods in accuracy and computational efficiency on benchmark tasks involving extremely long time scales."}}

However, it does not work well in case of insufficient data points. To improve the performance in such situations, the conditional VAE (CVAE) is widely used, which aims to share task-invariant knowledge with multiple tasks through the task-invariant latent variable. In the CVAE, the posterior of the latent variable given the data point and task is regularized by the task-invariant prior, which is modeled by the standard Gaussian distribution. Although this regularization encourages independence between the latent variable and task, the latent variable remains dependent on the task. To reduce this task-dependency, the previous work introduced an additional regularizer. However, its learned representation does not work well on the target tasks. In this study, we theoretically investigate why the CVAE cannot sufficiently reduce the task-dependency and show that the simple standard Gaussian prior is one of the causes. Based on this, we propose a theoretical optimal prior for reducing the task-dependency. In addition, we theoretically show that unlike the previous work, our learned representation works well on the target tasks. Experiments on various datasets show that our approach obtains better task-invariant representations, which improves the performances of various downstream applications such as density estimation and classification."}}

Although Rotation captures information of object shapes, it hardly captures information of textures. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel pretext-task called image enhanced rotation prediction (IE-Rot) for SSL. IE-Rot simultaneously solves Rotation and another pretext-task based on image enhancement (e.g., sharpening and solarizing) while maintaining simplicity. Through the simultaneous prediction of rotation and image enhancement, models learn representations to capture the information of not only object shapes but also textures. Our experimental results show that IE-Rot models outperform Rotation on various standard benchmarks including ImageNet classification, PASCAL-VOC detection, and COCO detection/segmentation."}}
