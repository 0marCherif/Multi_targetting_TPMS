Starting from random noise, such text-to-image diffusion models gradually synthesize images in an iterative fashion while conditioning on text prompts. We find that their synthesis behavior qualitatively changes throughout this process: Early in sampling, generation strongly relies on the text prompt to generate text-aligned content, while later, the text conditioning is almost entirely ignored. This suggests that sharing model parameters throughout the entire generation process may not be ideal. Therefore, in contrast to existing works, we propose to train an ensemble of text-to-image diffusion models specialized for different synthesis stages. To maintain training efficiency, we initially train a single model, which is then split into specialized models that are trained for the specific stages of the iterative generation process. Our ensemble of diffusion models, called eDiff-I, results in improved text alignment while maintaining the same inference computation cost and preserving high visual quality, outperforming previous large-scale text-to-image diffusion models on the standard benchmark. In addition, we train our model to exploit a variety of embeddings for conditioning, including the T5 text, CLIP text, and CLIP image embeddings. We show that these different embeddings lead to different behaviors. Notably, the CLIP image embedding allows an intuitive way of transferring the style of a reference image to the target text-to-image output. Lastly, we show a technique that enables eDiff-I's \"paint-with-words\" capability. A user can select the word in the input text and paint it in a canvas to control the output, which is very handy for crafting the desired image in mind.

To this end, for a subset of ImageNet samples, we collect segmentation masks for the entire object and 18 informative attributes. We call this dataset RIVAL10 (RIch Visual Attributes with Localization), consisting of roughly 26k instances over 10 classes. Using RIVAL10, we evaluate the sensitivity of a broad set of models to noise corruptions in foregrounds, backgrounds and attributes. In our analysis, we consider diverse state-of-the-art architectures (ResNets, Transformers) and training procedures (CLIP, SimCLR, DeiT, Adversarial Training). We find that, somewhat surprisingly, in ResNets, adversarial training makes models more sensitive to the background compared to foreground than standard training. Similarly, contrastively-trained models also have lower relative foreground sensitivity in both transformers and ResNets. Lastly, we observe intriguing adaptive abilities of transformers to increase relative foreground sensitivity as corruption level increases. Using saliency methods, we automatically discover spurious features that drive the background sensitivity of models and assess alignment of saliency maps with foregrounds. Finally, we quantitatively study the attribution problem for neural features by comparing feature saliency with ground-truth localization of semantic attributes."}}

Current contrastive learning approaches, however, are only effective when trained on a particular dataset, limiting their utility in diverse multi-domain settings. In fact, training these methods on a combination of several domains often degrades the quality of learned representations compared to the models trained on a single domain. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Domain Self-Supervised Learning (MDSSL) approach that can effectively perform representation learning on multiple, diverse datasets. In MDSSL, we propose a three-level hierarchical loss for measuring the agreement between augmented views of a given sample, agreement between samples within a dataset and agreement between samples across datasets. We show that MDSSL when trained on a mixture of CIFAR-10, STL-10, SVHN and CIFAR-100 produces powerful representations, achieving up to a $25\\%$ increase in top-1 accuracy on a linear classifier compared to single-domain self-supervised encoders. Moreover, MDSSL encoders can generalize more effectively to unseen datasets compared to both single-domain and multi-domain baselines. MDSSL is also highly efficient in terms of the resource usage as it stores and trains a single model for multiple datasets leading up to $17\\%$ reduction in training time. Finally, for multi-domain datasets where domain labels are unknown, we propose a modified approach that alternates between clustering and MDSSL. Thus, for diverse multi-domain datasets (even without domain labels), MDSSL provides an efficient and generalizable self-supervised encoder without sacrificing the quality of representations in individual domains.

Indeed, most successful GANs used in practice are trained using overparameterized generator and discriminator networks, both in terms of depth and width. A large body of work in supervised learning have shown the importance of model overparameterization in the convergence of the gradient descent (GD) to globally optimal solutions. In contrast, the unsupervised setting and GANs in particular involve non-convex concave mini-max optimization problems that are often trained using Gradient Descent/Ascent (GDA).\nThe role and benefits of model overparameterization in the convergence of GDA to a global saddle point in non-convex concave problems is far less understood. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the importance of model overparameterization in GANs both theoretically and empirically. We theoretically show that in an overparameterized GAN model with a $1$-layer neural network generator and a linear discriminator, GDA converges to a global saddle point of the underlying non-convex concave min-max problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result for global convergence of GDA in such settings. Our theory is based on a more general result that holds for a broader class of nonlinear generators and discriminators that obey certain assumptions (including deeper generators and random feature discriminators). Our theory utilizes and builds upon a novel connection with the convergence analysis of linear time-varying dynamical systems which may have broader implications for understanding the convergence behavior of GDA for non-convex concave problems involving overparameterized models. We also empirically study the role of model overparameterization in GANs using several large-scale experiments on CIFAR-10 and Celeb-A datasets. Our experiments show that overparameterization improves the quality of generated samples across various model architectures and datasets. Remarkably, we observe that overparameterization leads to faster and more stable convergence behavior of GDA across the board."}}

Among multiple state-of-the-art methods, we found vanilla experience replay (ER) still very competitive in terms of both performance and scalability, despite its simplicity.\nHowever, a degraded performance is observed for ER with small memory. A further visualization of the feature space reveals that the intermediate representation undergoes a distributional drift.\nWhile existing methods usually replay only the input-output pairs, we hypothesize that their regularization effect is inadequate for complex deep models and diverse tasks with small replay buffer size. Following this observation, we propose to replay the activation of the intermediate layers in addition to the input-output pairs. Considering that saving raw activation maps can dramatically increase memory and compute cost, we propose the Compressed Activation Replay technique, where compressed representations of layer activation are saved to the replay buffer. We show that this approach can achieve superior regularization effect while adding negligible memory overhead to replay method. Experiments on both the large-scale Taskonomy benchmark with a diverse set of tasks and standard common datasets (Split-CIFAR and Split-miniImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}}

Despite its success as a defense mechanism, adversarial training fails to generalize well to unperturbed test set. We hypothesize that this poor generalization is a consequence of adversarial training with uniform perturbation radius around every training sample. Samples close to decision boundary can be morphed into a different class under a small perturbation budget, and enforcing large margins around these samples produce poor decision boundaries that generalize poorly. Motivated by this hypothesis, we propose instance adaptive adversarial training -- a technique that enforces sample-specific perturbation margins around every training sample. We show that using our approach, test accuracy on unperturbed samples improve with a marginal drop in robustness. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Imagenet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."}}
