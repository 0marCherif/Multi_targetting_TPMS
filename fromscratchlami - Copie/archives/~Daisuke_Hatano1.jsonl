In this paper, we study the problem with the cardinality constraint that the number of assets in a portfolio is restricted to be at most k, and consider two scenarios: (i) in the full-feedback setting, the learner can observe price relatives (rates of return to cost) for all assets, and (ii) in the bandit-feedback setting, the learner can observe price relatives only for invested assets. We propose efficient algorithms for these scenarios that achieve sublinear regrets. We also provide regret (statistical) lower bounds for both scenarios which nearly match the upper bounds when k is a constant. In addition, we give a computational lower bound which implies that no algorithm maintains both computational efficiency, as well as a small regret upper bound."}}

In real-world applications, however, multiple scenarios could exist, each of which determines a characteristic function, and which scenario is more important is unknown. To handle such situations, the notion of multi-scenario cooperative games and several solution concepts have been proposed. However, computing the value divisions in those solution concepts is intractable in general. To resolve this issue, we focus on supermodular two-scenario cooperative games in which the number of scenarios is two and the characteristic functions are supermodular and study the computational aspects of a major solution concept called the preference core. First, we show that we can compute the value division in the preference core of a supermodular two-scenario game in polynomial time. Then, we reveal the relations among preference cores with different parameters. Finally, we provide more efficient algorithms for deciding the non-emptiness of the preference core for several specific supermodular two-scenario cooperative games such as the airport game, multicast tree game, and a special case of the generalized induced subgraph game."}}

Viewing tensors with hypergraphs, we propose formulating the co-clustering of a tensor as a problem of partitioning the corresponding hypergraph. Our algorithm is based on the random sampling technique, which has been successfully applied to graph cut problems. We extend a random sampling algorithm for the graph multiwaycut problem to hypergraphs, and design a co-clustering algorithm based on it. Each iteration of our algorithm runs in polynomial on the size of hypergraphs, and thus it performs well even for higher-order tensors, which are difficult to deal with for state-of-the-art algorithm."}}

This concept is formalized as the notion of the core.To obtain a value division that motivates players to cooperate to a greater extent or that is more robust under noise, the notions of the strong least core and the weak least core have been considered. In this paper, we characterize the strong and the weak least cores of supermodular cooperative games using the theory of minimizing crossing submodular functions. We then apply our characterizations to two representative supermodular cooperative games, namely, the induced subgraph game generalized to hypergraphs and the airport game. For these games, we derive explicit forms of the strong and weak least core values, and provide polynomial-time algorithms that compute value divisions in the strong and weak least cores."}}

Despite its importance in many practical applications, it has been recently shown that there is no polynomial-time sublinear-regret algorithm unless NP$\\subseteq$BPP, and only an exponential-time sublinear-regret algorithm has been found. In this paper, we introduce mild assumptions to solve the problem. Under these assumptions, we present polynomial-time sublinear-regret algorithms for the online sparse linear regression. In addition, thorough experiments with publicly available data demonstrate that our algorithms outperform other known algorithms."}}

In the problem, an advertiser has limited budgets to allocate across media, and seeks to optimize the allocation such that the largest fraction of customers can be influenced. It is known that this problem admits a (1-1/e)-approximation algorithm. However, no previous studies on this problem considered adjusting the allocation adaptively based upon the effect of the past campaigns, which is a usual strategy in the real setting. Our main contribution in this paper is to analyze adaptive strategies for the budget allocation problem. We define a greedy strategy, referred to as the insensitive policy, and then give a provable performance guarantee. This result is obtained by extending the adaptive submodularity, which is a concept studied in the context of active learning and stochastic optimization, to the functions over an integer lattice."}}

We propose two methods for searching the extended domain for good assignments. The first one relaxes the problem using linear programming, finds the optimum LP solution, and rounds it to an assignment. The second one plays a cost-minimization game, finds a certain kind of equilibrium, and rounds it to an assignment. Both methods are realized by performing the multiplicative weights method in a distributed manner. We experimentally demonstrate that our methods have good scalability, and in particular, the second method outperforms existing algorithms in terms of solution quality and efficiency."}}

The objective of the problem is to find an allocation such that each advertiser can influence some given number of customers while the slots of marketing channels are limited.\r\n\r\nWe propose an algorithm based on the Lagrangian decomposition.

DeQED is based on the Divide-and-Coordinate (DaC) framework, where the agents repeatedly solve their updated local sub-problems (the divide stage) and exchange coordination information that causes them to update their local sub-problems (the coordinate stage). Unlike other DaC-based DCOP algorithms, DeQED does not essentially increase the complexity of local subproblems and allows agents to avoid exchanging (primal) variable values in the coordinate stage. Our experimental results show that DeQED significantly outperformed other incomplete DCOP algorithms for both random and structured instances."}}
