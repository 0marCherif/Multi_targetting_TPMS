We present a BQ reformulation of these problems and introduce a simple attention-based policy network that we train by imitation of (near) optimal solutions for small instances from a single distribution. \nWe obtain new state-of-the-art generalization results for instances with up to 1000 nodes from synthetic and realistic benchmarks that vary both in size and node distributions."}}

It is often the case when the objective function is itself the output of an optimization solver, as for large-scale energy optimization problems tackled by decomposition. In this paper, we study how to incorporate the uncontrolled linearizations into (proximal and level) bundle algorithms in view of generating better iterates and possibly accelerating the methods. We provide the convergence analysis of the algorithms using uncontrolled linearizations, and we present numerical illustrations showing they indeed speed up resolution of two stochastic optimization problems coming from energy optimization (two-stage linear problems and chance-constrained problems in reservoir management)."}}

This generalization can be used to model virtual machine placement problems and in particular to build feasible solutions for the machine reassignment problem. We propose several families of greedy heuristics for this problem and show that they are flexible and can be adapted to handle additional constraints. We present structural properties of the machine reassignment problem, that allow us to decompose it into smaller subproblems and adapt our heuristics to them. We evaluate our heuristics on academic benchmarks of the vector bin packing problem, a randomly generated vector bin packing problem with heterogeneous bins benchmark as well as Google\u2019s realistic instances of the machine reassignment problem."}}

The dual problem consists then in finding the best Lagrangian multiplier (the optimal \u201cprice\u201d); it is solved by a convex nonsmooth optimization method. Realistic modeling of technical production constraints makes the subproblems themselves difficult to solve exactly. Nonsmooth optimization algorithms can cope with inexact solutions of the subproblems. In this case however, we observe that the computed dual solutions show a noisy and unstable behaviour, that could prevent their use as price indicators. In this paper, we present a simple and easy-to-implement way to stabilize dual optimal solutions, by penalizing the noisy behaviour of the prices in the dual objective. After studying the impact of a general stabilization term on the model and the resolution scheme, we focus on the penalization by discrete total variation, showing the consistency of the approach. We illustrate our stabilization on a synthetic example, and real-life problems from EDF (the French Electricity Board)."}}

Using ticket validation\ndata to construct a realistic scenario-based model of the waiting times, our goal is to design shifts of the current schedules that reduce the overall expected waiting time. We propose a parallel local search heuristic that exploits the structure of the problem to efficiently explore a large number of possible schedules. Compared to previous approaches, our algorithm should allow to both treat more transfers (bigger cities) and more scenarios (ensuring a better generalization). We provide promising preliminary results on transit data collected from Nancy, France."}}
