This can be beneficial for developing mental health support systems and for understanding the symptoms of depression. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is an instrument that healthcare professionals widely use to assess and monitor symptoms of depression. However, most existing models only consider capturing semantic information from posts, without considering PHQ-9 descriptive information related to symptoms. In addition, they are not devised to capture features that are specific to each symptom, especially in the case of multi-label symptoms identification. To tackle these challenges, we present a Span-based PHQ-aware and similarity contrastive network (SpanPHQ). We first adopt a novel span-based framework casting depressive symptoms identification task as a span-prediction problem. Then, we introduce context-aware and PHQ-aware self-guided cross-attention modules to enhance the model\u2019s ability to consider both semantic contextual information and PHQ-9 descriptive information. Besides, a similarity contrastive learning is designed to effectively utilise the label information in identifying class-specific features. Our model is evaluated on two depressive symptoms identification datasets, i.e., the D2S dataset with 1,850 Twitter posts and the PRIMATE dataset with 2,000 Reddit posts. Moreover, our model achieves competitive performance compared to existing models on both datasets, with macro-F1 of 63.22%, 68.84%, micro-F1 of 73.34%, 75.92%, weighted-F1 of 72.86%, 76.65%, JacS of 69.94%, 63.82% and HamL of 0.0665, 0.1832 on these two datasets, respectively. The ablation study further provides evidence of the effectiveness of each module we proposed. Furthermore, we include visualisations and case studies verifying the ability of our model to learn PHQ information and its superior performance over existing baselines. Our work is expected to help the future identification and analysis of depressive symptoms on social media."}}

Therefore, existing works train the model to generate the response of the target utterance, which aims to recognise emotions leveraging contextual information. However, adjacent response generation ignores long-range dependencies and provides limited affective information in many cases. In addition, most ERC models learn a unified distributed representation for each utterance, which lacks interpretability and robustness. To address these issues, we propose a VAD -disentangled V ariational A uto E ncoder (VAD-VAE), which first introduces a target utterance reconstruction task based on Variational Autoencoder, then disentangles three affect representations Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) from the latent space. We also enhance the disentangled representations by introducing VAD supervision signals from a sentiment lexicon and minimising the mutual information between VAD distributions. Experiments show that VAD-VAE outperforms the state-of-the-art model on two datasets. Further analysis proves the effectiveness of each proposed module and the quality of disentangled VAD representations. The code is available at https://github.com/SteveKGYang/VAD-VAE ."}}

Some works utilise Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) which uses categorical emotion labels as supervision signals and contrasts in high-dimensional semantic space. However, categorical labels fail to provide quantitative information between emotions. ERC is also not equally dependent on all embedded features in the semantic space, which makes the high-dimensional SCL inefficient. To address these issues, we propose a novel low-dimensional Supervised Cluster-level Contrastive Learning (SCCL) method, which first reduces the high-dimensional SCL space to a three-dimensional affect representation space Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD), then performs cluster-level contrastive learning to incorporate measurable emotion prototypes. To help modelling the dialogue and enriching the context, we leverage the pre-trained knowledge adapters to infuse linguistic and factual knowledge. Experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results with 69.81% on IEMOCAP, 65.7% on MELD, and 62.51% on DailyDialog datasets. The analysis also proves that the VAD space is not only suitable for ERC but also interpretable, with VAD prototypes enhancing its performance and stabilising the training of SCCL. In addition, the pre-trained knowledge adapters benefit the performance of the utterance encoder and SCCL. Our code is available at: https://github.com/SteveKGYang/SCCL"}}

Social media provide a platform for people to discuss health concerns, living conditions, and policies during the epidemic, allowing policymakers to use this content to analyze the public emotions and attitudes for decision-making.\n\nObjective:\nThe aim of this study was to use deep learning\u2013based methods to understand public emotions on topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom through a comparative geolocation and text mining analysis on Twitter.\n\nMethods:\nOver 500,000 tweets related to COVID-19 from 48 different cities in the United Kingdom were extracted, with the data covering the period of the last 2 years (from February 2020 to November 2021). We leveraged three advanced deep learning\u2013based models for topic modeling to geospatially analyze the sentiment, emotion, and topics of tweets in the United Kingdom: SenticNet 6 for sentiment analysis, SpanEmo for emotion recognition, and combined topic modeling (CTM).\n\nResults:\nWe observed a significant change in the number of tweets as the epidemiological situation and vaccination situation shifted over the 2 years. There was a sharp increase in the number of tweets from January 2020 to February 2020 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom. Then, the number of tweets gradually declined as of February 2020. Moreover, with identification of the COVID-19 Omicron variant in the United Kingdom in November 2021, the number of tweets grew again. Our findings reveal people\u2019s attitudes and emotions toward topics related to COVID-19. For sentiment, approximately 60% of tweets were positive, 20% were neutral, and 20% were negative. For emotion, people tended to express highly positive emotions in the beginning of 2020, while expressing highly negative emotions over time toward the end of 2021. The topics also changed during the pandemic.\n\nConclusions:\nThrough large-scale text mining of Twitter, our study found meaningful differences in public emotions and topics regarding the COVID-19 pandemic among different UK cities. Furthermore, efficient location-based and time-based comparative analysis can be used to track people\u2019s thoughts and feelings, and to understand their behaviors. Based on our analysis, positive attitudes were common during the pandemic; optimism and anticipation were the dominant emotions. With the outbreak and epidemiological change, the government developed control measures and vaccination policies, and the topics also shifted over time. Overall, the proportion and expressions of emojis, sentiments, emotions, and topics varied geographically and temporally. Therefore, our approach of exploring public emotions and topics on the pandemic from Twitter can potentially lead to informing how public policies are received in a particular geographical area."}}

Existing methods mainly model the mental states of the post speaker implicitly. They also lack the ability to mentalise for complex mental state reasoning. Besides, they are not designed to explicitly capture class-specific features. To resolve the above issues, we propose a mental state Knowledge\u2013aware and Contrastive Network (KC-Net). In detail, we first extract mental state knowledge from a commonsense knowledge base COMET, and infuse the knowledge using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to explicitly model the mental states of the speaker. Then we propose a knowledge\u2013aware mentalisation module based on dot-product attention to accordingly attend to the most relevant knowledge aspects. A supervised contrastive learning module is also utilised to fully leverage label information for capturing class-specific features. We test the proposed methods on a depression detection dataset Depression_Mixed with 3165 Reddit and blog posts, a stress detection dataset Dreaddit with 3553 Reddit posts, and a stress factors recognition dataset SAD with 6850 SMS-like messages. The experimental results show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all datasets: 95.4% of F1 scores on Depression_Mixed, 83.5% on Dreaddit and 77.8% on SAD, with 2.07% average improvement. Factor-specific analysis and ablation study prove the effectiveness of all proposed modules, while UMAP analysis and case study visualise their mechanisms. We believe our work facilitates detection and analysis of depression and stress on social media data, and shows potential for applications on other mental health conditions."}}

Recently, graph neural networks are applied on dependency graph to promote the performance of DDI extraction with better semantic representations. However, current method concentrates more on first-order dependency relations and cannot discriminate the connected nodes properly. To better incorporate the dependency relations and improve the representations, we propose a novel DDI extraction method named Drug-drug Interactions extRaction with Enhanced Dependency Graph and Attention Mechanism in this work. Specifically, the dependency graph is enhanced with some potential long-range words to complete the semantic information and fit the aggregation process of graph neural networks. And graph attention mechanism is adopted to further improve word representation by discriminating the connected nodes according to the specific task. Numerical experiments on DDIExtraction 2013 corpus, the benchmark corpus for this domain, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method."}}
