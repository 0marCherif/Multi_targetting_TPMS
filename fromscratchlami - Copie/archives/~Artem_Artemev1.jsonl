Gaussian processes (GPs) provide uncertainty estimates and a marginal likelihood objective, but their weak inductive biases lead to inferior accuracy. This has limited their applicability in certain tasks (e.g. image classification). We propose a translation insensitive convolutional kernel, which relaxes the translation invariance constraint imposed by previous convolutional GPs. We show how we can use the marginal likelihood to learn the degree of insensitivity. We also reformulate GP image-to-image convolutional mappings as multi-output GPs, leading to deep convolutional GPs. We show experimentally that our new kernel improves performance in both single-layer and deep models. We also demonstrate that our fully Bayesian approach improves on dropout-based Bayesian deep learning methods in terms of uncertainty and marginal likelihood estimates. "}}

We show that approximate maximum likelihood learning of model parameters by maximising our lower bound retains many benefits of the sparse variational approach while reducing the bias introduced into hyperparameter learning. The basis of our bound is a more careful analysis of the log-determinant term appearing in the log marginal likelihood, as well as using the method of conjugate gradients to derive tight lower bounds on the term involving a quadratic form. Our approach is a step forward in unifying methods relying on lower bound maximisation (e.g. variational methods) and iterative approaches based on conjugate gradients for training Gaussian processes. In experiments, we show improved predictive performance with our model for a comparable amount of training time compared to other conjugate gradient based approaches."}}

However, by prioritising speed, they often neglect memory requirements. As a consequence, the implementations of memory-intensive algorithms that are convenient in terms of software design can often not be run for large problems due to memory overflows. Memory-efficient solutions require complex programming approaches with significant logic outside the computational framework. This impairs the adoption and use of such algorithms. To address this, we developed an XLA compiler extension that adjusts the computational data-flow representation of an algorithm according to a user-specified memory limit. We show that k-nearest neighbour, sparse Gaussian process regression methods and Transformers can be run on a single device at a much larger scale, where standard implementations would have failed. Our approach leads to better use of hardware resources. We believe that further focus on removing memory constraints at a compiler level will widen the range of machine learning methods that can be developed in the future."}}

We suggest a method that adaptively selects the amount of computation to use when estimating the log marginal likelihood so that the bias of the objective function is guaranteed to be small. While in principle a simple modification of existing approximations, our current implementation of the method is not computationally competitive with these existing approximations, limiting its applicability."}}

In order to improve the utility of GPs we need a modular system that allows rapid implementation and testing, as seen in the neural network community. We present a mathematical and software framework for scalable approximate inference in GPs, which combines interdomain approximations and multiple outputs. Our framework, implemented in GPflow, provides a unified interface for many existing multioutput models, as well as more recent convolutional structures. This simplifies the creation of deep models with GPs, and we hope that this work will encourage more interest in this approach. "}}

Furthermore, we provide the natural gradient formulation for the proposed variational parameterisation.Finally, this work makes it possible to use the state-space formulation inside deep Gaussian process models as illustrated in one of the experiments.
