Temporally consistent 3D deformations are estimated without the need for dense correspondences at training time, by exploiting cycle consistency. Besides its ability to learn dense correspondences, GNPMs also enable latent-space manipulations such as interpolation and shape/pose transfer. We evaluate GNPMs on various datasets of clothed humans, and show that it achieves comparable performance to state of the art methods that require dense correspondences during training."}}

They have been successfully applied in the medical domain where symmetries in the data can be effectively exploited to build more accurate and robust models. To be able to reach a much larger body of patients, mobile, on-device implementations of deep learning solutions have been developed for medical applications. However, equivariant models are commonly implemented using large and computationally expensive architectures, not suitable to run on mobile devices. In this work, we design and test an equivariant version of MobileNetV2 and further optimize it with model quantization to enable more efficient inference. We achieve close-to state of the art performance on the Patch Camelyon (PCam) medical dataset while being more computationally efficient."}}
