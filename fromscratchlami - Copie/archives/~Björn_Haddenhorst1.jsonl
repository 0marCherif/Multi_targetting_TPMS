The action is to choose a set of arms, whereupon feedback for each arm in the chosen set is received. Unlike existing works, we study this problem in a non-stochastic setting with subset-dependent feedback, i.e., the semi-bandit feedback received could be generated by an oblivious adversary and also might depend on the chosen set of arms. In addition, we consider a general feedback scenario covering both the numerical-based as well as preference-based case and introduce a sound theoretical framework for this setting guaranteeing sensible notions of optimal arms, which a learner seeks to find. We suggest a generic algorithm suitable to cover the full spectrum of conceivable arm elimination strategies from aggressive to conservative. Theoretical questions about the sufficient and necessary budget of the algorithm to find the best arm are answered and complemented by deriving lower bounds for any learning algorithm for this problem scenario."}}

In this paper, we investigate the problem of testing different forms of stochastic transitivity in an online manner. We derive lower bounds on the expected sample complexity of any sequential hypothesis testing algorithm for various forms of stochastic transitivity, thereby providing additional motivation to focus on weak stochastic transitivity. To this end, we introduce an algorithmic framework for the dueling bandits problem, in which the statistical validity of weak stochastic transitivity can be tested, either actively or passively, based on a multiple binomial hypothesis test. Moreover, by exploiting a connection between weak stochastic transitivity and graph theory, we suggest an enhancement to further improve the efficiency of the testing algorithm.

{"id": "PdEKnJoeE0d", "cdate": 1649227145390, "mdate": 1649227145390, "content": {"title": "Testification of Condorcet Winners in dueling bandits", "abstract": "Several algorithms for finding the best arm in the dueling bandits setting assume the existence of a Condorcet winner (CW), that is, an arm that uniformly dominates all other arms. Yet, by simply relying on this assumption but not verifying it, such algorithms may produce doubtful results in cases where it actually fails to hold. Even worse, the problem may not be noticed, and an alleged CW still be produced. In this paper, we therefore address the problem as a \u201dtestification\u201d task, by which we mean a combination of testing and identification: The online identification of the CW is combined with the statistical testing of the CW assumption. Thus, instead of returning a supposed CW at some point, the learner has the possibility to stop sampling and refuse an answer in case it feels confident that the CW assumption is violated. Analyzing the testification problem formally, we derive lower bounds on the expected sample complexity of any online algorithm solving it. Moreover, a concrete algorithm is proposed, which achieves the optimal sample complexity up to logarithmic terms. "}}
