Under this paradigm, we have several clients, each of them having a myopic view, i.e., observing a small subgraph of the network. Each client sends a censored evidence graph to a central server. We provide an efficient algorithm, which computes a consensus signed weighted graph from clients evidence, and recovers the underlying network structure in the central server. We analyze the topological structure conditions of the network, as well as the signal and noise levels of the clients that allow for recovery of the network structure. Our analysis shows that exact recovery is possible and can be achieved in polynomial time. We also provide information-theoretic limits for the central server to recover the network structure from any single client evidence. Finally, as a byproduct of our analysis, we provide a novel Cheeger-type inequality for general signed weighted graphs."}}

For a given undirected connected graph, we tackle the statistical problem of exactly recovering an unknown ground-truth binary labeling of the nodes from a single corrupted observation of each edge. Such problem can be formulated as a quadratic combinatorial optimization problem over the boolean hypercube, where it has been shown before that one can (with high probability and in polynomial time) exactly recover the ground-truth labeling of graphs that have an isoperimetric number that grows with respect to the number of nodes (e.g., complete graphs, regular expanders). In this work, we apply a powerful hierarchy of relaxations, known as the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy, to the combinatorial problem. Motivated by empirical evidence on the improvement in exact recoverability, we center our attention on the degree-4 SoS relaxation and set out to understand the origin of such improvement from a graph theoretical perspective. We show that the solution of the dual of the relaxed problem is related to finding edge weights of the Johnson and Kneser graphs, where the weights fulfill the SoS constraints and intuitively allow the input graph to increase its algebraic connectivity. Finally, as byproduct of our analysis, we derive a novel Cheeger-type lower bound for the algebraic connectivity of graphs with signed edge weights."}}

A high-order planted model assumes some underlying cluster structures, and simulates high-order interactions by placing hyperedges among nodes. Example models include the disjoint hypercliques, the densest subhypergraphs, and the hypergraph stochastic block models. We show that exact partitioning of high-order planted models (a NP-hard problem in general) is achievable through solving a computationally efficient convex optimization problem with a tensor nuclear norm constraint. Our analysis provides the conditions for our approach to succeed on recovering the true underlying cluster structures, with high probability."}}

We show that exact inference can be achieved using a semidefinite programming (SDP) approach without knowing either the latent variables or their domain.

For the Latent Space Model, the non-recoverability condition depends on the dimension of the latent space, and how far and spread are the communities in the latent space.
