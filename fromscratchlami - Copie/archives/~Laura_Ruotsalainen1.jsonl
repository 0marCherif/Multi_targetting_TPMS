In the established depth estimation benchmarks depicting, for example, street navigation or indoor offices, these cues can be found consistently, which enables neural networks to predict depth maps from single images. In this work, we are addressing the challenge of depth estimation from a real-world bird\u2019s-eye perspective in an industry environment which contains, conditioned by its special geometry, a minimal amount of visual cues and, hence, requires incorporation of the temporal domain for structure from motion estimation. To enable the system to incorporate structure from motion from pixel translation when facing context-sparse, i.e., visual cue sparse, scenery, we propose a novel architecture built upon the structure from motion learner, which uses temporal pairs of jointly unrotated and stacked images for depth prediction. In order to increase the overall performance and to avoid blurred depth edges that lie in between the edges of the two input images, we integrate a geometric consistency loss into our pipeline. We assess the model\u2019s ability to learn structure from motion by introducing a novel industry dataset whose perspective, orthogonal to the floor, contains only minimal visual cues. Through the evaluation with ground truth depth, we show that our proposed method outperforms the state of the art in difficult context-sparse environments."}}

Typically, in rural and open areas, global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) can provide an accurate and reliable localisation performance. However, in urban areas GNSS localisation accuracy is significantly reduced due to shadowing, scattering and signal blockages. In this work, the UE positioning assisted by deep learning in 5G and beyond networks is investigated in an urban area environment. We study the impact of utilising the spatial correlation in the received signal strengths (RSSs) on the UE positioning accuracy and how to utilise such correlation with deep learning algorithms to improve the localisation accuracy. Numerical results showed the importance of utilising the spatial correlation in the RSS to improve the prediction accuracy for all of the considered models. In addition, the impact of varying the number of access points (APs) transmitters on the localisation accuracy is also investigated. Numerical results showed that a lower number of APs may be sufficient when not considering uncertainties in RSS measurements. Moreover, we study how much the degrading effect of RSS uncertainty can be compensated for by increasing the number of APs."}}

One of the major threats to a GNSS receiver is the intentional interference known as jamming. A Jammer significantly disrupts the normal functioning of a GNSS receiver, at the acquisition, tracking, and positioning stages. The foremost important step to combat against jamming of GNSS signals is the early detection and characterization of the interfering signals to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS). This paper presents a robust Deep-Learning (DL) based technique using transfer learning to characterize the type of disruption in GNSS signal based on time-frequency analysis. To this end, a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to extract the informative features from the scalogram of the received signals. Further, a fully connected layer followed by a Soft-Max activation function is deployed to classify the signals. In this work, the Signal of Interest (SoI) is a synthetic GPS signal generated by a GNSS simulator. In our experiment, the GPS signal is combined with different kinds of jamming, spoofing, and multipath signals. Moreover, the proposed classification approach can recognize not only the various kinds of jammers such as ones producing Continuous Wave Interference (CWI), Multi-CWI (MCWI), Chirp Interference (CI), and Pulse interference (PI) but also the inclusion of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). Besides that, the effect of five pre-trained CNNs, namely, AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet-18, VGG-16, and MobileNet-V2, is evaluated on classification accuracy. The GNSS signal and its seven disruptive variants are recorded at three different power levels such as low, medium, and high. The medium power level signal is used for training and the testing has been carried out for unseen data set of low, high, and mixed power level. From the simulation results, it has been observed that MobileNet-V2 has performed better than other techniques with an accuracy of 99. 8%. Finally, the trained MobileNet-V2 is used to predict the unseen data type generated at different Jamming to signal Ratios (JSRs)."}}

The availability of these individual sensors suggests the idea of sensor fusion to achieve a more accurate solution. This work aims to address, with the goal of improving localization accuracy, the fusion of two conventional candidates for indoor positioning scenarios: Ultra Wide Band (UWB) and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi). The proposed method consists of a Machine Learning (ML)-based enhancement of WiFi measurements, environment observation, and sensor fusion. In particular, the proposed algorithm takes advantage of Received Signal Strength (RSS) values to fuse range measurements utilizing a Gaussian Process (GP). The range values are calculated using the WiFi Round Trip Time (RTT) and UWB Two Way Ranging (TWR) methods. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, trilateration is used for positioning. Furthermore, empirical range measurements are obtained to investigate and validate the proposed approach. The results prove that UWB and WiFi, working together, can compensate for each other\u2019s limitations and, consequently, provide a more accurate position solution."}}

To deal with the problems of Doppler estimation in high-dynamic maneuvers, the interest on maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) is increasing among the academic community. Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method is usually regarded as an effective and promising approach to obtain the solution of MLE, but the computation of Hessian matrix loads a great burden on the algorithm. Besides, a poor performance on convergency in final iterations is the common failing of LM implementations. To solve these problems, an LM method based on Gauss-Newton and a Quasi-Newton (QN) method based on Hessian approximation are derived, making the computation cost of Hessian decline from <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O(N)</i> to <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O(</i> 1 <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">)</i> . Then, on the basis of these two methods, a closed carrier loop with adaptive LM-QN algorithm is further proposed which can switch between LM and QN adaptively according to a damping parameter. Besides, an ideal LM with super-linear convergence (SLM) is constructed and proved as a reference of the convergence analysis. Finally, through the analyses and experiments using aircraft data, the improvements on computation cost and convergence are verified. Compared with scalar tracking and vector tracking, results indicate a magnitude increase in the precision of LM-QN loop, even though more computation counts are needed by LM-QN."}}
