The core of our results is the construction of neural-network layers that efficiently perform tensor contractions, and that use commonly adopted non-linear activation functions. The resulting deep networks feature a number of edges that closely matches the contraction complexity of the tensor networks to be approximated. In the context of many-body quantum states, this result establishes that neural-network states have strictly the same or higher expressive power than practically usable variational tensor networks. As an example, we show that all matrix product states can be efficiently written as neural-network states with a number of edges polynomial in the bond dimension and depth logarithmic in the system size. The opposite instead does not hold true, and our results imply that there exist quantum states that are not efficiently expressible in terms of matrix product states or PEPS, but that are instead efficiently expressible with neural network states."}}

In this paper, we theoretically study the interplay between depth and width in self-attention. We shed light on the root of the above phenomenon, and establish two distinct parameter regimes of depth efficiency and inefficiency in self-attention. We invalidate the seemingly plausible hypothesis by which widening is as effective as deepening for self-attention, and show that in fact stacking self-attention layers is so effective that it quickly saturates a capacity of the network width. Specifically, we pinpoint a ``depth threshold\" that is logarithmic in the network width: for networks of depth that is below the threshold, we establish a double-exponential depth-efficiency of the self-attention operation, while for depths over the threshold we show that depth-inefficiency kicks in. Our predictions accord with existing empirical ablations, and we further demonstrate the two depth-(in)efficiency regimes experimentally for common network depths of 6, 12, and 24. By identifying network width as a limiting factor, our analysis indicates that solutions for dramatically increasing the width can facilitate the next leap in self-attention expressivity."}}

In practical applications, neural-network states inherit numerical schemes used in Variational Monte Carlo, most notably the use of Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling to estimate quantum expectations. The local stochastic sampling in MCMC caps the potential advantages of neural networks in two ways: (i) Its intrinsic computational cost sets stringent practical limits on the width and depth of the networks, and therefore limits their expressive capacity; (ii) Its difficulty in generating precise and uncorrelated samples can result in estimations of observables that are very far from their true value. Inspired by the state-of-the-art generative models used in machine learning, we propose a specialized Neural Network architecture that supports efficient and exact sampling, completely circumventing the need for Markov Chain sampling. We demonstrate our approach for two-dimensional interacting spin models, showcasing the ability to obtain accurate results on larger system sizes than those currently accessible to neural-network quantum states."}}

For example, it is known that deep networks are exponentially efficient with respect to shallow networks, in the sense that a shallow network must grow exponentially large in order to approximate the functions represented by a deep network of polynomial size. In this work, we extend the study of expressive efficiency to the attribute of network connectivity and in particular to the effect of \"overlaps\" in the convolutional process, i.e., when the stride of the convolution is smaller than its filter size (receptive field).\nTo theoretically analyze this aspect of network's design, we focus on a well-established surrogate for ConvNets called Convolutional Arithmetic Circuits (ConvACs), and then demonstrate empirically that our results hold for standard ConvNets as well. Specifically, our analysis shows that having overlapping local receptive fields, and more broadly denser connectivity, results in an exponential increase in the expressive capacity of neural networks. Moreover, while denser connectivity can increase the expressive capacity, we show that the most common types of modern architectures already exhibit exponential increase in expressivity, without relying on fully-connected layers."}}

However, a well established measure of RNNs' long-term memory capacity is lacking, and thus formal understanding of their ability to correlate data throughout time is limited. Though depth efficiency in convolutional networks is well established by now, it does not suffice in order to account for the success of deep RNNs on inputs of varying lengths, and the need to address their 'time-series expressive power' arises. In this paper, we analyze the effect of depth on the ability of recurrent networks to express correlations ranging over long time-scales. To meet the above need, we introduce a measure of the information flow across time that can be supported by the network, referred to as the Start-End separation rank. Essentially, this measure reflects the distance of the function realized by the recurrent network from a function that models no interaction whatsoever between the beginning and end of the input sequence. We prove that deep recurrent networks support Start-End separation ranks which are exponentially higher than those supported by their shallow counterparts. Moreover, we show that the ability of deep recurrent networks to correlate different parts of the input sequence increases exponentially as the input sequence extends, while that of vanilla shallow recurrent networks does not adapt to the sequence length at all. Thus, we establish that depth brings forth an overwhelming advantage in the ability of recurrent networks to model long-term dependencies, and provide an exemplar of quantifying this key attribute which may be readily extended to other RNN architectures of interest, e.g. variants of LSTM networks. We obtain our results by considering a class of recurrent networks referred to as Recurrent Arithmetic Circuits (RACs), which merge the hidden state with the input via the Multiplicative Integration operation."}}
