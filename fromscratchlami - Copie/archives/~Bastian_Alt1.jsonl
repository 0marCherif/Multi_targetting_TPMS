AQM describes methods to send proactive feedback to TCP flow sources to regulate their rate using selective packet drops or markings. Traditionally, AQM policies relied on heuristics to approximately provide Quality of Service (QoS) such as a target delay for a given flow. These heuristics are usually based on simple network and TCP control models together with the monitored buffer filling. A primary drawback of these heuristics is that their way of accounting flow characteristics into the feedback mechanism and the corresponding effect on the state of congestion are not well understood. In this work, we show that taking a probabilistic model for the flow rates and the dequeueing pattern, a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) can be formulated to obtain an optimal packet dropping policy. This policy-based AQM, denoted PAQMAN, takes into account a steady-state model of TCP and a target delay for the flows. Additionally, we present an inference algorithm that builds on TCP congestion control in order to calibrate the model parameters governing underlying network conditions. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our approach using simulation compared to state-of-the-art AQM algorithms."}}

As in many fields within the natural and engineering sciences, the systems under study typically evolve continuously in time, it is natural to consider continuous-time model formulations consisting of switching stochastic differential equations governed by an underlying Markov jump process. Inference in these types of models is however notoriously difficult, and tractable computational schemes are rare. In this work, we propose a novel inference algorithm utilizing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. The presented Gibbs sampler allows to efficiently obtain samples from the exact continuous-time posterior processes. Our framework naturally enables Bayesian parameter estimation, and we also include an estimate for the diffusion covariance, which is oftentimes assumed fixed in stochastic differential equation models. We evaluate our framework under the modeling assumption and compare it against an existing variational inference approach."}}

Probabilistic dynamical models achieve substantial performance gains for decision-making. Their ability to predict the system state depending on the decisions enables efficient learning with small amounts of data, and therefore make guided optimal decisions possible. Multiple probabilistic models for dynamical state-space systems under discrete-time and continuous-time assumptions are presented. They provide the basis to compute Bayesian beliefs and optimal decisions under uncertainty. Numerical algorithms are developed, by starting with the exact system description and making principled approximations to arrive at tractable algorithms for both inference and learning, as well as decision-making. The developed methods are showcased on communication systems and other commonplace applications. The specific contributions to modeling, inference and decision-making are outlined in the following. The first contribution is an inference method for non-stationary point process data, which is common, for example, in queues within communication systems. A hierarchical Bayesian non-parametric model with a gamma-distributional assumption on the holding times of the process serves as a basis. For inference, a computationally tractable method based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler is derived and subsequently validated under the modeling assumption using synthetic data and in a real-data scenario. The second contribution is a fast algorithm for adapting bitrates in video streaming. This is achieved by a new algorithm for adaptive bitrate video streaming that uses a sparse Bayesian linear model for a quality-of-experience score. The algorithm uses a tractable inference scheme to extract relevant features from network data and builds on a contextual bandit strategy for decision making. The algorithm is validated numerically and an implementation and evaluation in a named data networking scenario is given. The third contribution is a novel method that exploits correlations in decision-making problems. Underlying model parameters can be inferred very data-efficiently, by building a Bayesian model for correlated count data from Markov decision processes. To overcome intractabilities arising in exact Bayesian inference, a tractable variational inference algorithm is presented exploiting an augmentation scheme. The method is extensively evaluated in various decision-making scenarios, such as, reinforcement learning in a queueing system. The final contribution is concerned with simultaneous state inference and decision-making in continuous-time partially observed environments. A new model for discrete state and action space systems is presented and the corresponding equations for exact Bayesian inference are discussed. The optimality conditions for decision-making are derived. Two tractable numerical schemes are presented, which exploit function approximators to learn the solution in the belief space. Applicability of the method is shown on several examples, including a scheduling algorithm under partial observability."}}

In essence, the decision-making agent maps each arriving job to one of the possibly heterogeneous servers while aiming at an optimization goal such as load balancing, low average delay or low loss rate. One main difficulty in finding optimal load balancing policies here is that the agent only partially observes the impact of its decisions, e.g., through the delayed acknowledgements of the served jobs. In this paper, we provide a partially observable (PO) model that captures the load balancing decisions in parallel buffered systems under limited information of delayed acknowledgements. We present a simulation model for this PO system to find a load balancing policy in real-time using a scalable Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. We numerically show that the resulting policy outperforms other limited information load balancing strategies such as variants of Join-the-Most-Observations and has comparable performance to full information strategies like: Join-the-Shortest-Queue, Join-the-Shortest-Queue(d) and Shortest-Expected-Delay.

Abstract The Lasso has become a benchmark method for simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection in regression analysis. It is based on the least-squares estimator and, therefore, suffers from the presence of outliers. Robust Lasso methods combine the objective function of a robust estimator with \u21131-penalization. We address robustness for cases in which the number of observations is smaller (or not much larger) than the number of predictors. Further, we assume that the regression matrix may contain cellwise outliers. In such settings, even a few highly contaminated predictors can cause existing robust methods that are based on the commonly used rowwise contamination model to break down. Therefore, we propose a new adaptive Lasso type regularization. It takes into account cellwise outlyingness in the regression matrix and uses this information for robust variable selection. The proposed regularization term is integrated into the objective function of the MM-estimator, which yields the proposed MM-Robust Weighted Adaptive Lasso (MM-RWAL). A performance comparison to existing robust Lasso estimators is provided using Monte Carlo experiments. Further, the MM-RWAL is applied to determine the temporal releases of the European Tracer Experiment (ETEX) at the source location. This sparse and ill-conditioned linear inverse problem contains cellwise and rowwise outliers."}}
