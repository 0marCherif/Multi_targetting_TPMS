Although many feature extraction methods have been proposed to improve the performance of enhancer identification, they cannot learn position-related multiscale contextual information from raw DNA sequences. Results: In this article, we propose a novel enhancer identification method (iEnhancer-ELM) based on BERT-like enhancer language models. iEnhancer-ELM tokenizes DNA sequences with multi-scale k-mers and extracts contextual information of different scale k-mers related with their positions via an multi-head attention mechanism. We first evaluate the performance of different scale k-mers, then ensemble them to improve the performance of enhancer identification. The experimental results on two popular benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms stateof-the-art methods. We further illustrate the interpretability of iEnhancer-ELM. For a case study, we discover 30 enhancer motifs via a 3-mer-based model, where 12 of motifs are verified by STREME and JASPAR, demonstrating our model has a potential ability to unveil the biological mechanism of enhancer.

Many advanced methods are proposed from different views with complementary detection ability, such as the classification method, the network method, and the ranking method. A framework integrating these heterogeneous methods is urgently desired to reduce the false positive rate and predictive bias. We propose a novel ranking method called ProtRe-CN by fusing the classification methods and network methods via Learning to Rank. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset and the independent dataset show that ProtRe-CN outperforms other existing state-of-the-art predictors. ProtRe-CN improves the detective performance via correcting the false positives in the ranking list by combining the heterogeneous methods.

In this paper, we seek to improve the generalization of GANs from a perspective of privacy protection, specifically in terms of defending against the membership inference attack (MIA) which aims to infer whether a particular sample was used for model training. We design a GAN framework, partition GAN (PAR-GAN), which consists of one generator and multiple discriminators trained over disjoint partitions of the training data. The key idea of PAR-GAN is to reduce the generalization gap by approximating a mixture distribution of all partitions of the training data. Our theoretical analysis shows that PAR-GAN can achieve global optimality just like the original GAN. Our experimental results on simulated data and multiple popular datasets demonstrate that PAR-GAN can improve the generalization of GANs while mitigating information leakage induced by MIA."}}

In order to address these limitations of genomic data, we develop a Population-scale Genomic Data Augmentation based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (PG-cGAN) to enhance the amount and diversity of genomic data by transforming samples already in the data rather than collecting new samples. Both the generator and discriminator in the PG-CGAN are stacked with convolutional layers to capture the underlying population structure. Our results for augmenting genotypes in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) regions showed that PC-cGAN can generate new genotypes with similar population structure, variant frequency distributions and LD patterns. Since the input for PC-cGAN is the original genomic data without assumptions about prior knowledge, it can be extended to enrich many other types of biomedical data and beyond."}}

Most methods of phenotype prediction are based on regularized statistical approaches which only consider linear relationships among genetic features. Deep learning based methods have been recently reported to nicely address regression problems in high dimensional data in genomic studies. To explore deep learning for phenotype prediction, we propose a deep learning regression model, called Sparse Convolutional Predictor with Denoising Autoencoders (SCP_DAE), to predict quantitative traits. We constructed SCP_DAE by utilizing a convolutional layer that can extract correlation or linkage patterns in the genotype data and applying a sparse weight matrix resulted from the L1 regularization to handle high dimensional genotype data. To learn efficient and compressed hidden representations of genotype data, we pre-trained the convolutional layer and the first fully connected layer in SCP_DAE using denoising autoencoders. These pre-trained layers were then fine-tuned to improve its performance of the SCP_DAE model for phenotype prediction. We comprehensively evaluated our proposed method on a yeast dataset which contains well assayed genotype profiles and quantitative traits. Our results showed that the proposed SCP\\_DAE method significantly outperforms regularized statistical approaches and similar deep learning models without pre-trained weights."}}

Currently, the profile-based methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance in these fields. However, the widely used sequence profiles, like position-specific frequency matrix (PSFM) and position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), ignore the sequence-order effects along protein sequence. In this study, we have proposed a novel profile, called sequence-order frequency matrix (SOFM), to extract the sequence-order information of neighboring residues from multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Combined with two profile feature extraction approaches, top-n-grams and the Smith-Waterman algorithm, the SOFMs are applied to protein remote homology detection and fold recognition, and two predictors called SOFM-Top and SOFM-SW are proposed. Experimental results show that SOFM contains more information content than other profiles, and these two predictors outperform other state-of-the-art methods. It is anticipated that SOFM will become a very useful profile in the studies of protein structures and functions."}}

Almost all of the traditional machine leaning methods require fixed length features to represent the protein sequences. However, it is never an easy task to extract the discriminative features with limited knowledge of proteins. On the other hand, deep learning technique has demonstrated its advantage in automatically learning representations. It is worthwhile to explore the applications of deep learning techniques to the protein remote homology detection. Results In this study, we employ the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) to learn effective features from pseudo proteins, also propose a predictor called ProDec-BLSTM: it includes input layer, bidirectional LSTM, time distributed dense layer and output layer. This neural network can automatically extract the discriminative features by using bidirectional LSTM and the time distributed dense layer. Conclusion Experimental results on a widely-used benchmark dataset show that ProDec-BLSTM outperforms other related methods in terms of both the mean ROC and mean ROC50 scores. This promising result shows that ProDec-BLSTM is a useful tool for protein remote homology detection. Furthermore, the hidden patterns learnt by ProDec-BLSTM can be interpreted and visualized, and therefore, additional useful information can be obtained."}}
