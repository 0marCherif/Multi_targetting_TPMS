The absence of one modality can often lead to confusion or misinterpretation of information. In this paper we present an end-to-end temporal model capable of directly synthesising audio from silent video, without needing to transform to-and-from intermediate features. Our proposed approach, based on GANs is capable of producing natural sounding, intelligible speech which is synchronised with the video. The performance of our model is evaluated on the GRID dataset for both speaker dependent and speaker independent scenarios. To the best of our knowledge this is the first method that maps video directly to raw audio and the first to produce intelligible speech when tested on previously unseen speakers. We evaluate the synthesised audio not only based on the sound quality but also on the accuracy of the spoken words"}}

We propose an alternative method for conditioning and present a new framework, where two networks are simultaneously trained, in a supervised manner, to perform domain translation in opposite directions. Our method is not only better at capturing the shared information between two domains but is more generic and can be applied to a broader range of problems. The proposed framework performs well even in challenging cross-modal translations, such as video-driven speech reconstruction, for which other systems struggle to maintain correspondence."}}

Modern techniques have enabled the collection of unprecedented amounts of high quality data describing the state of these molecules during cancer development. In cancer research particularly, this strategy has been particularly successful, leading to the discovery of new drugs able to target key factors promoting cancer growth. However, a large body of research suggests that in complex organs, the interaction between cancer and its surrounding environment is an essential part of the biology of both diseased and healthy tissues, therefore it is of paramount importance that this process is further investigated. Here we report a strategy designed to reveal communication signals between cancer cells and adjacent cell types. We apply the strategy to prostate cancer and find that normal cells surrounding the tumour do exert an anti-tumour activity on prostate cancer cells. By using a statistical model which integrates multiple levels of genetic data, we show that cell-to-cell communication genes are controlled by DNA alterations and have potential prognostic value."}}
