However, task performance depends significantly on the quality of the prompt used to steer the model. Due to the lack of knowledge of how LLMs work, most effective prompts have been handcrafted by humans through a demanding trial and error process. To reduce the human effort involved in this alignment process, we propose Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) for automatic instruction generation and selection. We treat the instruction as the \"program,\" optimized by searching over a pool of instruction candidates proposed by an LLM in order to maximize a chosen score function. To evaluate how well the selected instruction can steer the model to desired behavior, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of another LLM following the selected instruction. Experiments on 24 NLP tasks show that our automatically generated instructions outperform the prior LLM baseline by a large margin and achieve better or comparable performance to the instructions generated by human annotators on 19/24 tasks. Moreover, we show that APE-engineered prompts can be applied to steer models toward truthfulness and/or informativeness.

Such methods typically learn from corpora of robot-language data that was either collected with specific tasks in mind or expensively re-labelled by humans with rich language descriptions in hindsight. Recently, large-scale pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP or ViLD have been applied to robotics for learning representations and scene descriptors. Can these pretrained models serve as automatic labelers for robot data, effectively importing Internet-scale knowledge into existing datasets to make them useful even for tasks that are not reflected in their ground truth annotations? To accomplish this, we introduce Data-driven Instruction Augmentation for Language-conditioned control (DIAL): we utilize semi-supervised language labels leveraging the semantic understanding of CLIP to propagate knowledge onto large datasets of unlabelled demonstration data and then train language-conditioned policies on the augmented datasets. This method enables cheaper acquisition of useful language descriptions compared to expensive human labels, allowing for more efficient label coverage of large-scale datasets. We apply DIAL to a challenging real-world robotic manipulation domain where 96.5% of the 80,000 demonstrations do not contain crowd-sourced language annotations.

When facing long horizon sparse reward environments modern methods still struggle with effective exploration and generalize poorly. In the multi-goal reinforcement learning setting, out-of-distribution goals might appear similar to the achieved ones, but the agent can never accurately assess its ability to achieve them without attempting them. To enable faster exploration and improve generalization, we propose an exploration method that lets the agent temporarily pursue the most meaningful nearby goal. Through experiments in four multi-goal environments, including a 2D PointMaze, an AntMaze, and a foraging world, we show that our method can improve an agent's ability to estimate the achievability of out-of-distribution goals as well as its frontier exploration strategy."}}

These embodied problems require an agent to understand many semantic aspects of the world: the repertoire of skills available, how these skills influence the world, and how changes to the world map back to the language. LLMs planning in embodied environments need to consider not just what skills to do, but also how and when to do them - answers that change over time in response to the agent's own choices. In this work, we investigate to what extent LLMs used in such embodied contexts can reason over sources of feedback provided through natural language, without any additional training. We propose that by leveraging environment feedback, LLMs are able to form an inner monologue that allows them to more richly process and plan in robotic control scenarios. We investigate a variety of sources of feedback, such as success detection, scene description, and human interaction. We find that closed-loop language feedback significantly improves high level instruction completion on three domains, including simulated and real table top rearrangement tasks and long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks in a kitchen environment in the real world."}}
