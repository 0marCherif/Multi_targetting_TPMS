We prove that both MAP inference and latent tag anchoring (required for weakly-supervised learning) are NP-hard problems. We propose two optimization algorithms based on constraint smoothing and conditional gradient to approximately solve these inference problems. Experimentally, our approach delivers state-of-the-art results on Geoquery, Scan and Clevr, both for i.i.d. splits and for splits that test for compositional generalization."}}

This fact opens the question of whether these losses are well-adapted for structured prediction and, if so, why."}}

That is, given a sentence and its corresponding well-formed dependency structure, the parser assigns elementary trees to words of the sentence and return attachment sites compatible with these elementary trees and predefined dependencies. Moreover, we prove that this algorithm has a linear-time complexity in the input length. This algorithm returns all compatible derivation trees as a packed forest. This result is of practical interest to the development of efficient weighted LTAG parsers based on derivation tree decoding."}}

Our approach relies on Gumbel perturbations and differentiable dynamic programming. Unlike previous approaches to latent tree learning, we stochastically sample global structures and our parser is fully differentiable. We illustrate its effectiveness on sentiment analysis and natural language inference tasks. We also study its properties on a synthetic structure induction task. Ablation studies emphasize the importance of both stochasticity and constraining latent structures to be projective trees."}}

In particular, we show that we can build variants of our parser with smaller search spaces and time complexities ranging from O(n\u02c66) down to O(n\u02c63). The cubic time variant covers 98% of constituents observed in linguistic treebanks while having the same complexity as continuous constituency parsers. We evaluate our approach on German and English treebanks (Negra, Tiger, and DPTB) and report state-of-the-art results in the fully supervised setting. We also experiment with pre-trained word embeddings and Bert-based neural networks."}}
