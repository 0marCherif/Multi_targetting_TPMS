A unified framework of rigorous state evolution is established for developing long-memory message-passing (LM-MP) in spatially coupled systems. LM-MP utilizes all previous messages to compute the current message while conventional MP only uses the latest messages. The unified framework is utilized to propose orthogonal approximate message-passing (OAMP) for spatially coupled systems. The framework for LM-MP is used as a technical tool to prove the convergence of state evolution for OAMP. Numerical results show that OAMP for spatially coupled systems is superior to that for systems without spatial coupling in the so-called waterfall region."}}

This paper proves the convergence of Bayes-optimal orthogonal/vector AMP in the large system limit. The proof strategy is based on a novel long-memory (LM) MP approach: A first step is a construction of LM-MP that is guaranteed to converge systematically. A second step is a large-system analysis of LM-MP via an existing framework of state evolution. A third step is to prove the convergence of state evolution recursions for Bayes-optimal LM-MP via a new statistical interpretation of existing LM damping. The last is an exact reduction of the state evolution recursions for Bayes-optimal LM-MP to those for Bayes-optimal orthogonal/vector AMP. The convergence of the state evolution recursions for Bayes-optimal LM-MP implies that for Bayes-optimal orthogonal/vector AMP.

Pilot contamination is caused by reuse of identical pilot sequences in adjacent cells. To solve pilot contamination, the base station utilizes differences between the transmission frames of different users, which are detected via joint channel and data estimation. The joint estimation is regarded as a bilinear inference problem in compressed sensing. Expectation propagation (EP) is used to propose an iterative channel and data estimation algorithm. Initial channel estimates are attained via time-shifted pilots without exploiting information about large scale fading. The proposed EP modifies two points in conventional bilinear adaptive vector approximate message-passing (BAd-VAMP). One is that EP utilizes data estimates after soft decision in the channel estimation while BAd-VAMP uses them before soft decision. The other point is that EP can utilize the prior distribution of the channel matrix while BAd-VAMP cannot in principle. Numerical simulations show that EP converges much faster than BAd-VAMP in spatially correlated MIMO, in which approximate message-passing fails to converge toward the same fixed-point as EP and BAd-VAMP."}}
