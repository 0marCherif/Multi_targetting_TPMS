By storing the bulk of the parameters in the external table, one can increase the capacity of the model without necessarily increasing the inference time. Two crucial questions in this setting are then: what is the lookup function for accessing the table and how are the contents of the table consumed? Prominent methods for accessing the table include 1) using words/wordpieces token-ids as table indices, 2) LSH hashing the token vector in each layer into a table of buckets, and 3) learnable softmax style routing to a table entry. The ways to consume the contents include adding/concatenating to input representation, and using the contents as expert networks that specialize to different inputs. In this work, we conduct rigorous experimental evaluations of existing ideas and their combinations. We also introduce a new method, alternating updates, that enables access to an increased token dimension without increasing the computation time, and demonstrate its effectiveness in language modeling."}}

This increase in scale often comes with an increase in compute cost and inference latency. Consequently, research into methods which help realize the benefits of increased scale without leading to an increase in the compute cost becomes important. We introduce Alternating Updates (AltUp), a simple-to-implement method to increase a model's capacity without the computational burden. AltUp enables the widening of the learned representation without increasing the computation time by working on a subblock of the representation at each layer. Our experiments on various transformer models and language tasks demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of alternating updates on a diverse set of benchmarks. Finally, we present extensions of AltUp to the sequence dimension, and demonstrate how AltUp can be synergistically combined with existing approaches, such as Sparse Mixture-of-Experts models, to obtain efficient models with even higher capacity."}}

We show that for this non-convex problem there exists a manifold of global minima all with the same maximum Hessian eigenvalue and that gradient descent reaches a particular global minimum when initialized randomly. Interestingly, which minimum is reached depends heavily on the batch-size. For full batch gradient descent, the directions of the neuron that are initially positively correlated with the data are merely rescaled uniformly, hence in high-dimensions the learned neuron is a near uniform mixture of these directions. On the other hand, with batch-size one the neuron exactly aligns with a single such direction, showing that when using a small batch-size a qualitatively different type of ``feature selection\" occurs."}}

In this work, we propose a new approach: we measure the performance of a collection of models when evaluated at *single input point*. Specifically, we study a point's *profile*: the relationship between models' average performance on the test distribution and their pointwise performance on this individual point. We find that profiles can yield new insights into the structure of both models and data---in and out-of-distribution. For example, we empirically show that real data distributions consist of points with qualitatively different profiles. On one hand, there are ``compatible'' points with strong correlation between the pointwise and average performance. On the other hand, there are points with weak and even *negative* correlation: cases where improving overall model accuracy actually *hurts* performance on these inputs. As an application, we use profiles to construct a dataset we call CIFAR-10-NEG: a subset of CINIC-10 such that for standard models, accuracy on CIFAR-10-NEG is *negatively correlated* with CIFAR-10 accuracy. Illustrating for the first time an OOD dataset that completely inverts ``accuracy-on-the-line'' (Miller et al., 2021)."}}

Specifically, we show that models that perform well on the test data (have low excess loss) are either \"classical\" -- have training loss close to the noise level, or are \"modern\" -- have a much larger number of parameters compared to the minimum needed to fit the training data exactly. We also provide a more precise asymptotic analysis when the limiting spectral distribution of the whitened features is Marchenko-Pastur. Remarkably, while the Marchenko-Pastur analysis is far more precise near the interpolation peak, where the number of parameters is just enough to fit the training data, it coincides exactly with the distribution independent bound as the level of overparametrization increases."}}

Existing approaches for this \u201cordinal embedding\u201d problem require expensive optimization procedures, which cannot scale to handle increasingly larger datasets. To address this issue, we propose a landmark-based strategy, which we call Landmark Ordinal Embedding (LOE). Our approach trades off statistical efficiency for computational efficiency by exploiting the low-dimensionality of the latent embedding. We derive bounds establishing the statistical consistency of LOE under the popular Bradley- Terry-Luce noise model. Through a rigorous analysis of the computational complexity, we show that LOE is significantly more efficient than conventional ordinal embedding approaches as the number of items grows. We validate these characterizations empirically on both synthetic and real datasets. We also present a practical approach that achieves the \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d, by using LOE to warm-start existing methods that are more statistically efficient but computationally expensive."}}
