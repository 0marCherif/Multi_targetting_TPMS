Generative models are employed to learn the distribution of query-answers and labels, which is in turn used to estimate the most informative query. However, learning and inference with a full generative model of the data is often intractable for complex tasks. In this work, we propose Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP), a variational characterization of IP which bypasses the need for learning generative models. V-IP is based on finding a query selection strategy and a classifier that minimizes the expected cross-entropy between true and predicted labels. We then demonstrate that the IP strategy is the optimal solution to this problem. Therefore, instead of learning generative models, we can use our optimal strategy to directly pick the most informative query given any history. We then develop a practical algorithm by defining a finite-dimensional parameterization of our strategy and classifier using deep networks and train them end-to-end using our objective. Empirically, V-IP is 10-100x faster than IP on different Vision and NLP tasks with competitive performance. Moreover, V-IP finds much shorter query chains when compared to reinforcement learning which is typically used in sequential-decision-making problems. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of V-IP on challenging tasks like medical diagnosis where the performance is far superior to the generative modelling approach."}}

Given the room type (e.g., living room or library) and the room layout (e.g., room elements such as floor and walls), our architecture generates a collection of objects (e.g., furniture items such as sofa, table and chairs) that is consistent with the room type and layout. This is a challenging problem because the generated scene needs to satisfy multiple constrains, e.g., each object should lie inside the room and two objects should not occupy the same volume. To address these challenges, we propose a deep generative model that encodes these relationships as soft constraints on an attributed graph (e.g., the nodes capture attributes of room and furniture elements, such as shape, class, pose and size, and the edges capture geometric relationships such as relative orientation). The architecture consists of a graph encoder that maps the input graph to a structured latent space, and a graph decoder that generates a furniture graph, given a latent code and the room graph. The latent space is modeled with autoregressive priors, which facilitates the generation of highly structured scenes. We also propose an efficient training procedure that combines matching and constrained learning. Experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that our method produces scenes that are diverse and are adapted to the room layout."}}

Providing an explanation of the reasoning process in domain-specific terms can be crucial for adoption in risk-sensitive domains such as healthcare. We argue that machine learning algorithms should be interpretable by design and that the language in which these interpretations are expressed should be domain- and task-dependent. Consequently, we base our model's prediction on a family of user-defined and task-specific binary functions of the data, each having a clear interpretation to the end-user. We then minimize the expected number of queries needed for accurate prediction on any given input. As the solution is generally intractable, following prior work, we choose the queries sequentially based on information gain. However, in contrast to previous work, we need not assume the queries are conditionally independent. Instead, we leverage a stochastic generative model (VAE) and an MCMC algorithm (Unadjusted Langevin) to select the most informative query about the input based on previous query-answers. This enables the online determination of a query chain of whatever depth is required to resolve prediction ambiguities. Finally, experiments on vision and NLP tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and its superiority over post-hoc explanations."}}

From classical information theory, we know that entropy is a useful measure of the complexity of a random variable and provides a lower bound on the minimum expected number of bits needed for transmitting its state. In this paper, we propose to measure the complexity of a learning task by the minimum expected number of questions that need to be answered to solve the task. For example, the minimum expected number of patches that need to be observed to classify FashionMNIST images. We prove several properties of the proposed complexity measure, including connections with classical entropy and sub-additivity for multiple tasks. As the computation of the minimum expected number of questions is generally intractable, we propose a greedy procedure called \u201cinformation pursuit\u201d (IP), which selects one question at a time depending on previous questions and their answers. This requires learning a probabilistic generative model relating data and questions to the task, for which we employ variational autoencoders and normalizing flows. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed measure on various binary image classification tasks using image patches as the query set. Our results indicate that the complexity of a classification task increases as signal-to-noise ratio decreases, and that classification of the KMNIST dataset is more complex than classification of the FashionMNIST dataset. As a byproduct of choosing patches as queries, our approach also provides a principled way of determining which pixels in an image are most informative for a task."}}

However, deep models are perceived as \"black box\" methods considering the lack of understanding of their internal functioning. There has been a significant recent interest to develop explainable deep learning models, and this paper is an effort in this direction. Building on a recently proposed method called Grad-CAM, we propose Grad-CAM++ to provide better visual explanations of CNN model predictions (when compared to Grad-CAM), in terms of better localization of objects as well as explaining occurrences of multiple objects of a class in a single image. We provide a mathematical explanation for the proposed method, Grad-CAM++, which uses a weighted combination of the positive partial derivatives of the last convolutional layer feature maps with respect to a specific class score as weights to generate a visual explanation for the class label under consideration. Our extensive experiments and evaluations, both subjective and objective, on standard datasets showed that Grad-CAM++ indeed provides better visual explanations for a given CNN architecture when compared to Grad-CAM."}}
