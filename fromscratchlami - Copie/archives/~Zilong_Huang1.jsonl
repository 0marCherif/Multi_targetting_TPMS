Conventionally, deep learning approaches take the whole input image and an associated trimap to infer the alpha matte using convolutional neural networks. Such approaches set state-of-the-arts in image matting; however, they may fail in real-world matting applications due to hardware limitations, since real-world input images for matting are mostly of very high resolution. In this paper, we propose HDMatt, a first deep learning based image matting approach for high-resolution inputs. More concretely, HDMatt runs matting in a patch-based crop-and-stitch manner for high-resolution inputs with a novel module design to address the contextual dependency and consistency issues between different patches. Compared with vanilla patch-based inference which computes each patch independently, we explicitly model the cross-patch contextual dependency with a newly-proposed Cross-Patch Contextual module (CPC) guided by the given trimap. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its necessity for high-resolution inputs. Our HDMatt approach also sets new state-of-the-art performance on Adobe Image Matting and AlphaMatting benchmarks and produce impressive visual results on more real-world high-resolution images."}}

Particularly, increasing attention has been drawn towards its application in agriculture. Nevertheless, while visual pattern recognition on farmlands carries enormous economic values, little progress has been made to merge computer vision and crop sciences due to the lack of suitable agricultural image datasets. Meanwhile, problems in agriculture also pose new challenges in computer vision. For example, semantic segmentation of aerial farmland images requires inference over extremely large-size images with extreme annotation sparsity. These challenges are not present in most of the common object datasets, and we show that they are more challenging than many other aerial image datasets. To encourage research in computer vision for agriculture, we present Agriculture-Vision: a large-scale aerial farmland image dataset for semantic segmentation of agricultural patterns. We collected 94,986 high-quality aerial images from 3,432 farmlands across the US, where each image consists of RGB and Near-infrared (NIR) channels with resolution as high as 10 cm per pixel. We annotate nine types of field anomaly patterns that are most important to farmers. As a pilot study of aerial agricultural semantic segmentation, we perform comprehensive experiments using popular semantic segmentation models; we also propose an effective model designed for aerial agricultural pattern recognition. Our experiments demonstrate several challenges Agriculture-Vision poses to both the computer vision and agriculture communities. Future versions of this dataset will include even more aerial images, anomaly patterns and image channels."}}

However, the computational cost and memory requirement render these methods unsuitable on the mobile device, especially for the high resolution per-pixel semantic segmentation task. In this paper, we introduce a new method squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer (SeaFormer) for mobile semantic segmentation. Specifically, we design a generic attention block characterized by the formulation of squeeze Axial and spatial enhancement. It can be further used to create a family of backbone architectures with superior cost-effectiveness. Coupled with a light segmentation head, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the ADE20K, Pascal Context and COCO-stuff datasets. Critically, we beat both the mobile-friendly rivals and Transformer-based counterparts with better performance and lower latency without bells and whistles. Beyond semantic segmentation, we further apply the proposed SeaFormer architecture to image classification problem, demonstrating the potentials of serving as a versatile mobile-friendly backbone."}}

However, existing approaches, such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and its variants, usually require dense input views (i.e. 50-150) to obtain decent results. To relive the over-dependence on massive calibrated images and enrich the coordinate-based feature representation, we explore injecting the prior information into the coordinate-based network and introduce a novel coordinate-based model, CoCo-INR, for implicit neural 3D representation. The cores of our method are two attention modules: codebook attention and coordinate attention. The former extracts the useful prototypes containing rich geometry and appearance information from the prior codebook, and the latter propagates such prior information into each coordinate and enriches its feature representation for a scene or object surface. With the help of the prior information, our method can render 3D views with more photo-realistic appearance and geometries than the current methods using fewer calibrated images available. Experiments on various scene reconstruction datasets, including DTU and BlendedMVS, and the full 3D head reconstruction dataset, H3DS, demonstrate the robustness under fewer input views and fine detail-preserving capability of our proposed method."}}

The multi-scale context module refers to the operations to aggregate feature responses from a large spatial extent, while the single-stage encoder-decoder structure encodes the high-level semantic information in the encoder path and recovers the boundary information in the decoder path. In contrast, multi-stage encoder-decoder networks have been widely used in human pose estimation and show superior performance than their single-stage counterpart. However, few efforts have been attempted to bring this effective design to semantic segmentation. In this work, we propose a Semantic Prediction Guidance (SPG) module which learns to re-weight the local features through the guidance from pixel-wise semantic prediction. We find that by carefully re-weighting features across stages, a two-stage encoder-decoder network coupled with our proposed SPG module can significantly outperform its one-stage counterpart with similar parameters and computations. Finally, we report experimental results on the semantic segmentation benchmark Cityscapes, in which our SPGNet attains 81.1% on the test set using only 'fine' annotations."}}

Many existing methods usually require fine-grained supervisions (e.g., bounding-box annotations) to learn patch features, which requires a great effort to label images may limit their potential applications. In this paper, we propose to learn patch features via weak supervisions, i.e., only image-level supervisions. To achieve this goal, we treat images as bags and patches as instances to integrate the weakly supervised multiple instance learning constraints into deep neural networks. Also, our method integrates the traditional multiple stages of weakly supervised object classification and discovery into a unified deep convolutional neural network and optimizes the network in an end-to-end way. The network processes the two tasks object classification and discovery jointly, and shares hierarchical deep features. Through this jointly learning strategy, weakly supervised object classification and discovery are beneficial to each other. We test the proposed method on the challenging PASCAL VOC datasets. The results show that our method can obtain state-of-the-art performance on object classification, and very competitive results on object discovery, with faster testing speed than competitors."}}

Nevertheless, it is still unclear how to develop an accurate human parsing system in an efficient and elegant way. In this paper, we identify several useful properties, including feature resolution, global context information and edge details, and perform rigorous analyses to reveal how to leverage them to benefit the human parsing task. The advantages of these useful properties finally result in a simple yet effective Context Embedding with Edge Perceiving (CE2P) framework for single human parsing. Our CE2P is end-to-end trainable and can be easily adopted for conducting multiple human parsing. Benefiting the superiority of CE2P, we won the 1st places on all three human parsing tracks in the 2nd Look into Person (LIP) Challenge. Without any bells and whistles, we achieved 56.50% (mIoU), 45.31% (mean APr) and 33.34% (APp0.5) in Track 1, Track 2 and Track 5, which outperform the state-of-the-arts more than 2.06%, 3.81% and 1.87%, respectively. We hope our CE2P will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in single/multiple human parsing. Code has been made available at https://github.com/liutinglt/CE2P."}}

Recent state-of-the-art methods on this problem first infer the sparse and discriminative regions for each object class using a deep classification network, then train semantic a segmentation network using the discriminative regions as supervision. Inspired by the traditional image segmentation methods of seeded region growing, we propose to train a semantic segmentation network starting from the discriminative regions and progressively increase the pixel-level supervision using by seeded region growing. The seeded region growing module is integrated in a deep segmentation network and can benefit from deep features. Different from conventional deep networks which have fixed/static labels, the proposed weakly-supervised network generates new labels using the contextual information within an image. The proposed method significantly outperforms the weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods using static labels, and obtains the state-of-the-art performance, which are 63.2% mIoU score on the PASCAL VOC 2012 test set and 26.0% mIoU score on the COCO dataset."}}

The majority of existing object proposal approaches utilize edge or edge-like cues to rank candidates, while we consider that the surface cue containing the 3D characteristic of objects should be captured effectively for proposals, which has been rarely discussed before. In this paper, an object-level proposal model is presented, which constructs an occlusion-based objectness taking the surface cue into account. Specifically, the better detection of occlusion edges is focused on to enrich the surface cue into proposals, namely, the occlusion-dominated fusion and normalization criterion are designed to obtain the approximately overall contour information, to enhance the occlusion edge map at utmost and thus boost proposals. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and MS COCO 2014 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves around 6% improvement on the average recall than Edge Boxes at 1000 proposals and also leads to a modest gain on the performance of object detection."}}
