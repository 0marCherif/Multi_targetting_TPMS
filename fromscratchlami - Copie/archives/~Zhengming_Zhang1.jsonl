Deep learning algorithms can achieve high performance in these tasks with remarkable visual scene understanding and generalization abilities. However, when common scene-parsing methods are used to train end-to-end models, limitations of explainability in such algorithms inhibit their implementations in fully automated driving. The main challenges include algorithm performance deficiencies and inconsistencies, insufficient AI transparency, degraded user trust, and undermining human-AI interactions. This research aids the decision-making performance and transparency of automated driving systems by providing multi-modal explanations, especially when interacting with pedestrians. The proposed algorithm combines global visual features and interrelation features by parsing scene images as self-constructed graphs and using an attention-based module to capture the interrelationship among the ego-vehicle and other traffic-related objects. The output modules make decisions while simultaneously generating semantic text explanations. The results show that the fusion of the features from global frames and interrelational graphs improves decision-making and explanation predictions compared to two state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms. The interrelation module also enhances algorithm transparency by disclosing the visual attention used for decision-making. The importance of interrelation features on the two prediction tasks is further revealed along with the underlying mechanism of multitask learning on the datasets with hierarchical labels. The proposed model improves driving decision-making during pedestrian interactions with intelligible reasoning cues for building an appropriate mental model of automated driving performance for human users."}}

However, due to the high contextual variations and temporal dynamics in pedestrian behaviors, the interaction between autonomous-driving cars and pedestrians remains challenging, impeding the development of fully autonomous driving systems. This paper focuses on predicting pedestrian intention with a novel transformer-based evidential prediction (TrEP) algorithm. We develop a transformer module towards the temporal correlations among the input features within pedestrian video sequences and a deep evidential learning model to capture the AI uncertainty under scene complexities. Experimental results on three popular pedestrian intent benchmarks have verified the effectiveness of our proposed model over the state-of-the-art. The algorithm performance can be further boosted by controlling the uncertainty level. We systematically compare human disagreements with AI uncertainty to further evaluate AI performance in confusing scenes. The code is released at https://github.com/zzmonlyyou/TrEP.git."}}

To evaluate the effectiveness of this alerting system, subjects were recruited to participate in the designed test scenarios on a driving simulator. The test scenarios include three warning types (no alerts, roadside alerts, and in-vehicle auditory alerts), three driver states (normal, distracted, and drowsy), and two weather conditions (sunny and foggy). Driver responses related to vehicle dynamics data were collected and analyzed. The results indicate that on average, the drowsy state decreases the minimum time-to-collision by 1.6 seconds compared to the normal state. In-vehicle auditory alerts can effectively increase the driving safety across different combinations of situations (driver states and weather conditions), while roadside alerts perform better than no alerts."}}
