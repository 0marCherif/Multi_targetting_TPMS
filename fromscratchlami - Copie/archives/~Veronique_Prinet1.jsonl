Previous works often learn all the motions with a single model. In this paper, we propose to decouple the gesture into hand posture variations and hand movements, which are then modeled separately. For the former, the skeleton sequence is embedded into a 3D hand posture evolution volume (HPEV) to represent fine-grained posture variations. For the latter, the shifts of hand center and fingertips are arranged as a 2D hand movement map (HMM) to capture holistic movements. To learn from the two inhomogeneous representations for gesture recognition, we propose an end-to-end two-stream network. The HPEV stream integrates both spatial layout and temporal evolution information of hand postures by a dedicated 3D CNN, while the HMM stream develops an efficient 2D CNN to extract hand movement features. Eventually, the predictions of the two streams are aggregated with high efficiency. Extensive experiments on SHREC'17 Track, DHG-14/28 and FPHA datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art."}}

Change detection with PCA shows, however, a major difficulty, that is, result interpretation. A new PCA method is developed, namely MB-PCA (multi-block PCA), in order to overcome this problem. Experimental results demonstrate the interest of the approach as a new way to use PCA."}}

Previous efforts mostly exploit optical flow to propagate features across frames, aiming to achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. However, introducing an extra model to estimate optical flow can significantly increase the over-all model size.  The gap between optical flow and high-level features can also hinder it from establishing spatial correspondence accurately. Instead of relying on optical flow, this paper proposes a novel module called Progressive Sparse Local Attention (PSLA), which establishes the spatial correspondence between features across frames in a local region with progressively sparser stride and uses the correspondence to propagate features. Based on PSLA, Re-cursive Feature Updating (RFU) and Dense Feature Trans-forming (DenseFT) are proposed to model temporal appearance and enrich feature representation respectively in a novel video object detection framework. Experiments onImageNet VID show that our method achieves the best ac-curacy compared to existing methods with smaller model size and acceptable runtime speed."}}

While there are many methods for illuminant estimation from a single image, few works so far have focused on videos, and even fewer on multiple light sources. Our aim is to leverage information provided by the temporal acquisition, where either the objects or the camera or the light source are/is in motion in order to estimate illuminant color without the need for user interaction or using strong assumptions and heuristics. We introduce a simple physically-based formulation based on the assumption that the incident light chromaticity is constant over a short space-time domain. We show that a deterministic approach is not sufficient for accurate and robust estimation: however, a probabilistic formulation makes it possible to implicitly integrate away hidden factors that have been ignored by the physical model. Experimental results are reported on a dataset of natural video sequences and on the Gray Ball benchmark, indicating that we compare favorably with the state-of-the-art."}}

We present new phase field higher-order active contour (HOAC) prior models for network regions, and apply them to the segmentation of road networks from very high resolution satellite images. This is a hard problem for two reasons. First, the images are complex, with much \u2018noise\u2019 in the road region due to cars, road markings, etc., while the background is very varied, containing many features that are locally similar to roads. Second, network regions are complex to model, because they may have arbitrary topology. In particular, we address a limitation of a previous model in which network branch width was constrained to be similar to maximum network branch radius of curvature, thereby providing a poor model of networks with straight narrow branches or highly curved, wide branches. We solve this problem by introducing first an additional nonlinear nonlocal HOAC term, and then an additional linear nonlocal HOAC term to improve the computational speed. Both terms allow separate control of branch width and branch curvature, and furnish better prolongation for the same width, but the linear term has several advantages: it is more efficient, and it is able to model multiple widths simultaneously. To cope with the difficulty of parameter selection for these models, we perform a stability analysis of a long bar with a given width, and hence show how to choose the parameters of the energy functions. After adding a likelihood energy, we use both models to extract the road network quasi-automatically from pieces of a QuickBird image, and compare the results to other models in the literature. The state-of-the-art results obtained demonstrate the superiority of our new models, the importance of strong prior knowledge in general, and of the new terms in particular."}}

Unlike local features-based methods or global template-based methods, we propose to represent a video sequence by a set of middle-level parts. A part, or component, has consistent spatial structure and consistent motion. We first segment the visual motion patterns and generate a set of middle-level components by clustering keypoints-based trajectories extracted from the video. To further exploit the interdependencies of the moving parts, we then define spatio-temporal relationships between pairwise components. The resulting descriptive middle-level components and pairwise-components thereby catch the essential motion characteristics of human activities. They also give a very compact representation of the video. We apply our framework on popular and challenging video datasets: Weizmann dataset and UT-Interaction dataset. We demonstrate experimentally that our middle-level representation combined with a \u03c7 2-SVM classifier equals to or outperforms the state-of-the-art results on these dataset."}}

It is based on the hypothesis that each local descriptor is drawn from a class-dependent probability measure. The density of the latter is estimated by the non-parametric kernel estimator, which is further simplified under the assumption that the normalization factor is class-independent. While leading to significant simplification, the assumption underlying the original NBNN is too restrictive and considerably degrades its generalization ability. The goal of this paper is to address this issue. As we relax the incriminated assumption we are faced with a parameter selection problem that we solve by hinge-loss minimization. We also show that our modified formulation naturally generalizes to optimal combinations of feature types. Experiments conducted on several datasets show that the gain over the original NBNN may attain up to 20 percentage points. We also take advantage of the linearity of optimal NBNN to perform classification by detection through efficient sub-window search [2], with yet another performance gain. As a result, our classifier outperforms \u2014 in terms of misclassification error \u2014 methods based on support vector machine and bags of quantized features on some datasets."}}
