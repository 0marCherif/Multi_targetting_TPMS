However, the uncertainty of the neural networks (NN) learning in the existing NS methods has not been considered, and one single answer is provided for a question without confidence evaluation. To tackle this problem, we propose a confidence-based NS (CBNS) framework to evaluate the confidence of the NN modules based on uncertainty quantification and make inferences based on the confidence evaluations. Specifically, CBNS includes a probabilistic question parser that generates multiple program candidates with confidence evaluations. CBNS also includes a probabilistic scene perception module which provides object-based scene representation and confidence evaluations for each attribute of objects in an image. The object-based scene representation and the programs with confidence evaluations are used for evaluating the confidence of answers through the inference process. The proposed framework is model-agnostic and compatible with mainstream NS VQA architectures. Experiments on CLEVR demonstrate that the proposed framework enables confidence-based reasoning for the complex VQA task and leads to a promising performance improvement with a significantly reduced computation cost."}}
