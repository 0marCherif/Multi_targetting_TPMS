However, most existing AL models make a strong assumption that the annotated data instances are always assigned correct labels, which may not hold true in many practical settings. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to formally analyze the impact of noisy annotations and show that systematically re-sampling guarantees to reduce the noise rate, which can lead to improved generalization capability. More importantly, the theoretical framework demonstrates the key benefit of conducting active re-sampling on label-efficient learning, which is critical for AL. The theoretical results also suggest essential properties of an active re-sampling function with a fast convergence speed and guaranteed error reduction. This inspires us to design a novel spatial-temporal active re-sampling function by leveraging the important spatial and temporal properties of maximum-margin classifiers. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world data clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active re-sampling function."}}

However, data annotation for training MLC models becomes much more labor-intensive due to the correlated (hence non-exclusive) labels and a potential large and sparse label space.  We propose to conduct multi-label active learning (ML-AL) through a novel integrated Gaussian Process-Bayesian Bernoulli Mixture model (GP-B$^2$M) to accurately quantify a data sample's overall contribution to a correlated label space and choose the most informative samples for cost-effective annotation. In particular, the B$^2$M encodes label correlations using a Bayesian Bernoulli mixture of label clusters, where each mixture component corresponds to a global pattern of label correlations. To tackle highly sparse labels under AL, the B$^2$M is further integrated with a predictive GP to connect data features as an effective inductive bias and achieve a feature-component-label mapping. The GP predicts coefficients of mixture components that help to recover the final set of labels of a data sample. A novel auxiliary variable based variational inference algorithm is developed to tackle the non-conjugacy introduced along with the mapping process for efficient end-to-end posterior inference.  The model also outputs a predictive  distribution that provides both the label prediction and their correlations in the form of a label covariance matrix. A principled sampling function is designed accordingly to naturally capture both the feature uncertainty (through GP) and label covariance (through B$^2$M) for effective data sampling.
