Generally it requires labeled data from the source and only unlabeled data from the target to learn such representations. While these representations act like a bridge to transfer knowledge learned in the source to the target; they may lead to negative transfer when the source specific characteristics detract their ability to represent the target data. We present a novel neural network architecture to simultaneously learn a two-part representation which is based on the principle of segregating source specific representation from the common representation. The first part captures the source specific characteristics while the second part captures the truly common representation. Our architecture optimizes an objective function which acts adversarial for the source specific part if it contributes towards the cross-domain learning. We empirically show that two parts of the representation, in different arrangements, outperforms existing learning algorithms on the source learning as well as cross-domain tasks on multiple datasets."}}

Intransitivity is a common occurrence in real world data sets and we introduce a flexible and natural parametric model for pairwise comparisons that we call the \\emph{Distinguishing Feature Model} (DF) to capture this. Under this model, the items have an unknown but fixed embedding and the pairwise comparison between a pair of items depends probabilisitically on the feature in the embedding that can best distinguish the items. We study several theoretical properties including how it generalizes the popular transitive Bradley-Terry-Luce model. With just an embedding dimension  $d = 3$, we show that the proposed model can capture  arbitrarily long cyclic dependencies. Furthermore, we explicitly show the type of preference relations that cannot be modelled under the DF model for $d=3$. On the algorithmic side, we propose a Siamese type neural network based algorithm which can learn to predict well under the DF model while at the same time being interpretable in the sense that the embeddings learnt can be extracted directly from the learnt model. Our experimental results show that the model outperforms  standard baselines in both synthetic and real world ranking datasets."}}

We consider an adversarial setting where the voters are partitioned into two sets. The first set votes in a stochastic manner according to the popular score-based Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for pairwise comparisons. The second set comprises malicious Byzantine voters trying to deteriorate the ranking. We consider a strongly-adversarial scenario where the Byzantine voters know the BTL scores, the votes of the good voters, the algorithm, and can collude with each other. We first show that the popular spectral ranking based Rank-Centrality algorithm, though optimal for the BTL model, does not perform well even when a small constant fraction of the voters are Byzantine.\n\nWe introduce the Byzantine Spectral Ranking Algorithm (and a faster variant of it), which produces a reliable ranking when the number of good voters exceeds the number of Byzantine voters. We show that no algorithm can produce a satisfactory ranking with probability > 1/2 for all BTL weights when there are more Byzantine voters than good voters, showing that our algorithm works for all possible population fractions. We support our theoretical results with experimental results on synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate the failure of the Rank-Centrality algorithm under several adversarial scenarios and how the proposed Byzantine Spectral Ranking algorithm is robust in obtaining good rankings."}}

Recent works have noted that parametric models which assume  $d$ dimensional node representations can effectively model intransitive tournaments. However, nothing is known about the structure of the class of tournaments that arise out of any fixed $d$ dimensional representations. In this work, we develop a novel theory for understanding parametric tournament representations. Our first contribution is to structurally characterize the class of tournaments that arise out of $d$ dimensional representations. We do this by showing that these tournament classes have forbidden configurations that must necessarily be a union of flip classes, a novel way to partition the set of all tournaments. We further characterize rank $2$ tournaments completely by showing that the associated forbidden flip class contains just $2$ tournaments. Specifically, we show that the rank $2$ tournaments are equivalent to locally transitive tournaments. This insight allows us to show that the minimum feedback arc set problem on this tournament class can be solved using the standard Quicksort procedure. We also exhibit specific forbidden configurations for rank $4$ tournaments. For a general rank $d$ tournament class, we show that the flip class associated with a coned-doubly regular tournament of size $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d})$ must be a forbidden configuration. To answer a dual question, using a celebrated result of Froster, we show a lower bound of $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$ on the minimum dimension needed to represent all tournaments on $n$ nodes. For any given tournament, we show a novel upper bound on the smallest representation dimension that depends on the least size of the number of unique nodes in any feedback arc set of the flip class associated with a tournament. We show how our results also shed light on the upper bound of sign-rank of matrices. "}}

The problem is NP-hard in general and we study it for important classes of tournaments that arise naturally in the problem of learning to rank from pairwise comparisons. Specifically, we consider tournaments classes that arise out of parametric preference matrices that can lead to cyclic preference relations. We investigate their structural properties via forbidden sub tournament configurations.  Towards this, we introduce \\emph{Tournament Dimension} - a combinatorial parameter that characterizes the size of a forbidden configuration for rank $r$ tournament classes i.e., classes that arise out pairwise preference matrices which lead to rank $r$ skew-symmetric matrices under a suitable link function. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm - \\texttt{Rank2Rank} - that solves the MFAST problem for the rank $2$ tournament class. This is achieved via a  geometric characterization that relies on our explicit construction of a forbidden configuration for this class. \n \n Building on our understanding of the rank-$2$ tournament class, we propose a very general and flexible parametric pairwise preference model called the local-global model which subsumes the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce/Thurstone classes to capture locally cyclic as well as globally acyclic preference relations. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm - \\texttt{BlockRank2Rank}- to solve the MFAST problem on the associated Block-Rank $2$ tournament class.\n \n As an application, we study the problem of learning to rank from pairwise comparisons under the proposed local-global preference model. Exploiting our structural characterization, we propose  \\texttt{PairwiseBlockRank} - a pairwise ranking algorithm for this class. We show sample complexity bounds of \\texttt{PairwiseBlockRank}  to learn a good ranking under the proposed model.  Finally, we conduct experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm."}}

With the availability of large amount of data and advancement of machine learning techniques, the rollout decisions of a supervisor can be effectively automated and the mistakes in decisions made by the supervisor learnt. In this paper, we propose a novel learning algorithm SUPAID which under a natural 'one-way efficiency' assumption on the supervisor, uses a rule mining approach to rank the vehicles based on their roll-out feasibility thus helping prevent the supervisor from makingerroneous decisions. Our experimental results on real data from a public transit agency from a city in U.S show that the proposed method SUPAID can result in significant cost savings."}}
