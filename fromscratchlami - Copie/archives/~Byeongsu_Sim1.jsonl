In particular, for multi-layer single ReLU neurons with spherically symmetric data distribution and the square loss function, we provide upper and lower bounds for magnitude and angle components to describe the dynamics of gradient flow. Using the obtained bounds, we conclude that small scale initialization induces slow convergence speed for deep single ReLU neurons. Finally, by exploiting the relation of gradient flow and gradient descent, we extend our results to the gradient descent approach. All theoretical results are verified by experiments."}}

Unfortunately, even for a single ReLU neuron trained with the square loss, it was recently shown impossible to characterize the implicit regularization in terms of a norm of model parameters (Vardi & Shamir, 2021). In order to close the gap toward understanding intriguing generalization behavior of ReLU networks, here we examine the gradient flow dynamics in the parameter space when training single-neuron ReLU networks. Specifically, we discover an implicit bias in terms of support vectors, which plays a key role in why and how ReLU networks generalize well. Moreover, we analyze gradient flows with respect to the magnitude of the norm of initialization, and show that the norm of the learned weight strictly increases through the gradient flow. Lastly, we prove the global convergence of single ReLU neuron for $d = 2$ case."}}

However, it was not clear how CycleGAN-type generative models can be derived from the OT theory. Here we show that a novel CycleGAN architecture can be derived as a Kantorovich dual OT formulation if a penalized least squares (PLS) cost with deep learning--based inverse path penalty is used as a transportation cost. One of the most important advantages of this formulation is that depending on the knowledge of the forward problem, distinct variations of CycleGAN architecture can be derived: for example, one with two pairs of generators and discriminators, and the other with only a single pair of generator and discriminator. Even for the two generator cases, we show that the structural knowledge of the forward operator can lead to a simpler generator architecture which significantly simplifies the neural network training. The new CycleGAN formulation, which we call the OT-CycleGAN, has been applied for various biomedical imaging problems, such as accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), super-resolution microscopy, and low-dose X-ray computed tomography (CT). Experimental results confirm the efficacy and flexibility of the theory."}}

These neural networks are usually trained in a supervised manner, so matched pairs of subsampled and fully sampled k-space data are required. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to acquire matched fully sampled k-space data, since the acquisition of fully sampled k-space data requires long scan time and often leads to the change of the acquisition protocol. Therefore, unpaired deep learning without matched label data has become a very important research topic. In this paper, we propose an unpaired deep learning approach using a optimal transport driven cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (OT-cycleGAN) that employs a single pair of generator and discriminator. The proposed OT-cycleGAN architecture is rigorously derived from a dual formulation of the optimal transport formulation using a specially designed penalized least squares cost. The experimental results show that our method can reconstruct high resolution MR images from accelerated k- space data from both single and multiple coil acquisition, without requiring matched reference data."}}
