Extreme classification has been successfully applied to several real world web-scale applications such as web search, product recommendation, query rewriting, etc. GalaXC identifies two critical deficiencies in leading extreme classification algorithms. First, existing approaches generally assume that documents and labels reside in disjoint sets, even though in several applications, labels and documents cohabit the same space. Second, several approaches, albeit scalable, do not utilize various forms of metadata offered by applications, such as label text and label correlations. To remedy these, GalaXC presents a framework that enables collaborative learning over joint document-label graphs at massive scales, in a way that naturally allows various auxiliary sources of information, including label metadata, to be incorporated. GalaXC also introduces a novel label-wise attention mechanism to meld high-capacity extreme clas\u0002sifiers with its framework. An efficient end-to-end implementation of GalaXC is presented that could be trained on a dataset with 50M labels and 97M training documents in less than 100 hours on 4\u00d7V100 GPUs. This allowed GalaXC to not only scale to ap\u0002plications with several millions of labels, but also be up to 18% more accurate than leading deep extreme classifiers, while being upto 2-50\u00d7 faster to train and 10\u00d7 faster to predict on benchmark datasets. GalaXC is particularly well-suited to warm-start scenarios where predictions need to be made on data points with partially revealed label sets, and was found to be up to 25% more accurate than extreme classification algorithms specifically designed for warm start settings.

Such models are at the core of recent advances in model-based reinforcement learning. For example, world models can imagine unseen trajectories, potentially improving data-efficiency. Planning in the real-world requires agents to understand long-term dependencies between actions and events, and account for varying degree of changes, e.g. due to a change in background or viewpoint. Moreover, in a typical scene, only a subset of objects change their state. These changes are often quite sparse which suggests incorporating such an inductive bias in a dynamics model. In this work, we introduce the variational sparse gating mechanism, which enables an agent to sparsely update a latent dynamics model's state. We also present a simplified version, which unlike prior models, has a single stochastic recurrent state. Finally, we introduce a new ShapeHerd environment, in which an agent needs to push shapes into a goal area. This environment is partially-observable and requires models to remember the previously observed objects and explore the environment to discover unseen objects. Our experiments show that the proposed methods significantly outperform leading model-based reinforcement learning methods on this environment, while also yielding competitive performance on tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite."}}

However, training such models require translation-aligned data across languages, which is not always available. Also, in case of short texts like tweets, search queries, etc, the training of topic models continues to be a challenge. In this work, we present a novel strategy of creating a pseudo-parallel dataset followed by training topic models for sponsored search retrieval, that also mitigates the short text challenge. Our data augmentation strategy leverages easily available bipartite click-though graph that allows us to draw similar documents in different languages. The proposed methodology is evaluated on sponsored search system whose performance is measured on correctly matching the user intent, presented via the query, with ads provided by the advertiser. Our experiments substantiate the goodness of the method on EuroParl dataset and live search-engine traffic."}}

First, and the more explored, approach is to train an offline deep regression network over the masked pixels with an additional refinement by adversarial training. This approach requires a single feed-forward pass for inpainting at inference. Another promising, yet unexplored approach is to first train a generative model to map a latent prior distribution to natural image manifold and during inference time search for the best-matching prior to reconstruct the signal. The primary aversion towards the latter genre is due to its inference time iterative optimization and difficulty to scale to higher resolution. In this paper, going against the general trend, we focus on the second paradigm of inpainting and address both of its mentioned problems. Most importantly, we learn a data driven parametric network to directly predict a matching prior for a given masked image. This converts an iterative paradigm to a single feed forward inference pipeline with around 800X speedup. We also regularize our network with structural prior (computed from the masked image itself) which helps in better preservation of pose and size of the object to be inpainted. Moreover, to extend our model for sequence reconstruction, we propose a recurrent net based grouped latent prior learning. Finally, we leverage recent advancements in high resolution GAN training to scale our inpainting network to 256X256. Experiments (spanning across resolutions from 64X64 to 256X256) conducted on SVHN, Standford Cars, CelebA, CelebA-HQ and ImageNet image datasets, and FaceForensics video datasets reveal that we consistently improve upon contemporary benchmarks from both schools of approaches."}}

In this respect, there have been attempts to resolve or reduce the severity of this problem via detection and monitoring of locust breeding areas using satellites and sensors, or the use of chemicals to prevent the formation of swarms. However, such methods have not been able to suppress the emergence and the collective behaviour of locusts. The ability to predict the location of the locust swarms prior to their formation, on the other hand, can help people get prepared and tackle the infestation issue more effectively. Here, we use machine learning to predict the location of locust swarms using the available data published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The data includes the location of the observed swarms as well as environmental information, including soil moisture and the density of vegetation. The obtained results show that our proposed model can successfully, and with reasonable precision, predict the location of locust swarms, as well as their likely level of damage using a notion of density."}}

This is made possible with better initialization of the core iterative optimization involved in the framework. To our best knowledge, this is also the first attempt of GAN based video inpainting with consideration to temporal cues. On single image inpainting, we achieve about 4.5-5\u00d7 speedup and 80 \u00d7 on videos compared to baseline. Simultaneously, our method has better spatial and temporal reconstruction qualities as found on three image and one video dataset."}}
