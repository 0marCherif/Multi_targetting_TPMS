This task is of high relevance as it provides the surgeon with context-aware support and safety. The current go-to strategy for improving performance is the development of new network mechanisms. However, the performance of current state-of-the-art techniques is substantially lower than other surgical tasks. Why is this happening? This is the question that we address in this work. We present the first study to understand the failure of existing deep learning models through the lens of robustness and explainability. Firstly, we study current existing models under weak and strong $\\delta-$perturbations via an adversarial optimisation scheme. We then analyse the failure modes via feature based explanations. Our study reveals that the key to improving performance and increasing reliability is in the core and spurious attributes. Our work opens the door to more trustworthy and reliable deep learning models in surgical data science."}}
