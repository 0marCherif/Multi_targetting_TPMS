However, the security risk posed by a potential false friend has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we unveil the threat of hypocritical examples---inputs that are originally misclassified yet perturbed by a false friend to force correct predictions. While such perturbed examples seem harmless, we point out for the first time that they could be maliciously used to conceal the mistakes of a substandard (i.e., not as good as required) model during an evaluation. Once a deployer trusts the hypocritical performance and applies the \"well-performed\" model in real-world applications, unexpected failures may happen even in benign environments. More seriously, this security risk seems to be pervasive: we find that many types of substandard models are vulnerable to hypocritical examples across multiple datasets. Furthermore, we provide the first attempt to characterize the threat with a metric called hypocritical risk and try to circumvent it via several countermeasures. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the countermeasures, while the risk remains non-negligible even after adaptive robust training."}}

To handle this issue, popular re-sampling methods generally require in-distribution data to balance the class priors. However, obtaining suitable in-distribution data with precise labels for selected classes is challenging. In this paper, we theoretically show that out-of-distribution data (i.e., open-set samples) could be leveraged to augment the minority classes from a Bayesian perspective. Based on this motivation, we propose a novel method called Open-sampling, which utilizes open-set noisy labels to re-balance the class priors of the training dataset. For each open-set instance, the label is sampled from our pre-defined distribution that is complementary to the original class priors. Furthermore, class-dependent weights are generated to provide stronger regularization on the minority classes than on the majority classes. \nWe empirically show that Open-sampling not only re-balances the class prior but also encourages the neural network to learn separable representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing data re-balancing methods and can be easily incorporated into existing state-of-the-art methods to enhance their performance."}}

By formalizing this malicious attack as finding the worst-case training data within a specific $\\infty$-Wasserstein ball, we show that minimizing adversarial risk on the perturbed data is equivalent to optimizing an upper bound of natural risk on the original data. This implies that adversarial training can serve as a principled defense against delusive attacks. Thus, the test accuracy decreased by delusive attacks can be largely recovered by adversarial training. To further understand the internal mechanism of the defense, we disclose that adversarial training can resist the delusive perturbations by preventing the learner from overly relying on non-robust features in a natural setting. Finally, we complement our theoretical findings with a set of experiments on popular benchmark datasets, which show that the defense withstands six different practical attacks. Both theoretical and empirical results vote for adversarial training when confronted with delusive adversaries."}}

In the existing literature, open-set noises are always considered to be poisonous for generalization, similar to closed-set noises. In this paper, we empirically show that open-set noisy labels can be non-toxic and even benefit the robustness against inherent noisy labels. Inspired by the observations, we propose a simple yet effective regularization by introducing Open-set samples with Dynamic Noisy Labels (ODNL) into training. With ODNL, the extra capacity of the neural network can be largely consumed in a way that does not interfere with learning patterns from clean data. Through the lens of SGD noise, we show that the noises induced by our method are random-direction, conflict-free and biased, which may help the model converge to a flat minimum with superior stability and enforce the model to produce conservative predictions on Out-of-Distribution instances. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets with various types of noisy labels demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances the performance of many existing robust algorithms but also achieves significant improvement on Out-of-Distribution detection tasks even in the label noise setting.\n"}}

Recently, much research has been devoted to improving the model robustness by training with noise perturbations. Most existing studies assume a fixed perturbation level for all training examples, which however hardly holds in real tasks. In fact, excessive perturbations may destroy the discriminative content of an example, while deficient perturbations may fail to provide helpful information for improving the robustness. Motivated by this observation, we propose to adaptively adjust the perturbation levels for each example in the training process. Specifically, a novel active learning framework is proposed to allow the model interactively querying the correct perturbation level from human experts. By designing a cost-effective sampling strategy along with a new query type, the robustness can be significantly improved with a few queries. Both theoretical analysis and experimental studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}}
