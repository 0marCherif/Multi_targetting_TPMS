While there exist various 2D graph-based molecular pretraining approaches, these methods struggle to show statistically significant gains in predictive performance. Recent work have thus instead proposed 3D conformer-based pretraining under the task of denoising, which led to promising results. During downstream finetuning, however, models trained with 3D conformers require accurate atom-coordinates of previously unseen molecules, which are computationally expensive to acquire at scale. In light of this limitation, we propose D&D, a self-supervised molecular representation learning framework that pretrains a 2D graph encoder by distilling representations from a 3D denoiser. With denoising followed by cross-modal knowledge distillation, our approach enjoys use of knowledge obtained from denoising as well as painless application to downstream tasks with no access to accurate conformers. Experiments on real-world molecular property prediction datasets show that the graph encoder trained via D&D can infer 3D information based on the 2D graph and shows superior performance and label-efficiency against other baselines."}}

While there exist graph neural networks that leverage hyperbolic or spherical spaces to learn representations that embed such structures more accurately, these methods are confined under the message-passing paradigm, making the models vulnerable against side-effects such as oversmoothing and oversquashing. More recent work have proposed global attention-based graph Transformers that can easily model long-range interactions, but their extensions towards non-Euclidean geometry are yet unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Fully Product-Stereographic Transformer, a generalization of Transformers towards operating entirely on the product of constant curvature spaces. When combined with tokenized graph Transformers, our model can learn the curvature appropriate for the input graph in an end-to-end fashion, without the need of additional tuning on different curvature initializations. We also provide a kernelized approach to non-Euclidean attention, which enables our model to run in time and memory cost linear to the number of nodes and edges while respecting the underlying geometry. Experiments on graph reconstruction and node classification demonstrate the benefits of generalizing Transformers to the non-Euclidean domain."}}

Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.
