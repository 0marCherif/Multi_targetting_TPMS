Various tasks for classifying new species from image data can be modeled as a semi-supervised few-shot classification, which assumes a labeled and unlabeled training examples and a small support set of the target classes. Predicting target classes with a few support examples per class makes the learning task difficult for existing semi-supervised classification methods, including selftraining, which iteratively estimates class labels of unlabeled training examples to learn a classifier for the training classes. To exploit unlabeled training examples effectively, we adopt as the objective function the composite likelihood, which integrates discriminative and generative learning and suits better with deep neural networks than the parameter coupling prior, the other popular integrated learning approach. In our proposed model, the discriminative and generative models are respectively Prototypical Networks, which have shown excellent performance in various kinds of few-shot learning, and Normalizing Flow a deep invertible model which returns the exact marginal likelihood unlike the other three major methods, i.e., VAE, GAN, and autoregressive model. Our main originality lies in our integration of these components at a latent space level, which is effective in preventing overfitting. Experiments using mini-ImageNet and VGG-Face datasets show that our method outperforms selftraining based Prototypical Networks."}}

Such a re-id system suffers from a lack of training samples for deployment to practical security applications. To address this problem, we focus on the approach that transfers features of a CNN pre-trained on a large-scale person re-id dataset to a small-scale dataset. Most of the existing CNN feature transfer methods use the features of fully connected layers that entangle locally pooled features of different spatial locations on an image. Unfortunately, due to the difference of view angles and the bias of walking directions of the persons, each camera view in a dataset has a unique spatial property in the person image, which reduces the generality of the local pooling for different cameras/datasets. To account for the camera- and dataset-specific spatial bias, we propose a method to learn camera and dataset-specific position weight maps for discriminative local pooling of convolutional features. Our experiments on four public datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed feature transfer with a small number of training samples in the target datasets."}}

Detecting outliers has attracted attention of data miners for over two decades, since such outliers can be crucial in decision making, knowledge discovery, and fraud detection, to name but a few. The fact that outliers are scarce and often tedious to label motivated researchers to propose detection methods from an unlabeled dataset, some of which borrow strengths from relevant labeled datasets in the framework of transfer learning. He et al. tackled a more challenging situation in which the input datasets coming from multiple tasks are all unlabeled. Their method, ML-OCSVM, conducts multi-task learning with one-class support vector machines (SVMs) and yields a mean model plus task-specific increments to detect outliers in the test datasets of the multiple tasks. We inherit a part of their problem setting, taking only unlabeled datasets in the input, but increase the difficulty by assuming only one source dataset in addition to the target dataset. Consequently, the source dataset consists of examples relevant to the target task as well as examples that are less relevant. To cope with this situation, we extend Selective Transfer Machine, which weights individual examples in the framework of covariate shift and learns an SVM classifier, to our one-class setting by replacing the binary SVMs with one-class SVMs. Experiments on two public datasets and an artificial dataset show that our method mostly outperforms baseline methods, including ML-OCSVM and a state-of-the-art ensemble anomaly detection method, in F1 score and AUC."}}
