And while online search has been commonly used in perfect information games such as Chess and Go, online search methods for imperfect information games have only been introduced relatively recently. This paper addresses the question of what is a sound online algorithm in an imperfect information setting of two-player zero-sum games? We argue that the fixed-strategy definitions of exploitability and epsilon-Nash equilibria are ill suited to measure the worst-case performance of an online algorithm. We thus formalize epsilon-soundness, a concept that connects the worst-case performance of an online algorithm to the performance of an epsilon-Nash equilibrium. Our definition of soundness and the consistency hierarchy finally provide appropriate tools to analyze online algorithms in repeated imperfect information games. We thus inspect some of the previous online algorithms in a new light, bringing new insights into their worst case performance guarantees."}}

We argue that sequential Bayesian games constitute a natural class of games for generalizing these results. In particular, this model allows for an elegant formulation of the counterfactual regret minimization algorithm, called public-state CFR (PS-CFR), which naturally lends itself to an efficient implementation. Empirically, solving a poker subgame with 10^7 states by public-state CFR takes 3 minutes and 700 MB while a comparable version of vanilla CFR takes 5.5 hours and 20 GB. Additionally, the public-state formulation of CFR opens up the possibility for exploiting domain-specific assumptions, leading to a quadratic reduction in asymptotic complexity (and a further empirical speedup) over vanilla CFR in poker and other domains. Overall, this suggests that the ability to represent poker as a sequential Bayesian game played a key role in the success of CFR-based methods. Finally, we extend public-state CFR to general extensive-form games, arguing that this extension enjoys some - but not all - of the benefits of the version for sequential Bayesian games."}}

This paper addresses the question of what is a sound online algorithm in an imperfect information setting of two-player zero-sum games. We argue that the~fixed-strategy~definitions of exploitability and $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibria are ill-suited to measure an online algorithm's worst-case performance. We thus formalize $\\epsilon$-soundness, a concept that connects the worst-case performance of an online algorithm to the performance of an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium. As $\\epsilon$-soundness can be difficult to compute in general, we introduce a consistency framework -- a hierarchy that connects an online algorithm's behavior to a Nash equilibrium. These multiple levels of consistency describe in what sense an online algorithm plays \"just like a fixed Nash equilibrium\". These notions further illustrate the difference between perfect and imperfect information settings, as the same consistency guarantees have different worst-case online performance in perfect and imperfect information games. The definitions of soundness and the consistency hierarchy finally provide appropriate tools to analyze online algorithms in repeated imperfect information games. We thus inspect some of the previous online algorithms in a new light, bringing new insights into their worst-case performance guarantees."}}

Continual Resolving (CR) is a recent theoretically sound approach to online game playing that has been used to outperform human professionals in poker. However, parts of the algorithm were specific to poker, which enjoys many properties not shared by other imperfect information games. We present a domain-independent formulation of CR applicable to any two-player zero-sum extensive-form games (EFGs). It works with an abstract resolving algorithm, which can be instantiated by various EFG solvers. We further describe and implement its Monte Carlo variant (MCCR) which uses Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) as a resolver. We prove the correctness of CR and show an $O(T^-1/2 )$-dependence of MCCR's exploitability on the computation time.
