Our method utilizes vector quantization to transform the representations of a classifier into a discrete, class-specific latent space. The class-specific codebooks act as a bottleneck that forces the interpreter to focus on the parts of the input data deemed relevant by the classifier for making a prediction. We evaluated our method through quantitative and qualitative studies and found that PIQ generates interpretations that are more easily understood by participants to our user studies when compared to several other interpretation methods in the literature."}}

This has allowed the community to make progress in tasks like zero-shot classification, which would otherwise not be possible. However, learning such representations requires a large amount of human-annotated audio-text pairs. In this paper, we study unsupervised approaches to improve the learning framework of such representations with unpaired text and audio. We explore domain-unspecific and domain-specific curation methods to create audio-text pairs that we use to further improve the model. We also show that when domain-specific curation is used in conjunction with a soft-labeled contrastive loss, we are able to obtain significant improvement in terms of zero-shot classification performance on downstream sound event classification or acoustic scene classification tasks."}}

Specifically, we target cry-based detection of neurological injury as well as identification of cry triggers such as pain, hunger, and discomfort. Annotating a large database in the medical setting is expensive and time-consuming, typically requiring the collaboration of several experts over years. Leveraging large amounts of unlabeled audio data to learn useful representations can lower the cost of building robust models and, ultimately, clinical solutions. In this work, we experiment with self-supervised pre-training of a convolutional neural network on large audio datasets. We show that pre-training with SSL contrastive loss (SimCLR) performs significantly better than supervised pre-training for both neuro injury and cry triggers. In addition, we demonstrate further performance gains through SSL-based domain adaptation using unlabeled infant cries. We also show that using such SSL-based pre-training for adaptation to cry sounds decreases the need for labeled data of the overall system."}}

Our main goal is to develop a framework where the model can be updated without relying on labeled data. For this purpose, we propose adopting representation learning, where an encoder is trained using unlabeled data. This learning framework enables the study and implementation of a practically relevant use case where only a small amount of the labels is available in a continual learning context. We also make the empirical observation that a similarity-based representation learning method within this framework is robust to forgetting even if no explicit mechanism against forgetting is employed. We show that this approach obtains similar performance compared to several distillation-based continual learning methods when employed on self-supervised representation learning methods. "}}

This paper contributes to fill this gap in two ways. First, we release the REAL-M dataset, a crowd-sourced corpus of real-life mixtures. Secondly, we address the problem of performance evaluation of real-life mixtures, where the ground truth is not available. We bypass this issue by carefully designing a blind Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SI-SNR) neural estimator. Through a user study, we show that our estimator reliably evaluates the separation performance on real mixtures. The performance predictions of the SI-SNR estimator indeed correlate well with human opinions. Moreover, we observe that the performance trends predicted by our estimator on the REAL-M dataset closely follow those achieved on synthetic benchmarks when evaluating popular speech separation models.

These models, however, are computationally-demanding and require a lot of learnable parameters. This paper explores Transformer-based speech separation with a reduced computational cost. Our main contribution is the development of the Resource-Efficient Separation Transformer (RE-SepFormer), a self-attention-based architecture that reduces the computational burden in two ways. First, it uses non-overlapping blocks in the latent space. Second, it operates on compact latent summaries calculated from each chunk. The RE-SepFormer reaches a competitive performance on the popular WSJ0-2Mix and WHAM! datasets in both causal and non-causal settings. Remarkably, it scales significantly better than the previous Transformer and RNN-based architectures in terms of memory and inference-time, making it more suitable for processing long mixtures."}}
