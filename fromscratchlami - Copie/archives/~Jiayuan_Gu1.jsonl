To tackle the entire task, prior work chains multiple stationary manipulation skills with a point-goal navigation skill, which are learned individually on subtasks. Although more effective than monolithic end-to-end RL policies, this framework suffers from compounding errors in skill chaining, e.g., navigating to a bad location where a stationary manipulation skill can not reach its target to manipulate. To this end, we propose that the manipulation skills should include mobility to have flexibility in interacting with the target object from multiple locations and at the same time the navigation skill could have multiple end points which lead to successful manipulation. We operationalize these ideas by implementing mobile manipulation skills rather than stationary ones and training a navigation skill trained with region goal instead of point goal. We evaluate our multi-skill mobile manipulation method M3 on 3 challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks in the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB), and show superior performance as compared to the baselines."}}

Inspired by the underlying mechanism of the sensors, we designed a fully physics-grounded simulation pipeline that includes material acquisition, ray-tracing-based infrared (IR) image rendering, IR noise simulation, and depth estimation. The pipeline is able to generate depth maps with material-dependent error patterns similar to a real depth sensor in real time. We conduct real experiments to show that perception algorithms and reinforcement learning policies trained in our simulation platform could transfer well to the real-world test cases without any fine-tuning. Furthermore, due to the high degree of realism of this simulation, our depth sensor simulator can be used as a convenient testbed to evaluate the algorithm performance in the real world, which will largely reduce the human effort in developing robotic algorithms. The entire pipeline has been integrated into the SAPIEN simulator and is open-sourced to promote the research of vision and robotics communities."}}

Different from previous methods, we address the problem of learning 3D complete shape from unaligned and real-world partial point clouds. To this end, we propose a weakly-supervised method to estimate both 3D canonical shape and 6-DoF pose for alignment, given multiple partial observations associated with the same instance. The network jointly optimizes canonical shapes and poses with multi-view geometry constraints during training, and can infer the complete shape given a single partial point cloud. Moreover, learned pose estimation can facilitate partial point cloud registration. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that it is feasible and promising to learn 3D shape completion through large-scale data without shape and pose supervision."}}

We propose a two-stage framework, which refactorizes a high-reward teacher policy into a generalizable student policy with strong inductive bias. Particularly, we implement an object-centric GNN-based student policy, whose input objects are learned from images through self-supervised learning. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on four difficult tasks that require compositional generalizability, and achieve superior performance compared to baselines."}}

The key idea is to leverage the feedback signal provided by the forward process and learn an iterative update model. Specifically, at each iteration, the neural network takes the feedback as input and outputs an update on current estimation. Our approach does not have any restrictions on the forward process; it does not require any prior knowledge either. Through the feedback information, our model not only can produce accurate estimations that are coherent to the input observation but also is capable of recovering from early incorrect predictions. We verify the performance of our model over a wide range of inverse problems, including 6-DoF pose estimation, illumination estimation, as well as inverse kinematics. Comparing to traditional optimization-based methods, we can achieve comparable or better performance while being two to three orders of magnitude faster. Compared to deep learning-based approaches, our model consistently improves the performance on all metrics."}}

A plethora of existing works is constantly pushing the state-of-the-art performance in the deep learning era. However, there remains a much more difficult and under-explored issue on how to generalize the learned skills over unseen object categories that have very different shape geometry distributions. In this paper, we bring in the concept of compositional generalizability and propose a novel framework that could better generalize to these unseen categories. We factorize the 3D shape reconstruction problem into proper sub-problems, each of which is tackled by a carefully designed neural sub-module with generalizability concerns. The intuition behind our formulation is that object parts (slates and cylindrical parts), their relationships (adjacency and translation symmetry), and shape substructures (T-junctions and a symmetric group of parts) are mostly shared across object categories, even though object geometries may look very different (e.g. chairs and cabinets). Experiments on PartNet show that we achieve superior performance than state-of-the-art. This validates our problem factorization and network designs."}}
