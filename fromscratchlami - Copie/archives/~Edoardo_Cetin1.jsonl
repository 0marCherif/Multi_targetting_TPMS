In this work, we extend hyperbolic RL to continuous control by introducing a novel hyperbolic actor-critic model. Empirically, our simple implementation outperforms its Euclidean counterpart, with significant gains on 16/24 tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite with pixel inputs. Notably, in the low-data regime, our method even outperforms several pre-trained unsupervised RL agents. Our findings show that hyperbolic representations provide a valuable inductive bias for continuous control."}}

We model agent behavior as the steady-state distribution of a parameterized reasoning Markov chain (RMC), optimized with a new tractable estimate of the policy gradient. We perform action selection by simulating the RMC for enough reasoning steps to approach its steady-state distribution. We show our framework has several useful properties that are inherently missing from traditional RL. For instance, it allows agent behavior to approximate any continuous distribution over actions by parameterizing the RMC with a simple Gaussian transition function. Moreover, the number of reasoning steps to reach convergence can scale adaptively with the difficulty of each action selection decision and can be accelerated by re-using past solutions. Our resulting algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in popular Mujoco and DeepMind Control benchmarks, both for proprioceptive and pixel-based tasks.\n"}}

In this work, we propose a novel learnable penalty to enact such pessimism, based on a new way to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty. Furthermore, we propose to learn the penalty alongside the critic with dual TD-learning, a strategy to estimate and minimize the bias magnitude in the target returns. Our method enables us to accurately counteract overestimation bias throughout training without incurring the downsides of overly pessimistic targets. Empirically, by integrating our method and other orthogonal improvements with popular off-policy algorithms, we achieve state-of-the-art results in continuous control tasks from both proprioceptive and pixel observations.

Imitation learning methods aim to replicate such capabilities, however, they generally depend on access to a full set of optimal states and actions taken with the agent's actuators and from the agent's point of view. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm - called Disentangling Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (DisentanGAIL) - with the purpose of bypassing such constraints. Our algorithm enables autonomous agents to learn directly from high dimensional observations of an expert performing a task, by making use of adversarial learning with a latent representation inside the discriminator network. Such latent representation is regularized through mutual information constraints to incentivize learning only features that encode information about the completion levels of the task being demonstrated. This allows to obtain a shared feature space to successfully perform imitation while disregarding the differences between the expert's and the agent's domains. Empirically, our algorithm is able to efficiently imitate in a diverse range of control problems including balancing, manipulation and locomotive tasks, while being robust to various domain differences in terms of both environment appearance and agent embodiment."}}

Saving a subset of training samples of previously seen classes in the memory and replaying them during new training phases is proven to be an efficient and effective way to fulfil this aim. It is evident that the larger number of exemplars the model inherits the better performance it can achieve. However, finding a trade-off between the model performance and the number of samples to save for each class is still an open problem for replay-based incremental learning and is increasingly desirable for real-life applications. In this paper, we approach this open problem by tapping into a two-step compression approach. The first step is a lossy compression, we propose to encode input images and save their discrete latent representations in the form of codes that are learned using a hierarchical Vector Quantised Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). In the second step, we further compress codes losslessly by learning a hierarchical latent variable model with bits-back asymmetric numeral systems (BB-ANS). To compensate for the information lost in the first step compression, we introduce an Information Back (IB) mechanism that utilizes real exemplars for a contrastive learning loss to regularize the training of a classifier. By maintaining all seen exemplars' representations in the format of `codes', Discrete Representation Replay (DRR) outperforms the state-of-art method on CIFAR-100 by a margin of 4% accuracy with a much less memory cost required for saving samples. Incorporated with IB and saving a small set of old raw exemplars as well, the accuracy of DRR can be further improved by 2% accuracy."}}
