Existing time-to-event (survival) models have focused primarily on preserving pairwise ordering of estimated event times (i.e., relative risk). We propose neural time-to-event models that account for calibration and uncertainty while predicting accurate absolute event times. Specifically, an adversarial nonparametric model is introduced for estimating matched time-to-event distributions for probabilistically concentrated and accurate predictions. We also consider replacing the discriminator of the adversarial nonparametric model with a survival-function matching estimator that accounts for model calibration. The proposed estimator can be used as a means of estimating and comparing conditional survival distributions while accounting for the predictive uncertainty of probabilistic models. Extensive experiments show that the distribution matching methods outperform existing approaches in terms of both calibration and concentration of time-to-event distributions."}}

However, the extreme diversity of the adaptive immune repertoire presents challenges in reliably identifying disease-specific TCRs. Population genetics and sequencing depth can also have strong systematic effects on repertoires, which requires careful consideration when developing diagnostic models. We present an Adaptive Immune Repertoire-Invariant Variational Autoencoder (AIRIVA), a generative model that learns a low-dimensional, interpretable, and compositional representation of TCR repertoires to disentangle such systematic effects in repertoires. We apply AIRIVA to two infectious disease case-studies: COVID-19 (natural infection and vaccination) and the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2), and empirically show that we can disentangle the individual disease signals. We further demonstrate AIRIVA's capability to: learn from unlabelled samples; generate in-silico TCR repertoires by intervening on the latent factors; and identify disease-associated TCRs validated using TCR annotations from external assay data."}}

Unfortunately, this flexibility comes at the cost of understanding the dynamical system, for which ODEs are used ubiquitously. Further, experimental data are collected under various conditions (inputs), such as treatments, or grouped in some way, such as part of sub-populations. Understanding the effects of these system inputs on system outputs is crucial to have any meaningful model of a dynamical system. To that end, we propose a structured latent ODE model that explicitly captures system input variations within its latent representation. Building on a static latent variable specification, our model learns (independent) stochastic factors of variation for each input to the system, thus separating the effects of the system inputs in the latent space. This approach provides actionable modeling through the controlled generation of time-series data for novel input combinations (or perturbations). Additionally, we propose a flexible approach for quantifying uncertainties, leveraging a quantile regression formulation. Results on challenging biological datasets show consistent improvements over competitive baselines in the controlled generation of observational data and inference of biologically meaningful system inputs."}}

These models deliver better prediction and goodness-of-fit than their RNN-based counterparts. However, they often require high computational and memory complexity requirements and sometimes fail to adequately capture the triggering function of the underlying process. So motivated, we introduce an efficient and general encoding of the historical event sequence by replacing the complex (multilayered) attention structures with triggering kernels of the observed data. Noting the similarity between the triggering kernels of a point process and the attention scores, we use a triggering kernel to replace the weights used to build history representations. Our estimate for the triggering function is equipped with a sigmoid gating mechanism that captures local-in-time triggering effects that are otherwise challenging with standard decaying-over-time kernels. Further, taking both event type representations and temporal embeddings as inputs, the model learns the underlying triggering type-time kernel parameters given pairs of event types. We present experiments on synthetic and real data sets widely used by competing models, while further including a COVID-19 dataset to illustrate a scenario where longitudinal covariates are available. Results show the proposed model outperforms existing approaches while being more efficient in terms of computational complexity and yielding interpretable results via direct application of the newly introduced kernel."}}

In practice, there is often great population-level phenotypic heterogeneity, resulting from (unknown) subpopulations with diverse risk profiles or survival distributions. As a result, there is an unmet need in survival analysis for identifying subpopulations with distinct risk profiles, while jointly accounting for accurate individualized time-to-event predictions. An approach that addresses this need is likely to improve the characterization of individual outcomes by leveraging regularities in subpopulations, thus accounting for population-level heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametrics approach that represents observations (subjects) in a clustered latent space, and encourages accurate time-to-event predictions and clusters (subpopulations) with distinct risk profiles. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements in predictive performance and interpretability relative to existing state-of-the-art survival analysis models."}}

A neural variational inference framework is proposed for training, where gradients are directly back-propagated through the discrete latent variable to optimize the hash function. We also draw connections between proposed method and rate-distortion theory, which provides a theoretical foundation for the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models on both unsupervised and supervised scenarios."}}
