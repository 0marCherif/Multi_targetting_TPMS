Since the performance of each predictor may vary over time, it is desirable to use not the single best predictor as a benchmark, but rather a dynamic combination which follows different predictors at different times. We design algorithms that combine predictions and are competitive against such dynamic combinations for a wide class of online problems, namely, metrical task systems. Against the best (in hindsight) unconstrained combination of $\\ell$ predictors, we obtain a competitive ratio of $O(\\ell^2)$, and show that this is best possible. However, for a benchmark with slightly constrained number of switches between different predictors, we can get a $(1+\\epsilon)$-competitive algorithm. Moreover, our algorithms can be adapted to access predictors in a bandit-like fashion, querying only one predictor at a time. An unexpected implication of one of our lower bounds is a new structural insight about covering formulations for the $k$-server problem."}}

Here, each server si lies in its own metric space Mi. A request is a k-tuple r = (r1,r2,\u2026 ,rk, which is served by moving some server si to the point ri \u2208 Mi, and the goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by the servers. Despite much work, no f(k)-competitive algorithm is known for the problem for k > 2 servers, even for special cases such as uniform metrics and lines. Here, we consider the problem in uniform metrics and give the first f(k)-competitive algorithms for general k. In particular, we obtain deterministic and randomized algorithms with competitive ratio k \u00b7 2k and O(k3 log k), respectively. Our deterministic bound is based on a novel application of the polynomial method to online algorithms, and essentially matches the long-known lower bound of 2k-1. We also give a 22O(k)-competitive deterministic algorithm for weighted uniform metrics, which also essentially matches the recent doubly exponential lower bound for the problem."}}

It has also played a central role in the development of learning-augmented algorithms -- a recent line of research that aims to ameliorate the shortcomings of classical worst-case analysis by giving algorithms access to predictions. Such predictions can typically be generated using a machine learning approach, but they are inherently imperfect. Previous work on learning-augmented paging has investigated predictions on (i) when the current page will be requested again (reoccurrence predictions), (ii) the current state of the cache in an optimal algorithm (state predictions), (iii) all requests until the current page gets requested again, and (iv) the relative order in which pages are requested. We study learning-augmented paging from the new perspective of requiring the least possible amount of predicted information. More specifically, the predictions obtained alongside each page request are limited to one bit only. We consider two natural such setups: (i) discard predictions, in which the predicted bit denotes whether or not it is ``safe'' to evict this page, and (ii) phase predictions, where the bit denotes whether the current page will be requested in the next phase (for an appropriate partitioning of the input into phases). We develop algorithms for each of the two setups that satisfy all three desirable properties of learning-augmented algorithms -- that is, they are consistent, robust and smooth -- despite being limited to a one-bit prediction per request. We also present lower bounds establishing that our algorithms are essentially best possible."}}

This fundamental online problem was first studied by Friedman and Linial (DCG 1993). They proved an $$\\varOmega (\\sqrt{d})$$ \u03a9(d) lower bound on the competitive ratio, and conjectured that a competitive ratio depending only on d is possible. However, despite much interest in the problem, the conjecture remains wide open. We consider the setting in which the convex bodies are nested: $$F_1 \\supset \\cdots \\supset F_n$$ F1\u2283\u22ef\u2283Fn. The nested setting is closely related to extending the online LP framework of Buchbinder and Naor (ESA 2005) to arbitrary linear constraints. Moreover, this setting retains much of the difficulty of the general setting and captures an essential obstacle in resolving Friedman and Linial\u2019s conjecture.
