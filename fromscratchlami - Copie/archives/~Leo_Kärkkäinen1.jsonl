Through ray tracing, it\nseems intuitively feasible to thus create a virtual point source at very high frequencies, but we provide a more\nrigorous analysis to determine what will happen at intermediate frequencies where the wavelength is of a similar\nmagnitude to the diameter of the disk or sphere. We show that a smoother off-axis response is obtained with a dipole\npressure source, which does not obstruct the scattered sound, rather than a monopole velocity source. Hence, an\nelectrostatic loudspeaker, for example, would be more suitable than a dynamic one. The sphere may also serve as a\nspherical approximation of a human head, in which case the loudspeaker would become an open headphone that is\nnot sealed to the ear."}}

Recently, approximate Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have been proposed for this task, but previous studies have only considered the binary referable/non-referable diabetic retinopathy classification applied to benchmark datasets. We present novel results for 9 BNNs by systematically investigating a clinical dataset and 5-class classification scheme, together with benchmark datasets and binary classification scheme. Moreover, we derive a connection between entropy-based uncertainty measure and classifier risk, from which we develop a novel uncertainty measure. We observe that the previously proposed entropy-based uncertainty measure improves performance on the clinical dataset for the binary classification scheme, but not to such an extent as on the benchmark datasets. It improves performance in the clinical 5-class classification scheme for the benchmark datasets, but not for the clinical dataset. Our novel uncertainty measure generalizes to the clinical dataset and to one benchmark dataset. Our findings suggest that BNNs can be utilized for uncertainty estimation in classifying diabetic retinopathy on clinical data, though proper uncertainty measures are needed to optimize the desired performance measure. In addition, methods developed for benchmark datasets might not generalize to clinical datasets."}}

In this case, however, a power series solution to the radiation integral is derived in order to eliminate the need for numerical integration. Hence, a set of simultaneous equations is obtained by simply equating the coefficients of the power series, which leads to two mathematical functions, one real and one imaginary, that can be applied to any radial velocity distribution. This provides an alternative method to obtain the sound scattered by a disk or the complementary hole in an infinite resilient screen according to Babinet\u2019s principle. Using the principle of superposition (or Gutin concept), it is shown how the sound radiation characteristics of a disk radiating from just one side can be obtained by combining the radiation field of a disk in a finite baffle with that of a disk in an infinite baffle. This one-sided radiator may be interpreted as a disk in a thin, circular enclosure.\n"}}

However, collecting and annotating large datasets can be a very cumbersome and expensive task. We tackle these problems with a virtual database approach where training data is generated using computer simulations of related phenomena. Specifically, we concentrate on the following problem: can cardiovascular indices such as aortic elasticity, diastolic and systolic blood pressures, and blood flow from heart be predicted continuously using wearable photoplethysmographic sensors? We simulate the blood flow using a haemodynamic model consisting of the entire human circulation. Repeated evaluation of the simulator allows us to create a database of \u201cvirtual subjects\u201d with size that is only limited by available computational resources. Using this database, we train neural networks to predict the cardiac indices from photoplethysmographic signal waveform. We consider two approaches: neural networks based on predefined input features and deep convolutional neural networks taking waveform directly as the input. The performance of the methods is demonstrated using numerical examples, thus carrying out a preliminary assessment of the approaches. The results show improvements in accuracy compared with the previous methods. The improvements are especially significant with indices related to aortic elasticity and maximum blood flow. The proposed approach would provide new means to measure cardiovascular health continuously, for example, with a simple wrist device."}}

Such model can also be used to create databases of virtual subjects, with sizes limited only by computational resources. In this work, we study if it is possible to estimate cardiovascular health indices using machine learning approaches. In particular, we carry out theoretical assessment of estimating aortic pulse wave velocity, diastolic and systolic blood pressure and stroke volume using pulse transit/arrival timings derived from photopletyshmography signals. For predictions, we train Gaussian process regression using a database of virtual subjects generated with a cardiovascular simulator. Simulated results provides theoretical assessment of accuracy for predictions of the health indices. For instance, aortic pulse wave velocity can be estimated with a high accuracy (r > 0.9) when photopletyshmography is measured from left carotid artery using a combination of foot-to-foot pulse transmit time and peak location derived for the predictions. Similar accuracy can be reached for diastolic blood pressure, but predictions of systolic blood pressure are less accurate (r > 0.75) and the stroke volume predictions are mostly contributed by heart rate."}}

However, such solutions are mostly taking advantage of heart rate measurement. Other health indices such as blood pressure and pulse wave velocity reflecting to the condition of cardiovascular system would also be of great interest, but such solutions for continuous monitoring are barely existing or are at least unreliable. In this paper, we use computational modelling to assess theoretical capabilities of such measurements. We concentrate on predicting health indices using on pulse transmit time type of measurements. Such measurements could be carried out, for example, with photopletyshmography sensor or an optical sensor already found from several wearable sport trackers. We use cardiovascular modelling to create a database of \u201cvirtual subjects\u201d, which is applied with machine learning to construct predictors for health indices.

They have not been used commonly in unsupervised tasks, because a probabilistic interpretation of the model has been difficult. Recently, two different frameworks, GSN and NADE, provide a connection between reconstruction and probabilistic modeling, which makes the interpretation possible. As far as we know, neither GSN or NADE have been studied in the context of time series before. As an example of an unsupervised task, we study the problem of filling in gaps in high-dimensional time series with complex dynamics. Although unidirectional RNNs have recently been trained successfully to model such time series, inference in the negative time direction is non-trivial. We propose two probabilistic interpretations of bidirectional RNNs that can be used to reconstruct missing gaps efficiently. Our experiments on text data show that both proposed methods are much more accurate than unidirectional reconstructions, although a bit less accurate than a computationally complex bidirectional Bayesian inference on the unidirectional RNN. We also provide results on music data for which the Bayesian inference is computationally infeasible, demonstrating the scalability of the proposed methods."}}
