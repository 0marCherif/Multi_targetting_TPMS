FDPs require a new mathematical framework to describe the forward and backward dynamics, and several extensions to derive practical training objectives. These include infinite-dimensional versions of Girsanov theorem, in order to be able to compute an ELBO, and of the sampling theorem, in order to guarantee that functional evaluations in a countable set of points are equivalent to infinite-dimensional functions. We use FDPs to build a new breed of generative models in function spaces, which do not require specialized network architectures, and that can work with any kind of continuous data. Our results on real data show that FDPs achieve high-quality image generation, using a simple MLP architecture with orders of magnitude fewer parameters than existing diffusion models."}}

(Avancements dans la scalabilit\u00e9 et l'inf\u00e9rence des mod\u00e8les profonds probabilistes)", "abstract": "Throughout the last decade, deep learning has reached a sufficient level of maturity to become the preferred choice to solve machine learning-related problems or to aid decision making processes.At the same time, deep learning is generally not equipped with the ability to accurately quantify the uncertainty of its predictions, thus making these models less suitable for risk-critical applications.A possible solution to address this problem is to employ a Bayesian formulation; however, while this offers an elegant treatment, it is analytically intractable and it requires approximations.Despite the huge advancements in the last few years, there is still a long way to make these approaches widely applicable.In this thesis, we address some of the challenges for modern Bayesian deep learning, by proposing and studying solutions to improve scalability and inference of these models.The first part of the thesis is dedicated to deep models where inference is carried out using variational inference (VI).Specifically, we study the role of initialization of the variational parameters and we show how careful initialization strategies can make VI deliver good performance even in large scale models.In this part of the thesis we also study the over-regularization effect of the variational objective on over-parametrized models.To tackle this problem, we propose an novel parameterization based on the Walsh-Hadamard transform; not only this solves the over-regularization effect of VI but it also allows us to model non-factorized posteriors while keeping time and space complexity under control.The second part of the thesis is dedicated to a study on the role of priors.While being an essential building block of Bayes' rule, picking good priors for deep learning models is generally hard.For this reason, we propose two different strategies based (i) on the functional interpretation of neural networks and (ii) on a scalable procedure to perform model selection on the prior hyper-parameters, akin to maximization of the marginal likelihood.To conclude this part, we analyze a different kind of Bayesian model (Gaussian process) and we study the effect of placing a prior on all the hyper-parameters of these models, including the additional variables required by the inducing-point approximations.We also show how it is possible to infer free-form posteriors on these variables, which conventionally would have been otherwise point-estimated."}}

Besides enabling scalability, one of their main advantages over sparse approximations using direct marginal likelihood maximization is that they provide a robust alternative for point estimation of the inducing inputs, i.e. the location of the inducing variables. In this work we challenge the common wisdom that optimizing the inducing inputs in the variational framework yields optimal performance. We show that, by revisiting old model approximations such as the fully-independent training conditionals endowed with powerful sampling-based inference methods, treating both inducing locations and GP hyper-parameters in a Bayesian way can improve performance significantly. Based on stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, we develop a fully Bayesian approach to scalable GP and deep GP models, and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance through an extensive experimental campaign across several regression and classification problems."}}

The non-linear nature of the model implies that any distribution of the parameters has an unpredictable effect on the distribution of the function output. Gaussian processes offer a rigorous framework to define prior distributions over the space of functions. Our proposal is to impose such functional priors on well-established architectures of neural networks by means of minimising the Wasserstein distance between samples of stochastic processes. Early experimental results demonstrate the potential of functional priors for Bayesian neural networks.\n"}}
