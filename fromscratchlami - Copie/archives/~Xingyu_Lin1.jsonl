Ideally, a robot trying to unfold a crumpled or folded cloth should be able to reason about the cloth\u2019s occluded regions. We leverage recent advances in pose estimation for cloth to build a system that uses explicit occlusion reasoning to unfold a crumpled cloth. Specifically, we first learn a model to reconstruct the mesh of the cloth. However, the model will likely have errors due to the complexities of the cloth configurations and due to ambiguities from occlusions. Our main insight is that we can further refine the predicted reconstruction by performing test-time finetuning with self-supervised losses. The obtained reconstructed mesh allows us to use a mesh-based dynamics model for planning while reasoning about occlusions. We evaluate our system both on cloth flattening as well as on cloth canonicalization, in which the objective is to manipulate the cloth into a canonical pose. Our experiments show that our method significantly outperforms prior methods that do not explicitly account for occlusions or perform test-time optimization."}}

We propose a novel segmentation pipeline that can segment transparent liquids such as water from a static, RGB image without requiring any manual annotations or heating of the liquid for training. Instead, we use a generative model that is capable of translating unpaired images of colored liquids into synthetically generated transparent liquid images. Segmentation labels of colored liquids are obtained automatically using background subtraction.  We use paired samples of synthetically generated transparent liquid images and background subtraction for our segmentation pipeline. Our experiments show that we are able to accurately predict a segmentation mask for transparent liquids without requiring any manual annotations. We demonstrate the utility of transparent liquid segmentation in a robotic pouring task that controls pouring by perceiving liquid height in a transparent cup.

However, such gradient-based trajectory optimization typically requires access to the full simulator states and can only solve short-horizon, single-skill tasks due to local optima. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named DiffSkill, that uses a differentiable physics simulator for skill abstraction to solve long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks from sensory observations. In particular, we first obtain short-horizon skills using individual tools from a gradient-based optimizer, using the full state information in a differentiable simulator; we then learn a neural skill abstractor from the demonstration trajectories which takes RGBD images as input. Finally, we plan over the skills by finding the intermediate goals and then solve long-horizon tasks. We show the advantages of our method in a new set of sequential deformable object manipulation tasks compared to previous reinforcement learning algorithms and compared to the trajectory optimizer.

In contrast to previous model-based approaches that learn a pixel-based dynamics model or a compressed latent vector dynamics, we propose to learn a particle-based dynamics model from a partial point cloud observation. To overcome the challenges of partial observability, we infer which visible points are connected on the underlying cloth mesh.  We then learn a dynamics model over this visible connectivity graph. Compared to previous learning-based approaches, our model poses strong inductive bias with its particle based representation for learning the underlying cloth physics; it can generalize to cloths with novel shapes; it is invariant to visual features; and the predictions can be more easily visualized. We show that our method greatly outperforms previous state-of-the-art model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer where we deploy the model trained in simulation on a Franka arm and show that the model can successfully smooth cloths of different materials, geometries and colors from crumpled configurations.
