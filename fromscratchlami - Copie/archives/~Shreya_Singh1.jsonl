Emotion, itself, is not uniformly distributed across an utterance. The extraction of relevant portions from an utterance that contain meaningful information in terms of emotion is always challenging. The vowel like regions (VLRs) are known to contain emotion-specific information. However, for spontaneous speech, all the VLRs in an utterance do not contain emotion. This paper proposes a method for extracting the emotional VLRs from a set of vowels in an utterance based on the fundamental frequency of a VLR. Further, the recently proposed epoch synchronous single frequency cepstral coefficients (SFCCs) features are combined with the epoch-based features producing 1.33% better result than state-of-the-art technique. In general, the accuracy value reduces for long utterances because all the VLRs in a long utterance are not consistent with the ground truth label. However, the proposed approach produced an improvement in accuracy by 8.22% for the long utterances when emotional VLRs were used in place of all VLRs."}}

Unlike offline, in online fashion shopping, customers don\u2019t have the luxury of trying a product and have to rely on the product images and size charts to select a product that fits well. As a result of this gap, online shopping yields a large percentage of returns due to size and fit. Hence providing size recommendation for customers enhances their buying experience and also reduces operational costs incurred during exchanges and returns. In this paper, we present a robust personalized size recommendation system which predicts the most appropriate size for users based on their order history and product data. We embed both users and products in a size and fit space using skip-gram based Word2Vec model and employ GBM classifier to predict the fit likelihood. We describe the architecture of the system and challenges we encountered while developing it. Further we also analyze the performance of our system through extensive offline and online testing, compare our technique with another state-of-art technique and share our findings."}}

Search, recommendations, personalization have become essential building blocks for serving customer needs. Efficacy of such systems is dependent on a thorough understanding of products and their representation. Multiple information sources and data types provide a complete picture of the product on the platform. While each of these tasks shares some common characteristics, typically product embeddings are trained and used in isolation. In this paper, we propose a framework to combine multiple data sources and learn unified embeddings for products on our e-commerce platform. Our product embeddings are built from three types of data sources - catalog text data, a user's clickstream session data and product images. We use various techniques like denoising auto-encoders for text, Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) for clickstream data, Siamese neural network architecture for image data and combined ensemble over the above methods for unified embeddings. Further, we compare and analyze the performance of these embeddings across three unrelated real-world e-commerce tasks specifically checking product attribute coverage, finding similar products and predicting returns. We show that unified product embeddings perform uniformly well across all these tasks."}}

Due to lack of try out options during online shopping, it becomes pivotal to provide customers with as much of this information as possible to enhance their shopping experience. Also it becomes essential to provide same experience for new customers. Our work here focuses on providing a production ready size recommendation system for shoes and address the challenge of providing recommendation for users with no previous purchases on the platform. In our work, we present a probabilistic approach based on user co-purchase data facilitated by generating a brand-brand relationship graph. Specifically we address two challenges that are commonly faced while implementing such solution. 1. Sparse signals for less popular or new products in the system 2. Extending the solution for new users. Further we compare and contrast this approach with our previous work and show significant improvement both in recommendation precision and coverage."}}

However, there are few underlying issues associated with this technique which are still a matter of concern for the security community. Achieving flatness or producing honeywords that are equally likely to the original password is one such major concern that requires further attention. Though recent studies have made significant efforts to meet this flatness criterion, our analysis shows that they still fall short to address this issue. In this paper, at first, we have made a detailed investigation to define the basic properties for achieving flatness. Followed by this, we have proposed a questionnaire-based authentication technique which can generate significantly flatter list of honeywords compared to existing state-of-the-art. Further study reveals that the proposed technique passes the other essential evaluation criteria of honeyword based authentication technique with flying colors."}}

However, the usage of \\textit{honeywords} has strongly been criticized under the different security and usability parameters. Though many of these issues have been successfully resolved, research in this domain is still facing difficulties in \\textit{achieving flatness} (or producing the equally probable \\textit{honeywords} with reference to the original password). Though recent studies have made a significant effort to meet this criterion, we show that they either fall short or are based on some unrealistic assumptions. To practically fulfill this flatness criterion, we propose a questionnaire-oriented authentication system based on the episodic (or long term) memory of the users. Our study reveals that proposed mechanism is capable of generating significantly improved flatter list of \\textit{honeywords} compared to the existing protocols. The subsequent discussion shows that the proposed system also overcomes all the limitations of the existing state of arts with no lesser than $95\\%$ goodness."}}
