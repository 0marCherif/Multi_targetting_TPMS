Machine learning methods like autoregressive neural networks, used with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, provide good approximations to such distributions, but suffer from either intrinsic bias or high variance. In this Letter, we propose a way to make this approximation unbiased and with low variance. Our method uses physical symmetries and variable-size cluster updates which utilize the structure of autoregressive factorization. We test our method for first- and second-order phase transitions of classical spin systems, showing its viability for critical systems and in the presence of metastable states."}}

The core of our results is the construction of neural-network layers that efficiently perform tensor contractions, and that use commonly adopted non-linear activation functions. The resulting deep networks feature a number of edges that closely matches the contraction complexity of the tensor networks to be approximated. In the context of many-body quantum states, this result establishes that neural-network states have strictly the same or higher expressive power than practically usable variational tensor networks. As an example, we show that all matrix product states can be efficiently written as neural-network states with a number of edges polynomial in the bond dimension and depth logarithmic in the system size. The opposite instead does not hold true, and our results imply that there exist quantum states that are not efficiently expressible in terms of matrix product states or PEPS, but that are instead efficiently expressible with neural network states."}}

NetKet is built around neural-network quantum states and provides efficient algorithms for their evaluation and optimization. This new version is built on top of JAX, a differentiable programming and accelerated linear algebra framework for the Python programming language. The most significant new feature is the possibility to define arbitrary neural network ans\\\"atze in pure Python code using the concise notation of machine-learning frameworks, which allows for just-in-time compilation as well as the implicit generation of gradients thanks to automatic differentiation. NetKet 3 also comes with support for GPU and TPU accelerators, advanced support for discrete symmetry groups, chunking to scale up to thousands of degrees of freedom, drivers for quantum dynamics applications, and improved modularity, allowing users to use only parts of the toolbox as a foundation for their own code."}}

A simple family of continuous-variable trial wavefunctons is introduced which naturally generalizes the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) wavefunction introduced for analyzing quantum spin systems. By virtue of its simplicity, the same variational Monte Carlo training algorithms that have been developed for ground state determination and time evolution of spin systems have natural analogues in the continuum. We offer a proof of principle demonstration in the context of ground state determination of a stoquastic quantum rotor Hamiltonian. Results are compared against those obtained from partial differential equation (PDE) based scalable eigensolvers. This study serves as a benchmark against which future investigation of continuous-variable neural quantum states can be compared, and points to the need to consider deep network architectures and more sophisticated training algorithms."}}

Motivated by the desire to efficiently simulate many-body quantum systems with exact local gauge invariance, gauge equivariant neural-network quantum states are introduced, which exactly satisfy the local Hilbert space constraints necessary for the description of quantum lattice gauge theory with Zd gauge group on different geometries. Focusing on the special case of Z2 gauge group on a periodically identified square lattice, the equivariant architecture is analytically shown to contain the loop-gas solution as a special case. Gauge equivariant neural-network quantum states are used in combination with variational quantum Monte Carlo to obtain compact descriptions of the ground state wavefunction for the Z2 theory away from the exactly solvable limit, and to demonstrate the confining/deconfining phase transition of the Wilson loop order parameter."}}

Recent work of Gomes et al.

The algorithmic framework is illustrated for approximate combinatorial optimization problems, and a systematic strategy is found for improving the approximation ratios. In particular it is found that natural evolution strategies can achieve approximation ratios competitive with widely used heuristic algorithms for Max-Cut, at the expense of increased computation time."}}

Using a Slater-Jastrow inspired ansatz which exploits deep residual networks with convolutional residual blocks, we approximately determine the ground state of spinless fermions on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions. The flexibility of the neural-network ansatz results in a high level of accuracy when compared to exact diagonalization results on small systems, both for energy and correlation functions. On large systems, we obtain accurate estimates of the boundaries between metallic and charge ordered phases as a function of the interaction strength and the particle density."}}

In practical applications, neural-network states inherit numerical schemes used in Variational Monte Carlo, most notably the use of Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling to estimate quantum expectations. The local stochastic sampling in MCMC caps the potential advantages of neural networks in two ways: (i) Its intrinsic computational cost sets stringent practical limits on the width and depth of the networks, and therefore limits their expressive capacity; (ii) Its difficulty in generating precise and uncorrelated samples can result in estimations of observables that are very far from their true value. Inspired by the state-of-the-art generative models used in machine learning, we propose a specialized Neural Network architecture that supports efficient and exact sampling, completely circumventing the need for Markov Chain sampling. We demonstrate our approach for two-dimensional interacting spin models, showcasing the ability to obtain accurate results on larger system sizes than those currently accessible to neural-network quantum states."}}
