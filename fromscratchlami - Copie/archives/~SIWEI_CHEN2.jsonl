In this work, we identify the benefits of differentiable physics simulators and propose a new IL method, i.e., Imitation Learning via Differentiable Physics (ILD), which gets rid of the double-loop design and achieves significant improvements in final performance, convergence speed, and stability. The proposed ILD incorporates the differentiable physics simulator as a physics prior into its computational graph for policy learning. It unrolls the dynamics by sampling actions from a parameterized policy, simply minimizing the distance between the expert trajectory and the agent trajectory, and back-propagating the gradient into the policy via temporal physics operators. With the physics prior, ILD policies can not only be transferable to unseen environment specifications but also yield higher final performance on a variety of tasks. In addition, ILD naturally forms a single-loop structure, which significantly improves the stability and training speed. To simplify the complex optimization landscape induced by temporal physics operations, ILD dynamically selects the learning objectives for each state during optimization. In our experiments, we show that ILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in a variety of continuous control tasks with Brax, requiring only one expert demonstration. In addition, ILD can be applied to challenging deformable object manipulation tasks and can be generalized to unseen configurations."}}

However, most existing motion mimicking methods are built upon reinforcement learning (RL) and suffer from heavy reward engineering, high variance, and slow convergence with hard explorations. Specifically, they usually take tens of hours or even days of training to mimic a simple motion sequence, resulting in poor scalability. In this work, we leverage differentiable physics simulators (DPS) and propose an efficient motion mimicking method dubbed $\\textbf{DiffMimic}$. Our key insight is that DPS casts a complex policy learning task to a much simpler state matching problem. In particular, DPS learns a stable policy by analytical gradients with ground-truth physical priors hence leading to significantly faster and stabler convergence than RL-based methods. Moreover, to escape from local optima, we utilize an \\textit{Demonstration Replay} mechanism to enable stable gradient backpropagation in a long horizon. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that DiffMimic has a better sample efficiency and time efficiency than existing methods (e.g., DeepMimic). Notably, DiffMimic allows a physically simulated character to learn back-flip after 10 minutes of training and be able to cycle it after 3 hours of training, while DeepMimic requires about a day of training to cycle back-flip. More importantly, we hope DiffMimic can benefit more differentiable animation systems with techniques like differentiable clothes simulation in future research.

This paper presents DaXBench, a differentiable simulation framework for DOM. While existing work often focuses on a specific type of deformable objects, DaXBench supports fluid, rope, cloth ...; it provides a general-purpose benchmark to evaluate widely different DOM methods, including planning, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning. DaXBench combines recent advances in deformable object simulation with JAX, a high-performance computational framework. All DOM tasks in DaXBench are wrapped with the OpenAI Gym API for easy integration with DOM algorithms. We hope that DaXBench provides to the research community a comprehensive, standardized benchmark and a valuable tool to support the development and evaluation of new DOM methods. The code and video are available online."}}
