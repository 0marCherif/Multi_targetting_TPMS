While significant computational efficiency improvements have been achieved, they come at the cost of reduced accuracy trade-offs. In this paper, we propose Composite Slice Transformer (CST), a Transformer-based network equipped with a composition of multi-scale multi-range attentions, boosting both efficiency and modeling capability.\nAfter stacking fixed-length slices of the input sequence, each layer in CST performs a pair of fine-and-coarse-grained attentions with short-long ranges in a sequential manner, coupled with volatile instant positional embedding, enabling efficient token interactions {\\em and} improving expressiveness of the model.\nIn addition to significantly reduced $O(NL+N^2/L^2)$ complexity for sequence length $N$ and slice length $L$, CST achieves superior performance on a variety of tasks.  We show that CST surpasses recently published efficient Transformers on the Long Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating the bidirectional long-range dependency modeling capability of our model. It outperforms the standard Transformer by a margin of $6.9$\\% in average accuracy across the five classification tasks of the benchmark, while being of complexity comparable to other efficient transformers. Furthermore, on the word-level autoregressive language modeling task with the WikiText-103 dataset, CST performs competitively against the Transformer model with only $2$\\% gap in the test perplexity while outperforming other efficient Transformers."}}

Existing works usually design dedicated backbone or apply Neural architecture Search (NAS) for each task to tackle this challenge. However, existing works impose significant limitations on the design or search space. To solve these problems, we present ScaleNAS, a one-shot learning method for exploring scale-aware representations. ScaleNAS solves multiple tasks at a time by searching multi-scale feature aggregation. ScaleNAS adopts a flexible search space that allows an arbitrary number of blocks and cross-scale feature fusions. To cope with the high search cost incurred by the flexible space, ScaleNAS employs one-shot learning for multi-scale supernet driven by grouped sampling and evolutionary search. Without further retraining, ScaleNet can be directly deployed for different visual recognition tasks with superior performance. We use ScaleNAS to create high-resolution models for two different tasks, ScaleNet-P for human pose estimation and ScaleNet-S for semantic segmentation. ScaleNet-P and ScaleNet-S outperform existing manually crafted and NAS-based methods in both tasks. When applying ScaleNet-P to bottom-up human pose estimation, it surpasses the state-of-the-art HigherHRNet. In particular, ScaleNet-P4 achieves 71.6% AP on COCO test-dev, achieving new state-of-the-art result.\n"}}

When deploying network models on mobile devices with limited resources, weight quantization has been widely adopted. Binary quantization obtains the highest compression but usually results in big accuracy drop. In practice, 8-bit or 16-bit quantization is often used aiming at maintaining the same accuracy as the original 32-bit precision. We observe different layers have different accuracy sensitivity of quantization. Thus judiciously selecting different precision for different layers/structures can potentially produce more efficient models compared to traditional quantization methods by striking a better balance between accuracy and compression rate. In this work, we propose a fine-grained quantization approach for deep neural network compression by relaxing the search space of quantization bitwidth from discrete to a continuous domain. The proposed approach applies gradient descend based optimization to generate a mixed-precision quantization scheme that outperforms the accuracy of traditional quantization methods under the same compression rate."}}

The robustness of DNN models, however, has been recently challenged by adversarial attacks where small disturbance on input samples may result in misclassification. State-of-the-art defending algorithms, such as adversarial training or robust optimization, improve DNNs' resilience to adversarial attacks by paying high computational costs. Moreover, these approaches are usually designed to defend one or a few known attacking techniques only. The effectiveness to defend other types of attacking methods, especially those that have not yet been discovered or explored, cannot be guaranteed. This work aims for a general approach of enhancing the robustness of DNN models under adversarial attacks. In particular, we propose Bamboo -- the first data augmentation method designed for improving the general robustness of DNN without any hypothesis on the attacking algorithms. Bamboo augments the training data set with a small amount of data uniformly sampled on a fixed radius ball around each training data and hence, effectively increase the distance between natural data points and decision boundary. Our experiments show that Bamboo substantially improve the general robustness against arbitrary types of attacks and noises, achieving better results comparing to previous adversarial training methods, robust optimization methods and other data augmentation methods with the same amount of data points."}}
