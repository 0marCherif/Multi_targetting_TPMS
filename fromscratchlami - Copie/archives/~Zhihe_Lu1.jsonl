In principle, the well-learned knowledge structure of the VLMs should be inherited appropriately when being transferred to downstream tasks with limited data. However, most existing efficient transfer learning (ETL) approaches for VLMs either damage or are excessively biased towards the prior knowledge, e.g., prompt tuning (PT) discards the pre-trained text-based classifier and builds a new one while adapter-style tuning (AT) fully relies on the pre-trained features. To address this, we propose a new efficient tuning approach for VLMs named Task Residual Tuning (TaskRes), which performs directly on the text-based classifier and explicitly decouples the prior knowledge of the pre-trained models and new knowledge regarding a target task. Specifically, TaskRes keeps the original classifier weights from the VLMs frozen and obtains a new classifier for the target task by tuning a set of prior-independent parameters as a residual to the original one, which enables reliable prior knowledge preservation and flexible task-specific knowledge exploration. The proposed TaskRes is simple yet effective, which significantly outperforms previous ETL methods (e.g., PT and AT) on 11 benchmark datasets while requiring minimal effort for the implementation. Our code is available at https://github.com/geekyutao/TaskRes."}}

Compared to the widely studied Few-shot Semantic Segmentation FSS, which is limited to segmenting novel classes only, GFSS is much under-studied despite being more practical. Existing approach to GFSS is based on classifier parameter fusion whereby a newly trained novel class classifier and a pre-trained base class classifier are combined to form a new classifier. As the training data is dominated by base classes, this approach is inevitably biased towards the base classes. In this work, we propose a novel Prediction Calibration Network PCN to address this problem. Instead of fusing the classifier parameters, we fuse the scores produced separately by the base and novel classifiers. To ensure that the fused scores are not biased to either the base or novel classes, a new Transformer-based calibration module is introduced. It is known that the lower-level features are useful of detecting edge information in an input image than higher-level features. Thus, we build a cross-attention module that guides the classifier's final prediction using the fused multi-level features. However, transformers are computationally demanding. Crucially, to make the proposed cross-attention module training tractable at the pixel level, this module is designed based on feature-score cross-covariance and episodically trained to be generalizable at inference time. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-$5^{i}$ and COCO-$20^{i}$ show that our PCN outperforms the state-the-the-art alternatives by large margins."}}

Most existing methods meta-learn all three model components for fast adaptation to a new class. However, given that as few as a single support set image is available, effective model adaption of all three components to the new class is extremely challenging. In this work we propose to simplify the meta-learning task by focusing solely on the simplest component, the classifier, whilst leaving the encoder and decoder to pre-training. We hypothesize that if we pre-train an off-the-shelf segmentation model over a set of diverse training classes with sufficient annotations, the encoder and decoder can capture rich discriminative features applicable for any unseen classes, rendering the subsequent meta-learning stage unnecessary. For the classifier meta-learning, we introduce a Classifier Weight Transformer (CWT) designed to dynamically adapt the supportset trained classifier's weights to each query image in an inductive way.

Following the 'wisdom of the crowd' principle, one has to ask: why stop at two? Indeed, we find that using more classifiers leads to better performance, but also introduces more model parameters, therefore risking overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called STochastic clAssifieRs (STAR) for addressing this problem. Instead of representing one classifier as a weight vector, STAR models it as a Gaussian distribution with its variance representing the inter-classifier discrepancy. With STAR, we can now sample an arbitrary number of classifiers from the distribution, whilst keeping the model size the same as having two classifiers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a variety of existing UDA methods can greatly benefit from STAR and achieve the state-of-the-art performance on both image classification and semantic segmentation tasks."}}
