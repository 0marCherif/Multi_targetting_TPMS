Datasets emerging from these experiments can be combined to construct \u201cmaps of biology\u201d, in which perturbation readouts are placed in unified, relatable embedding spaces to capture known biological relationships and discover new ones. Construction of maps involves many technical choices in both experimental and computational protocols, motivating the design of benchmark procedures by which to evaluate map quality in a systematic, unbiased manner.\n\nIn this work, we propose a framework for the steps involved in map building and demonstrate key classes of benchmarks to assess the quality of a map. We describe univariate benchmarks assessing perturbation quality and multivariate benchmarks assessing recovery of known biological relationships from large-scale public data sources. We demonstrate the application and interpretation of these benchmarks through example maps of scRNA-seq and phenomic imaging data."}}

However, for many properties, public and private training sets are typically small, and it is difficult for the models to generalize well outside of the training data. Recently, large language models have addressed this problem by using self-supervised pretraining on large unlabeled datasets, followed by fine-tuning on smaller, labeled datasets. In this paper, we report MolE, a molecular foundation model that adapts the DeBERTa architecture to be used on molecular graphs together with a two-step pretraining strategy. The first step of pretraining is a self-supervised approach focused on learning chemical structures, and the second step is a massive multi-task approach to learn biological information. We show that fine-tuning pretrained MolE achieves state-of-the-art results on 9 of the 22 ADMET tasks included in the Therapeutic Data Commons."}}

Despite their ubiquity in the real-world deployments, these distribution shifts are under-represented in the datasets widely used in the ML community today. To address this gap, we present WILDS, a curated benchmark of 10 datasets reflecting a diverse range of distribution shifts that naturally arise in real-world applications, such as shifts across hospitals for tumor identification; across camera traps for wildlife monitoring; and across time and location in satellite imaging and poverty mapping. On each dataset, we show that standard training yields substantially lower out-of-distribution than in-distribution performance. This gap remains even with models trained by existing methods for tackling distribution shifts, underscoring the need for new methods for training models that are more robust to the types of distribution shifts that arise in practice. To facilitate method development, we provide an open-source package that automates dataset loading, contains default model architectures and hyperparameters, and standardizes evaluations.

In our assay, remdesivir is the only antiviral tested with strong efficacy, neither chloroquine nor hydroxychloroquine have any beneficial effect in this human cell model, and a small number of compounds not currently being pursued clinically for SARS-CoV-2 have efficacy. We observed weak but beneficial class effects of \u03b2-blockers, mTOR/PI3K inhibitors and Vitamin D analogues and a mild amplification of the viral phenotype with \u03b2-agonists."}}

High-throughput screening on this platform demonstrates rapid identification and triage of hits for TGF-\u03b2- and TNF-\u03b1-driven phenotypes. We deploy the platform to develop phenotypic models of active SARS-CoV-2 infection and of COVID-19-associated cytokine storm, surfacing compounds with demonstrated clinical benefit and identifying several new candidates for drug repurposing. The presented library of images, deep learning features, and compound screening data from immune profiling and COVID-19 screens serves as a deep resource for immune biology and cellular-model drug discovery with immediate impact on the COVID-19 pandemic."}}

However, it is well known that non-biological artifacts arising from variability in the technical execution of different experimental batches confound high-throughput screens measurements. These batch effects obscure biological conclusions, and it is therefore necessary to account for them. While a number of techniques have been proposed, to our knowledge there is not a publicly available biological dataset designed specifically for the systematic study of batch effect correction. To this end we announce the release of RxRx1, a set of 125,514 high-resolution fluorescence microscopy images of human cells under 1,108 genetic perturbations in 51 experimental batches across four cell types. Visual inspection of the images by batch makes it clear that the set indeed demonstrates significant batch effects. In this paper we describe the image set in detail. We also propose a classification task designed to study batch effect correction on these images, and provide some baseline results for the task. Our goal in releasing this image set is to encourage researchers across various disciplines to develop effective methods for removing batch effects that generalize well to unseen experimental batches and to share these methods with the scientific community."}}
