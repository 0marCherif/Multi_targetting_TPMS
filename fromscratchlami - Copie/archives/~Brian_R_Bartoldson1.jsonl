Among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) that operate on mesh-based data are desirable because they possess inductive biases that promote physical faithfulness, but hardware limitations have precluded their application to large computational domains. We show that it is \\textit{possible} to train a class of GNN surrogates on 3D meshes. We scale MeshGraphNets (MGN), a subclass of GNNs for mesh-based physics modeling, via our domain decomposition-based approach to facilitate training that is mathematically equivalent to training on the whole domain under certain conditions. With this, we were able to train MGN on meshes with \\textit{millions} of nodes to generate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Furthermore, we show how to enhance MGN via higher-order numerical integration, which can reduce MGN's error and training time. We validated our methods on an accompanying dataset of 3D $\\text{CO}_2$-capture CFD simulations on a 3.1M-node mesh. This work presents a practical path to scaling MGN for real-world applications.

It has been observed that accuracies on in-distribution (ID) versus OOD data follow a linear trend and models that outperform this baseline are exceptionally rare (and referred to as ``effectively robust\u201d). Recently, some promising approaches have been developed to improve OOD robustness: model pruning, data augmentation, and ensembling or zero-shot evaluating large pretrained models. However, there still is no clear understanding of the conditions on OOD data and model properties that are required to observe effective robustness. We approach this issue by conducting a comprehensive empirical study of diverse approaches that are known to impact OOD robustness on a broad range of natural and synthetic distribution shifts of CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. In particular, we view the \"effective robustness puzzle\" through a Fourier lens and ask how spectral properties of both models and OOD data correlate with OOD robustness. We find this Fourier lens offers some insight into why certain robust models, particularly those from the CLIP family, achieve OOD robustness. However, our analysis also makes clear that no known metric is consistently the best explanation of OOD robustness. Thus, to aid future research into the OOD puzzle, we address the gap in publicly-available models with effective robustness by introducing a set of pretrained CIFAR-10 models---$RobustNets$---with varying levels of OOD robustness."}}

Unfortunately, efforts towards simultaneously meeting these requirements have mostly been unsuccessful. This raises an important question: Is the inability to create Compact, Accurate, and Robust Deep neural networks (CARDs) fundamental? To answer this question, we perform a large-scale analysis of popular model compression techniques which uncovers several intriguing patterns. Notably, in contrast to traditional pruning approaches (e.g., fine tuning and gradual magnitude pruning), we find that ``lottery ticket-style'' approaches can surprisingly be used to produce CARDs, including binary-weight CARDs. Specifically, we are able to create extremely compact CARDs that, compared to their larger counterparts, have similar test accuracy and matching (or better) robustness---simply by pruning and (optionally) quantizing. Leveraging the compactness of CARDs, we develop a simple domain-adaptive test-time ensembling approach (CARD-Decks) that uses a gating module to dynamically select appropriate CARDs from the CARD-Deck based on their spectral-similarity with test samples. The proposed approach builds a \"winning hand'' of CARDs that establishes a new state-of-the-art (on RobustBench) on CIFAR-10-C accuracies (i.e., 96.8% standard and 92.75% robust) and CIFAR-100-C accuracies (80.6% standard and 71.3% robust) with better memory usage than non-compressed baselines (pretrained CARDs and CARD-Decks available at https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench). Finally, we provide theoretical support for our empirical findings. "}}

This motivation is particularly relevant given the perhaps surprising observation that a wide variety of pruning approaches increase test accuracy despite sometimes massive reductions in parameter counts. To better understand this phenomenon, we analyze the behavior of pruning over the course of training, finding that pruning's effect on generalization relies more on the instability it generates (defined as the drops in test accuracy immediately following pruning) than on the final size of the pruned model. We demonstrate that even the pruning of unimportant parameters can lead to such instability, and show similarities between pruning and regularizing by injecting noise, suggesting a mechanism for pruning-based generalization improvements that is compatible with the strong generalization recently observed in over-parameterized networks."}}

Parameter-pruning algorithms combat these costs, with some algorithms capable of removing over 90% of an ANN's weights without harming the ANN's performance. Removing weights from an ANN is a form of regularization, but existing pruning algorithms do not significantly improve generalization error. We show that pruning ANNs can improve generalization if pruning targets large weights instead of small weights. Applying our pruning algorithm to an ANN leads to a higher image classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 data than applying the popular regularizer dropout. The pruning couples this higher accuracy with an 85% reduction of the ANN's parameter count."}}
