Fashion apparels demonstrate diverse visual concepts with their designs, styles and brands. Hence, there exist a hierarchy of similarities between fashion clothing, ranging from exact instance or brand to similar attributes, styles. An effective search method, thus, should be able to represent the tiers of similarities. In this paper, we present a deep learning based fashion search framework for learning the tiers of similarity. We propose a new attribute-guided metric learning (AGML) with multitask CNNs that jointly learns fashion attributes and image embeddings while taking category and brand information into account. The two tasks in the framework are linked with a guiding signal. The guiding signal, first, helps in mining informative training samples. Secondly, it helps in treating training samples by their importance to capture the tiers of similarity. We conduct experiments in a new BrandFashion dataset which is richly annotated at different granularities. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is very effective in capturing a tiered similarity search space and outperforms the state-of-the-art fashion search methods."}}
