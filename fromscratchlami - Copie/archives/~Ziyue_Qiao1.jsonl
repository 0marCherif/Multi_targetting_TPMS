Prevailing GCL methods mainly derive from the principles of contrastive learning in the field of computer vision: modeling invariance by specifying absolutely similar pairs. However, when applied to graph data, this paradigm encounters two significant limitations: (1) the validity of the generated views cannot be guaranteed: graph perturbation may produce invalid views against semantics and intrinsic topology of graph data; (2) specifying absolutely similar pairs in the graph views is unreliable: for abstract and non-Euclidean graph data, it is difficult for humans to decide the absolute similarity and dissimilarity intuitively. Despite the notable performance of current GCL methods, these challenges necessitate a reevaluation: Could GCL be more effectively tailored to the intrinsic properties of graphs, rather than merely adopting principles from computer vision? In response to this query, we propose a novel paradigm, Graph Soft-Contrastive Learning (GSCL). This approach facilitates GCL via neighborhood ranking, avoiding the need to specify absolutely similar pairs. GSCL leverages the underlying graph characteristic of diminishing label consistency, asserting that nodes that are closer in the graph are overall more similar than far-distant nodes. Within the GSCL framework, we introduce pairwise and listwise gated ranking InfoNCE loss functions to effectively preserve the relative similarity ranking within neighborhoods. Moreover, as the neighborhood size exponentially expands with more hops considered, we propose neighborhood sampling strategies to improve learning efficiency. Our extensive empirical results across 11 commonly used graph datasets-including 8 homophily graphs and 3 heterophily graphs-demonstrate GSCL's superior performance compared to 20 SOTA GCL methods."}}

It aims to provide users with the convenience to discover their interested places to visit based on previous visits and current status. Most existing methods usually merely leverage recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to explore sequential influences for recommendation. Despite the effectiveness, these methods not only neglect topological geographical influences among POIs, but also fail to model high-order sequential substructures. To tackle the above issues, we propose a Kernel-Based Graph Neural Network (KBGNN) for next POI recommendation, which combines the characteristics of both geographical and sequential influences in a collaborative way. KBGNN consists of a geographical module and a sequential module. On the one hand, we construct a geographical graph and leverage a message passing neural network to capture the topological geographical influences. On the other hand, we explore high-order sequential substructures in the user-aware sequential graph using a graph kernel neural network to capture user preferences. Finally, a consistency learning framework is introduced to jointly incorporate geographical and sequential information extracted from two separate graphs. In this way, the two modules effectively exchange knowledge to mutually enhance each other. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world LBSN datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Fang6ang/KBGNN."}}

As proposals are increasingly interdisciplinary, it is challenging to profile the interdisciplinary nature of a proposal, and, thereafter, find expert reviewers with an appropriate set of expertise. An essential step in solving this challenge is to accurately model and classify the interdisciplinary labels of a proposal. Existing methodological and application-related literature, such as textual classification and proposal classification, are insufficient in jointly addressing the three key unique issues introduced by interdisciplinary proposal data: 1) the hierarchical structure of discipline labels of a proposal from coarse-grain to fine-grain, e.g., from information science to AI to fundamentals of AI. 2) the heterogeneous semantics of various main textual parts that play different roles in a proposal; 3) the number of proposals is imbalanced between non-interdisciplinary and interdisciplinary research. Can we simultaneously address the three issues in understanding the proposal's interdisciplinary nature? In response to this question, we propose a hierarchical mixup multiple-label classification framework, which we called H-MixUp. H-MixUp leverages a transformer-based semantic information extractor and a GCN-based interdisciplinary knowledge extractor for the first and second issues. H-MixUp develops a fused training method of Wold-level MixUp, Word-level CutMix, Manifold MixUp, and Document-level MixUp to address the third issue."}}

It can improve the quality of services and intelligence of academic engines. Most of the existing studies for researcher data mining focus on a single task for a particular application scenario and learning a task-specific model, which is usually unable to transfer to out-of-scope tasks. The pre-training technology provides a generalized and sharing model to capture valuable information from enormous unlabeled data. The model can accomplish multiple downstream tasks via a few fine-tuning steps. In this paper, we propose a multi-task self-supervised learning-based researcher data pre-training model named RPT. Specifically, we divide the researchers' data into semantic document sets and community graph. We design the hierarchical Transformer and the local community encoder to capture information from the two categories of data, respectively. Then, we propose three self-supervised learning objectives to train the whole model. Finally, we also propose two transfer modes of RPT for fine-tuning in different scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate RPT, results on three downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of pre-training for researcher data mining."}}
