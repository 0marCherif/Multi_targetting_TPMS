Although they are widely adopted beyond research, it has been a longstanding open problem to understand mathematically the feature extraction mechanism that trained nonlinear autoencoders provide. In this work, we make progress in this problem by analyzing a class of two-layer weight-tied nonlinear autoencoders in the mean field framework. Upon a suitable scaling, in the regime of a large number of neurons, the models trained with stochastic gradient descent are shown to admit a mean field limiting dynamics. This limiting description reveals an asymptotically precise picture of feature learning by these models: their training dynamics exhibit different phases that correspond to the learning of different principal subspaces of the data, with varying degrees of nonlinear shrinkage dependent on the $\\ell_{2}$-regularization and stopping time. While we prove these results under an idealized assumption of (correlated) Gaussian data, experiments on real-life data demonstrate an interesting match with the theory. The autoencoder setup of interests poses a nontrivial mathematical challenge to proving these results. In this setup, the \"Lipschitz\" constants of the models grow with the data dimension $d$. Consequently an adaptation of previous analyses requires a number of neurons $N$ that is at least exponential in $d$. Our main technical contribution is a new argument which proves that the required $N$ is only polynomial in $d$. We conjecture that $N\\gg d$ is sufficient and that $N$ is necessarily larger than a data-dependent intrinsic dimension, a behavior that is fundamentally different from previously studied setups."}}

There we also proved a global convergence guarantee for three-layer (as well as two-layer) networks using this framework.   In this companion note, we point out that the insights in our previous work can be readily extended to prove a global convergence guarantee for multilayer networks of any depths. Unlike our previous three-layer global convergence guarantee that assumes i.i.d. initializations, our present result applies to a type of correlated initialization. This initialization allows to, at any finite training time, propagate a certain universal approximation property through the depth of the neural network. To achieve this effect, we introduce a bidirectional diversity condition."}}

As the network's widths increase, the network's learning trajectory is shown to be well captured by a meaningful and dynamically nonlinear limit (the \\textit{mean field} limit), which is characterized by a system of ODEs. Our framework applies to a broad range of network architectures, learning dynamics and network initializations. Central to the framework is the new idea of a \\textit{neuronal embedding}, which comprises of a non-evolving probability space that allows to embed neural networks of arbitrary widths. Using our framework, we prove several properties of large-width multilayer neural networks. Firstly we show that independent and identically distributed initializations cause strong degeneracy effects on the network's learning trajectory when the network's depth is at least four. Secondly we obtain several global convergence guarantees for feedforward multilayer networks under a number of different setups. These include two-layer and three-layer networks with independent and identically distributed initializations, and multilayer networks of arbitrary depths with a special type of correlated initializations that is motivated by the new concept of \\textit{bidirectional diversity}. Unlike previous works that rely on convexity, our results admit non-convex losses and hinge on a certain universal approximation property, which is a distinctive feature of infinite-width neural networks and is shown to hold throughout the training process. Aside from being the first known results for global convergence of multilayer networks in the mean field regime, they demonstrate flexibility of our framework and incorporate several new ideas and insights that depart from the conventional convex optimization wisdom."}}
