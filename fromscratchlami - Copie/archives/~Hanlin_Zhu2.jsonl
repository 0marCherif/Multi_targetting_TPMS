Much effort has focused on improving offline RL practicality by addressing the prevalent issue of partial data coverage through various forms of conservative policy learning. While the majority of algorithms do not have finite-\nsample guarantees, several provable conservative offline RL algorithms are designed and analyzed within the single-policy concentrability framework that handles partial coverage. Yet, in the nonlinear function approximation setting where confidence intervals are difficult to obtain, existing provable algorithms suffer from computational intractability, prohibitively strong assumptions, and suboptimal statistical rates. In this paper, we leverage the marginalized importance sampling (MIS) formulation of RL and present the first set of offline RL algorithms that are statistically optimal and practical under general function approximation and single-policy concentrability, bypassing the need for uncertainty quantification. We identify that the key to successfully solving the sample-based approximation of the MIS problem is ensuring that certain occupancy validity constraints are nearly satisfied. We enforce these constraints by a novel application of the augmented Lagrangian method and prove the following result: with the MIS formulation, augmented Lagrangian is enough for statistically optimal offline RL. In stark contrast to prior algorithms that induce additional conservatism through methods such as behavior regularization, our approach provably eliminates this need and reinterprets regularizers as \"enforcers of occupancy validity\" than \"promoters of conservatism.\""}}

However, the convergence property of neural networks with finite width could be very different. The simplest experiment with two-layer teacher-student networks shows that the input weights of student neurons eventually align with one of the teacher neurons. This suggests a distinct convergence nature for ``not-too-wide'' neural networks that there might not be any local minima near the initialization. As the theoretical justification, we prove that under the most basic settings, all student neurons must align with the teacher neuron at any local minima. The methodology is extendable to more general cases, where the proof can be reduced to analyzing the properties of a special class of functions that we call {\\em Angular Distance (AD) function}. Finally, we demonstrate that these properties can be easily verified numerically."}}
