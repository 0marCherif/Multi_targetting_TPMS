Most membership inference attacks rely on confidence scores from the victim model for the attack purpose. However, a few studies indicate that prediction labels of the victim model's output are sufficient for launching successful attacks. Besides the well-studied classification models, segmentation models are also vulnerable to this type of attack. In this article, for the first time, we propose the label-only membership inference attacks against semantic segmentation models. With a well-designed framework of the attacks, we can achieve a considerably higher successful attacking rate compared to previous work. In addition, we have discussed several possible defense mechanisms to counter such a threat."}}

To preserve the privacy of IoT datasets, traditional methods usually calibrate random noises on the data values to achieve differential privacy (DP). However, the amount of the calibrating noises should be carefully designed and a heedless value will definitely degrade the availability of datasets. Thus, in this work, we propose a stochastic perturbation method to sanitize the dataset, where the perturbation is obtained from the rest samples in the same dataset. In addition, we derive the expression of the utility level based on its unique framework and prove that the proposed algorithm can achieve the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\epsilon$</tex-math></inline-formula> -DP. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments on real-life datasets by various functions, such as query answers and machine learning tasks. By comparing with the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed algorithm can achieve a better performance under the same privacy level."}}

Nevertheless, these important enabling technologies have been studied separately in most existing works. This article proposes a novel cooperative task offloading and block mining (TOBM) scheme for a blockchain-based MEC system where each edge device not only handles data tasks but also deals with block mining for improving the system utility. To address the latency issues caused by the blockchain operation in MEC, we develop a new Proof-of-Reputation consensus mechanism based on a lightweight block verification strategy. A multi-objective function is then formulated to maximize the system utility of the blockchain-based MEC system, by jointly optimizing offloading decision, channel selection, transmit power allocation, and computational resource allocation. We propose a novel distributed deep reinforcement learning-based approach by using a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. We then develop a game-theoretic solution to model the offloading and mining competition among edge devices as a potential game, and prove the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate the significant system utility improvements of our proposed scheme over baseline approaches."}}

However, it is rather challenging for lightweight IIoT devices to perform computation-intensive local model training over large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs). Driven by this issue, we develop a communication-computation efficient FL framework for resource-limited IIoT networks that integrates DNN partition technique into the standard FL mechanism, wherein IIoT devices perform local model training over the bottom layers of the objective DNN, and offload the top layers to the edge gateway side. Considering imbalanced data distribution, we derive the device-specific participation rate to involve the devices with better data distribution in more communication rounds. Upon deriving the device-specific participation rate, we propose to minimize the training delay under the constraints of device-specific participation rate, energy consumption and memory usage. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem of device scheduling and resource allocation (i.e. DNN partition point, channel assignment, transmit power, and computation frequency), and solve the long-term min-max mixed integer non-linear programming based on the Lyapunov technique. In particular, the proposed dynamic device scheduling and resource allocation (DDSRA) algorithm can achieve a trade-off to balance the training delay minimization and FL performance. We also provide the FL convergence bound for the DDSRA algorithm with both convex and non-convex settings. Experimental results demonstrate the derived device-specific participation rate in terms of feasibility, and show that the DDSRA algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of test accuracy and convergence time."}}

Up to now, the research on the performance of large networks with IRSs is still in its infancy. In this article, we study a Poisson bipolar network with line segment blockages and reflectors. By deriving the probability that an IRS can successfully reflect a signal from a transmitter to a receiver and the distribution of the distance traveled by the reflected signal, the performance impact of deploying IRSs on the signal propagation is investigated. The aggregated interference through reflective paths via IRSs is derived by modeling the IRSs as additional interfering sources with non-uniformly distributed interfering power in different directions. With these results, the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) and the achievable rate are further derived, where a characteristic function and the inverse theorem are adopted to handle the complicated channel fading of reflective signals. From the analysis, IRSs have a great potential to enhance the network performance, but the tradeoff between signal enhancement and reflective interference is important. That is, the performance gain suffers from a diminishing return with a large IRS fraction due to the growth of reflective interference."}}

Privacy practices should be adopted from the first stage of software design to safeguard personal data from unintentional information leakage. Privacy patterns have been investigated by academic and industry practitioners to address different privacy issues. The presence of these patterns is both helpful and challenging for the designer. On one hand, the privacy patterns are valuable as reusable design solutions to solve common privacy problems. On the other hand, the multitude of privacy patterns makes the choice of patterns as solutions difficult for the designer. In this paper, we propose a selection model that can assist architects in deciding suitable patterns for a software system. The selection is based on the regulatory entities and architectural characteristics implicit in the patterns. We evaluate the proposed selection model through case studies and interviews with practitioners. Our evaluation accesses the applicability and usefulness of the selection model in guiding the pattern selection for architectural design and understanding the rationale of different design decisions."}}

The master server then aggregates the received gradients and broadcasts the aggregation to all clients, with which the clients can update the global model. In this paper, we consider multi-server federated learning with secure aggregation and unreliable communication links. We first define a threat model using Shannon's information-theoretic security framework and propose a novel scheme called Lagrange Coding with Mask (LCM), which divides the servers into groups and uses Coding and Masking techniques. LCM can achieve a trade-off between the uplink and downlink communication loads by adjusting the number of servers in each group. Furthermore, we derive the lower bounds of the uplink and downlink communication loads, respectively, and prove that LCM achieves the optimal uplink communication load, which is unrelated to the number of collusion clients."}}

However, it suffers the leakage of private information from uploading models. In addition, as the model size grows, the training latency increases due to limited transmission bandwidth and the model performance degrades while using differential privacy (DP) protection. In this paper, we propose a gradient sparsification empowered FL framework over wireless channels, in order to improve training efficiency without sacrificing convergence performance. Specifically, we first design a random sparsification algorithm to retain a fraction of the gradient elements in each client's local training, thereby mitigating the performance degradation induced by DP and and reducing the number of transmission parameters over wireless channels. Then, we analyze the convergence bound of the proposed algorithm, by modeling a non-convex FL problem. Next, we formulate a time-sequential stochastic optimization problem for minimizing the developed convergence bound, under the constraints of transmit power, the average transmitting delay, as well as the client's DP requirement. Utilizing the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework, we develop an analytical solution to the optimization problem. Extensive experiments have been implemented on three real life datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. We show that our proposed algorithms can fully exploit the interworking between communication and computation to outperform the baselines, i.e., random scheduling, round robin and delay-minimization algorithms."}}

To enhance the network capacity and reliability, we propose a learning-based dynamic time-frequency division duplexing (D-TFDD) scheme that adaptively allocates the uplink and downlink time-frequency resources of base stations (BSs) to meet the asymmetric and heterogeneous traffic demands while alleviating the inter-cell interference. We formulate the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) that maximizes the long-term expected sum rate under the users' packet dropping ratio constraints. In order to jointly optimize the global resources in a decentralized manner, we propose a federated reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm named federated Wolpertinger deep deterministic policy gradient (FWDDPG) algorithm. The BSs decide their local time-frequency configurations through RL algorithms and achieve global training via exchanging local RL models with their neighbors under a decentralized federated learning framework. Specifically, to deal with the large-scale discrete action space of each BS, we adopt a DDPG-based algorithm to generate actions in a continuous space, and then utilize Wolpertinger policy to reduce the mapping errors from continuous action space back to discrete action space. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm to the benchmark algorithms with respect to system sum rate."}}
