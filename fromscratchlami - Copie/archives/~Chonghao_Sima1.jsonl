Previous work struggled in complex cases due to their simple designs of the spatial transformation between front view and bird\u2019s eye view (BEV) and the lack of a realistic dataset. Towards these issues, we present PersFormer: an end-to-end monocular 3D lane detector with a novel Transformer-based spatial feature transformation module. Our model generates BEV features by attending to related front-view local regions with camera parameters as a reference. PersFormer adopts a unified 2D/3D anchor design and an auxiliary task to detect 2D/3D lanes simultaneously, enhancing the feature consistency and sharing the benefits of multi-task learning. Moreover, we release one of the first large-scale real-world 3D lane datasets: OpenLane, with high-quality annotation and scenario diversity. OpenLane contains 200,000 frames, over 880,000 instance-level lanes, 14 lane categories, along with scene tags and the closed-in-path object annotations to encourage the development of lane detection and more industrial-related autonomous driving methods. We show that PersFormer significantly outperforms competitive baselines in the 3D lane detection task on our new OpenLane dataset as well as Apollo 3D Lane Synthetic dataset, and is also on par with state-of-the-art algorithms in the 2D task on OpenLane.

Conventional approaches for most autonomous driving algorithms perform detection, segmentation, tracking, etc., in a front or perspective view. As sensor configurations get more complex, integrating multi-source information from different sensors and representing features in a unified view come of vital importance. BEV perception inherits several advantages, as representing surrounding scenes in BEV is intuitive and fusion-friendly; and representing objects in BEV is most desirable for subsequent modules as in planning and/or control. The core problems for BEV perception lie in (a) how to reconstruct the lost 3D information via view transformation from perspective view to BEV; (b) how to acquire ground truth annotations in BEV grid; (c) how to formulate the pipeline to incorporate features from different sources and views; and (d) how to adapt and generalize algorithms as sensor configurations vary across different scenarios. In this survey, we review the most recent work on BEV perception and provide an in-depth analysis of different solutions. Moreover, several systematic designs of BEV approach from the industry are depicted as well. Furthermore, we introduce a full suite of practical guidebook to improve the performance of BEV perception tasks, including camera, LiDAR and fusion inputs. At last, we point out the future research directions in this area. We hope this report would shed some light on the community and encourage more research effort on BEV perception. We keep an active repository to collect the most recent work and provide a toolbox for bag of tricks at https://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/BEVPerception-Survey-Recipe."}}

In this work, we present a new framework termed BEVFormer, which learns unified BEV representations with spatiotemporal transformers to support multiple autonomous driving perception tasks. In a nutshell, BEVFormer exploits both spatial and temporal information by interacting with spatial and temporal space through predefined grid-shaped BEV queries. To aggregate spatial information, we design spatial cross-attention that each BEV query extracts the spatial features from the regions of interest across camera views. For temporal information, we propose temporal self-attention to recurrently fuse the history BEV information. Our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art 56.9\\% in terms of NDS metric on the nuScenes \\texttt{test} set, which is 9.0 points higher than previous best arts and on par with the performance of LiDAR-based baselines. We further show that BEVFormer remarkably improves the accuracy of velocity estimation and recall of objects under low visibility conditions.

LSH-SMILE hashes elements with similar dynamics into a single hash bucket and handles their updates at once. This allows LSH-SMILE to scale with respect to the number of non-empty hash buckets, a drastic improvement over conventional approaches. Theoretically, we prove a novel bound on the errors introduced by LSH-SMILE. Experimentally, we demonstrate that LSH-SMILE simulates physics systems at comparable quality with exact approaches, but with way less time and space complexity. Such savings also translate to better learning performance due to LSH-SMILE's ability to propagate gradients over a long duration."}}
