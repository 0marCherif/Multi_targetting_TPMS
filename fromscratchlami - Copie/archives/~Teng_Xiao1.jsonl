Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in representation learning on graphs, facilitating various downstream tasks. However, GNNs have several drawbacks such as lacking interpretability, can easily inherit the bias of the training data and cannot model the casual relations. Recently, counterfactual learning on graphs has shown promising results in alleviating these drawbacks. Various graph counterfactual learning approaches have been proposed for counterfactual fairness, explainability, link prediction and other applications on graphs. To facilitate the development of this promising direction, in this survey, we categorize and comprehensively review papers on graph counterfactual learning. We divide existing methods into four categories based on research problems studied. For each category, we provide background and motivating examples, a general framework summarizing existing works and a detailed review of these works. We point out promising future research directions at the intersection of graph-structured data, counterfactual learning, and real-world applications. To offer a comprehensive view of resources for future studies, we compile a collection of open-source implementations, public datasets, and commonly-used evaluation metrics. This survey aims to serve as a ``one-stop-shop'' for building a unified understanding of graph counterfactual learning categories and current resources. We also maintain a repository for papers and resources and will keep updating the repository https://github.com/TimeLovercc/Awesome-Graph-Causal-Learning."}}

Most existing self-supervised learning methods assume the graph is homophilous, where linked nodes often belong to the same class or have similar features. However, such assumptions of homophily do not always hold in real-world graphs. We address this problem by developing a decoupled self-supervised learning (DSSL) framework for graph neural networks. DSSL imitates a generative process of nodes and links from latent variable modeling of the semantic structure, which decouples different underlying semantics between different neighborhoods into the self-supervised learning process. Our DSSL framework is agnostic to the encoders and does not need prefabricated augmentations, thus is flexible to different graphs. To effectively optimize the framework,  we derive the evidence lower bound of the self-supervised objective and develop a scalable training algorithm with variational inference. We provide a theoretical analysis to justify that DSSL enjoys the better downstream performance. Extensive experiments on various types of graph benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed framework can  achieve better performance compared with competitive  baselines."}}

A user may click/purchase an item regardless of whether the item is recommended or not. Thus, it is important to estimate the causal effect of recommendation and rank items higher with a larger causal effect. However, most existing works focused on improving the accuracy of recommendations, which usually have large bias and variance. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a general and theoretically rigorous framework for causal recommender systems, which enables unbiased evaluation and learning for the ranking metrics with confounding bias. We first propose a robust estimator for unbiased ranking evaluation and theoretically show that this estimator has a smaller bias and variance. We then propose a deep variational information bottleneck (IB) approach to exploit the sufficiency of the propensity score for estimation adjustment and better generalization. We also provide the learning bound and develop an unbiased learning algorithm to optimize the causal metric. Results on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets show that our evaluation and learning algorithms significantly outperform existing methods."}}

Reinforcement learning models have been proposed to maximize user long-term rewards by formulating the recommendation as a sequential decision-making problem, but could only achieve inferior accuracy compared to LTR counterparts, primarily due to the lack of online interactions and the characteristics of ranking. In this paper, we propose a new off-policy value ranking (VR) algorithm that can simultaneously maximize user long-term rewards and optimize the ranking metric offline for improved sample efficiency in a unified Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. We theoretically and empirically show that the EM process guides the leaned policy to enjoy the benefit of integration of the future reward and ranking metric, and learn without any online interactions. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods"}}

However, it is an ongoing challenge to obtain correct reconstruction results from image sets consisting of problematic match pairs. This paper investigated two types of problematic match pairs, stemming from repetitive structures and very short baselines. We built a weighted view-graph based on all potential match pairs and propose a progressive SfM method (PRMP-PSfM) that iteratively prioritizes and refines its match pairs (or edges). The method has two main steps: initialization and expansion. Initialization is developed for reliable seed reconstruction. Specifically, we prioritize a subset of match pairs by the union of multiple independent minimum spanning trees and refine them by the idea of cycle consistency inference (CCI), which aims to infer incorrect edges by analyzing the geometric consistency over cycles of the view-graph. The seed reconstruction is progressively expanded by iteratively adding new minimum spanning trees and refining the corresponding match pairs, and the expansion terminates when a certain completeness of the block is achieved. Results from evaluations on several public datasets demonstrate that PRMP-PSfM can successfully accomplish the image orientation task for datasets with repetitive structures and very short baselines and can obtain better or similar accuracy of reconstruction results compared to several state-of-the-art incremental and hierarchical SfM methods."}}
