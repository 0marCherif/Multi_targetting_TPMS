Classical methods of object detection very often fail in this scenario due to violation of implicit assumptions made such as rich texture, small to moderate ratios between image size and object size. Satellite video is a very new modality which introduces temporal consistency as inductive bias. Approaches for vehicle detection in satellite video use either background subtraction, frame differencing or subspace methods showing moderate performance (0.26 - 0.82 F1 score). This work proposes to apply recent work on deep learning for wide-area motion imagery (WAMI) on satellite video. We show in a first approach comparable results (0.84 F1) on Planet's SkySat-1 LasVegas video with room for further improvement."}}

Results of over eighty trackers are presented; many are state-of-the-art trackers published at major computer vision conferences or in journals in the recent years. The evaluation included the standard VOT and other popular methodologies for short-term tracking analysis and a \u201creal-time\u201d experiment simulating a situation where a tracker processes images as if provided by a continuously running sensor. A long-term tracking subchallenge has been introduced to the set of standard VOT sub-challenges. The new subchallenge focuses on long-term tracking properties, namely coping with target disappearance and reappearance. A new dataset has been compiled and a performance evaluation methodology that focuses on long-term tracking capabilities has been adopted. The VOT toolkit has been updated to support both standard short-term and the new long-term tracking subchallenges. Performance of the tested trackers typically by far exceeds standard baselines. The source code for most of the trackers is publicly available from the VOT page. The dataset, the evaluation kit and the results are publicly available at the challenge website ( http://votchallenge.net )."}}

The VOT-TIR2016 challenge is similar to the 2015 challenge, the main difference is the introduction of new, more difficult sequences into the dataset. Furthermore, VOT-TIR2016 evaluation adopted the improvements regarding overlap calculation in VOT2016. Compared to VOT-TIR2015, a significant general improvement of results has been observed, which partly compensate for the more difficult sequences.

The key ingredient is a dissimilarity measure between correspondences that takes into account their geometric compatibility, allowing us to separate inlier correspondences from outliers. We employ both static correspondences from the initial appearance of the object as well as adaptive correspondences from the previous frame to address the stability-plasticity dilemma. The geometric dissimilarity measure enables us to also disambiguate keypoints that are difficult to match. Based on these ideas we build a keypoint-based tracker that outputs rotated bounding boxes. We demonstrate in a rigorous empirical analysis that this tracker outperforms the state of the art on a dataset of 77 sequences."}}

The calibration or estimating the camera pose, focal length and radial distortion is an essential requirement in video surveillance systems for any further automated tasks like person tracking or flow monitoring. The proposed methodology casts the calibration as a localization problem of an image with respect to a 3D model which is built a priori with a moving camera. The method comprises state-of-the-art functioning blocks, the Structure from Motion (SfM) and minimal Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solvers, which were proved stable in 3D computer vision community and applies them in context of video surveillance. We demonstrate that the calibration method is effective in difficult repetitive, reflective and texture less large indoor environments like an airport."}}

The method is an extension of the Direct Reference Plane method, which formulates the localization and the reconstruction as a system of linear equations that is globally solvable by Singular Value Decomposition. The method's assumptions are static synchronized cameras, smooth trajectories, known camera internal parameters, and the rotation between the cameras in a world coordinate system. The paper describes the method in the context of self-calibrating cameras, where the internal parameters and the rotation can be jointly obtained assuming a man-made scene with orthogonal structures. Experiments with synthetic and real--image data show that the method can recover the camera centers with an error less than half a meter even in the presence of a 4 meter gap between the fields of view."}}
