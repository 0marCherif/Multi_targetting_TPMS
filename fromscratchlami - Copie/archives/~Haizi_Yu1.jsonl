Machine learning (ML) algorithms, however, typically require large data to either learn or pre-learn to transfer. Inspired by nativism, we directly model very basic human innate priors in abstract visual tasks like character or doodle recognition. The result is a white-box model that learns transformation-based topological similarity akin to how a human would naturally and unconsciously ``distort'' an object when first seeing it. Using the simple Nearest-Neighbor classifier in this similarity space, our model approaches human-level character recognition using only one to ten examples per class and nothing else (no pre-training). This is in contrast to one-shot and few-shot settings that require significant pre-training. On standard benchmarks including MNIST, EMNIST-letters, and the harder Omniglot challenge, our model outperforms both neural-network-based and classical ML methods in the ``tiny-data'' regime, including few-shot learning models that use an extra background set to perform transfer learning. Moreover, mimicking simple clustering methods like $k$-means but in a non-Euclidean space, our model can adapt to an unsupervised setting and generate human-interpretable archetypes of a class."}}
{"id": "SzjyTIc5qMP", "cdate": 1601308138325, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Information Lattice Learning", "abstract": "Information Lattice Learning (ILL) is a general framework to learn decomposed representations, called rules, of a signal such as an image or a probability distribution. Each rule is a coarsened signal used to gain some human-interpretable insight into what might govern the nature of the original signal. To summarize the signal, we need several disentangled rules arranged in a hierarchy, formalized by a lattice structure. ILL focuses on explainability and generalizability from \"small data\", and aims for rules akin to those humans distill from experience (rather than a representation optimized for a specific task like classification). This paper focuses on a mathematical and algorithmic presentation of ILL, then demonstrates how ILL addresses the core question \"what makes X an X\" or \"what makes X different from Y\" to create effective, rule-based explanations designed to help human learners understand. The key part here is \\emph{what} rather than tasks like generating X or predicting labels X,Y. Typical applications of ILL are presented for artistic and scientific knowledge discovery. These use ILL to learn music theory from scores and chemical laws from molecule data, revealing relationships between domains. We include initial benchmarks and assessments for ILL to demonstrate efficacy."}}

In many domains, the two processes are approached through \\emph{rules}: high-level principles that reveal invariances within similar yet diverse examples. Under a probabilistic setting for discrete input spaces, we focus on the rule realization problem which generates input sample distributions that follow the given rules. More ambitiously, we go beyond a mechanical realization that takes whatever is given, but instead ask for proactively selecting reasonable rules to realize. This goal is demanding in practice, since the initial rule set may not always be consistent and thus intelligent compromises are needed. We formulate both rule realization and selection as two strongly connected components within a single and symmetric bi-convex problem, and derive an efficient algorithm that works at large scale. Taking music compositional rules as the main example throughout the paper, we demonstrate our model's efficiency in not only music realization (composition) but also music interpretation and understanding (analysis)."}}

This paper continues the study of building \\emph{automatic theorists} (rovers) to learn and represent music concepts that lead to human interpretable knowledge and further lead to materials for educating people. Our previous work took a first step in algorithmic concept learning of tonal music, studying high-level representations (concepts) of symbolic music (scores) and extracting interpretable rules for composition. This paper further studies the representation \\emph{hierarchy} through the learning process, and supports \\emph{adaptive} 2D memory selection in the resulting language model. This leads to a deeper-level interpretability that expands from individual rules to a dynamic system of rules, making the entire rule learning process more cognitive. The outcome is a new rover, MUS-ROVER \\RN{2}, trained on Bach's chorales, which outputs customizable syllabi for learning compositional rules. We demonstrate comparable results to our music pedagogy, while also presenting the differences and variations. In addition, we point out the rover's potential usages in style recognition and synthesis, as well as applications beyond music."}}
