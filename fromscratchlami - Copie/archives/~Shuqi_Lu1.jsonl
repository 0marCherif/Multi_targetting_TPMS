The pocket-based 3D molecular generation model, i.e., directly generating a molecule with a 3D structure and binding position in the pocket, is a new promising way to address this issue. Herein, we propose VD-Gen, a novel pocket-based 3D molecular generation pipeline. VD-Gen consists of several carefully designed stages to generate fine-grained 3D molecules with binding positions in the pocket cavity end-to-end. Rather than directly generating or sampling atoms with 3D positions in the pocket like in early attempts, in VD-Gen, we first randomly initialize many virtual particles in the pocket; then iteratively move these virtual particles, making the distribution of virtual particles approximate the distribution of molecular atoms. After virtual particles are stabilized in 3D space, we extract a 3D molecule from them. Finally, we further refine atoms in the extracted molecule by iterative movement again, to get a high-quality 3D molecule, and predict a confidence score for it. Extensive experiment results on pocket-based molecular generation demonstrate that VD-Gen can generate novel 3D molecules to fill the target pocket cavity with high binding affinities, significantly outperforming previous baselines."}}

However, previous methods learned from 1D SMILES sequences or 2D molecular graphs failed to achieve high accuracy as QC properties primarily depend on the 3D equilibrium conformations optimized by electronic structure methods, far different from the sequence-type and graph-type data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Uni-Mol+ to tackle this challenge. Uni-Mol+ first generates a raw 3D molecule conformation from inexpensive methods such as RDKit. Then, the raw conformation is iteratively updated to its target DFT equilibrium conformation using neural networks, and the learned conformation will be used to predict the QC properties. To effectively learn this update process towards the equilibrium conformation, we introduce a two-track Transformer model backbone and train it with the QC property prediction task. We also design a novel approach to guide the model's training process. Our extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that the proposed Uni-Mol+ significantly improves the accuracy of QC property prediction in various datasets. We have made the code and model publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Mol}."}}

The pocket-based 3D molecular generation model, i.e., directly generating a molecule with a 3D structure and binding position in the pocket, is a new promising way to address this issue. However, the method is very challenging due to the complexity brought by the huge continuous 3D space in the pocket cavity. Herein, inspired by Molecular Dynamics, we propose a novel pocket-based 3D molecular generation framework VD-Gen. VD-Gen consists of a Virtual Dynamics mechanism and several carefully designed stages to generate fine-grained 3D molecules with binding positions in the pocket cavity end-to-end. Rather than directly generating or sampling atoms with 3D positions in the pocket like in early attempts, in VD-Gen, we first randomly scatter many virtual particles in the pocket; then with the proposed Virtual Dynamics mechanism, a deep model, acting like a \"force field\", iteratively moves these virtual particles to positions that are highly possible to contain real atoms. After virtual particles are stabilized in 3D space, we extract the atoms from them. Finally, we further refine the 3D positions of atoms by Virtual Dynamics again, to get a fine-grained 3D molecule.

Autoencoder-based language models are appealing in dense retrieval as they train the encoder to output high-quality embedding that can reconstruct the input texts. However, in this paper, we provide theoretical analyses and show empirically that an autoencoder language model with a low reconstruction loss may not provide good sequence representations because the decoder may take shortcuts by exploiting language patterns. To address this, we propose a new self-learning method that pre-trains the autoencoder using a \\textit{weak} decoder, with restricted capacity and attention flexibility to push the encoder to provide better text representations. Our experiments on web search, news recommendation, and open domain question answering show that our pre-trained model significantly boosts the effectiveness and few-shot ability of dense retrieval models.

For each user and her queries, KEPS first con- ducts personalized entity linking on the queries and forms better intent representations; then it builds a knowledge enhanced profile for the user, using memory networks to store the predicted search intents and linked entities in her search history. The knowledge enhanced user profile and intent representation are then utilized by KEPS for better, knowledge enhanced, personalized search. Furthermore, after providing personalized search for each query, KEPS leverages user's feedback (click on documents) to post-adjust the entity linking on previous queries. This fixes previous linking errors and improves ranking quality for future queries. Experiments on the public AOL search log demonstrate the advantage of knowledge in personalized search: personalized entity linking better reflects user's search intent, the memory networks better maintain user's subtle preferences, and the post linking adjustment fixes some linking errors with the received feedback signals. The three components together lead to a significantly better ranking accuracy of KEPS."}}
