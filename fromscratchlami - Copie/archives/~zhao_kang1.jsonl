In this article, we propose a novel multigraph fusion method to produce a high-quality graph and a low-dimensional space of original high-dimensional data for the GCN model. Specifically, the proposed method first extracts the common information and the complementary information among multiple local graphs to obtain a unified local graph, which is then fused with the global graph of the data to obtain the initial graph for the GCN model. As a result, the proposed method conducts the graph fusion process twice to simultaneously learn the low-dimensional space and the intrinsic graph structure of the data in a unified framework. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrated that our method outperformed the comparison methods in terms of classification tasks."}}

Most existing methods focus on local structure and fail to fully incorporate the global topological structure. To this end, we propose a novel Structure-Preserving Graph Representation Learning (SPGRL) method, to fully capture the structure information of graphs. Specifically, to reduce the uncertainty and misinformation of the original graph, we construct a feature graph as a complementary view via k-Nearest Neighbor method. The feature graph can be used to contrast at node-level to capture the local relation. Besides, we retain the global topological structure information by maximizing the mutual information (MI) of the whole graph and feature embeddings, which is theoretically reduced to exchanging the feature embeddings of the feature and the original graphs to reconstruct themselves. Extensive experiments show that our method has quite superior performance on semi-supervised node classification task and excellent robustness under noise perturbation on graph structure or node features."}}

Although deep neural networks based graph clustering methods have achieved impressive performance, the huge amount of training parameters make them time-consuming and memory- intensive. Moreover, real-world graphs are often noisy or incomplete and are not optimal for the clustering task. To solve these problems, we design a graph learning framework for the attributed graph clustering task in this study. We firstly develop a shallow model for learning a fine-grained graph from smoothed data, which sufficiently exploits both node attributes and topology information. A regularizer is also designed to flexibly explore the high-order information hidden in the data. To further reduce the computation complexity, we then propose a linear method with respect to node number n, where a smaller graph is learned based on importance sampling strategy to select m(m\u226an) anchors. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed methods are not only effective but also more efficient than state-of-the-art techniques. In particular, our method surpasses many recent deep learning approaches."}}

However, existing methods are still limited in two main aspects. On the one hand, most of them can not deal with data that have both attributes and graphs. Nowadays, multi-view attributed graph data are ubiquitous and the need for effective clustering methods is growing. On the other hand, many state-of-the-art algorithms are either shallow or deep models. Shallow methods may seriously restrict their capacity for modeling complex data, while deep approaches often involve large number of parameters and are expensive to train in terms of running time and space needed. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view attributed graph clustering (MAGC) framework, which exploits both node attributes and graphs. Our novelty lies in three aspects. First, instead of deep neural networks, we apply a graph filtering technique to achieve a smooth node representation. Second, the original graph could be noisy or incomplete and is not directly applicable, thus we learn a consensus graph from data by considering the heterogeneous views. Third, high-order relations are explored in a flexible way by designing a new regularizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness and efficiency."}}

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in text classification and achieved outstanding performance. Despite the success of GNNs on text classification, existing methods are still limited in two main aspects. On the one hand, transductive methods cannot easily adapt to new documents. Since transductive methods incorporate all documents into their text graph, they need to reconstruct the whole graph and retrain their system from scratch when new documents come. However, this is not applicable to real-world situations. On the other hand, many state-of-the-art algorithms ignore the quality of text graphs, which may lead to sub-optimal performance. To address these problems, we propose a Graph Fusion Network (GFN), which can overcome these limitations and boost text classification performance. In detail, in the graph construction stage, we build homogeneous text graphs with word nodes, which makes the learning system capable of making inference on new documents without rebuilding the whole text graph. Then, we propose to transform external knowledge into structural information and integrate different views of text graphs to capture more structural information. In the graph reasoning stage, we divide the process into three steps: graph learning, graph convolution, and graph fusion. In the graph learning step, we adopt a graph learning layer to further adapt text graphs. In the graph fusion step, we design a multi-head fusion module to integrate different opinions. Experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method."}}

However, clustering of multilayer graph, which aims at dividing the graph nodes into categories or communities, is still at a nascent stage. Existing methods are often limited to exploiting the multiview attributes or multiple networks and ignoring more complex and richer network frameworks. To this end, we propose a generic and effective autoencoder framework for multilayer graph clustering named Multilayer Graph Contrastive Clustering Network (MGCCN). MGCCN consists of three modules: (1)Attention mechanism is applied to better capture the relevance between nodes and neighbors for better node embeddings. (2)To better explore the consistent information in different networks, a contrastive fusion strategy is introduced. (3)MGCCN employs a self-supervised component that iteratively strengthens the node embedding and clustering.

In contrast to most existing works that only explore one graph, our proposed SCRL method treats graph from two perspectives: topology graph and feature graph. We argue that their embeddings should share some common information, which could serve as a supervisory signal. Specifically, we construct the feature graph of node features via k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Then graph convolutional network (GCN) encoders extract features from two graphs respectively. Self-supervised loss is designed to maximize the agreement of the embeddings of the same node in the topology graph and the feature graph. Extensive experiments on real citation networks and social networks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed SCRL over the state-of-the-art methods on semi-supervised node classification task.

However, self-reconstruction loss of an AE ignores rich useful relation information and might lead to indiscriminative representation, which inevitably degrades the clustering performance. It is also challenging to learn high-level similarity without feeding semantic labels. Another unsolved problem facing DSC is the huge memory cost due to n\u00d7n similarity matrix, which is incurred by the self-expression layer between an encoder and decoder. To tackle these problems, we use pairwise similarity to weigh the reconstruction loss to capture local structure information, while a similarity is learned by the self-expression layer. Pseudo-graphs and pseudo-labels, which allow benefiting from uncertain knowledge acquired during network training, are further employed to supervise similarity learning. Joint learning and iterative training facilitate to obtain an overall optimal solution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. By combining with the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, we further show that our method can address the large-scale and out-of-sample problems.

Specifically, it retains the graph geometric features through applying a low-pass filter. Consequently, it produces a ``clustering-friendly\" representation and greatly facilitates the downstream clustering task. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our approach. Analysis shows that graph filtering increases the separability of classes."}}
