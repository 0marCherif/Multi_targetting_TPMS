Due to partial information, a policy directly trained to operate from these restricted observations tends to perform poorly. In some scenarios, during training more information about the environment is available, which can be utilized to find a superior policy. Because this privileged information is unavailable at deployment, such a policy cannot be deployed. The $\\textit{teacher-student}$ paradigm overcomes this challenge by using actions of privileged (or $\\textit{teacher}$) policy as the target for training the deployable (or $\\textit{student}$) policy operating from the restricted observation space using supervised learning. However, due to information asymmetry, it is not always feasible for the student to perfectly mimic the teacher. We provide a principled solution to this problem, wherein the student policy dynamically balances between following the teacher's guidance and utilizing reinforcement learning to solve the partially observed task directly. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on diverse domains and fares favorably against strong baselines. "}}

We consider cooperative multi-player games in which each agent's policy is constrained by a private capability parameter, and agents with higher capabilities are able to simulate the behavior of agents with lower capabilities (but not vice-versa). To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm that maintains a belief over the other agents' capabilities and incorporates this belief into the planning process. Our primary innovation is a novel framework based on capability type structures, which ensures that the belief updates remain consistent and informative without constructing the infinite hierarchy of beliefs. We also extend our techniques to settings where the agents' observations are subject to noise. We provide examples of games in which deviations in capability between oblivious agents can lead to arbitrarily poor outcomes, and experimentally validate that our capability-aware algorithm avoids the anti-cooperative behavior of the naive approach in these toy settings as well as a more complex cooperative checkers environment."}}

With the recent advance in GPU-based simulation, such as Isaac Gym, data collection speed has been improved thousands of times on a commodity GPU. Most prior works have been using on-policy methods such as PPO to train policies in Isaac Gym due to its simpleness and effectiveness in scaling up. Off-policy methods are usually more sample-efficient but more challenging to be scaled up, resulting in a much longer wall-clock training time in practice. In this work, we presented a novel parallel $Q$-learning framework that not only gains better sample efficiency but also reduces the training wall-clock time compared to PPO. Different from prior works on distributed off-policy learning, such as Apex, our framework is designed specifically for massively parallel GPU-based simulation and optimized to work on a single workstation. We demonstrate the capability of scaling up $Q$ learning methods to tens of thousands of parallel environments. We also investigate various factors that can affect the policy learning training speed, including the number of parallel environments, exploration schemes, batch size, GPU models, etc."}}

It follows that the performance of the target policy is strongly related to the performance of the behavior policy and, thus, the trajectory return distribution of the dataset. We show that in mixed datasets consisting of mostly low-return trajectories and minor high-return trajectories, state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms are overly restrained by low-return trajectories and fail to exploit high-performing trajectories to the fullest. To overcome this issue, we show that, in deterministic MDPs with stochastic initial states, the dataset sampling can be re-weighted to induce an artificial dataset whose behavior policy has a higher return. This re-weighted sampling strategy may be combined with any offline RL algorithm. We further analyze that the opportunity for performance improvement over the behavior policy correlates with the positive-sided variance of the returns of the trajectories in the dataset. We empirically show that while CQL, IQL, and TD3+BC achieve only a part of this potential policy improvement, these same algorithms combined with our reweighted sampling strategy fully exploit the dataset. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that, despite its theoretical limitation, the approach may still be efficient in stochastic environments. "}}

However, agents typically face problems like getting stuck locally during exploration and catastrophic forgetting in their construction of models when the environments are heterogeneous. Here, we propose and apply the concept of Fragmentation-and-Recall to solve spatial (FarMap) and reinforcement learning problems (FarCuriosity). Agents construct local maps or local models, respectively, which are used to predict the current observation. High surprisal points lead to a fragmentation event. At fracture points, we store the current map or model fragment in a long-term memory (LTM) and initialize a new fragment. On the other hand, Fragments are recalled (and thus reused) from LTM if the observations of their fracture points match the agent\u2019s current observation during exploration. The set of fracture points defines a set of intrinsic potential subgoals. Agents choose their next subgoal from the set of near and far potential subgoals in the current fragment or LTM, respectively. Thus, local maps and model fragments guide exploration locally and avoid catastrophic forgetting in learning heterogeneous environments, while LTM promotes exploration more globally. We evaluate FarMap and FarCuriosity on complex procedurally-generated spatial environments and on reinforcement learning benchmarks and demonstrate that the proposed methods are more efficient at exploration and memory use, and in harvesting extrinsic rewards, respectively."}}

When learning to achieve multiple goals, data efficiency is intimately connected with the generalization of the Q-function to new goals. The de-facto paradigm is to approximate Q(s, a, g) using monolithic neural networks. To improve the generalization of the Q-function, we propose a bilinear decomposition that represents the Q-value via a low-rank approximation in the form of a dot product between two vector fields. The first vector field, f(s, a), captures the environment's local dynamics at the state s; whereas the second component, {\\phi}(s, g), captures the global relationship between the current state and the goal. We show that our bilinear decomposition scheme substantially improves data efficiency, and has superior transfer to out-of-distribution goals compared to prior methods.

This strategy often uniformly and randomly samples or prioritizes data sampling based on measures such as the temporal difference (TD) error. Such sampling strategies can be inefficient at learning Q-function because a state's Q-value depends on the Q-value of successor states. If the data sampling strategy ignores the precision of the Q-value estimate of the next state, it can lead to useless and often incorrect updates to the Q-values. To mitigate this issue, we organize the agent's experience into a graph that explicitly tracks the dependency between Q-values of states. Each edge in the graph represents a transition between two states by executing a single action. We perform value backups via a breadth-first search starting from that expands vertices in the graph starting from the set of terminal states and successively moving backward. We empirically show that our method is substantially more data-efficient than several baselines on a diverse range of goal-reaching tasks. Notably, the proposed method also outperforms baselines that consume more batches of training experience and operates from high-dimensional observational data such as images."}}

Our method is motivated from primary failure modes of prior state-of-the-art: poor exploration, inaccurate object identification, and agent getting trapped due to imprecise map construction. We make three contributions to mitigate these issues: (i) First, we show that existing map-based methods fail to effectively use semantic clues for exploration. We present a semantic-agnostic exploration strategy (called Stubborn) without any learning that surprisingly outperforms prior work. (ii) We propose a strategy for integrating temporal information to improve object identification. (iii) Lastly, due to inaccurate depth observation the agent often gets trapped in small regions. We develop a multi-scale collision map for obstacle identification that mitigates this issue."}}
