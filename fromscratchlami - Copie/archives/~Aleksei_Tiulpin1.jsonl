We investigate Triplet loss (TL), which is probably the most well-known loss for this problem. TL aims to enforce closeness between similar and enlarge the distance between dissimilar data points in the image representation space extracted by a DNN. Although TL has been shown to perform well, it still has limitations, which we identify and analyze in this work.\nSpecifically, we first introduce AdaTriplet -- an extension of TL that aims to adapt loss gradients according to the levels of difficulty of negative samples. Second, we also introduce AutoMargin -- a technique to adjust hyperparameters of margin-based losses such as TL and AdaTriplet dynamically during training. The performance of our loss is evaluated on a new large-scale benchmark for FMIM, which we have constructed from the Osteoarthritis Initiative cohort. The codes allowing replication of our results have been made publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/Oulu-IMEDS/AdaTriplet}."}}

The training of ensembles relies on non-convexity of the loss landscape and random initialization of their individual members, making the resulting posterior approximation uncontrolled. This paper proposes a novel and principled method to tackle this limitation, minimizing an $f$-divergence between the true posterior and a kernel density estimator in a function space. We analyze this objective from a combinatorial point of view, and show that it is submodular with respect to mixture components for any $f$. Subsequently, we consider the problem of greedy ensemble construction, and from the marginal gain of the total objective, we derive a novel diversity term for ensemble methods. The performance of our approach is demonstrated on computer vision out-of-distribution detection benchmarks in a range of architectures trained on multiple datasets. The source code of our method is made publicly available."}}

This musculoskeletal disorder is assessed from clinical symptoms, and typically confirmed via radiographic assessment. This visual assessment done by a radiologist requires experience, and suffers from moderate to high inter-observer variability. The recent literature has shown that deep learning methods can reliably perform the OA severity assessment according to the gold standard Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system. However, these methods require large amounts of labeled data, which are costly to obtain. In this study, we propose the Semixup algorithm, a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach to leverage unlabeled data. Semixup relies on consistency regularization using in- and out-of-manifold samples, together with interpolated consistency. On an independent test set, our method significantly outperformed other state-of-the-art SSL methods in most cases. Finally, when compared to a well-tuned fully supervised baseline that yielded a balanced accuracy (BA) of $70.9\\pm0.8%$ on the test set, Semixup had comparable performance -- BA of $71\\pm0.8%$ $(p=0.368)$ while requiring $6$ times less labeled data. These results show that our proposed SSL method allows building fully automatic OA severity assessment tools with datasets that are available outside research settings."}}

Our method is based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) decoder.

Finally, using the predicted segmentation mask samples, we estimate CTR with uncertainty. In our experiments we demonstrate that the proposed method generalizes well to three different test sets.

We have earlier developed the 3D protocol for imaging of AC and its structures which includes staining of the sample with a contrast agent (phosphotungstic acid, PTA) and a consequent scanning with micro-computed tomography. Such a protocol was designed to provide X-ray attenuation contrast to visualize AC structure. However, at the same time, this protocol has one major disadvantage: the loss of contrast at the tidemark (calcified cartilage interface, CCI). An accurate segmentation of CCI can be very important for understanding the etiology of OA and ex-vivo evaluation of tidemark condition at early OA stages. In this paper, we present the first application of Deep Learning to PTA-stained osteochondral samples that allows to perform tidemark segmentation in a fully-automatic manner. Our method is based on U-Net trained using a combination of binary cross-entropy and soft Jaccard loss. On cross-validation, this approach yielded intersection over the union of  0.59, 0.70, 0.79, 0.83 and 0.86 within 15 \u03bcm, 30 \u03bcm, 45 \u03bcm, 60 \u03bcm and 75 \u03bcm  padded zones around the tidemark, respectively. Our codes and the dataset that consisted of 35 PTA-stained human AC samples are made publicly available together with the segmentation masks to facilitate the development of biomedical image segmentation methods."}}

This problem is closely related to optical flow estimation task where ConvNets (CNNs) have recently achieved significant progress. While optical flow methods produce very accurate results for the small pixel translation and limited appearance variation scenarios, they hardly deal with the strong geometric transformations that we consider in this work. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine CNN-based framework that can leverage the advantages of optical flow approaches and extend them to the case of large transformations providing dense and subpixel accurate estimates. It is trained on synthetic transformations and demonstrates very good performance to unseen, realistic, data. Further, we apply our method to the problem of relative camera pose estimation and demonstrate that the model outperforms existing dense approaches."}}

Segmentation of AC tissues from MRI data is an essential step in quantification of their damage. Deep learning (DL) based methods have shown potential in this realm and are the current state-of-the-art, however, their robustness to heterogeneity of MRI acquisition settings remains an open problem. In this study, we investigated two modern regularization techniques - mixup and adversarial unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) - to improve the robustness of DL-based knee cartilage segmentation to new MRI acquisition settings. Our validation setup included two datasets produced by different MRI scanners and using distinct data acquisition protocols. We assessed the robustness of automatic segmentation by comparing mixup and UDA approaches to a strong baseline method at different OA severity stages and, additionally, in relation to anatomical locations. Our results showed that for moderate changes in knee MRI data acquisition settings both approaches may provide notable improvements in the robustness, which are consistent for all stages of the disease and affect the clinically important areas of the knee joint. However, mixup may be considered as a recommended approach, since it is more computationally efficient and does not require additional data from the target acquisition setup."}}

Landmark localization can be viewed as regression problem, where the landmark position is directly predicted by using the region of interest or even full-size images leading to large memory footprint, especially in case of high resolution medical images. In this work, we propose an efficient deep neural networks framework with an hourglass architecture utilizing a soft-argmax layer to directly predict normalized coordinates of the landmark points. We provide an extensive evaluation of different regularization techniques and various loss functions to understand their influence on the localization performance. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of transfer learning from low-budget annotations, and experimentally demonstrate that such approach is improving the accuracy of landmark localization. Compared to the prior methods, we validate our model on two datasets that are independent from the train data and assess the performance of the method for different stages of OA severity. The proposed approach demonstrates better generalization performance compared to the current state-of-the-art."}}

Histopathological cellularity assessment of residual tumors in post-surgical tissues is used to analyze a tumor's response to a therapy. Correct cellularity assessment increases the chances of getting an appropriate treatment and facilitates the patient's survival. In current clinical practice, tumor cellularity is manually estimated by pathologists; this process is tedious and prone to errors or low agreement rates between assessors. In this work, we evaluated three strong novel Deep Learning-based approaches for automatic assessment of tumor cellularity from post-treated breast surgical specimens stained with hematoxylin and eosin. We validated the proposed methods on the BreastPathQ SPIE challenge dataset that consisted of 2395 image patches selected from whole slide images acquired from 64 patients. Compared to expert pathologist scoring, our best performing method yielded the Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.70 (vs. 0.42 previously known in literature) and the intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.89 (vs. 0.83). Our results suggest that Deep Learning-based methods have a significant potential to alleviate the burden on pathologists, enhance the diagnostic workflow, and, thereby, facilitate better clinical outcomes in breast cancer treatment."}}
