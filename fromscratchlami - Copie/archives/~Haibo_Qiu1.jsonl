Inspired by the success of high-resolution architectures in image dense prediction, which always maintains a high-resolution representation throughout the entire learning process, we consider it also highly important for 3D dense point cloud analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we explore high-resolution architectures for 3D point cloud segmentation. Specifically, we generalize high-resolution architectures using a unified pipeline named PointHR, which includes a knn-based sequence operator for feature extraction and a differential resampling operator to efficiently communicate different resolutions. Additionally, we propose to avoid numerous on-the-fly computations of high-resolution architectures by pre-computing the indices for both sequence and resampling operators. By doing so, we deliver highly competitive high-resolution architectures while capitalizing on the benefits of well-designed point cloud blocks without additional effort. To evaluate these architectures for dense point cloud analysis, we conduct thorough experiments using S3DIS and ScanNetV2 datasets, where the proposed PointHR outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods without any bells and whistles.

In this paper, we propose a new transformer network equipped with a collect-and-distribute mechanism to communicate short- and long-range contexts of point clouds, which we refer to as CDFormer. Specifically, we first employ self-attention to capture short-range interactions within each local patch, and the updated local features are then collected into a set of proxy reference points from which we can extract long-range contexts. Afterward, we distribute the learned long-range contexts back to local points via cross-attention. To address the position clues for short- and long-range contexts, we additionally introduce the context-aware position encoding to facilitate position-aware communications between points. We perform experiments on five popular point cloud datasets, namely ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, ShapeNetPart, S3DIS and ScanNetV2, for classification and segmentation. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed CDFormer, delivering several new state-of-the-art performances on point cloud classification and segmentation tasks.

However, the state-of-the-art general face recognition models do not generalize well to occluded face images, which are exactly the common cases in real-world scenarios. The potential reasons are the absences of large-scale occluded face data for training and specific designs for tackling corrupted features brought by occlusions. This article presents a novel face recognition method that is robust to occlusions based on a single end-to-end deep neural network. Our approach, named FROM (Face Recognition with Occlusion Masks), learns to discover the corrupted features from the deep convolutional neural networks, and clean them by the dynamically learned masks. In addition, we construct massive occluded face images to train FROM effectively and efficiently. FROM is simple yet powerful compared to the existing methods that either rely on external detectors to discover the occlusions or employ shallow models which are less discriminative. Experimental results on the LFW, Megaface challenge 1, RMF2, AR dataset and other simulated occluded/masked datasets confirm that FROM dramatically improves the accuracy under occlusions, and generalizes well on general face recognition."}}

Different views capture different information of point clouds and thus are complementary to each other. However, recent projection-based methods for point cloud semantic segmentation usually utilize a vanilla late fusion strategy for the predictions of different views, failing to explore the complementary information from a geometric perspective during the representation learning. In this paper, we introduce a geometric flow network (GFNet) to explore the geometric correspondence between different views in an align-before-fuse manner. Specifically, we devise a novel geometric flow module (GFM) to bidirectionally align and propagate the complementary information across different views according to geometric relationships under the end-to-end learning scheme. We perform extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our GFNet for project-based point cloud semantic segmentation. Concretely, GFNet not only significantly boosts the performance of each individual view but also achieves state-of-the-art results over all existing projection-based models.

However, collecting large-scale real-world training data for face recognition has turned out to be challenging, especially due to the label noise and privacy issues. Meanwhile, existing face recognition datasets are usually collected from web images, lacking detailed annotations on attributes (e.g., pose and expression), so the influences of different attributes on face recognition have been poorly investigated. In this paper, we address the above-mentioned issues in face recognition using synthetic face images, i.e., SynFace. Specifically, we first explore the performance gap between recent state-of-the-art face recognition models trained with synthetic and real face images. We then analyze the underlying causes behind the performance gap, e.g., the poor intraclass variations and the domain gap between synthetic and real face images. Inspired by this, we devise the SynFace with identity mixup (IM) and domain mixup (DM) to mitigate the above performance gap, demonstrating the great potentials of synthetic data for face recognition. Furthermore, with the controllable face synthesis model, we can easily manage different factors of synthetic face generation, including pose, expression, illumination, the number of identities, and samples per identity. Therefore, we also perform a systematically empirical analysis on synthetic face images to provide some insights on how to effectively utilize synthetic data for face recognition."}}

In this work, we present an approach to refine inaccurate 3D pose estimations. The core idea of the approach is to learn a number of bases to obtain tight approximations of the low-dimensional pose manifold where a 3D pose is represented by a convex combination of the bases. The representation requires that globally the refined poses are close to the pose manifold thus avoiding generating illegitimate poses. Second, the designed bases also have the property to guarantee that the distances among the body joints of a pose are within reasonable ranges. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach obtains more legitimate poses over the baselines. In particular, the limb lengths are closer to the ground truth."}}
