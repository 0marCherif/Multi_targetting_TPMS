To address this challenge, we propose a new framework, called Hyper-Decision Transformer (HDT), that can generalize to novel tasks from a handful of demonstrations in a data- and parameter-efficient manner. To achieve such a goal, we propose to augment the base DT with an adaptation module, whose parameters are initialized by a hyper-network. When encountering unseen tasks, the hyper-network takes a handful of demonstrations as inputs and initializes the adaptation module accordingly. This initialization enables HDT to efficiently adapt to novel tasks by only fine-tuning the adaptation module. We validate HDT's generalization capability on object manipulation tasks. We find that with a single expert demonstration and fine-tuning only 0.5% of DT parameters, HDT adapts faster to unseen tasks than fine-tuning the whole DT model. Finally, we explore a more challenging setting where expert actions are not available, and we show that HDT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of task success rates by a large margin."}}

Nevertheless, they still make mistakes from time to time. For a model deployed in an industrial environment, fixing these mistakes quickly and robustly is vital to improve user experiences. Previous works formalize such problems as Model Editing (ME) and mostly focus on fixing one mistake. However, the one-mistake-fixing scenario is not an accurate abstraction of the real-world challenge. In the deployment of AI services, there are ever-emerging mistakes, and the same mistake may recur if not corrected in time. Thus a preferable solution is to rectify the mistakes as soon as they appear nonstop. Therefore, we extend the existing ME into Sequential Model Editing (SME) to help develop more practical editing methods. Our study shows that most current ME methods could yield unsatisfying results in this scenario. We then introduce Transformer-Patcher, a novel model editor that can shift the behavior of transformer-based models by simply adding and training a few neurons in the last Feed-Forward Network layer. Experimental results on both classification and generation tasks show that Transformer-Patcher can successively correct up to thousands of errors (Reliability) and generalize to their equivalent inputs (Generality) while retaining the model's accuracy on irrelevant inputs (Locality). Our method outperforms previous fine-tuning and HyperNetwork-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance for Sequential Model Editing (SME).

However, solving the knowledge-based visual reasoning tasks remains challenging, which requires a model to comprehensively understand image content, connect the external world knowledge, and perform step-by-step reasoning to answer the questions correctly. To this end, we propose a novel framework named Interactive Prompting Visual Reasoner (IPVR) for few-shot knowledge-based visual reasoning. IPVR contains three stages, see, think and confirm. The see stage scans the image and grounds the visual concept candidates with a visual perception model. The think stage adopts a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to attend to the key concepts from candidates adaptively. It then transforms them into text context for prompting with a visual captioning model and adopts the LLM to generate the answer. The confirm stage further uses the LLM to generate the supporting rationale to the answer, verify the generated rationale with a cross-modality classifier and ensure that the rationale can infer the predicted output consistently. We conduct experiments on a range of knowledge-based visual reasoning datasets. We found our IPVR enjoys several benefits, 1). it achieves better performance than the previous few-shot learning baselines; 2). it enjoys the total transparency and trustworthiness of the whole reasoning process by providing rationales for each reasoning step; 3). it is computation-efficient compared with other fine-tuning baselines."}}

When looking at an image, we can decompose the scene into entities and their parts as well as obtain the dependencies between them. To mimic such capability, we propose Visual Dependency Transformers (DependencyViT) that can induce visual dependencies without any labels. We achieve that with a novel neural operator called \\emph{reversed attention} that can naturally capture long-range visual dependencies between image patches. Specifically, we formulate it as a dependency graph where a child token in reversed attention is trained to attend to its parent tokens and send information following a normalized probability distribution rather than gathering information in conventional self-attention. With such a design, hierarchies naturally emerge from reversed attention layers, and a dependency tree is progressively induced from leaf nodes to the root node unsupervisedly. DependencyViT offers several appealing benefits. (i) Entities and their parts in an image are represented by different subtrees, enabling part partitioning from dependencies; (ii) Dynamic visual pooling is made possible. The leaf nodes which rarely send messages can be pruned without hindering the model performance, based on which we propose the lightweight DependencyViT-Lite to reduce the computational and memory footprints; (iii) DependencyViT works well on both self- and weakly-supervised pretraining paradigms on ImageNet, and demonstrates its effectiveness on 8 datasets and 5 tasks, such as unsupervised part and saliency segmentation, recognition, and detection."}}
