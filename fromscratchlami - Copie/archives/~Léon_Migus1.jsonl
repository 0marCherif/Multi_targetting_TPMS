We propose a novel modeling approach leveraging Implicit Neural Representations (INR). This approach enables us to effectively capture the continuous aspect of time series and provides a natural solution to recurring modeling issues such as handling missing data, dealing with irregular sampling, or unaligned observations from multiple sensors. By introducing conditional modulation of INR parameters and leveraging meta-learning techniques, we address the issue of generalization to both unseen samples and time window shifts. Through extensive experimentation, our model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in forecasting and imputation tasks, while exhibiting flexibility in handling a wide range of challenging scenarios that competing models cannot."}}

To circumvent limitations of traditional solvers, many different Deep Learning methods have been proposed. They are all based on auto-regressive methods and exhibit stability issues. Drawing inspiration from the stability property of implicit numerical schemes, we introduce a stable  auto-regressive implicit neural network. We develop a theory based on the stability definition of schemes to ensure the stability in forecasting of this network. It leads us to introduce hard constraints on its weights and propagate the dynamics in the latent space. Our experimental results validate our stability property, and show improved results at long-term forecasting for two transports PDEs."}}

They allow us to approximate complex physical phenomena, thereby reducing the computational burden of direct numerical simulations. We propose INFINITY, a deep learning model that utilizes implicit neural representations (INRs) to address this challenge. Our framework encodes geometric information and physical fields into compact representations and learns a mapping between them to infer the physical fields. We use an airfoil design optimization problem as an example task and we evaluate our approach on the challenging AirfRANS dataset, which closely resembles real-world industrial use-cases. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance by accurately inferring physical fields throughout the volume and surface. Additionally we demonstrate its applicability in contexts such as design exploration and shape optimization: our model can correctly predict drag and lift coefficients while adhering to the equations."}}
