It has been shown that BP can achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks by mixing old and new messages before sending the new one, i.e., damping. However, existing methods on tuning a static damping factor for BP not only is laborious but also harms their performance. Moreover, existing BP  algorithms treat each variable node's neighbors equally when composing a new message, which also limits their exploration ability. To address these issues, we seamlessly integrate BP, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) within the massage-passing framework to reason about dynamic weights and damping factors for composing new BP messages. Our model, Deep Attentive Belief Propagation (DABP), takes the factor graph and the BP messages in each iteration as the input and infers the optimal weights and damping factors through GRUs and GATs, followed by a multi-head attention layer. Furthermore, unlike existing neural-based BP variants, we propose a novel self-supervised learning algorithm for DABP with a smoothed solution cost, which does not require expensive training labels and also avoids the common out-of-distribution issue through efficient online learning. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines."}}

When compared with the state-of-the-art distributed algorithm for CRC constraints, which is a randomized one, our algorithm guarantees to generate a solution for satisfiable CRC constraint networks and it is applicable to solve large networks in real distributed systems.

Tree convex constraints are extensions of the well-known row convex constraints. Just like the latter, every path-consistent tree convex constraint network is globally consistent. However, it is NP-complete to decide whether a tree convex constraint network has solutions. This paper studies and compares three subclasses of tree convex constraints, which are called chain-, path-, and tree-preserving constraints respectively. The class of tree-preserving constraints strictly contains the subclasses of path-preserving and arc-consistent chain-preserving constraints. We prove that, when enforcing strong path-consistency on a tree-preserving constraint network, in each step, the network remains tree-preserving. This ensures the global consistency of consistent tree-preserving networks after enforcing strong path-consistency, and also guarantees the applicability of the partial path-consistency algorithms to tree-preserving constraint networks, which is usually much more efficient than the path-consistency algorithms for large sparse constraint networks. As an application, we show that the class of tree-preserving constraints is useful in solving the scene labelling problem."}}
