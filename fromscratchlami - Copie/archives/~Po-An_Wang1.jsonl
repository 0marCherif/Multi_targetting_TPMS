The goal of the learner is to answer a query about the environment with a given level of certainty while minimizing her sampling budget. For this problem, instance-specific lower bounds on the expected sample complexity reveal the optimal proportions of arm draws an Oracle algorithm would apply. These proportions solve an optimization problem whose tractability strongly depends on the structural properties of the environment, but may be instrumental in the design of efficient learning algorithms. We devise Frank-Wolfe-based Sampling (FWS), a simple algorithm whose sample complexity matches the lower bounds for a wide class of pure exploration problems. The algorithm is computationally efficient as, to learn and track the optimal proportion of arm draws, it relies on a single iteration of Frank-Wolfe algorithm applied to the lower-bound optimization problem. We apply FWS to various pure exploration tasks, including best arm identification in unstructured, thresholded, linear, and Lipschitz bandits. Despite its simplicity, FWS is competitive compared to state-of-art algorithms."}}

When several players select the same arm, a collision occurs and no reward is collected on this arm. Players involved in a collision are informed about this collision. We present DPE (Decentralized Parsimonious Exploration), a decentralized algorithm that achieves the same regret as that obtained by an optimal centralized algorithm. Our algorithm has better regret guarantees than the state-of-the-art algorithm SIC-MMAB \\cite{boursier2019}. As in SIC-MMAB, players communicate through collisions only. An additional important advantage of DPE is that it requires very little communication. Specifically, the expected number of rounds where players use collisions to communicate is finite."}}
