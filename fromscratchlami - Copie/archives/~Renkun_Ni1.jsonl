However, SAM incurs a high computational cost in practice, requiring up to twice as much computation as vanilla SGD. The computational challenge posed by SAM arises because each iteration requires both ascent and descent steps and thus double the gradient computations. To address this challenge, we propose to compute gradients in both stages of SAM on only the top-k samples with highest loss. K-SAM is simple and extremely easy-to-implement while providing significant generalization boosts over vanilla SGD at little to no additional cost."}}

In this paper, we observe experimentally that this implicit regularization behavior is {\\em generic}, i.e. it does not depend strongly on the choice of optimizer. We demonstrate this by training neural networks using several gradient-free optimizers, which do not benefit from properties that are often attributed to gradient-based optimizers.   This includes a guess-and-check optimizer that generates uniformly random parameter vectors until finding one that happens to achieve perfect train accuracy, and a zeroth-order Pattern Search optimizer that uses no gradient computations. In the low sample and few-shot regimes, where zeroth order optimizers are most computationally tractable, we find that these non-gradient optimizers achieve test accuracy comparable to SGD.

Meanwhile, existing GNN architectures are limited in their ability to perform equally well on both homophilious and heterophilious graphs as their inductive biases are generally tailored to only one setting. To address these issues, we propose GOAT, a scalable global graph transformer. In GOAT, each node conceptually attends to all the nodes in the graph and homophily/heterophily relationships can be learnt adaptively from the data. We provide theoretical justification for our approximate global self-attention scheme, and show it to be scalable to large-scale graphs. We demonstrate the competitiveness of GOAT on both heterophilious and homophilious graphs with millions of nodes."}}

Past algorithmic approaches aim to enforce parity across groups given a fixed set of training data; instead, we ask: what if we can gather more data to mitigate disparities? We develop a meta-learning algorithm for parity-constrained active learning that learns a policy to decide which labels to query so as to maximize accuracy subject to parity constraints. To optimize the active learning policy, our proposed algorithm formulates the parity-constrained active learning task as a bi-level optimization problem. The inner level corresponds to training a classifier on a subset of labeled examples. The outer level corresponds to updating the selection policy choosing this subset to achieve a desired fairness and accuracy behavior on the trained classifier. To solve this constrained bi-level optimization problem, we employ the Forward-Backward Splitting optimization method. Empirically, across several parity metrics and classification tasks, our approach outperforms alternatives by a large margin."}}

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of screening using low dose CT (LDCT) in reducing lung cancer related mortality. While lung nodules are detected with a high rate of sensitivity, this exam has a low specificity rate and it is still difficult to separate benign and malignant lesions. The ISBI 2018 Lung Nodule Malignancy Prediction Challenge, developed by a team from the Quantitative Imaging Network of the National Cancer Institute, was focused on the prediction of lung nodule malignancy from two sequential LDCT screening exams using automated (non-manual) algorithms. We curated a cohort of 100 subjects who participated in the National Lung Screening Trial and had established pathological diagnoses. Data from 30 subjects were randomly selected for training and the remaining was used for testing. Participants were evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of nodule-wise malignancy scores generated by their algorithms on the test set. The challenge had 17 participants, with 11 teams submitting reports with method description, mandated by the challenge rules. Participants used quantitative methods, resulting in a reporting test AUC ranging from 0.698 to 0.913. The top five contestants used deep learning approaches, reporting an AUC between 0.87 \u2013 0.91. The team\u2019s predictor did not achieve significant differences from each other nor from a volume change estimate (p =.05 with Bonferroni-Holm\u2019s correction)."}}

Meanwhile, these products are accumulated using high-precision (typically 32-bit) additions. Additions dominate the arithmetic complexity of inference in quantized (e.g., binary) nets, and high precision is needed to avoid overflow. To further optimize inference, we propose WrapNet, an architecture that adapts neural networks to use low-precision (8-bit) additions while achieving classification accuracy comparable to their 32-bit counterparts. We achieve resilience to low-precision accumulation by inserting a cyclic activation layer that makes results invariant to overflow. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using both software and hardware platforms."}}
