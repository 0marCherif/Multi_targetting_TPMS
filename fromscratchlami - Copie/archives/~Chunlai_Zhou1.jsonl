Pignistic and plausibility transformations are two well-known probability transformations that map belief functions to probability functions in the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. In this paper, we establish the link between pignistic and plausibility transformations by devising a belief-update framework for belief functions where plausibility transformation works on belief update while pignistic transformation operates on absolute belief. In this framework, we define a new belief-update operator connecting the two transformations, and interpret the framework in a belief-function model of parametric statistical inference. As a metaphor, these two transformations projecting the belief-update framework for belief functions to that for probabilities are likened to the fire projecting reality into shadows on the wall in Plato's cave."}}

In the theory, belief functions are defined on Boolean algebras of events. In many applications of belief functions in real world problems, however, the objects that we manipulate is no more a Boolean algebra but a distributive lattice. In this paper, we employ Birkhoff@?s representation theorem for finite distributive lattices to extend the Dempster-Shafer theory to the setting of distributive lattices, which has a mathematical theory as attractive as in that of Boolean algebras. Moreover, we use this more general theory to provide a framework for reasoning about belief functions in a deductive approach on non-classical formalisms which assume a setting of distributive lattices. As an illustration of this approach, we investigate the theory of belief functions for a simple epistemic logic the first-degree-entailment fragment of relevance logic R by providing an axiomatization for reasoning about belief functions for this logic and by showing that the complexity of the satisfiability problem of a belief formula with respect to the class of the corresponding Dempster-Shafer structures is NP-complete."}}
