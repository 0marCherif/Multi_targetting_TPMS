In this paper, we propose a novel online framework for 3D vehicle detection and tracking from monocular videos. The framework can not only associate detections of vehicles in motion over time, but also estimate their complete 3D bounding box information from a sequence of 2D images captured on a moving platform. Our method leverages 3D box depth-ordering matching for robust instance association and utilizes 3D trajectory prediction for re-identification of occluded vehicles. We also design a motion learning module based on an LSTM for more accurate long-term motion extrapolation. Our experiments on simulation, KITTI, and Argoverse datasets show that our 3D tracking pipeline offers robust data association and tracking. On Argoverse, our image-based method is significantly better for tracking 3D vehicles within 30 meters than the LiDAR-centric baseline methods."}}

For autonomous driving, models that explicitly represent objects may be more robust to new scenes\nand provide intuitive visualizations. We describe a taxonomy of \u201cobject-centric\" models which leverage both object instances and end-to-end learning. In the Grand Theft Auto V simulator, we show that object-centric models outperform object-agnostic methods in scenes with other vehicles and pedestrians, even with an imperfect detector. We also demonstrate that our architectures perform well on real-world environments by evaluating on the Berkeley DeepDrive Video dataset."}}

The existence of adversarial examples hinders such applications. The state-of-the-art result on defense shows that adversarial training can be applied to train a robust model on MNIST against adversarial examples; but it fails to achieve a high empirical worst-case accuracy on a more complex task, such as CIFAR-10 and SVHN. In our work, we propose curriculum adversarial training (CAT) to resolve this issue. The basic idea is to develop a curriculum of adversarial examples generated by attacks with a wide range of strengths. With two techniques to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting and the generalization issues, we demonstrate that CAT can improve the prior art's empirical worst-case accuracy by a large margin of 25% on CIFAR-10 and 35% on SVHN. At the same, the model's performance on non-adversarial inputs is comparable to the state-of-the-art models."}}
