Its research progress has been boosted by existing HPO benchmarks.

In this paper, we first identify some uniqueness of HPO for FL algorithms from various aspects. Due to this uniqueness, existing HPO benchmarks no longer satisfy the need to compare HPO methods in the FL setting. To facilitate the research of HPO in the FL setting, we propose and implement a benchmark suite FedHPO-Bench that incorporates comprehensive FedHPO problems, enables flexible customization of the function evaluations, and eases continuing extensions. We also conduct extensive experiments based on FedHPO-Bench to provide the community with more insights into FedHPO.

However, standardized evaluation and systematical analysis of diverse pFL methods remain a challenge. Firstly, the highly varied datasets, FL simulation settings and pFL implementations prevent easy and fair comparisons of pFL methods. Secondly, the current pFL literature diverges in the adopted evaluation and ablation protocols. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of pFL methods are under-explored in various practical scenarios, such as the generalization to new clients and the participation of resource-limited clients. To tackle these challenges, we propose the first comprehensive pFL benchmark, pFL-Bench, for facilitating rapid, reproducible, standardized and thorough pFL evaluation. The proposed benchmark contains more than 10 dataset variants in various application domains with a unified data partition and realistic heterogeneous settings; a modularized and easy-to-extend pFL codebase with more than 20 competitive pFL method implementations; and systematic evaluations under containerized environments in terms of generalization, fairness, system overhead, and convergence. We highlight the benefits and potential of state-of-the-art pFL methods and hope pFL-Bench enables further pFL research and broad applications that would otherwise be difficult owing to the absence of a dedicated benchmark.

We also present B-FHTL, a federated hetero-task learning benchmark consisting of simulation dataset, FL protocols and a unified evaluation mechanism. B-FHTL dataset contains three well-designed federated learning tasks with increasing heterogeneity. Each task simulates the clients with different non-IID data and learning tasks. To ensure fair comparison among different FL algorithms, B-FHTL builds in a full suite of FL protocols by providing high-level APIs to avoid privacy leakage, and presets most common evaluation metrics spanning across different learning tasks, such as regression, classification, text generation and etc. Furthermore, we compare the FL algorithms in fields of federated multi-task learning, federated personalization and federated meta learning within B-FHTL, and highlight the influence of heterogeneity and difficulties of federated hetero-task learning.

To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel FL platform, named FederatedScope, which employs an event-driven architecture to provide users with great flexibility to independently describe the behaviors of different participants. Such a design makes it easy for users to describe participants with various local training processes, learning goals and backends, and coordinate them into an FL course with synchronous or asynchronous training strategies. Towards an easy-to-use and flexible platform, FederatedScope enables rich types of plug-in operations and components for efficient further development, and we have implemented several important components to better help users with privacy protection, attack simulation and auto-tuning. We have released FederatedScope at https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope to promote academic research and industrial deployment of federated learning in a wide range of scenarios."}}

However, the optimal architecture is applied to all the instances (i.e., nodes, in the context of graph) equally, which might be insufficient to handle the diverse local patterns ingrained in a graph, as shown in this paper and some very recent studies. Thus, we argue the necessity of node-wise architecture search for GNN. Nevertheless, node-wise architecture cannot be realized by trivially applying NAS methods node by node due to the scalability issue and the need for determining test nodes' architectures. To tackle these challenges, we propose a framework wherein the parametric controllers decide the GNN architecture for each node based on its local patterns. We instantiate our framework with depth, aggregator and resolution controllers, and then elaborate on learning the backbone GNN model and the controllers to encourage their cooperation. Empirically, we justify the effects of node-wise architecture through the performance improvements introduced by the three controllers, respectively. Moreover, our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five of the ten real-world datasets, where the diversity of these datasets has hindered any graph convolution-based method to lead on them simultaneously. This result further confirms that node-wise architecture can help GNNs become versatile models."}}

In this paper, we identify the obstacles of applying Transformer to large graphs: (1) The vast number of distant nodes distract the necessary attention of each target node from its local neighborhood; (2) The quadratic computational complexity regarding the number of nodes makes the learning procedure costly. We get rid of these obstacles by exploiting the complementary natures of GNN and Transformer, and trade the fine-grained long-range information for the efficiency of Transformer. In particular, we present Coarformer, a two-view architecture that captures fine-grained local information using a GNN-based module on the original graph and coarse yet long-range information using a Transformer-based module on the coarse graph (with far fewer nodes). Meanwhile, we design a scheme to enable message passing across these two views to enhance each other. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where Coarformer outperforms any single-view method that solely applies a GNN or Transformer. Besides, the coarse global view and the cross-view propagation scheme enable Coarformer to perform better than the combinations of different GNN-based and Transformer-based modules while consuming the least running time and GPU memory."}}
