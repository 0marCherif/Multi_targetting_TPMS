Building and maintaining it remains challenging due to the need to merge information from multiple providers. Entity Resolution (ER) consists of finding entity mentions from different sources that refer to the same real world entity. In geospatial ER, entities are often represented using different schemes and are subject to incomplete information and inaccurate location, making ER and deduplication daunting tasks. While tremendous advances have been made in traditional entity resolution and natural language processing, geospatial data integration approaches still heavily rely on static similarity measures and human-designed rules. In order to achieve automatic linking of geospatial data, a unified representation of entities with heterogeneous attributes and their geographical context, is needed. To this end, we propose Geo-ER1, a joint framework that combines Transformer-based language models, that have been successfully applied in ER, with a novel learning-based architecture to represent the geospatial character of the entity. Different from existing solutions, Geo-ER does not rely on pre-defined rules and is able to capture information from surrounding entities in order to make context-based, accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on eight real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, Geo-ER proves to be robust in settings where there is no available training data for a specific city."}}

Actual costs in follow-up treatment cannot exceed the prepaid value, achieving the purpose of medical cost control. Three problems exist in the process. First, some treatment operations are highly overlapping and therefore cannot be accurately classified. Second, classification data cannot be credibly shared across hospitals. Third problem is the historical payment path required to predict costs cannot be fully traced. To address these problems, we design a Cost Control System Based on Blockchain and DRG Mechanism (CCSBD). We proposes a fusion classification model to realize the contribution assessment of the important feature factors, leading to accurate classification. In order to ensure the security and consistency of shared information, We establish a hyper-ledger blockchain architecture for secure sharing of medical data. Through smart contract, the architecture realizes dynamic consensus endorsement of data and cross-chain cross-authentication of departmental attributes. We realize value data screening and clinical path tracking through logical chain code to generate reasonable cost metrics to predict expenses, and implement CCSBD on the Fabric consortium-chain platform. Through comparative analysis with three single classification models, we prove that CCSBD improves classification accuracy by 7%. Furthermore, the security and efficiency of the shared structure are demonstrated by smart contract latency tests and consistency attack tests."}}

Despite substantial progress in training accurate models of code search, the robustness of these models has received little attention so far. In this paper, we aim to study and understand the security and robustness of code search models by answering the following question: Can we inject backdoors into deep-learning-based code search models? If so, can we detect poisoned data and remove these backdoors? This work studies and develops a series of backdoor attacks on the deep-learning-based models for code search, through data poisoning. We first show that existing models are vulnerable to data-poisoning-based backdoor attacks. We then introduce a simple yet effective attack on neural code search models by poisoning their corresponding training dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that attacks can also influence the ranking of the code search results by adding a few specially-crafted source code files to the training corpus. We show that this type of backdoor attack is effective for several representative deep-learning-based code search systems, and can successfully manipulate the ranking list of searching results. Taking the bidirectional RNN-based code search system as an example, the normalized ranking of the target candidate can be significantly raised from top 50% to top 4.43%, given a query containing an attacker targeted word, e.g., file. To defend a model against such attack, we empirically examine an existing popular defense strategy and evaluate its performance. Our results show the explored defense strategy is not yet effective in our proposed backdoor attack for code search systems."}}

Every user can download the weights of PTMs, then fine-tune the weights for a task on the local side. However, the pre-training of a model relies heavily on accessing a large-scale of training data and requires a vast amount of computing resources. These strict requirements make it impossible for any single client to pre-train such a model. To grant clients with limited computing capability to participate in pre-training a large model, we propose a new learning approach, FedBERT, that takes advantage of the federated learning and split learning approaches, resorting to pre-training BERT in a federated way. FedBERT can prevent sharing the raw data information and obtain excellent performance. Extensive experiments on seven GLUE tasks demonstrate that FedBERT can maintain its effectiveness without communicating to the sensitive local data of clients."}}

Existing work usually takes pairs of entities as input and judges those pairs independently. However, there is often interdependence between different pairs of ER decisions, e.g., the entities from the same data source are usually semantically related to each other. Furthermore, current ER approaches are mainly based on attribute similarity comparison, but ignore interdependence between attributes. To address the limits of existing methods, we propose HierGAT, a new method for ER based on a Hierarchical Graph Attention Transformer Network, which can model and exploit the interdependence between different ER decisions. The benefit of our method comes from: 1) The graph attention network model for joint ER decisions; 2) The graph-attention capability to identify the discriminative words from attributes and find the most discriminative attributes. Furthermore, we propose to learn contextual embeddings to enrich word embeddings for better performance. The experimental results on publicly available benchmark datasets show that HierGAT outperforms DeepMatcher by up to 32.5% of F1 score and up to 8.7% of F1 score compared with Ditto."}}

Sorting algorithms are important topics in Data Structure where students are expected to learn how various sorting algorithms work and their time complexities. Some sorting algorithms may easily cause confusions to novice students, as they usually find it challenging to understand and memorize these algorithms. There is a need to find a means of technology enhanced learning to improve the learning process of students. Game based learning is a pedagogy where students learn through game playing. This mode of learning could effectively engage students to focus on the learning topics more efficiently. The study uses a sorting algorithm serious game to allow students to learn four types of sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort and Quick sort. The students would carry out self-directed learning lecture materials in the serious game, followed by refreshing their learning using a visualizer, and lastly reinforce their learning through playing a sorting serious game. Two groups of students participate in the experiment, a control group and an experiment group. The experiment group that sues the sorting algorithm games achieves better results, compared to the control group who learns without the serious game. Game-based learning provides a positive learning experience to the students that could improve the learning effectiveness. Coupled with technology such as VR headsets as a future upgrade, it would be a niche factor that would create an immersive learning experience to engage the students and enhance their learning in a virtual environment."}}

A scalable federated learning framework should address the heterogeneity that clients have different computing capacities and communication capabilities. To this end, this paper proposes FedHM, a novel heterogeneous federated model compression framework, distributing the heterogeneous low-rank models to clients and then aggregating them into a full-rank model. Our solution enables the training of heterogeneous models with varying computational complexities and aggregates them into a single global model. Furthermore, FedHM significantly reduces the communication cost by using low-rank models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedHM is superior in the performance and robustness of models of different sizes, compared with state-of-the-art heterogeneous FL methods under various FL settings. Additionally, the convergence guarantee of FL for heterogeneous devices is first theoretically analyzed."}}

Context-awareness is a popular method for automatic awareness of the mobile environment and choosing the most suitable cloud provider. Lack of context information may harm the users' confidence in the application rendering it useless. Thus, mobile devices need to be constantly aware of the environment and to test the performance of each cloud provider, which is inefficient and wastes energy. Crowdsourcing is a considerable technology to discover and select cloud services in order to provide intelligent, efficient, and stable discovering of services for mobile users based on group choice. This article introduces a crowdsourcing-based QoS supported mobile cloud service framework that fulfills mobile users' satisfaction by sensing their context information and providing appropriate services to each of the users. Based on user's activity context, social context, service context, and device context, our framework dynamically adapts cloud service for the requests in different kinds of scenarios. The context-awareness based management approach efficiency achieves a reliable cloud service supported platform to supply the Quality of Service on mobile device."}}
