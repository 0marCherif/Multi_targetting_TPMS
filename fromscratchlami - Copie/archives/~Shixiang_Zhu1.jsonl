However, rarely can we quantify how well the generative model captures the nature or ground-truth since it is usually unknown. The challenge typically lies in the fact that the generative models typically provide, at most, good approximations to the ground- truth (e.g., through the rich representative power of neural networks), but they cannot be precisely the ground-truth. We thus can- not use the classic goodness-of-fit (GOF) test framework to evaluate their performance. In this paper, we develop a GOF test for genera- tive models of self-exciting processes by mak- ing a new connection to this problem with the classical statistical theory of Quasi-maximum- likelihood estimator (QMLE). We present a non-parametric self-normalizing statistic for the GOF test: the Generalized Score (GS) statistics, and explicitly capture the model misspecification when establishing the asymp- totic distribution of the GS statistic. Nu- merical simulation and real-data experiments validate our theory and demonstrate the pro- posed GS test\u2019s good performance."}}

A major thrust of research has been focused on developing k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) based algorithms combined with metric learning that captures similarities between samples. When the samples are limited, robustness is especially crucial to ensure the generalization capability of the classifier. In this paper, we study a minimax distributionally robust formulation of weighted k-nearest neighbors, which aims to find the optimal weighted k-NN classifiers that hedge against feature uncertainties. We develop an algorithm, Dr.k-NN, that efficiently solves this functional optimization problem and features in assigning minimax optimal weights to training samples when performing classification. These weights are class-dependent, and are determined by the similarities of sample features under the least favorable scenarios. When the size of the uncertainty set is properly tuned, the robust classifier has a smaller Lipschitz norm than the vanilla k-NN, and thus improves the generalization capability. We also couple our framework with neural-network-based feature embedding. We demonstrate the competitive performance of our algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art in the few-training-sample setting with various real-data experiments."}}

Taking advantage of these advances in data collection rates requires the development and application of data processing tools, including image analysis, feature extraction, and streaming data processing techniques.

Despite the rapid development of one-dimensional temporal point processes for discrete event data, the study of spatial-temporal aspects of such data is relatively scarce. Our model captures complex spatio-temporal dependence between discrete events by carefully design a mixture of heterogeneous Gaussian diffusion kernels, whose parameters are parameterized by neural networks. This new kernel is the key that our model can capture intricate spatial dependence patterns and yet still lead to interpretable results as we examine maps of Gaussian diffusion kernel parameters. The imitation learning model fitting for the NEST is more robust than the maximum likelihood estimate. It directly measures the divergence between the empirical distributions between the training data and the model-generated data. Moreover, our imitation learning-based approach enjoys computational efficiency due to the explicit characterization of the reward function related to the likelihood function; furthermore, the likelihood function under our model enjoys tractable expression due to Gaussian kernel parameterization. Experiments based on real data show our method\u2019s good performance relative to the state-of-the-art and the good interpretability of NEST\u2019s result."}}

These data include power outages, police 911 calls, healthcare records, credit card transactions, social media posts, etc. Understanding the intricate spatio-temporal dynamics behind these data requires the next generation of mathematical and statistical algorithms based on quantitative models of human and physical dynamics. This thesis presents the recent developments in this area with methodological advances and various real-world applications. We develop new theoretical and algorithmic techniques for capturing the dynamics of real-world spatio-temporal data by combining cutting-edge machine learning and classical statistical models. We also formulate the sequential decision-making processes as different optimization problems in a data driven manner, suggesting better decisions by taking advantage of the historical knowledge. Last but not least, we investigate a wide array of real-world spatio-temporal datasets using our proposed methods. The results demonstrate the value of spatio-temporal analytics in understanding computational, physical, and social systems."}}
