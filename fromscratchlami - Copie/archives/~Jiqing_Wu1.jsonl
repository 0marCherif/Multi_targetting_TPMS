However, a thorough and comprehensive analysis of phenotypic heterogeneity is challenged by the complex nature of cell-level data. Here, we propose a novel Latent Eigenvalue Analysis (LEA) framework and apply it to high-throughput phenotypic profiling with single-cell and single-organelle granularity. Using the publicly available SARS-CoV-2 datasets stained with the multiplexed fluorescent cell-painting protocol, we demonstrate the power of the LEA approach in the investigation of phenotypic changes induced by more than 1800 drug compounds. As a result, LEA achieves a robust quantification of phenotypic changes introduced by drug treatment. Moreover, this quantification can be biologically supported by simulating clearly observable phenotypic transitions in a broad spectrum of use cases. In conclusion, LEA represents a new and broadly applicable approach for quantitative and interpretable analysis in routine drug screening practice."}}

However, the investigation of prognostic variables of patient outcome in a hypothesized cause-effect route is not feasible using standard statistical methods. Here, we propose a new automated causal inference method (AutoCI) built upon the invariant causal prediction (ICP) framework for the causal re-interpretation of clinical trial data. Compared to existing methods, we show that the proposed AutoCI allows to efficiently determine the causal variables with a clear differentiation on two real-world RCTs of endometrial cancer patients with mature outcome and extensive clinicopathological and molecular data. This is achieved via suppressing the causal probability of non-causal variables by a wide margin. In ablation studies, we further demonstrate that the assignment of causal probabilities by AutoCI remain consistent in the presence of confounders. In conclusion, these results confirm the robustness and feasibility of AutoCI for future applications in real-world clinical analysis."}}

Given visual data and the outcome of interest, the goal is to infer the cause-effect relation. Aside from rich visual ('visible') variables, oftentimes, the outcome is also determined by 'invisible' variables, i.e. the variables from non-visual modalities that do not have visual counterparts. This $(\\textbf{visible}, \\textbf{invisible})$ combination is particularly common in the clinical domain.\n\nBuilt upon the promising invariant causal prediction (ICP) framework, we propose a novel $\\varepsilon$-ICP algorithm to resolve the (visible, invisible) setting. To efficiently discover $\\varepsilon$-plausible causal variables and to estimate the cause-effect relation, the $\\varepsilon$-ICP is learned under a min-min optimisation scheme. Driven by the need for clinical reliability and interpretability, the $\\varepsilon$-ICP is implemented with a typed neural-symbolic functional language. With the built-in program synthesis method, we can synthesize a type-safe program that is comprehensible to the clinical experts.\n\nFor concept validation of the $\\varepsilon$-ICP, we carefully design a series of synthetic experiments on the type of visual-perception tasks that are encountered in daily life. To further substantiate the proposed method, we demonstrate the application of $\\varepsilon$-ICP on a real-world cancer study dataset, Swiss CRC. This population-based cancer study has spanned over two decades, including 25$k$ fully annotated tissue micro-array (TMA) images with at least $3k \\times 3k$ resolution and a broad spectrum of clinical meta data for 533 patients. Both the synthetic and clinical experiments demonstrate the advantages of $\\varepsilon$-ICP over the state-of-the-art methods.

The key idea is to decompose the photo enhancement process into hierarchically multiple sub-problems, which can be better conquered from bottom to up. On the top level, we propose a perception-based division to learn additive and multiplicative components, required to translate a low-quality image into its high-quality counterpart. On the intermediate level, we use a frequency-based division with generative adversarial network (GAN) to weakly supervise the photo enhancement process. On the lower level, we design dimension-based division that enables the GAN model to better approximates the distribution distance on multiple independent one-dimensional data to train the GAN model. While considering all three hierarchies, we develop a multiscale training approach to optimize the image enhancement process, suitable for high-resolution images, in a weakly-supervised manner. Both quantitative and qualitative results clearly demonstrate that the proposed DACAL achieves the state-of-the-art performance for high-resolution image enhancement."}}

Unfortunately, it is challenging to approximate the WD of high-dimensional distributions. In contrast, the sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) factorizes high-dimensional distributions into their multiple one-dimensional marginal distributions and is thus easier to approximate. In this paper, we introduce novel approximations of the primal and dual SWD. Instead of using a large number of random projections, as it is done by conventional SWD approximation methods, we propose to approximate SWDs with a small number of parameterized orthogonal projections in an end-to-end deep learning fashion. As concrete applications of our SWD approximations, we design two types of differentiable SWD blocks to equip modern generative frameworks---Auto-Encoders (AE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In the experiments, we not only show the superiority of the proposed generative models on standard image synthesis benchmarks, but also demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance on challenging high resolution image and video generation in an unsupervised manner."}}
