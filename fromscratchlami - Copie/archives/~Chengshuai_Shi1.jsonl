However, in some practical applications, the available data are often coming from several related but heterogeneous environments. A theoretical understanding of efficient learning from heterogeneous offline datasets remains lacking. In this work, we study the problem of learning a (hidden) underlying Markov decision process (MDP) based on heterogeneous offline datasets collected from multiple randomly perturbed data sources. A novel HetPEVI algorithm is proposed, which jointly considers two types of uncertainties: sample uncertainties from the finite number of data samples per data source, and source uncertainties due to a finite number of data sources. Building on HetPEVI, we further incorporate reference-advantage decompositions and Bernstein-type penalties to propose the HetPEVI-Adv algorithm. Theoretical analysis not only proves the effectiveness of both HetPEVI and HetPEVI-Adv but also demonstrates the advantage of the latter. More importantly, the results explicitly characterize the learning loss due to the finite heterogeneously realized environments compared with sampling directly from the underlying MDP. Finally, we extend the study to MDPs with linear function approximation and propose the HetPEVI-Lin algorithm that provides additional efficiency guarantees beyond the tabular case."}}

However, almost all existing studies are confined to temporary myopic agents. In this work, we break this barrier and study incentivized exploration with multiple and long-term strategic agents, who have more complicated behaviors that often appear in real-world applications. An important observation of this work is that strategic agents' intrinsic needs of learning benefit (instead of harming) the principal's explorations by providing \"free pulls\". Moreover, it turns out that increasing the population of agents significantly lowers the principal's burden of incentivizing. The key and somewhat surprising insight revealed from our results is that when there are sufficiently many learning agents involved, the exploration process of the principal can be (almost) free. Our main results are built upon three novel components which may be of independent interest: (1) a simple yet provably effective incentive-provision strategy; (2) a carefully crafted best arm identification algorithm for rewards aggregated under unequal confidences; (3) a high-probability finite-time lower bound of UCB algorithms. Experimental results are provided to complement the theoretical analysis."}}

In this paper, we propose BEACON -- Batched Exploration with Adaptive COmmunicatioN -- that closes this gap. BEACON accomplishes this goal with novel contributions in implicit communication and efficient exploration. For the former, we propose a novel adaptive differential communication (ADC) design that significantly improves the implicit communication efficiency. For the latter, a carefully crafted batched exploration scheme is developed to enable incorporation of the combinatorial upper confidence bound (CUCB) principle. We then generalize the existing linear-reward MP-MAB problems, where the system reward is always the sum of individually collected rewards, to a new MP-MAB problem where the system reward is a general (nonlinear) function of individual rewards. We extend BEACON to solve this problem and prove a logarithmic regret. BEACON bridges the algorithm design and regret analysis of combinatorial MAB (CMAB) and MP-MAB, two largely disjointed areas in MAB, and the results in this paper suggest that this previously ignored connection is worth further investigation."}}
