Recent deep learning-based MVS methods typically densely sample depth hypotheses in the depth range, and then construct prohibitively memory-consuming 3D cost volumes for depth prediction. Although coarse-to-fine sampling strategies alleviate this overhead issue to a certain extent, the efficiency of MVS is still an open challenge. In this work, we propose a novel method for highly efficient MVS that remarkably decreases the memory footprint, meanwhile clearly advancing state-of-the-art depth prediction performance. We investigate what a search strategy can be reasonably optimal for MVS taking into account of both efficiency and effectiveness. We first formulate MVS as a binary search problem, and accordingly propose a generalized binary search network for MVS. Specifically, in each step, the depth range is split into 2 bins with extra 1 error tolerance bin on both sides. A classification is performed to identify which bin contains the true depth. We also design three mechanisms to respectively handle classification errors, deal with out-of-range samples and decrease the training memory. The new formulation makes our method only sample a very small number of depth hypotheses in each step, which is highly memory efficient, and also greatly facilitates quick training convergence. Experiments on competitive benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with much less memory. Particularly, our method obtains an overall score of 0.289 on DTU dataset and tops the first place on challenging Tanks and Temples advanced dataset among all the learning-based methods."}}

Recent state-of-the-art models consider directly decoding task-specific features from one shared task-generic feature (e.g., feature from a backbone layer), and utilize carefully designed decoders to produce multi-task features. However, as the input feature is fully shared and each task decoder also shares decoding parameters for different input samples, it leads to a static feature decoding process, producing less discriminative task-specific representations. To tackle this limitation, we propose TaskExpert, a novel multi-task mixtureof-experts model that enables learning multiple representative task-generic feature spaces and decoding task-specific features in a dynamic manner. Specifically, TaskExpert introduces a set of expert networks to decompose the backbone feature into several representative task-generic features. Then, the task-specific features are decoded by using dynamic task-specific gating networks operating on the decomposed task-generic features. Furthermore, to establish long-range modeling of the task-specific representations from different layers of TaskExpert, we design a multitask feature memory that updates at each layer and acts as an additional feature expert for dynamic task-specific feature decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TaskExpert clearly outperforms previous best-performing methods on all 9 metrics of two competitive multi-task learning benchmarks for visual scene understanding (i.e., PASCAL-Context and NYUD-v2)."}}

Most existing works encounter a severe limitation of modeling in the locality due to heavy utilization of convolution operations, while learning interactions and inference in a global spatial-position and multi-task context is critical for this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Inverted Pyramid multi-task Transformer (InvPT) to perform simultaneous modeling of spatial positions and multiple tasks in a unified framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores designing a transformer structure for multi-task dense prediction for scene understanding. Besides, it is widely demonstrated that a higher spatial resolution is remarkably beneficial for dense predictions, while it is very challenging for existing transformers to go deeper with higher resolutions due to huge complexity to large spatial size. InvPT presents an efficient UP-Transformer block to learn multi-task feature interaction at gradually increased resolutions, which also incorporates effective self-attention message passing and multi-scale feature aggregation to produce taskspecific prediction at a high resolution. Our method achieves superior multi-task performance on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets respectively, and significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art."}}

Although considerable improvement has been achieved, the quality of synthesized images is far from satisfactory due to three largely unresolved challenges. 1) The semantic labels do not provide detailed structural information, making it difficult to synthesize local details and structures. 2) The widely adopted CNN operations such as convolution, down-sampling, and normalization usually cause spatial resolution loss and thus cannot fully preserve the original semantic information, leading to semantically inconsistent results (e.g., missing small objects). 3) Existing semantic image synthesis methods focus on modeling ``local'' semantic information from a single input semantic layout. However, they ignore ``global'' semantic information of multiple input semantic layouts, i.e., semantic cross-relations between pixels across different input layouts. To tackle 1), we propose to use edge as an intermediate representation which is further adopted to guide image generation via a proposed attention guided edge transfer module. Edge information is produced by a convolutional generator and introduces detailed structure information. To tackle 2), we design an effective module to selectively highlight class-dependent feature maps according to the original semantic layout to preserve the semantic information. To tackle 3), inspired by current methods in contrastive learning, we propose a novel contrastive learning method, which aims to enforce pixel embeddings belonging to the same semantic class to generate more similar image content than those from different classes. Doing so can capture more semantic relations by explicitly exploring the structures of labeled pixels from multiple input semantic layouts. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our ECGAN achieves significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods."}}

To model a large-scale scene efficiently, a dominant strategy is to employ a divide-and-conquer paradigm via performing scene decomposition, which decomposes a complex scene into parts that are further processed by different sub-networks. Existing large-scale NeRFs mainly use heuristic hand-crafted scene decomposition, with regular 3D-distance-based or physical-street-block-based schemes. Although achieving promising results, the hand-crafted schemes limit the capabilities of NeRF in large-scale scene modeling in several aspects. Manually designing a universal scene decomposition rule for different complex scenes is challenging, leading to adaptation issues for different scenarios. The decomposition procedure is not learnable, hindering the network from jointly optimizing the scene decomposition and the radiance fields in an end-to-end manner.  The different sub-networks are typically optimized independently, and thus hand-crafted rules are required to composite them to achieve a better consistency.  To tackle these issues, we propose Switch-NeRF, a novel end-to-end large-scale NeRF with learning-based scene decomposition. We design a gating network to dispatch 3D points to different NeRF sub-networks. The gating network can be optimized together with the NeRF sub-networks for different scene partitions, by a design with the Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts (MoE). The outputs from different sub-networks can also be fused in a learnable way in the unified framework to effectively guarantee the consistency of the whole scene. Furthermore, the proposed MoE-based Switch-NeRF model is carefully implemented and optimized to achieve both high-fidelity scene reconstruction and efficient computation. Our method establishes clear state-of-the-art performances on several large-scale datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an applicable end-to-end sparse NeRF network  with learning-based decomposition for large-scale scenes.

Highly dynamic and complex motions in the driving video cause ambiguous generation from the source image, because the still source image cannot provide sufficient appearance information for occluded regions or delicate expressions, which severely produces artifacts and significantly degrades the generation quality. However, existing works mainly focus on learning more accurate motion estimation and representation in 2D and 3D, and they ignore the facial structural prior in addressing the facial ambiguities. Therefore, effective handling of the ambiguities in the dramatic appearance changes of the source to largely improve facial details and completeness in generation still remains barely explored. To this end, we propose a novel implicit scale conditioned memory compensation network (MCNet) for high-fidelity talking head generation. Specifically, considering human faces are symmetric and structured, we aim to automatically learn a representative global facial memory bank from all training data as a prior to compensate for the facial generation features. Each face in the source image contains a scale that can be reflected in detected facial keypoints. To better query the learned global memory, we further propose to learn implicit scale representations from the discrete keypoints, which can be used to condition on the query of the global memory, to obtain scale-aware memory for the feature compensation. Extensive experiments from quantitative and qualitative perspectives demonstrate that MCNet can learn representative and complementary facial memory, and can clearly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on VoxCeleb1 and CelebV datasets.

This requires joint modeling (i) task-generic and (ii) task-specific representations, and (iii) cross-task representation interactions. Existing works typically model these three perspectives with separately designed structures, using shared network modules for task-generic learning, different modules for task-specific learning, and establishing connections among these components for cross-task interactions. It is barely explored in the literature to model these three perspectives in each network layer in an end-to-end manner, which can not only minimize the effort of carefully designing empirical structures for the three multi-task representation learning objectives, but also greatly improve the representation learning capability of the multi-task network since all the model capacity will be used to optimize the three objectives together. In this paper, we propose TaskPrompter, a novel spatial-channel multi-task prompting transformer framework to achieve this target. Specifically, we design a set of spatial-channel task prompts and learn their spatial- and channel interactions with the shared image tokens in each transformer layer with attention mechanism, as aggregating spatial and channel information is critical for dense prediction tasks. Each task prompt learns task-specific representation for one task, while all the prompts can jointly contribute to the learning of the shared image token representations, and the interactions between different task prompts model the cross-task relationship. To decode dense predictions for multiple tasks with the learned spatial-channel task prompts from transformer, we accordingly design a dense task prompt decoding mechanism, which queries the shared image tokens using task prompts to obtain spatial- and channel-wise task-specific representations. Extensive experiments on two challenging multi-task dense scene understanding benchmarks (i.e. NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context) show the superiority of the proposed framework and TaskPrompter establishes significant state-of-the-art performances on multi-task dense predictions.

The recent work GLIP formulates this problem as a grounding problem by concatenating all category names of detection datasets into sentences, which leads to inefficient interaction between category names. This paper presents DetCLIP, a paralleled visual-concept pre-training method for open-world detection by resorting to knowledge enrichment from a designed concept dictionary. To achieve better learning efficiency, we propose a novel paralleled concept formulation that extracts concepts separately to better utilize heterogeneous datasets (i.e., detection, grounding, and image-text pairs) for training. We further design a concept dictionary (with descriptions) from various online sources and detection datasets to provide prior knowledge for each concept. By enriching the concepts with their descriptions,\nwe explicitly build the relationships among various concepts to facilitate the open-domain learning. The proposed concept dictionary is further used to provide sufficient negative concepts for the construction of the word-region alignment loss, and to complete labels for objects with missing descriptions in captions of image-text pair data. The proposed framework demonstrates strong zero-shot detection performances, e.g., on the LVIS dataset, our DetCLIP-T outperforms GLIP-T by 9.9% mAP and obtains a 13.5% improvement on rare categories compared to the fully-supervised model with the same backbone as ours."}}

Inspired by the fact that the attended regions of the one-class token in the standard vision transformer can be leveraged to form a class-agnostic localization map, we investigate if the transformer model can also effectively capture class-specific attention for more discriminative object localization by learning multiple class tokens within the transformer. To this end, we propose a Multi-class Token Transformer, termed as MCTformer, which uses multiple class tokens to learn interactions between the class tokens and the patch tokens. The proposed MCTformer can successfully produce class-discriminative object localization maps from class-to-patch attentions corresponding to different class tokens. We also propose to use a patch-level pairwise affinity, which is extracted from the patch-to-patch transformer attention, to further refine the localization maps. Moreover, the proposed framework is shown to fully complement the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) method, leading to remarkably superior WSSS results on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. These results underline the importance of the class token for WSSS."}}

However, deep architectures trained with gradient-based techniques suffer from catastrophic forgetting, which is the tendency to forget previously learned knowledge while learning new tasks. Aiming at devising strategies to counteract this effect, incremental learning approaches have gained popularity over the past years. However, the first incremental learning methods for semantic segmentation appeared only recently. While effective, these approaches do not account for a crucial aspect in pixel-level dense prediction problems, i.e. the role of attention mechanisms. To fill this gap, in this paper we introduce a novel attentive feature distillation approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while accounting for semantic spatial- and channel-level dependencies. Furthermore, we propose a {continual attentive fusion} structure, which takes advantage of the attention learned from the new and the old tasks while learning features for the new task. Finally, we also introduce a novel strategy to account for the background class in the distillation loss, thus preventing biased predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an extensive evaluation on Pascal-VOC 2012 and ADE20K, setting a new state of the art."}}
