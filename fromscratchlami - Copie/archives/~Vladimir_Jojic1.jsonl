In this article, we introduce a method for recovering signatures of microenvironments from such data. We use topic models to identify characteristic cell types overrepresented in neighborhoods that serve as proxies for microenvironment. Furthermore, by assuming spatial coherence among neighboring microenvironments our model limits the number of parameters that need to be learned and permits data-driven decisions about the size of cellular neighborhoods. We apply this method to uncover anatomically known structures in mouse spleen\u2014identifying distinct population of spleen B cells that are defined by their characteristic neighborhoods. Next, we apply the method to a dataset of triple-negative breast cancer tumors from 41 patients to study the structure of tumor-immune boundary. We uncover previously reported tumor-immune microenvironment near the tumor-immune boundary enriched for immune cells with high Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and a novel, immunosuppressed, microenvironment-enriched for cells expressing CD45 and FoxP3."}}

In our framework, samples are generated by sampling components from component generators and feeding these components to a composition function which combines them into a \"composed sample\". This compositional training approach improves the modularity, extensibility and interpretability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - providing a principled way to incrementally construct complex models out of simpler component models, and allowing for explicit \"division of responsibility\" between these components. Using this framework, we define a family of learning tasks and evaluate their feasibility on two datasets in two different data modalities (image and text). Lastly, we derive sufficient conditions such that these compositional generative models are identifiable.

Compared to original GAN model, this model has multiple generators and gives control over what its generators should generate. Unlike previous multi-generator models use a subsequent generation process, that one layer is generated given the previous layer, our model uses a process of generating different part of the images together. This way the model contains fewer parameters and the generation speed is faster. Speci\ufb01cally, the model leverages the label information to separate the object from the image correctly. Since the model conditional on the label information does not restrict to generate other parts of an image, we proposed a cost function that encourages the model to generate only the succinct part of an image in terms of label discrimination. We also found an exclusive prior on the mask of the model help separate the object. The experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CelebA datasets show 3C-GAN can generate different objects with different generators simultaneously, according to the labels given to each generator."}}

We show that the degrees of freedom in these models is related to the expected optimism, which is the expected difference between test error and training error. We provide an efficient Monte-Carlo method to estimate the degrees of freedom for multi-class classification methods. We show degrees of freedom are lower than the parameter count in a simple XOR network. We extend these results to neural nets trained on synthetic and real data, and investigate impact of network's architecture and different regularization choices. The degrees of freedom in deep networks are dramatically smaller than the number of parameters, in some real datasets several orders of magnitude. Further, we observe that for fixed number of parameters, deeper networks have less degrees of freedom exhibiting a regularization-by-depth."}}

We describe an improved, in-vivo method that estimates the individualized, relative tissue elasticity parameters directly from medical images. Although elasticity reconstruction, or elastograph, can be used to estimate tissue elasticity, it is less suited for in-vivo measurements or deeply-seated organs like prostate. We develop a non-invasive method to estimate tissue elasticity values based on pairs of medical images, using a finite-element based biomechanical model derived from an initial set of images, local displacements, and an optimization-based framework. We demonstrate the feasibility of a statistically-based multi-class learning method that classifies a clinical T-stage and Gleason score using the patient\u2019s age and relative prostate elasticity values reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) images."}}

Rather than estimating deformations by standard image registration methods, we investigate how to obtain a basis of the space of deformations. In particular, we explore how image appearance differences with respect to a common atlas image can be used to predict deformations represented by such a basis. We use a coupled dictionary learning method to jointly learn a basis for image appearance differences and their related deformations. Our proposed method is based on local image patches. We evaluate our method on synthetically generated datasets as well as on a structural magnetic resonance brain imaging (MRI) dataset. Our method results in an improved prediction accuracy while reducing the search space compared to nearest neighbor search and demonstrates that learning a deformation basis is feasible."}}
