In the future, LDP can be adopted to anonymize richer user data attributes that will be input to more sophisticated machine learning (ML) tasks. However, today's LDP approaches are largely task-agnostic and often lead to sub-optimal performance - they will simply inject noise to all data attributes according to a given privacy budget, regardless of what features are most relevant for an ultimate task. In this paper, we address how to significantly improve the ultimate task performance for multi-dimensional user data by considering a task-aware privacy preservation problem. The key idea is to use an encoder-decoder framework to learn (and anonymize) a task-relevant latent representation of user data, which gives an analytical near-optimal solution for a linear setting with mean-squared error (MSE) task loss. We also provide an approximate solution through a learning algorithm for general nonlinear cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our task-aware approach significantly improves ultimate task accuracy compared to a standard benchmark LDP approach while guaranteeing the same level of privacy."}}

Typically, forecasts are designed without knowledge of a downstream controller's task objective, and thus simply optimize for mean prediction error. However, such task-agnostic representations are often too large to stream over a communication network and do not emphasize salient temporal features for cooperative control. This paper presents a solution to learn succinct, highly-compressed forecasts that are co-designed with a modular controller's task objective. Our simulations with real cellular, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and electricity load data show we can improve a model predictive controller's performance by at least 25% while transmitting 80% less data than the competing method. Further, we present theoretical compression results for a networked variant of the classical linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control problem."}}
