We show that the necessary and sufficient conditions can lead to tighter sufficient conditions for the uniqueness in several special cases. Our results are based on the existing notion of maximal girth and our new notion of maximal eye. Moreover, we develop a series\u2013parallel reduction method and search-based algorithms for computing the maximal eye and the maximal girth, which are necessary for the uniqueness analysis. Reduction to a single line using the proposed reduction method is guaranteed for 2-vertex-connected series\u2013parallel graphs. The relations between the parameters of the network before and after reduction are obtained. It is verified on real-world networks that the computation of the maximal eye can be reduced to the analysis of a much smaller power network, while the maximal girth is computed during the reduction process."}}

This problem spans multiple domains including quantum mechanics and chemistry sciences and we investigate the geometric properties of this optimization problem. Fourth-order optimality conditions are derived for characterizing local and global minima. When the matrix in the quadratic term is diagonal, the problem has no spurious local minima and global solutions can be represented explicitly and calculated in $$O(n\\log {n})$$ O ( n log n ) operations. When A is a rank one matrix, the global minima of the problem are unique under certain phase shift schemes. The strict-saddle property, which can imply polynomial time convergence of second-order-type algorithms, is established when the coefficient $$\\beta $$ \u03b2 of the quartic term is either at least $$O(n^{3/2})$$ O ( n 3 / 2 ) or not larger than O(1). Finally, the Kurdyka\u2013\u0141ojasiewicz exponent of quartic\u2013quadratic problem is estimated and it is shown that the largest exponent is at least 1/4 for a broad class of stationary points."}}

First, we develop a new technique to verify the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality in a neighborhood of the global minimizers, which leads to a local linear convergence region for the gradient descent method. Second, based on the local convergence result and a sharp strict saddle property proven in this paper, we present two new conditions that guarantee the global linear convergence of the perturbed gradient descent method. The developed local and global convergence results provide much stronger theoretical guarantees than the existing results. As a by-product, this work significantly improves the existing bounds on the RIP constant required to guarantee the non-existence of spurious solutions."}}

We develop the notion of biased perturbation and show that it gives a quantitative view of the notion of small regions of attraction that can be escaped. As a counterpart, we explain why the dynamics is stable in a wide region of attraction around a strongly stable equilibrium. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the usefulness of the developed concepts."}}
