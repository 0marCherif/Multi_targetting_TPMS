The most widely adopted approach for concept-based, gradient interpretation is Concept Activation Vector (CAV). CAV relies on learning a linear relation between some latent representation of a given model and concepts. The premise of meaningful concepts lying in a linear subspace of model layers is usually implicitly assumed but does not hold true in general. In this work we proposed Concept Gradient (CG), which extends concept-based, gradient interpretation methods to non-linear concept functions. We showed that for a general (potentially non-linear) concept, we can mathematically measure how a small change of concept affects the model\u2019s prediction, which is an extension of gradient-based interpretation to the concept space. We demonstrated empirically that CG outperforms CAV in attributing concept importance on real world datasets and performed case study on a medical dataset. The code is available at github.com/jybai/concept-gradients."}}

We showed that for a general (potentially non-linear) concept, we can mathematically evaluate how a small change of concept affecting the model's prediction, which leads to an extension of gradient-based interpretation to the concept space.

It is observed that many state-of-the-art GANs generate samples that are more similar to the training set than a holdout testing set from the same distribution, hinting some training samples are implicitly memorized in these models. This memorization behavior is unfavorable in many applications that demand the generated samples to be sufficiently distinct from known samples. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether it is possible to reduce memorization without compromising the generation quality. In this paper, we propose memorization rejection, a training scheme that rejects generated samples that are near-duplicates of training samples during training. Our scheme is simple, generic and can be directly applied to any GAN architecture. Experiments on multiple datasets and GAN models validate that memorization rejection effectively reduces training sample memorization, and in many cases does not sacrifice the generation quality. Code to reproduce the experiment results can be found at $\\texttt{https://github.com/jybai/MRGAN}$."}}
