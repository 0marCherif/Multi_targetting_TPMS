Indeed, existing KGs suffer from the data imbalance issue, i.e., entities and relations conform to a long-tail distribution, only a small portion of entities and relations occur frequently, while the vast majority of entities and relations only have a few training samples. Existing KGE methods assign equal weights to each entity and relation during the training process. Under this setting, long-tail entities and relations are not fully trained during training, leading to unreliable representations. In this paper, we propose WeightE, which attends differentially to different entities and relations. Specifically, WeightE is able to endow lower weights to frequent entities and relations, and higher weights to infrequent ones. In such manner, WeightE is capable of increasing the weights of long-tail entities and relations, and learning better representations for them. In particular, WeightE tailors bilevel optimization for the KGE task, where the inner level aims to learn reliable entity and relation embeddings, and the outer level attempts to assign appropriate weights for each entity and relation. Moreover, it is worth noting that our technique of applying weights to different entities and relations is general and flexible, which can be applied to a number of existing KGE models. Finally, we extensively validate the superiority of WeightE against various state-of-the-art baselines."}}

Many claims require the simultaneous integration and reasoning of several pieces of evidence for verification. Existing models exhibit limitations in two aspects: 1) during the sentence selection stage, they only consider the interaction between the claim and the evidence, disregarding the intersentence information, and 2) most fusion strategies employed in current research, such as addition, concatenation, or simple neural networks, fail to capture the relationships and logical information among the evidence. To alleviate these problems, we propose select and fact verification modeling (SFVM). Our model utilizes a multihead self-attention mechanism combined with a gating mechanism to facilitate sentence interaction and enhance sentence embeddings. Then, we utilize factorization machines to effectively express the compressed alignment vectors, which are then used to expand the representations of the base evidence. To distinguish the importance of features, we use the evidence fusion network to determine the importance of various feature interactions. Results from experiments on the two public datasets showed that SFVM can utilize richer information between the claim and the evidence for fact verification and achieve competitive performance on the FEVER dataset."}}

Moreover, to sufficiently model node multi-relational information in BMHG, we adopt a newly proposed hierarchical mechanism. By doing so, the proposed dual hierarchical attention operations enable our model to fully capture the complex structures of the bi-typed multi-relational heterogeneous graphs. Experimental results on various tasks against the state-of-the-arts sufficiently confirm the capability of DHAN in learning node representations on the BMHGs."}}

Although existing online KD methods achieve desirable performance, they often focus on class probabilities as the core knowledge type, ignoring the valuable feature representational information. We present a Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) framework for online KD. The core idea of MCL is to perform mutual interaction and transfer of contrastive distributions among a cohort of networks in an online manner. Our MCL can aggregate cross-network embedding information and maximize the lower bound to the mutual information between two networks. This enables each network to learn extra contrastive knowledge from others, leading to better feature representations, thus improving the performance of visual recognition tasks. Beyond the final layer, we extend MCL to intermediate layers and perform an adaptive layer-matching mechanism trained by meta-optimization. Experiments on image classification and transfer learning to visual recognition tasks show that layer-wise MCL can lead to consistent performance gains against state-of-the-art online KD approaches. The superiority demonstrates that layer-wise MCL can guide the network to generate better feature representations.

Great efforts have been made for automatic fake news detection on a <i>single</i> domain (e.g., politics).

Based on our analysis, we pose two challenges in multi-domain fake news detection: 1) <i>domain shift</i> , caused by the discrepancy among domains in terms of words, emotions, styles, etc. 2) <i>domain labeling incompleteness</i> , stemming from the real-world categorization that only outputs one single domain label, regardless of topic diversity of a news piece.

However, the prediction performance heavily relies on effective representations from multi-dimensional time-series EHR data. Existing solutions usually focus on temporal features or inherent relations between clinical event variables or extract both information in two separate phases. This usually leads to insufficient patient feature information and results in poor prediction performance. Moreover, existing methods based on Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network usually require manual selection of proper Meta-Paths. To solve these problems, we propose the Time-aware Context-Gated Graph Attention Network (T-ContextGGAN). Specifically, we design a GNN based module with Time-aware Meta-Paths and self-attention mechanism to extract both temporal semantic information and inherent relations of EHR data simultaneously and perform automatic Meta-Path selection. To evaluate the proposed model, we extract the first 48 hour EHR data in the first Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission of three different tasks from two open-source datasets and model various clinical variables on the proposed EHRGraph.
