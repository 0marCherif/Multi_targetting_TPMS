However, offline RL requires the dataset to be reward-annotated, which presents practical challenges when reward engineering is difficult or when obtaining reward annotations is labor-intensive. In this paper, we introduce Optimal Transport Reward labeling (OTR), an algorithm that assigns rewards to offline trajectories, with a few high-quality demonstrations. OTR's key idea is to use optimal transport to compute an optimal alignment between an unlabeled trajectory in the dataset and an expert demonstration to obtain a similarity measure that can be interpreted as a reward, which can then be used by an offline RL algorithm to learn the policy. OTR is easy to implement and computationally efficient. On D4RL benchmarks, we show that OTR with a single demonstration can consistently match the performance of offline RL with ground-truth rewards."}}

These methods compute a target value based on observed data and predictions for future values. The approximation error of the target value, which comes from stochastic dynamics and inaccurate predictions, can significantly affect the data efficiency of RL algorithms. Multi-step methods, such as n-step Q learning and TD(lambda), leverage the chain structure of the data, alleviating the effect of inaccurate predictions and allowing credit assignment across a longer time horizon. However, the main limitation of such multi-step methods is that they fail to exploit the graph structure of certain MDPs by only treating each trajectory independently, resulting in an inadequate estimate of the target value that misses the intersections between multiple trajectories. In this paper, we propose to treat the transition data of an MDP as a graph, and define a novel backup operator exploiting this graph structure. Comparing to multi-step backup, our graph backup method allows counterfactual credit assignment, and can reduce the variance that comes from stochastic environment dynamics. Our empirical evaluation on MiniGrid and Minatar shows graph backup can greatly improve data efficiency compared to one-step and multi-step backup."}}

While relational inductive biases that fit a task can improve generalization of RL agents, these biases are commonly hard-coded directly in the agent's neural architecture. In this work, we show that we can incorporate relational inductive biases, encoded in the form of relational graphs, into agents. Based on this insight, we propose Grid-to-Graph (GTG), a mapping from grid structures to relational graphs that carry useful spatial relational inductive biases when processed through a Relational Graph Convolution Network (R-GCN). We show that, with GTG, R-GCNs generalize better both in terms of in-distribution and out-of-distribution compared to baselines based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Neural Logic Machines on challenging procedurally generated environments and MinAtar. Furthermore, we show that GTG produces agents that can jointly reason over observations and environment dynamics encoded in knowledge bases."}}
