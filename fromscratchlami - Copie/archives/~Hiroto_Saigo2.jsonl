It is involved in several biological processes including immune response, protein stability, transcription regulation, post translational regulation, DNA damage repair, redox regulation, and is an emerging paradigm of redox signaling for protection against oxidative stress. The development of robust computational tools to predict protein SNO sites would contribute to further interpretation of the pathological and physiological mechanisms of SNO. Results Using an intermediate fusion-based stacked generalization approach, we integrated embeddings from supervised embedding layer and contextualized protein language model (ProtT5) and developed a tool called pLMSNOSite (protein language model-based SNO site predictor). On an independent test set of experimentally identified SNO sites, pLMSNOSite achieved values of 0.340, 0.735 and 0.773 for MCC, sensitivity and specificity respectively. These results show that pLMSNOSite performs better than the compared approaches for the prediction of S-nitrosylation sites. Conclusion Together, the experimental results suggest that pLMSNOSite achieves significant improvement in the prediction performance of S-nitrosylation sites and represents a robust computational approach for predicting protein S-nitrosylation sites. pLMSNOSite could be a useful resource for further elucidation of SNO and is publicly available at https://github.com/KCLabMTU/pLMSNOSite ."}}

However, powerful nonlinear prediction methods such as deep learning and SVM suffer from interpretability problem, making it hard to use in domains where the reason for decision making is required. In this paper, we develop an interpretable non-linear model called itemset Sparse Bayes (iSB), which builds a Bayesian probabilistic model, while simultaneously considering variable interactions. In order to suppress the resulting large number of variables, sparsity is imposed on regression weights by a sparsity inducing prior. As a subroutine to search for variable interactions, itemset enumeration algorithm is employed with a novel bounding condition. In computational experiments using real-world dataset, the proposed method performed better than decision tree by 10% in terms of r <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> . We also demonstrated the advantage of our method in Bayesian optimization setting, in which the proposed approach could successfully find the maximum of an unknown function while maintaining transparency. Apart from Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process, i SB gives us a clue to understand which variables interactions are important in optimizing an unknown function."}}

This paper presents a solution to this problem by combining itemset mining with non-negative least squares. However, once incorporation of modern regularization is considered, then a naive solution requires to solve expensive enumeration problem many times for every regularization parameter. In this paper, we devise a regularization path tracking algorithm such that combinatorial feature is searched and included one by one to the solution set. Our contribution is a proposal of novel bounds specifically designed for the feature search problem. In synthetic dataset, the proposed method is demonstrated to run orders of magnitudes faster than a naive counterpart which does not employ tree pruning. We also empirically show that non-negativity constraints can reduce the number of active features much less than that of LASSO, leading to significant speed-ups in pattern search. In experiments using HIV-1 drug resistance dataset, the proposed method could successfully model the rapidly increasing drug resistance triggered by accumulation of mutations in HIV-1 genetic sequences. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of non-negativity constraints in suppressing false positive features, resulting in a model with smaller number of features and thereby improved interpretability."}}

Developing a method for the classification of NR proteins is an important step towards understanding the structure and functions of the newly discovered NR protein. The recent studies on NR classification are either unable to achieve optimum accuracy or are not designed for all the known NR subfamilies. In this study, we developed RF-NR, which is a Random Forest based approach for improved classification of nuclear receptors. The RF-NR can predict whether a query protein sequence belongs to one of the eight NR subfamilies or it is a non-NR sequence. The RF-NR uses spectrum-like features namely: Amino Acid Composition, Di-peptide Composition, and Tripeptide Composition. Benchmarking on two independent datasets with varying sequence redundancy reduction criteria, the RF-NR achieves better (or comparable) accuracy than other existing methods. The added advantage of our approach is that we can also obtain biological insights about the important features that are required to classify NR subfamilies.

As the newly identified number of BL enzymes is increasing daily, it is imperative to develop a computational tool to classify the newly identified BL enzymes into one of its classes. There are two types of classification of BL enzymes: Molecular Classification and Functional Classification. Existing computational methods only address Molecular Classification and the performance of these existing methods is unsatisfactory. Results We addressed the unsatisfactory performance of the existing methods by implementing a Deep Learning approach called Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We developed CNN-BLPred, an approach for the classification of BL proteins. The CNN-BLPred uses Gradient Boosted Feature Selection (GBFS) in order to select the ideal feature set for each BL classification. Based on the rigorous benchmarking of CCN-BLPred using both leave-one-out cross-validation and independent test sets, CCN-BLPred performed better than the other existing algorithms. Compared with other architectures of CNN, Recurrent Neural Network, and Random Forest, the simple CNN architecture with only one convolutional layer performs the best. After feature extraction, we were able to remove ~95% of the 10,912 features using Gradient Boosted Trees. During 10-fold cross validation, we increased the accuracy of the classic BL predictions by 7%. We also increased the accuracy of Class A, Class B, Class C, and Class D performance by an average of 25.64%. The independent test results followed a similar trend. Conclusions We implemented a deep learning algorithm known as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to develop a classifier for BL classification. Combined with feature selection on an exhaustive feature set and using balancing method such as Random Oversampling (ROS), Random Undersampling (RUS) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), CNN-BLPred performs significantly better than existing algorithms for BL classification."}}
