Forecasting neurological outcomes of these patients (the task of neurological prognostication) could help with treatment decisions. In this paper, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first dynamic framework for neurological prognostication of post-cardiac-arrest comatose patients using EEG data: our framework makes predictions for a patient over time as more EEG data become available, and different training patients' available EEG time series could vary in length. Predictions are phrased in terms of either time-to-event outcomes (time-to-awakening or time-to-death) or as the patient's probability of awakening or of dying across multiple time horizons. Our framework uses any dynamic survival analysis model that supports competing risks in the form of estimating patient-level cumulative incidence functions. We consider three competing risks as to what happens first to a patient: awakening, being withdrawn from life-sustaining therapies (and thus deterministically dying), or dying (by other causes). We demonstrate our framework by benchmarking three existing dynamic survival analysis models that support competing risks on a real dataset of 922 patients. Our main experimental findings are that: (1) the classical Fine and Gray model which only uses a patient's static features and summary statistics from the patient's latest hour's worth of EEG data is highly competitive, achieving accuracy scores as high as the recently developed Dynamic-DeepHit model that uses substantially more of the patient's EEG data; and (2) in an ablation study, we show that our choice of modeling three competing risks results in a model that is at least as accurate while learning more information than simpler models (using two competing risks or a standard survival analysis setup with no competing risks)."}}

Our framework is based on so-called anchor directions in an embedding space. We show how to estimate these anchor directions using clustering or, alternatively, using user-supplied \"concepts\" defined by collections of raw inputs (e.g., feature vectors all from female patients could encode the concept \"female\"). For tabular data, we present visualization strategies that reveal how anchor directions relate to raw clinical features and to survival time distributions. We then show how these visualization ideas extend to handling raw inputs that are images. Our framework is built on looking at angles between vectors in an embedding space, where there could be \"information loss\" by ignoring magnitude information. We show how this loss results in a \"clumping\" artifact that appears in our visualizations, and how to reduce this information loss in practice."}}

Existing unsupervised approaches often suffer from high computational cost, complex hyperparameter tuning, and limited interpretability, especially when working with large, high-dimensional datasets. To address these issues, we present a simple yet effective algorithm called ECOD (Empirical-Cumulative-distribution-based Outlier Detection), which is inspired by the fact that outliers are often the \"rare events\" that appear in the tails of a distribution. In a nutshell, ECOD first estimates the underlying distribution of the input data in a nonparametric fashion by computing the empirical cumulative distribution per dimension of the data. ECOD then uses these empirical distributions to estimate tail probabilities per dimension for each data point. Finally, ECOD computes an outlier score of each data point by aggregating estimated tail probabilities across dimensions. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a novel outlier detection method called ECOD, which is both parameter-free and easy to interpret; (2) we perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets, where we find that ECOD outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability; and (3) we release an easy-to-use and scalable (with distributed support) Python implementation for accessibility and reproducibility."}}

Such a kernel function can be learned using deep kernel survival models. In this paper, we present a new deep kernel survival model called a survival kernet, which scales to large datasets in a manner that is amenable to model interpretation and also theoretical analysis. Specifically, the training data are partitioned into clusters based on a recently developed training set compression scheme for classification and regression called kernel netting that we extend to the survival analysis setting. At test time, each data point is represented as a weighted combination of these clusters, and each such cluster can be visualized. For a special case of survival kernets, we establish a finite-sample error bound on predicted survival distributions that is, up to a log factor, optimal. Whereas scalability at test time is achieved using the aforementioned kernel netting compression strategy, scalability during training is achieved by a warm-start procedure based on tree ensembles such as XGBoost and a heuristic approach to accelerating neural architecture search. On four standard survival analysis datasets of varying sizes (up to roughly 3 million data points), we show that survival kernets are highly competitive compared to various baselines tested in terms of time-dependent concordance index.
