There have been numerous domain adaptation (DA) methods in both online and offline modes to improve cross-domain adaptation ability. However, these DA methods typically only provide good performance after a long period of adaptation, and perform poorly on new domains before and during adaptation \u2013 in what we call the \u201cUnfamiliar Period\u201d, especially when domain shifts happen suddenly and significantly. On the other hand, domain generalization (DG) methods have been proposed to improve the model generalization ability on unadapted domains. However, existing DG works are ineffective for continually changing domains due to severe catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. To overcome these limitations of DA and DG in handling the Unfamiliar Period during continual domain shift, we propose RaTP, a framework that focuses on improving models\u2019 target domain generalization (TDG) capability, while also achieving effective target domain adaptation (TDA) capability right after training on certain domains and forgetting alleviation (FA) capability on past domains. RaTP includes a training-free data augmentation module to prepare data for TDG, a novel pseudo-labeling mechanism to provide reliable supervision for TDA, and a prototype contrastive alignment algorithm to align different domains for achieving TDG, TDA and FA. Extensive experiments on Digits, PACS, and DomainNet demonstrate that RaTP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art works from Continual DA, Source-Free DA, Test-Time/Online DA, Single DG, Multiple DG and Unified DA&DG in TDG, and achieves comparable TDA and FA capabilities."}}

However, most existing methods unrealistically assume object classes of the overall framework are fixed over time. It makes the global model suffer from significant catastrophic forgetting on old classes in real-world scenarios, where local clients often collect new classes continuously and have very limited storage memory to store old classes. Moreover, new clients with unseen new classes may participate in the FL training, further aggravating the catastrophic forgetting of global model. To address these challenges, we develop a novel Global-Local Forgetting Compensation (GLFC) model, to learn a global class-incremental model for alleviating the catastrophic forgetting from both local and global perspectives. Specifically, to address local forgetting caused by class imbalance at the local clients, we design a class-aware gradient compensation loss and a class-semantic relation distillation loss to balance the forgetting of old classes and distill consistent inter-class relations across tasks. To tackle the global forgetting brought by the non-i.i.d class imbalance across clients, we propose a proxy server that selects the best old global model to assist the local relation distillation. Moreover, a prototype gradient-based communication mechanism is developed to protect the privacy. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.4%~15.1% in terms of average accuracy on representative benchmark datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/conditionWang/FCIL."}}

Specifically: 1) For ownership verification, watermarking techniques are commonly used but are often vulnerable to sophisticated watermark removal methods. By comparison, our NTL-based ownership verification provides robust resistance to state-of-the-art watermark removal methods, as shown in extensive experiments with 6 removal approaches over the digits, CIFAR10 & STL10, and VisDA datasets. 2) For usage authorization, prior solutions focus on authorizing specific users to access the model, but authorized users can still apply the model to any data without restriction. Our NTL-based authorization approach instead provides data-centric protection, which we call applicability authorization, by significantly degrading the performance of the model on unauthorized data.

In some target problem domains, there are not many data samples available, which could significantly hinder the learning process. While data from similar domains may be leveraged to help through domain adaptation, obtaining high-quality labeled data for those source domains themselves could be difficult or costly. To address such challenges on data insufficiency for classification problem in a target domain, we propose a weak adaptation learning (WAL) approach that leverages unlabeled data from a similar source domain, a low-cost weak annotator that produces labels based on task-specific heuristics, labeling rules, or other methods (albeit with inaccuracy), and a small amount of labeled data in the target domain. Our approach first conducts a theoretical analysis on the error bound of the trained classifier with respect to the data quantity and the performance of the weak annotator, and then introduces a multi-stage weak adaptation learning method to learn an accurate classifier by lowering the error bound. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in learning an accurate classifier with limited labeled data in the target domain and unlabeled data in the source domain."}}

However, the distribution and quantity of the training data on the clients' side may lead to significant challenges such as class imbalance and non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data, which could greatly impact the performance of the common model. While much effort has been devoted to helping FL models converge when encountering non-IID data, the imbalance issue has not been sufficiently addressed. In particular, as FL training is executed by exchanging gradients in an encrypted form, the training data is not completely observable to either clients or server, and previous methods for class imbalance do not perform well for FL. Therefore, it is crucial to design new methods for detecting class imbalance in FL and mitigating its impact. In this work, we propose a monitoring scheme that can infer the composition of training data for each FL round, and design a new loss function -- Ratio Loss to mitigate the impact of the imbalance. Our experiments demonstrate the importance of acknowledging class imbalance and taking measures as early as possible in FL training, and the effectiveness of our method in mitigating the impact. Our method is shown to significantly outperform previous methods, while maintaining client privacy."}}

Although it is designed for enhancing the data privacy, we demonstrated in this paper a new direction in inference attacks in the context of FL, where valuable information about training data can be obtained by adversaries with very limited power. In particular, we proposed three new types of attacks to exploit this vulnerability. The first type of attack, Class Sniffing, can detect whether a certain label appears in training. The other two types of attacks can determine the quantity of each label, i.e., Quantity Inference attack determines the composition proportion of the training label owned by the selected clients in a single round, while Whole Determination attack determines that of the whole training process. We evaluated our attacks on a variety of tasks and datasets with different settings, and the corresponding results showed that our attacks work well generally. Finally, we analyzed the impact of major hyper-parameters to our attacks and discussed possible defenses."}}
