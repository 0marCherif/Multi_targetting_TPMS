We focus on the underexplored problem of estimating clustering quality with limited labels. We adapt existing approaches from the few-sample model evaluation literature to actively sub-sample, with a learned surrogate model, the most informative data points for annotation to estimate the evaluation metric. However, we find that their estimation  can be biased and only relies on the labeled data. To that end, we introduce CEREAL, a comprehensive framework for few-sample clustering evaluation that extends active sampling approaches in three key ways. First, we propose novel NMI-based acquisition functions that account for the distinctive properties of clustering and uncertainties from a learned surrogate model. Next, we use ideas from semi-supervised learning and train the surrogate model with both the labeled and unlabeled data. Finally, we pseudo-label the unlabeled data with the surrogate model. We run experiments to estimate NMI in an active sampling pipeline on three datasets across vision and language. Our results show that CEREAL reduces the area under the absolute error curve by up to 57% compared to the best sampling baseline. We perform an extensive ablation study to show that our framework is agnostic to the choice of clustering algorithm and evaluation metric. We also extend CEREAL from clusterwise annotations to pairwise annotations. Overall, CEREAL can efficiently evaluate clustering with limited human annotations. "}}

We develop CSP for compositional zero-shot learning, the task of predicting unseen attribute-object compositions (e.g., old cat and young tiger). VLMs have a flexible text encoder that can represent arbitrary classes as natural language prompts but they often underperform task-specific architectures on the compositional zero-shot benchmark datasets. CSP treats the attributes and objects that define classes as learnable tokens of vocabulary. During training, the vocabulary is tuned to recognize classes that compose tokens in multiple ways (e.g., old cat and white cat). At test time, we recompose the learned attribute-object vocabulary in new combinations to recognize novel classes. We show that CSP outperforms the CLIP on benchmark datasets by an average of 10.9 percentage points on AUC. CSP also outperforms CoOp, a soft prompting method that fine-tunes the prefix context tokens, by an average of 5.8 percentage points on AUC. We perform additional experiments to show that CSP improves generalization to higher-order attribute-attribute-object compositions (e.g., old white cat) and combinations of pretrained attributes and fine-tuned objects.

It has been hypothesized that this is a consequence of implicit multitask learning in language models\u2019 pretraining (Radford et al., 2019). Can zero-shot generalization instead be directly induced by explicit multitask learning? To test this question at scale, we develop a system for easily mapping any natural language tasks into a human-readable prompted form. We convert a large set of supervised datasets, each with multiple prompts with diverse wording. These prompted datasets allow for benchmarking the ability of a model to perform completely unseen tasks specified in natural language. We fine-tune a pretrained encoder-decoder model (Raffel et al., 2020; Lester et al., 2021) on this multitask mixture covering a wide variety of tasks. The model attains strong zero-shot performance on several datasets, often outperforming models 16\u00d7 its size. Further, our model attains strong performance on a subset of tasks from the BIG-Bench benchmark, outperforming models 6\u00d7 its size. All trained models are available at https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/t-zero, and all prompts are available at https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/promptsource."}}

Common sense knowledge graphs are an untapped source of explicit high-level knowledge that requires little human effort to apply to a range of tasks. To capture the knowledge in the graph, we introduce ZSL-KG, a general-purpose framework with a novel transformer graph convolutional network (TrGCN) to generate class representations. Our proposed TrGCN architecture computes non-linear combinations of the node neighbourhood and leads to significant improvements on zero-shot learning tasks. We report new state-of-the-art accuracies on six zero-shot benchmark datasets in object classification, intent classification, and fine-grained entity typing tasks. ZSL-KG outperforms the specialized state-of-the-art method for each task by an average 1.7 accuracy points and outperforms the general-purpose method with the best average accuracy by 5.3 points. Our ablation study on ZSL-KG with alternate graph neural networks shows that our transformer-based aggregator adds up to 2.8 accuracy points improvement on these tasks."}}

On two natural language tasks across three datasets, ZSL-KG shows an average improvement of 9.2 points of accuracy versus state-of-the-art methods. In addition, on an object classification task, ZSL-KG shows a 2.2 accuracy point improvement versus the best methods that do not require hand-engineered class representations.
