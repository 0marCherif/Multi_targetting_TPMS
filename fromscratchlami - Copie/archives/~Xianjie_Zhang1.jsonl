To achieve these benefits, two key interlinked challenges have to be solved effectively: (a) pricing -- setting prices to customer requests for taxis; and (b) matching -- assignment of customers (that accepted the prices) to taxis/cars. Traditionally, both these challenges have been studied individually and using myopic approaches (considering only current requests), without considering the impact of current matching on addressing future requests. In this paper, we develop a novel framework that handles the pricing and matching problems together, while also considering the future impact of the pricing and matching decisions. In our experimental results on a real-world taxi dataset, we demonstrate that our framework can significantly improve revenue (up to 17% and on average 6.4%) in a sustainable manner by reducing the number of vehicles (up to 14% and on average 10.6%) required to obtain a given fixed revenue and the overall distance travelled by vehicles (up to 11.1% and on average 3.7%). That is to say, we are able to provide an ideal win-win scenario for all stakeholders (customers, drivers, aggregator, environment) involved by obtaining higher revenue for customers, drivers, aggregator (ride pooling company) while being good for the environment (due to fewer number of vehicles on the road and lesser fuel consumed)."}}

Similar to human social groups, agents in distributed learning systems can also rely on common belief to achieve cooperation under the condition of limited communication. In this paper, we show the role of common belief among agents in completing cooperative tasks, by proposing the Common Belief Multi-Agent (CBMA) reinforcement learning method. CBMA is a novel value-based method that infers the belief between agents with a variational model and models the environment with a variational recurrent neural network. We validate CBMA on two grid-world games as well as the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark. Experimental results show that the learned common belief by CBMA can improve performance in both discrete and continuous state settings."}}

Many attempts have been made for agents with prior domain knowledge and predefined structure. However, the interaction relationship between agents in a multi-agent system (MAS) in general is usually unknown, and previous methods could not tackle dynamical activities in an ever-changing environment. Here we propose a multi-agent Actor-Critic algorithm called Structural Relational Inference Actor-Critic (SRI-AC), which is based on the framework of centralized training and decentralized execution. SRI-AC utilizes the latent codes in variational autoencoder (VAE) to represent interactions between paired agents, and the reconstruction error is based on Graph Neural Network (GNN). With this framework, we test whether the reinforcement learning learners could form an interpretable structure while achieving better performance in both cooperative and competitive scenarios. The results indicate that SRI-AC could be applied to complex dynamic environments to find an interpretable structure while obtaining better performance compared to baseline algorithms."}}

As the desired next-generation power grid system, smart grid can provide secure and reliable power generation, and consumption, and can also realize the system\u2019s coordinated and intelligent power distribution. Coordinating grid power distribution usually requires mutual communication between power distributors to accomplish coordination. However, the power network is complex, the network nodes are far apart, and the communication bandwidth is often expensive. Therefore, how to reduce the communication bandwidth in the cooperative power distribution process task is crucially important. One way to tackle this problem is to build mechanisms to selectively send out communications, which allow distributors to send information at certain moments and key states. The distributors in the power grid are modeled as reinforcement learning agents, and the communication bandwidth in the power grid can be reduced by optimizing the communication frequency between agents. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model for deciding whether to communicate based on the causal inference method, Causal Inference Communication Model (CICM). CICM regards whether to communicate as a binary intervention variable, and determines which intervention is more effective by estimating the individual treatment effect (ITE). It offers the optimal communication strategy about whether to send information while ensuring task completion. This method effectively reduces the communication frequency between grid distributors, and at the same time maximizes the power distribution effect. In addition, we test the method in StarCraft II and 3D environment habitation experiments, which fully proves the effectiveness of the method."}}
