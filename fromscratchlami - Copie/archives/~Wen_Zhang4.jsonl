Recent query embedding (QE) approaches embed the entities and relations in a KG and the first-order logic (FOL) queries into a low dimensional space, making the query can be answered by dense similarity searching. However, previous works mainly concentrate on the target answers, ignoring intermediate entities' usefulness, which is essential for relieving the cascading error problem in logical query answering. In addition, these methods are usually designed with their own geometric or distributional embeddings to handle logical operators like union, intersection, and negation, with the sacrifice of the accuracy of the basic operator -- projection, and they could not absorb other embedding methods to their models. In this work, we propose a Neural and Symbolic Entangled framework (ENeSy) for complex query answering, which enables the neural and symbolic reasoning to enhance each other to alleviate the cascading error and KG incompleteness. The projection operator in ENeSy could be any embedding method with the capability of link prediction, and the other FOL operators are handled without parameters. With both neural and symbolic reasoning results contained, ENeSy answers queries in ensembles. We evaluate ENeSy on complex query answering benchmarks, and ENeSy achieves the state-of-the-art, especially in the setting of training model only with the link prediction task."}}

Such problems still exist for multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). Thus, knowledge graph completion (KGC) is of great importance to predict the missing triples in the existing KGs. As for the existing KGC methods, embedding-based methods rely on manual design to leverage multimodal information while finetune-based approaches are not superior to embedding-based methods in link prediction. To address these problems, we propose a VisualBERT-enhanced Knowledge Graph Completion model (VBKGC for short). VBKGC could capture deeply fused multimodal information for entities and integrate them into the KGC model. Besides, we achieve the co-design of the KGC model and negative sampling by designing a new negative sampling strategy called twins negative sampling. Twins negative sampling is suitable for multimodal scenarios and could align different embeddings for entities. We conduct extensive experiments to show the outstanding performance of VBKGC on the link prediction task and make further exploration of VBKGC."}}

With a unified framework, NeuralKG successfully reproduces link prediction results of these methods on benchmarks, freeing users from the laborious task of reimplementing them, especially for some methods originally written in non-python programming languages. Besides, NeuralKG is highly configurable and extensible. It provides various decoupled modules that can be mixed and adapted to each other. Thus with NeuralKG, developers and researchers can quickly implement their own designed models and obtain the optimal training methods to achieve the best performance efficiently. We built an website in http://neuralkg.zjukg.cn to organize an open and shared KG representation learning community. The source code is all publicly released at https://github.com/zjukg/NeuralKG."}}

Most existing methods exploit pre-trained language models or/and unstructured text, but the knowledge in these resources are often incomplete and noisy. Some other methods prefer to use knowledge graphs (KGs) which often have intensive structured knowledge, but the research is still quite preliminary. In this paper, we propose LaKo, a knowledge-driven VQA method via Late Knowledge-to-text Injection. To effectively incorporate an external KG, we transfer triples into textual format and propose a late injection mechanism for knowledge fusion. Finally we address VQA as a text generation task with an effective encoder-decoder paradigm, which achieves state-of-the-art results on OKVQA datasets."}}

However, previous methods failed to account for the fine-grained semantic association between the image and the text, which resulted in limited identification of fine-grained image aspects and opinions. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose a new approach called SeqCSG, which enhances the encoder-decoder sentiment classification framework using sequential cross-modal semantic graphs. SeqCSG utilizes image captions and scene graphs to extract both global and local fine-grained image information and considers them as elements of the cross-modal semantic graph along with tokens from tweets. The sequential cross-modal semantic graph is represented as a sequence with a multi-modal adjacency matrix indicating relationships between elements. Experimental results show that the approach outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard datasets. Further analysis has demonstrated that the model can implicitly learn the correlation between fine-grained information of the image and the text with the given target.

To organize this knowledge from experts uniformly, we propose to create a Tele-KG (tele-knowledge graph). Using this valuable data, we further propose a tele-domain language pre-training model TeleBERT and its knowledge-enhanced version, a tele-knowledge re-training model KTeleBERT. which includes effective prompt hints, adaptive numerical data encoding, and two knowledge injection paradigms. Concretely, our proposal includes two stages: first, pre-training TeleBERT on 20 million tele-related corpora, and then re-training it on 1 million causal and machine-related corpora to obtain KTeleBERT. Our evaluation on multiple tasks related to fault analysis in tele-applications, including root-cause analysis, event association prediction, and fault chain tracing, shows that pre-training a language model with tele-domain data is beneficial for downstream tasks. Moreover, the KTeleBERT re-training further improves the performance of task models, highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating diverse tele-knowledge into the model."}}

In this problem, a model trained on an existing KG needs to embed an emerging KG with unseen entities and relations. To solve this problem, we introduce the meta-learning setting, where a set of tasks are sampled on the existing KG to mimic the link prediction task on the emerging KG. Based on sampled tasks, we meta-train a graph neural network framework that can construct features for unseen components based on structural information and output embeddings for them. Experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively embed unseen components and outperforms models that consider inductive settings for KGs and baselines that directly use conventional KG embedding methods."}}
