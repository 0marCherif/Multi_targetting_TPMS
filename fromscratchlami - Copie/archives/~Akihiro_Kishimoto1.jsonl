Despite recent progress, this topic remains a challenging problem, due to potentially many combinations to consider as well as slow training and validation.  We present the BLDS algorithm for optimized algorithm selection (ML operations) in a fixed ML pipeline structure.  BLDS performs multi-fidelity optimization for selecting ML algorithms trained with smaller computational overhead, while controlling its pipeline search based on multi-armed bandit and limited discrepancy search.  Our experiments on well-known benchmarks show that BLDS is superior to competing algorithms.\n"}}

However, understanding their performances in industrial applications is still limited. We investigate the search performance of MCTS and DFPN, a variant of PNS in Retrosynthetic Analysis. We present a new variation of DFPN that shows superior search performance over MCTS. We find that DFPN's strengths that justify its success in games have a limited value in our application domain. Therefore a MCTS variant enhanced with the formula of Segler et al. significantly outperforms DFPN. Here, we address this disadvantage of DFPN in Retrosynthetic Analysis by introducing a novel approach to combine DFPN with Heuristic Edge Initialization. We successfully demonstrate that our new DFPN search algorithm outperforms MCTS in search time by a factor of 3 on average with comparable success rates. "}}

Existing state-of-the-art solvers for this task are based on a hybrid best-first and depth-first search scheme that allows them to compute upper and lower bounds on the optimal solution value in an anytime fashion. These methods however are memory intensive schemes (via the best-first component) and do not have an efficient memory management mechanism. For this reason, they are often less effective in practice, especially on difficult problem instances with very large search spaces. In this paper, we introduce a new recursive best-first search based bounding scheme that operates efficiently within limited memory and computes anytime upper and lower bounds that improve over time. An empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach against current solvers."}}

The AI research community and humanity would benefit tremendously from focusing AI research on chemistry on a regular basis, as a benchmark as well as a real-world application domain. To support our position, we review the importance of chemical compound discovery and synthesis planning and discuss the properties of search spaces in a chemistry problem. Knowledge acquired in domains such as two-player board games or single-player puzzles places the AI community in a good position to solve critical problems in the chemistry domain. Yet, we show that searching in chemistry problems poses significant additional challenges that will have to be addressed. Finally, we envision how several AI areas like Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, planning and search, are relevant for chemistry."}}

Existing approaches can compute optimal policies. However, they have a limited scalability, as they implement expensive minimax searches. We introduce a sub-optimal but scalable approach that assigns individual agents to individual targets and that can dynamically re-compute such assignments. We provide a theoretical analysis, including upper bounds on the number of time steps required to solve an instance. In a detailed empirical evaluation on grid maps, our algorithm scales up very convincingly beyond the limits of previous methods. On small problems, where a comparison to a minimax approach is possible, the results demonstrate a good solution quality for our method."}}

Existing work typically assumes that the cost of each action can easily be obtained. However, in many problems, the exact edge cost is expensive to compute. Existing search algorithms face a significant performance bottleneck, due to an excessive overhead associated with dynamically calculating exact edge costs. We present DEA*, an algorithm for problems with expensive edge cost computations. DEA* combines heuristic edge cost evaluations with delayed node expansions, reducing the number of exact edge computations. We formally prove that DEA* is optimal and it is efficient with respect to the number of exact edge cost computations. We empirically evaluate DEA* on multiple-worker routing problems where the exact edge cost is calculated by invoking an external multi-modal journey planning engine. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our ideas in reducing the computational time and improving the solving ability. In addition, we show the advantages of DEA* in domain-independent planning, where we simulate that accurate edge costs are expensive to compute."}}

Automatically extracting knowledge from documents and linking existing databases are common approaches to construct multi-relational data. Complementary to such approaches, there is still a strong demand for manually encoding human expert knowledge. For example, human annotation is necessary for constructing a common-sense knowledge base, which stores facts implicitly shared in a community, because such knowledge rarely appears in documents. As human annotation is both tedious and costly, an important research challenge is how to best use limited human resources, whiles maximizing the quality of the resulting dataset. In this paper, we formalize the problem of dataset construction as active learning problems and present the Active Multi-relational Data Construction (AMDC) method. AMDC repeatedly interleaves multi-relational learning and expert input acquisition, allowing us to acquire helpful labels for data construction. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our solution increases the number of positive triples by a factor of 2.28 to 17.0, and that the predictive performance of the multi-relational model in AMDC achieves the highest or comparable to the best performance throughout the data construction process."}}

We present the succinct interval-splitting tree algorithm (SITA) that efficiently per- forms similarity search in databases for compound-protein pairs with respect to both binary fingerprints and real-valued properties. SITA achieves both time and space efficiency by developing the data structure called interval-splitting trees, which enables to efficiently prune the useless portions of search space, and by incorporating the ideas behind wavelet tree, a succinct data structure to compactly represent trees. We experimentally test SITA on the ability to retrieve similar compound-protein pairs/substrate-product pairs for a query from large databases with over 200 million compound- protein pairs/substrate-product pairs and show that SITA performs better than other possible approaches."}}
