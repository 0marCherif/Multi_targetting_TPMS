Although contrastive learning has been a prominent class of representation learning approaches, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) contrastive learning methods were found to have limited ability for learning unseen out-of-domain speech representations. This paper presents SynCLR, a synthesis framework for contrastive learning of speech representations that can be generalized over unseen domains. Specifically, instead of using data augmentation approach, SynCLR employs data synthesis for multi-view generation. To ensure a highly-varied conditional speech distribution in view generation, we design a novel diffusion-based speech synthesizer. A new contrastive loss is also proposed to construct multiple embedding spaces, each of which preserves view-sensitive information to reduce domain reliance for a better disentanglement. Our experiments showed that SynCLR outperformed the SOTA contrastive learning methods with a 17.2\\% relative reduction of EER in speaker verification tested on an unseen speech corpus, and considerably reduced 50.8\\% relative FIDs in a challenging speech-to-image translation task given out-of-domain test speeches."}}

Our key finding is to learn such representations by separating the target signal from contrastive interfering signals. First, a multi-task separative encoder is built to extract shared separable and discriminative embedding; secondly, we propose a powerful cross-attention mechanism performed over speaker representations across various interfering conditions, allowing the model to focus on and globally aggregate the most critical information to answer the \"query\" (current bottom-up embedding) while paying less attention to interfering, noisy, or irrelevant parts; lastly, we form a new probabilistic contrastive loss which estimates and maximizes the mutual information between the representations and the global speaker vector. While most prior unsupervised methods have focused on predicting the future, neighboring, or missing samples, we take a different perspective of predicting the interfered samples. Moreover, our contrastive separative loss is free from negative sampling. The experiment demonstrates that our approach can learn useful representations achieving a strong speaker verification performance in adverse conditions."}}

Nevertheless, conventional TasNets struggle to satisfy the memory and latency constraints in industrial applications. In this regard, we design a low-cost high-performance architecture, namely, globally attentive locally recurrent (GALR) network. Alike the dual-path RNN (DPRNN), we first split a feature sequence into 2D segments and then process the sequence along both the intra- and inter-segment dimensions. Our main innovation lies in that, on top of features recurrently processed along the inter-segment dimensions, GALR applies a self-attention mechanism to the sequence along the inter-segment dimension, which aggregates context-aware information and also enables parallelization. Our experiments suggest that GALR is a notably more effective network than the prior work. On one hand, with only 1.5M parameters, it has achieved comparable separation performance at a much lower cost with 36.1% less runtime memory and 49.4% fewer computational operations, relative to the DPRNN. On the other hand, in a comparable model size with DPRNN, GALR has consistently outperformed DPRNN in three datasets, in particular, with a substantial margin of 2.4dB absolute improvement of SI-SNRi in the benchmark WSJ0-2mix task."}}

In contrast, our key finding is that multi-granularity features are essential for enhancing contextual modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce a self-attentive network with a novel sandglass-shape, namely Sandglasset, which advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) SS performance at significantly smaller model size and computational cost. Forward along each block inside Sandglasset, the temporal granularity of the features gradually becomes coarser until reaching half of the network blocks, and then successively turns finer towards the raw signal level. We also unfold that residual connections between features with the same granularity are critical for preserving information after passing through the bottleneck layer. Experiments show our Sandglasset with only 2.3M parameters has achieved the best results on two benchmark SS datasets \u2013 WSJ0-2mix and WSJ0-3mix, where the SI-SNRi scores have been improved by absolute 0.6 dB and 2.4 dB, respectively, comparing to the prior SOTA results."}}
