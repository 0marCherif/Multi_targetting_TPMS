Furthermore, these methods often incorporate biased external knowledge from large-scale datasets as prior knowledge into image-text matching model, which is inevitable to force model further learn biased associations. To address above limitations, this paper firstly utilizes Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to illustrate how intra- and inter-modal confounders damage the image-text matching. Then, we employ backdoor adjustment to propose an innovative Deconfounded Causal Inference Network (DCIN) for image-text matching task. DCIN (1) decomposes the intra- and inter-modal confounders and incorporates them into the encoding stage of visual and textual features, effectively eliminating the spurious correlations during image-text matching, and (2) uses causal inference to mitigate biases of external knowledge. Consequently, the model can learn causality instead of spurious correlations caused by dataset bias. Extensive experiments on two well-known benchmark datasets, i.e., Flickr30K and MSCOCO, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method."}}

However, most existing robustness certification works are devoted to the classification case. It remains open for robustness certification for more general outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of robustness certification for structured prediction problems, where the output space is modeled as a semimetric space with a distance function that satisfies non-negativity and symmetry but not necessarily the triangle inequality. We further develop our tailored certification methods for binary, numerical, and hybrid inputs in structured prediction. Experiment results show that our method achieves tighter robustness guarantees than the SOTA structured certification baseline for numerical inputs (for which it only supports) with \u21132 norm perturbation when outputs are measured by intersection over union (IoU) similarity, total variation distance, and perceptual distance. Moreover, we achieve good robustness certification for binary inputs with \u21130 norm perturbation and hybrid inputs with corresponding perturbation when outputs are measured by Manhattan distance."}}

First, there is no convenient interface for domain experts to provide domain knowledge easily. Second, they require significant training data collection overheads. Third, the accuracy suffers from complicated schema changes. To address these shortcomings, we present a novel approach that leverages the unique capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in coding, complex reasoning, and zero-shot learning to generate SQL code that transforms the source datasets into the target datasets. We demonstrate the viability of this approach by designing an LLM-based framework, termed SQLMorpher, which comprises a prompt generator that integrates the initial prompt with optional domain knowledge and historical patterns in external databases. It also implements an iterative prompt optimization mechanism that automatically improves the prompt based on flaw detection. The key contributions of this work include (1) pioneering an end-to-end LLM-based solution for data transformation, (2) developing a benchmark dataset of 105 real-world building energy data transformation problems, and (3) conducting an extensive empirical evaluation where our approach achieved 96% accuracy in all 105 problems. SQLMorpher demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing LLMs in complex, domain-specific challenges, highlighting the potential of their potential to drive sustainable solutions."}}

Image and text retrieval learns visual and textual semantic relationships for multimedia data management and content recognition. The main challenge of this task is how to derive image and text similarity based on local associations under huge modal gap. However, the existing methods compute semantic relevance using associations of all fragments (visual regions and textual words), which underestimate the uncertainty of associations and discriminative positive associations leading to cross-modal correspondence ambiguity. To address these issues, we propose a novel Progressive Positive Association Framework (PPAF), which models association uncertainty as a normal distribution and progressively mines direct and potential positive associations according to the characteristics of the association distribution. We design positive association matching, which adaptively fuses multi-step associations for local matching depending on the relevance difference. In addition, we apply KL loss constraint on cross-modal association distribution in order to enhance local semantic alignment. Extended experiments demonstrate the leading performance of PPAF."}}

Most of them rely on existing datasets and try to improve the detection performance on those known datasets, but their performance drops significantly when detecting newly emerging events. This is not in line with the original intention of the rumor detection task. To tackle this issue, we formulate the rumor detection problem as a domain adaption task and propose the Class-based Adversarial Domain Adaptive framework, CADA, which is a general model framework where any latest rumor detection methods can be plugged-in. The improvement of new emerging rumor event detection is based on adversarial training. Specifically, CADA considers class-based discriminators to achieve fine-grained alignment of declarations to be detected of different classes. Experiments on three public datasets show that CADA can improve the detection performance of existing rumor detection models and achieve better results than state-of-the-art models. In terms of accuracy, the performance is improved by at least 3% compared with the original base model in the PHEME dataset, and as high as 10% in the Twitter datasets."}}

Together with the prevalence of deep neural networks (DNNs), DNN-based 3D object retrieval systems are widely applied, especially by inputting 2D images to retrieve 3D objects. Although DNNs have shown vulnerable to adversarial attacks in classification, the vulnerability of DNN-based 3D object retrieval system remains under-explored. In this paper, we formulate the problem of attacking against DNN-based feature extractors in the 2D image-based 3D object retrieval system. Specifically, we consider the attack happens under a reasonable scenario that the candidate 3D object database is unknown to the adversary, which challenges adversarial example generation. To tackle this difficulty, we set up a reasonable hypothesis on the information which the adversary can be accessible, and then propose two effective perturbation generation methods: one is to corrupt domain-level alignment (CDA) and the other one is to corrupt class-level alignment (CCA). In converse, we propose a novel progressive adversarial training (PAT) method to improve the feature extractor robustness, which can effectively and stably mitigate both CDA and CCA attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that a typical feature extractor can be effectively compromised by attacks. Moreover, the transferability of the adversarial query illustrates the possibility of realistic black-box attacks. The successful defense against both CDA and CCA attacks by PAT can validate the superiority of the proposed defense method."}}

In response, social bot detection tasks have been developed to identify such fake users. Due to the structure of social networks, the majority of methods are based on the graph neural network(GNN), which is susceptible to attacks. In this study, we propose a node injection-based adversarial attack method designed to deceive bot detection models. Notably, neither the target bot nor the newly injected bot can be detected when a new bot is added around the target bot. This attack operates in a black-box fashion, implying that any information related to the victim model remains unknown. To our knowledge, this is the first study exploring the resilience of bot detection through graph node injection. Furthermore, we develop an attribute recovery module to revert the injected node embedding from the graph embedding space back to the original feature space, enabling the adversary to manipulate node perturbation effectively. We conduct adversarial attacks on four commonly used GNN structures for bot detection on two widely used datasets: Cresci-2015 and TwiBot-22. The attack success rate is over 73% and the rate of newly injected nodes being detected as bots is below 13% on these two datasets."}}

However, the existing methods can only interpret some specific decision logic on individual or a small number of images. To facilitate human understandability and generalization ability, it is important to develop representative interpretations that interpret common decision logics of a CNN on a large group of similar images, which reveal the common semantics data contributes to many closely related predictions. In this paper, we develop a novel unsupervised approach to produce a highly representative interpretation for a large number of similar images. We formulate the problem of finding representative interpretations as a co-clustering problem, and convert it into a submodular cost submodular cover problem based on a sample of the linear decision boundaries of a CNN. We also present a visualization and similarity ranking method. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent performance of our method."}}

Structural prior information of nodes is used to construct a joint smoothing distribution matrix with physical significance, which certifies a wider range than those obtained by previous iterative optimization methods.
