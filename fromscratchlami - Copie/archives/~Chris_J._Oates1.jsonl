These are directed acyclic graph (DAG) models with two kinds of variables, primary and secondary. The secondary variables are used to aid in the estimation of the structure of causal relationships between the primary variables. We prove that, under certain assumptions, such causal structure is identifiable from the joint observational distribution of the primary and secondary variables. We give causal semantics for the model class, put forward a score-based approach for estimation and establish consistency results. Empirical results demonstrate gains compared with formulations that treat all variables on an equal footing, or that ignore secondary variables. The methodology is motivated by applications in biology that involve multiple data types and is illustrated here using simulated data and in an analysis of molecular data from the Cancer Genome Atlas."}}

Calibration refers to the statistical quality of the posterior covariances produced by a solver. Since BayesCG is not calibrated in the strict existing notion, we propose instead two test statistics that are necessary but not sufficient for calibration: the Z-statistic and the new S-statistic. We show analytically and experimentally that under low-rank approximate Krylov posteriors, BayesCG exhibits desirable properties of a calibrated solver, is only slightly optimistic, and is computationally competitive with CG."}}

However, it remains an open problem to establish the circumstances in which maximum likelihood estimation is well-posed, that is, when the predictions of the regression model are insensitive to small perturbations of the data. This article identifies scenarios where the maximum likelihood estimator fails to be well-posed, in that the predictive distributions are not Lipschitz in the data with respect to the Hellinger distance. These failure cases occur in the noiseless data setting, for any Gaussian process with a stationary covariance function whose lengthscale parameter is estimated using maximum likelihood. Although the failure of maximum likelihood estimation is part of Gaussian process folklore, these rigorous theoretical results appear to be the first of their kind. The implication of these negative results is that well-posedness may need to be assessed post-hoc, on a case-by-case basis, when maximum likelihood estimation is used to train a Gaussian process model."}}

Specifically, we characterise the native spaces (reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces) and the Sobolev spaces associated with kernels defined over hyperspheres. Our results have direct consequences for kernel cubature, determining the rate of convergence of the worst case error, and expanding the applicability of cubature algorithms based on Stein's method. We first introduce a suitable characterisation on Sobolev spaces on the $d$-dimensional hypersphere embedded in $(d+1)$-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Our characterisation is based on the Fourier--Schoenberg sequences associated with a given kernel. Such sequences are hard (if not impossible) to compute analytically on $d$-dimensional spheres, but often feasible over Hilbert spheres. We circumvent this problem by finding a projection operator that allows to Fourier mapping from Hilbert into finite dimensional hyperspheres. We illustrate our findings through some parametric families of kernels."}}

One approach is to model the unknown quantity of interest as a random variable, and to constrain this variable using data generated during the course of a traditional numerical method. However, data may be nonlinearly related to the quantity of interest, rendering the proper conditioning of random variables difficult and limiting the range of numerical tasks that can be addressed. Instead, this paper proposes to construct probabilistic numerical methods based only on the final output from a traditional method. A convergent sequence of approximations to the quantity of interest constitute a dataset, from which the limiting quantity of interest can be extrapolated, in a probabilistic analogue of Richardson\u2019s deferred approach to the limit. This black box approach (1) massively expands the range of tasks to which probabilistic numerics can be applied, (2) inherits the features and performance of state-of-the-art numerical methods, and (3) enables provably higher orders of convergence to be achieved. Applications are presented for nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations, as well as for eigenvalue problems\u2014a setting for which no probabilistic numerical methods have yet been developed."}}

Here we consider generalised Bayesian inference with a Stein discrepancy as a loss function, motivated by applications in which the likelihood contains an intractable normalisation constant. In this context, the Stein discrepancy circumvents evaluation of the normalisation constant and produces generalised posteriors that are either closed form or accessible using standard Markov chain Monte Carlo. On a theoretical level, we show consistency, asymptotic normality, and bias-robustness of the generalised posterior, highlighting how these properties are impacted by the choice of Stein discrepancy. Then, we provide numerical experiments on a range of intractable distributions, including applications to kernel-based exponential family models and non-Gaussian graphical models."}}

This paper establishes Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods as those which can be cast as solutions to certain inverse problems within the Bayesian framework. This allows us to establish general conditions under which Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods are well-defined, encompassing both non-linear and non-Gaussian models. For general computation, a numerical approximation scheme is proposed and its asymptotic convergence established. The theoretical development is then extended to pipelines of computation, wherein probabilistic numerical methods are composed to solve more challenging numerical tasks. The contribution highlights an important research frontier at the interface of numerical analysis and uncertainty quantification, with a challenging industrial application presented."}}
