However, the existing models are usually limited to the single-task learning framework under the mean squared error (MSE) criterion, where the utilization of variable structure depends heavily on a priori knowledge among variables. For high-dimensional observations in real environment, e.g., Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) data, the learning performance of previous methods may be degraded seriously due to the complex non-Gaussian noise and the insuf\ufb01ciency of a prior knowledge on variable structure. To tackle this problem, we propose a new class of additive models, called Multi-task Additive Models (MAM), by integrating the mode-induced metric, the structure-based regularizer, and additive hypothesis spaces into a bilevel optimization framework. Our approach does not require any priori knowledge of variable structure and suits for high-dimensional data with complex noise, e.g., skewed noise, heavy-tailed noise, and outliers. A smooth iterative optimization algorithm with convergence guarantees is provided to implement MAM ef\ufb01ciently. Experiments on simulations and the CMEs analysis demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach for robust estimation and automatic structure discovery."}}

However, existing methods usually assume the time series data to be stationary and the innovation is sampled from a Gaussian distribution. Both assumptions are too stringent for heavy-tailed and non-stationary time series data that frequently arise in practice, such as \ufb01nance and medical \ufb01elds. To address these problems, we propose an adaptive sparse Huber additive model for robust forecasting in both non-Gaussian data and (non)stationary data. In theory, the generalization bounds of our estimator are established for both stationary and nonstationary time series data, which are independent of the widely used mixing conditions in learning theory of dependent observations. Moreover, the error bound for non-stationary time series contains a discrepancy measure for the shifts of the data distributions over time. Such a discrepancy measure can be estimated empirically and used as a penalty in our method. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/xianruizhong/SpHAM."}}
