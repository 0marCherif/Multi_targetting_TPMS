Nevertheless, with the emergence of normalization techniques and residual connection, deep supervision in image classification was gradually phased out. In this paper, we revisit deep supervision for masked image modeling (MIM) that pre-trains a Vision Transformer (ViT) via a mask-and-predict scheme. Experimentally, we find that deep supervision drives the shallower layers to learn more meaningful representations, accelerates model convergence, and expands attention diversities. Our approach, called DeepMIM, significantly boosts the representation capability of each layer. In addition, DeepMIM is compatible with many MIM models across a range of reconstruction targets. For instance, using ViT-B, DeepMIM on MAE achieves 84.2 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, outperforming MAE by +0.6. By combining DeepMIM with a stronger tokenizer CLIP, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks, including image classification (85.6 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, outperforming MAE-CLIP by +0.8), object detection (52.8 APbox on COCO) and semantic segmentation (53.1 mIoU on ADE20K).

However, small models that are critical for real-world applications cannot or only marginally benefit from this pre-training approach. In this paper, we explore distillation techniques to transfer the success of large MIM-based pre-trained models to smaller ones. We systematically study different options in the distillation framework, including distilling targets, losses, input, network regularization, sequential distillation, etc, revealing that: 1) Distilling token relations is more effective than CLS token- and feature-based distillation; 2) An intermediate layer of the teacher network as target perform better than that using the last layer when the depth of the student mismatches that of the teacher; 3) Weak regularization is preferred; etc. With these findings, we achieve significant fine-tuning accuracy improvements over the scratch MIM pre-training on ImageNet-1K classification, using all the ViT-Tiny, ViT-Small, and ViT-base models, with +4.2%/+2.4%/+1.4% gains, respectively. Our TinyMIM model of base size achieves 52.2 mIoU in AE20K semantic segmentation, which is +4.1 higher than the MAE baseline. Our TinyMIM model of tiny size achieves 79.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K image classification, which sets a new record for small vision models of the same size and computation budget. This strong performance suggests an alternative way for developing small vision Transformer models, that is, by exploring better training methods rather than introducing inductive biases into architectures as in most previous works.

These models, however, usually designate the similar receptive fields of each token feature within each layer. Such a constraint inevitably limits the ability of each self-attention layer in capturing multi-scale features, thereby leading to performance degradation in handling images with multiple objects of different scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel and generic strategy, termed shunted self-attention (SSA), that allows ViTs to model the attentions at hybrid scales per attention layer. The key idea of SSA is to inject heterogeneous receptive field sizes into tokens: before computing the self-attention matrix, it selectively merges tokens to represent larger object features while keeping certain tokens to preserve fine-grained features. This novel merging scheme enables the self-attention to learn relationships between objects with different sizes, and simultaneously reduces the token numbers and the computational cost. Extensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the superiority of SSA. Specifically, the SSA-based transformer achieve 84.0% Top-1 accuracy and out-performs the state-of-the-art Focal Transformer on Ima-geNet with only half of the model size and computation cost, and surpasses Focal Transformer by 1.3 mAP on COCO and 2.9 mIOU on ADE20K under similar parameter and computation cost.

Knowledge distillation is thus introduced to assist the training of transformers. Unlike previous works, where merely heavy convolution-based teachers are provided, in this paper, we delve into the influence of models inductive biases in knowledge distillation (e.g., convolution and involution). Our key observation is that the teacher accuracy is not the dominant reason for the student accuracy, but the teacher inductive bias is more important. We demonstrate that lightweight teachers with different architectural inductive biases can be used to co-advise the student transformer with outstanding performances. The rationale behind is that models designed with different inductive biases tend to focus on diverse patterns, and teachers with different inductive biases attain various knowledge despite being trained on the same dataset. The diverse knowledge provides a more precise and comprehensive description of the data and compounds and boosts the performance of the student during distillation. Furthermore, we propose a token inductive bias alignment to align the inductive bias of the token with its target teacher model. With only lightweight teachers provided and using this cross inductive bias distillation method, our vision transformers (termed as CiT) outperform all previous vision transformers (ViT) of the same architecture on ImageNet. Moreover, our small size model CiT-SAK further achieves 82.7% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet without modifying the attention module of the ViT.
