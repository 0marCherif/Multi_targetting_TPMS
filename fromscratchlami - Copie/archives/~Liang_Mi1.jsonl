We raise the problem of regularizing Wasserstein means and propose several terms tailored to tackle different problems. Our formulation is based on the variational transportation to distribute a sparse discrete measure into the target domain. The resulting sparse representation well captures the desired property of the domain while reducing the mapping cost. We demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our method with examples in domain adaptation, point set registration, and skeleton layout."}}

We discuss the connection between optimal transportation and k-means clustering, solve optimal transportation with the variational principle, and investigate the use of power diagrams as transportation plans for aggregating arbitrary domains into a fixed number of clusters. We drive cluster centroids through the target domain while maintaining the minimum clustering energy by adjusting the power diagram. Thus, we simultaneously pursue clustering and the Wasserstein distance between the centroids and the target domain, resulting in a measure-preserving mapping. We demonstrate the use of our method in domain adaptation, remeshing, and learning representations on synthetic and real data."}}

In this paper, we introduce a variational framework to compute the optimal transformation (OT) in 3D space and propose a univariate neuroimaging index based on OT to measure such alterations. We compute the OT from each image to a template and measure the Wasserstein distance between them. By comparing the distances from all the images to the common template, we obtain a concise and informative index for each image. Our framework makes use of the Newton's method, which reduces the computational cost and enables itself to be applicable to large-scale datasets. The proposed work is a generic approach and thus may be applicable to various volumetric brain images, including structural magnetic resonance (sMR) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) images. In the classification between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls, our method achieves an accuracy of 82:30% on the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) baseline sMRI dataset and outperforms several other indices. On FDG-PET dataset, we boost the accuracy to 88:37% by leveraging pairwise Wasserstein distances. In a longitudinal study, we obtain a 5% significance with p-value = 1:13 \u00d7105 in a t-test on FDG-PET. The results demonstrate a great potential of the proposed index for neuroimage analysis and the precision medicine research."}}
