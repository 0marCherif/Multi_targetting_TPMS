Existing methods use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for square lattices due to their image-like structures. For non-square lattices, existing method uses graph neural network (GNN) in which structure information is not precisely captured, thereby requiring additional hand-crafted sublattice encoding. In this work, we propose lattice convolutions in which a set of proposed operations are used to convert non-square lattices into grid-like augmented lattices on which regular convolution can be applied. Based on the proposed lattice convolutions, we design lattice convolutional networks (LCN) that use self-gating and attention mechanisms. Experimental results show that our method achieves performance on par or better than the GNN method on spin 1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model over the square, honeycomb, triangular, and kagome lattices while without using hand-crafted encoding."}}

One task of particular interests and importance is to predict quantum chemical properties without 3D equilibrium structures. This is practically favorable since obtaining 3D equilibrium structures requires extremely expensive calculations. In this work, we design a deep graph neural network to predict quantum properties by directly learning from 2D molecular graphs. In addition, we propose a 3D graph neural network to learn from low-cost conformer sets, which can be obtained with open-source tools using an affordable budget. We employ our methods to participate in the 2021 KDD Cup on OGB Large-Scale Challenge (OGB-LSC), which aims to predict the HOMO-LUMO energy gap of molecules. Final evaluation results reveal that we are one of the winners with a mean absolute error of 0.1235 on the holdout test set. Our implementation is available as part of the MoleculeX package (https://github.com/divelab/MoleculeX)."}}
