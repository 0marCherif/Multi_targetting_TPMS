The challenge was to create bots that compete in a multiplayer deathmatch in a first-person shooter game Doom. The bots had to make their decisions solely based on visual information, i.e., a raw screen buffer. To play well, the bots needed to understand their surroundings, navigate, explore, and handle the opponents at the same time. These aspects, together with the competitive multiagent aspect of the game, make the competition a unique platform for evaluating the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. This paper discusses the rules, solutions, results, and statistics that give insight into the agents' behaviors. Best performing agents are described in more detail. The results of the competition lead to the conclusion that, although reinforcement learning can produce capable Doom bots, they still are not yet able to successfully compete against humans in this game. This paper also revisits the ViZDoom environment, which is a flexible, easy to use, and efficient three-dimensional platform for research for vision-based reinforcement learning, based on a well-recognized first-person perspective game Doom."}}

Atari 2600 games, however, do not resemble real-world tasks since they involve non-realistic 2D environments and the third-person perspective. Here, we propose a novel test-bed platform for reinforcement learning research from raw visual information which employs the first-person perspective in a semi-realistic 3D world. The software, called ViZDoom, is based on the classical first-person shooter video game, Doom. It allows developing bots that play the game using the screen buffer. ViZDoom is lightweight, fast, and highly customizable via a convenient mechanism of user scenarios. In the experimental part, we test the environment by trying to learn bots for two scenarios: a basic move-and-shoot task and a more complex maze-navigation problem. Using convolutional deep neural networks with Q-learning and experience replay, for both scenarios, we were able to train competent bots, which exhibit human-like behaviors. The results confirm the utility of ViZDoom as an AI research platform and imply that visual reinforcement learning in 3D realistic first-person perspective environments is feasible."}}
