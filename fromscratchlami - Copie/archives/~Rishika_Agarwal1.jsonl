False trigger mitigation (FTM) is a process to detect the false trigger events and respond appropriately to the user. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to the FTM problem by introducing a parallel ASR decoding process with a special language model trained from \"out-of-domain\" data sources. Such language model is complementary to the existing language model optimized for the assistant task. A bidirectional lattice RNN (Bi-LRNN) classifier trained from the lattices generated by the complementary language model shows a $38.34\\%$ relative reduction of the false trigger (FT) rate at the fixed rate of $0.4\\%$ false suppression (FS) of correct invocations, compared to the current Bi-LRNN model. In addition, we propose to train a parallel Bi-LRNN model based on the decoding lattices from both language models, and examine various ways of implementation. The resulting model leads to further reduction in the false trigger rate by $10.8\\%$."}}

The method proposed herein is developed in the frequency domain and enhances the directional information in the sound signal for efficient broad band sound source localization even under conditions of low SNR. The directional information is enhanced by cancelling the spectrum of the direct sound source. Subsequently the sound source is localized using a sub space based method. Binaural source localization experiments are performed using HRIR from the CIPIC database and the HRTFs recorded from a customized mannequin developed using 3D printing technology. Experimental results on sound source localization indicate a reasonable improvement in terms of RMSE when compared to state of the art methods."}}
