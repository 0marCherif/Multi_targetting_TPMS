In this paper, we propose a framework FedAMD to improve the convergence property and maintain flexibility. The core idea is anchor sampling, which disjoints the partial participants into anchor and miner groups. Each client in the anchor group aims at the local bullseye with the gradient computation using a large batch. Guided by the bullseyes, clients in the miner group steer multiple near-optimal local updates using small batches and update the global model. With the joint efforts from both groups, FedAMD is able to accelerate the training process as well as improve the model performance. Measured by $\\epsilon$-approximation and compared to the state-of-the-art first-order methods, FedAMD achieves the convergence by up to $O(1/\\epsilon)$ fewer communication rounds under non-convex objectives. In specific, we achieve a linear convergence rate under PL conditions. Empirical studies on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of FedAMD and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm: Not only does it considerably save computation and communication costs, but also the test accuracy significantly improves.

To this end, improving the communication efficiency by reducing traffic size is one of the most crucial issues for realistic deployment. Existing systems mostly compress features at pixel level and ignore the characteristics of feature structure, which could be further exploited for more efficient compression. In this paper, we take new insights into implementing scalable CL systems through a hierarchical compression on features, termed Stripe-wise Group Quantization (SGQ). Different from previous unstructured quantization methods, SGQ captures both channel and spatial similarity in pixels, and simultaneously encodes features in these two levels to gain a much higher compression ratio. In particular, we refactor feature structure based on inter-channel similarity and bound the gradient deviation caused by quantization, in forward and backward passes, respectively. Such a double-stage pipeline makes SGQ hold a sublinear convergence order as the vanilla SGD-based optimization. Extensive experiments show that SGQ achieves a higher traffic reduction ratio by up to 15.97 times and provides 9.22 times image processing speedup over the uniform quantized training, while preserving adequate model accuracy as FP32 does, even using 4-bit quantization. This verifies that SGQ can be applied to a wide spectrum of edge intelligence applications."}}
