Due to the high resolution of the WSI and the unavailability of patch-level annotations, WSI classification is usually formulated as a weakly supervised problem, which relies on multiple instance learning (MIL) based on patches of a WSI. In this paper, we aim to learn an optimal patch-level feature space by integrating prototype learning with MIL. To this end, we develop a Trainable Prototype enhanced deep MIL (TPMIL) framework for weakly supervised WSI classification. In contrast to the conventional methods which rely on a certain number of selected patches for feature space refinement, we softly cluster all the instances by allocating them to their corresponding prototypes. Additionally, our method is able to reveal the correlations between different tumor subtypes through distances between corresponding trained prototypes. More importantly, TPMIL also enables to provide a more accurate interpretability based on the distance of the instances from the trained prototypes which serves as an alternative to the conventional attention score-based interpretability. We test our method on two WSI datasets and it achieves a new SOTA. GitHub repository: https://github.com/LitaoYang-Jet/TPMIL"}}

Existing long-tailed learning methods usually treat each class equally to re-balance the long-tailed distribution. However, considering that some challenging classes may present diverse intra-class distributions, re-balancing all classes equally may lead to a significant performance drop. To address this, in this paper, we propose a curriculum learning-based framework called Flexible Sampling for the long-tailed skin lesion classification task. Specifically, we initially sample a subset of training data as anchor points based on the individual class prototypes. Then, these anchor points are used to pre-train an inference model to evaluate the per-class learning difficulty. Finally, we use a curriculum sampling module to dynamically query new samples from the rest training samples with the learning difficulty-aware sampling probability. We evaluated our model against several state-of-the-art methods on the ISIC dataset. The results with two long-tailed settings have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed training strategy, which achieves a new benchmark for long-tailed skin lesion classification."}}

Due to an increasing deployment of such systems in clinics, it has become important to develop a more robust system towards various Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples (unknown skin lesions and conditions). However, the current deep learning models trained for skin lesion classification tend to classify these OOD samples incorrectly into one of their learned skin lesion categories. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet strategic approach that improves the OOD detection performance while maintaining the multi-class classification accuracy for the known categories of skin lesion. To specify, this approach is built upon a realistic scenario of a long-tailed and fine-grained OOD detection task for skin lesion images. Through this approach, 1) First, we target the mixup amongst middle and tail classes to address the long-tail problem. 2) Later, we combine the above mixup strategy with prototype learning to address the fine-grained nature of the dataset. The unique contribution of this paper is two-fold, justified by extensive experiments. First, we present a realistic problem setting of OOD task for skin lesion. Second, we propose an approach to target the long-tailed and fine-grained aspects of the problem setting simultaneously to increase the OOD performance."}}

An essential property of camouflaged objects is that they usually exhibit patterns similar to the background and thus make them hard to identify from still images. Therefore, effectively handling temporal dynamics in videos becomes the key for the VCOD task as the camouflaged objects will be noticeable when they move. However, current VCOD methods often leverage homography or optical flows to represent motions, where the detection error may accumulate from both the motion estimation error and the segmentation error. On the other hand, our method unifies motion estimation and object segmentation within a single optimization framework. Specifically, we build a dense correlation volume to implicitly capture motions between neighbouring frames and utilize the final segmentation supervision to optimize the implicit motion estimation and segmentation jointly.

However, existing classification algorithms for medical diagnoses often assume semantically independent labels. In this study, we aim to leverage class hierarchy with deep learning algorithms for more accurate and reliable skin lesion recognition. We propose a hyperbolic network to jointly learn image embeddings and class prototypes. The hyperbola provably provides a space for modeling hierarchical relations better than Euclidean geometry. Meanwhile, we restrict the distribution of hyperbolic prototypes with a distance matrix which is encoded from the class hierarchy. Accordingly, the learned prototypes preserve the semantic class relations in the embedding space and we can predict label of an image by assigning its feature to the nearest hyperbolic class prototype. We use an in-house skin lesion dataset which consists of $$\\sim $$ 230k dermoscopic images on 65 skin diseases to verify our method. Extensive experiments provide evidence that our model can achieve higher accuracy with less severe classification errors compared to that of models without considering class relations."}}

However, these methods focus only on global distribution adaptation and ignore distribution constraints at the category level, which would lead to sub-optimal adaptation performance. This paper presents an unsupervised domain adaptation framework based on category-level regularization that regularizes the category distribution from three perspectives. Specifically, for inter-domain category regularization, an adaptive prototype alignment module is proposed to align feature prototypes of the same category in the source and target domains. In addition, for intra-domain category regularization, we tailored a regularization technique for the source and target domains, respectively. In the source domain, a prototype-guided discriminative loss is proposed to learn more discriminative feature representations by enforcing intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, and as a complement to traditional supervised loss. In the target domain, an augmented consistency category regularization loss is proposed to force the model to produce consistent predictions for augmented/unaugmented target images, which encourages semantically similar regions to be given the same label. Extensive experiments on two publicly fundus datasets show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art comparison algorithms."}}

To address the issues, we advocate to firstly constrain the consistency of pixels with and without strong perturbations to apply a sufficient smoothness constraint and further encourage the class-level separation to exploit the low-entropy regularization for the model training. Particularly, in this paper, we propose the SS-Net for semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks, via exploring the pixel-level Smoothness and inter-class Separation at the same time. The pixel-level smoothness forces the model to generate invariant results under adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, the inter-class separation encourages individual class features should approach their corresponding high-quality prototypes, in order to make each class distribution compact and separate different classes. We evaluated our SS-Net against five recent methods on the public LA and ACDC datasets. Extensive experimental results under two semi-supervised settings demonstrate the superiority of our proposed SS-Net model, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both datasets.
