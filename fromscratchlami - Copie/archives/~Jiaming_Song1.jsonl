Starting from random noise, such text-to-image diffusion models gradually synthesize images in an iterative fashion while conditioning on text prompts. We find that their synthesis behavior qualitatively changes throughout this process: Early in sampling, generation strongly relies on the text prompt to generate text-aligned content, while later, the text conditioning is almost entirely ignored. This suggests that sharing model parameters throughout the entire generation process may not be ideal. Therefore, in contrast to existing works, we propose to train an ensemble of text-to-image diffusion models specialized for different synthesis stages. To maintain training efficiency, we initially train a single model, which is then split into specialized models that are trained for the specific stages of the iterative generation process. Our ensemble of diffusion models, called eDiff-I, results in improved text alignment while maintaining the same inference computation cost and preserving high visual quality, outperforming previous large-scale text-to-image diffusion models on the standard benchmark. In addition, we train our model to exploit a variety of embeddings for conditioning, including the T5 text, CLIP text, and CLIP image embeddings. We show that these different embeddings lead to different behaviors. Notably, the CLIP image embedding allows an intuitive way of transferring the style of a reference image to the target text-to-image output. Lastly, we show a technique that enables eDiff-I's \"paint-with-words\" capability. A user can select the word in the input text and paint it in a canvas to control the output, which is very handy for crafting the desired image in mind.

However, most existing approaches are restricted to linear inverse problems, limiting their applicability to more general cases. In this paper, we build upon Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models (DDRM) and propose a method for solving some non-linear inverse problems. We leverage the pseudo-inverse operator used in DDRM and generalize this concept for other measurement operators, which allows us to use pre-trained unconditional diffusion models for applications such as JPEG artifact correction. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various quality factors, attaining performance levels that are on par with state-of-the-art methods trained specifically for the JPEG restoration task."}}

Models trained for specific inverse problems work well but are limited to their particular use cases, whereas methods that use problem-agnostic models are general but often perform worse empirically. To address this dilemma, we introduce Pseudoinverse-guided Diffusion Models ($\\Pi$GDM), an approach that uses problem-agnostic models to close the gap in performance. $\\Pi$GDM directly estimates conditional scores from the measurement model of the inverse problem without additional training. It can address inverse problems with noisy, non-linear, or even non-differentiable measurements, in contrast to many existing approaches that are limited to noiseless linear ones. We illustrate the empirical effectiveness of $\\Pi$GDM on several image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, inpainting and JPEG restoration. On ImageNet, $\\Pi$GDM is competitive with state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on specific tasks, and is the first to achieve this with problem-agnostic diffusion models. $\\Pi$GDM can also solve a wider set of inverse problems where the measurement processes are composed of several simpler ones."}}

It has also been a trend to automate the curriculum generation process. Automatic CL works primarily focus on goal-conditioned RL problems, where an explicit indicator of training progress, e.g., reward or success rate, can be used to prioritize the training tasks. However, such a requirement is no longer valid in zero-sum games: there are no goals for the agents, and the accumulative reward of the learning policy can constantly fluctuate throughout training. In this work, we present the first theoretical framework of automatic curriculum learning in the setting of zero-sum games and derive a surprisingly simple indicator of training progress, i.e., the Q-value variance, which can be directly approximated by computing the variance of value network ensembles. With such a progression metric, we further adopt a particle-based task sampler to generate initial environment configurations for training, which is particularly lightweight, computation-efficient, and naturally multi-modal. Combining these techniques with multi-agent PPO training, we obtain our final algorithm, Zero-sum Automatic Curriculum Learning (ZACL). We first evaluate ZACL in a 2D particle-world environment, where ZACL produces much stronger policies than popular RL methods for zero-sum games using the same amount of samples. Then we show in the challenging hide-and-seek environment that ZACL can lead to all four emergent phases using a single desktop computer, which is reported for the first time in the literature.

The training process requires concurrent access to both datasets, which hinders data separation and privacy protection; and existing models cannot be easily adapted for translation of new domain pairs. We present Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIBs), an image translation method based on diffusion models, that circumvents training on domain pairs. Image translation with DDIBs relies on two diffusion models trained independently on each domain, and is a two-step process: DDIBs first obtain latent encodings for source images with the source diffusion model, and then decode such encodings using the target model to construct target images. Both steps are defined via ordinary differential equations (ODEs), thus the process is cycle consistent only up to discretization errors of the ODE solvers. Theoretically, we interpret DDIBs as concatenation of source to latent, and latent to target Schrodinger Bridges, a form of entropy-regularized optimal transport, to explain the efficacy of the method. Experimentally, we apply DDIBs on synthetic and high-resolution image datasets, to demonstrate their utility in a wide variety of translation tasks and their inherent optimal transport properties."}}

However, this representation is not applicable in discrete domains where the gradient is undefined.   To this end, we propose an analogous score function called the \u201cConcrete score\u201d, a generalization of the (Stein) score for discrete settings. Given a predefined neighborhood structure, the Concrete score of any input is defined by the rate of change of the probabilities with respect to local directional changes of the input. This formulation allows us to recover the (Stein) score in continuous domains when measuring such changes by the Euclidean distance, while using the Manhattan distance leads to our novel score function in discrete domains. Finally, we introduce a new framework to learn such scores from samples called Concrete Score Matching (CSM), and propose an efficient training objective to scale our approach to high dimensions. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of CSM on density estimation tasks on a mixture of synthetic, tabular, and high-dimensional image datasets, and demonstrate that it performs favorably relative to existing baselines for modeling discrete data."}}
