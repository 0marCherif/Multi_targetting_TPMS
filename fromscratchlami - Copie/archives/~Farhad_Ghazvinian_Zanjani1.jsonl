However, previous approaches, either based on VAE or GAN frameworks, have no guarantee of preserving particular aspects of the image in scene reconstruction. In this work, we propose the first probabilistic model called DeNF. Based on recent advances in normalizing flows, we represent the scene as a mixture of bidirectional flows that map a set of structured prior distributions into the scene data distribution. The bijective mapping of DeNF yields an efficient sampling and density evaluation in training time. Furthermore, it improves the fidelity of the scene's visual contents in the reconstruction process. In our experiments on real and synthetic image data for unsupervised scene decomposition, DeNF achieves competitive results."}}

State-of-the-art techniques may yield accurate estimates only when they are tailor-made for a specific data modality like camera-based system that prevents their applicability to broader domains. Here, we establish a modality-agnostic framework (called OT-Isomap) and formulate the localization problem in the context of parametric manifold learning while leveraging optimal transportation. This framework allows jointly learning a low-dimensional embedding as well as correspondences with a topological map. We examine the generalizability of the proposed algorithm by applying it to data from diverse modalities such as image sequences and radio frequency signals. The experimental results demonstrate decimeter-level accuracy for localization using different sensory inputs."}}

Handheld ultrasound is one of the most efficient ways to identify and diagnose the breast cancer. The area and the shape information of a lesion is very helpful for clinicians to make diagnostic decisions. In this study we propose a new deep-learning scheme, semi-pixel-wise cycle generative adversarial net (SPCGAN) for segmenting the lesion in 2D ultrasound. The method takes the advantage of a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) and a generative adversarial net to segment a lesion by using prior knowledge. We compared the proposed method to a fully connected neural network and the level set segmentation method on a test dataset consisting of 32 malignant lesions and 109 benign lesions. Our proposed method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.92 while FCN and the level set achieved 0.90 and 0.79 respectively. Particularly, for malignant lesions, our method increases the DSC (0.90) of the fully connected neural network to 0.93 significantly (p <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$&lt;$</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.001). The results show that our SPCGAN can obtain robust segmentation results. The framework of SPCGAN is particularly effective when sufficient training samples are not available compared to FCN. Our proposed method may be used to relieve the radiologists\u2019 burden for annotation."}}

Additionally, we incorporate multi-scale information in our approach by training models with different input image resolutions. This approach is taken since multi-scale approaches have been shown to be effective for many medical image analysis problems\u00a0(Litjens et\u00a0al. 2017). Finally, ensembling is a good way to boost performance and ensembles have been used to win many AI competitions. These methods are especially effective when the models are diverse\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al. 2005). We achieve this diversity by using different ResNet models and by employing the multi-scale approach."}}
