In this work, we propose a novel paradigm called \u201cGromov-Wasserstein Factorization\u201d (GWF) to learn graph representations in a flexible and interpretable way. Given a set of graphs, whose correspondence between nodes is unknown and whose sizes can be different, our GWF model reconstructs each graph by a weighted combination of some \u201cgraph factors\u201d under a pseudo-metric called Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) discrepancy. This model leads to a new nonlinear factorization mechanism of the graphs. The graph factors are shared by all the graphs, which represent the typical patterns of the graphs\u2019 structures. The weights associated with each graph indicate the graph factors\u2019 contributions to the graph's reconstruction, which lead to a permutation-invariant graph representation. We learn the graph factors of the GWF model and the weights of the graphs jointly by minimizing the overall reconstruction error. When learning the model, we reparametrize the graph factors and the weights to unconstrained model parameters and simplify the backpropagation of gradient with the help of the envelope theorem. For the GW discrepancy (the critical training step), we consider two algorithms to compute it, which correspond to the proximal point algorithm (PPA) and Bregman alternating direction method of multipliers (BADMM), respectively. Furthermore, we propose some extensions of the GWF model, including (i) combining with a graph neural network and learning graph representations in an auto-encoding manner, (ii) representing the graphs with node attributes, and (iii) working as a regularizer for semi-supervised graph classification. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our GWF model is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods. The graph representations derived by it perform well in graph clustering and classification tasks."}}

Risk scores are sparse linear models with integer coefficients; often these models can be memorized or placed on an index card. Typically, risk scores have been created either without data or by rounding logistic regression coefficients, but these methods do not reliably produce high-quality risk scores. Recent work used mathematical programming, which is computationally slow. We introduce an approach for efficiently producing a collection of high-quality risk scores learned from data. Specifically, our approach  produces a pool of almost-optimal sparse continuous solutions, each with a different support set, using a beam-search algorithm. Each of these continuous solutions is transformed into a separate risk score through a \"star ray\" search, where a range of multipliers are considered before rounding the coefficients sequentially to maintain low logistic loss. Our algorithm returns all of these high-quality risk scores for the user to consider. This method completes within minutes and can be valuable in a broad variety of applications. "}}

These techniques can handle thousands of features and thousands of observations in minutes, even in the presence of many highly correlated features. For fast sparse logistic regression, our computational speed-up over other best-subset search techniques owes to linear and quadratic surrogate cuts for the logistic loss that allow us to efficiently screen features for elimination, as well as use of a priority queue that favors a more uniform exploration of features. As an alternative to the logistic loss, we propose the exponential loss, which permits an analytical solution to the line search at each iteration. Our algorithms are generally 2 to 5 times faster than previous approaches. They produce interpretable models that have accuracy comparable to black box models on challenging datasets."}}

Despite its success, we found that the empirical results of GPT-$3$ depend heavily on the choice of in-context examples. In this work, we investigate whether there are more effective strategies for judiciously selecting in-context examples (relative to random sampling) that better leverage GPT-$3$'s few-shot capabilities. Inspired by the recent success of leveraging a retrieval module to augment large-scale neural network models, we propose to retrieve examples that are semantically-similar to a test sample to formulate its corresponding prompt. Intuitively, the in-context examples selected with such a strategy may serve as more informative inputs to unleash GPT-$3$'s extensive knowledge. We evaluate the proposed approach on several natural language understanding and generation benchmarks, where the retrieval-based prompt selection approach consistently outperforms the random baseline. Moreover, it is observed that the sentence encoders fine-tuned on task-related datasets yield even more helpful retrieval results. Notably, significant gains are observed on tasks such as table-to-text generation (41.9% on the ToTTo dataset) and open-domain question answering (45.5% on the NQ dataset). We hope our investigation could help understand the behaviors of GPT-$3$ and large-scale pre-trained LMs in general and enhance their few-shot capabilities."}}
