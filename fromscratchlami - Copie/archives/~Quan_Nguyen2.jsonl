For objective functions whose gradient cannot be evaluated directly, Bayesian optimization offers one solution -- we construct a probabilistic model of the objective, design a policy to learn about the gradient at the current location, and use the resulting information to navigate the objective landscape. Previous work has realized this scheme by minimizing the variance in the estimate of the gradient, then moving in the direction of the expected gradient. In this paper, we re-examine and refine this approach. We demonstrate that, surprisingly, the expected value of the gradient is not always the direction maximizing the probability of descent, and in fact, these directions may be nearly orthogonal. This observation then inspires an elegant optimization scheme seeking to maximize the probability of descent while moving in the direction of most-probable descent. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world objectives show that our method outperforms previous realizations of this optimization scheme and is competitive against other, significantly more complicated baselines."}}

These innovations set the foundation for actively guiding users during data exploration. Providing such guidance will become more critical as datasets grow in size and complexity, precluding exhaustive investigation. Meanwhile, the machine learning community also struggles with datasets growing in size and complexity, precluding exhaustive labeling. Active learning is a broad family of algorithms developed for actively guiding models during training. We will consider the intersection of these analogous research thrusts. First, we discuss the nuances of matching the choice of an active learning algorithm to the task at hand. This is critical for performance, a fact we demonstrate in a simulation study. We then present results of a user study for the particular task of data discovery guided by an active learning algorithm specifically designed for this task."}}
