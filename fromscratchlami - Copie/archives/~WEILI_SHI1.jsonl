However, the robustness of vision transformers has been relatively under-explored. Recent studies have revealed that pre-trained vision transformers are also vulnerable to white-box adversarial attacks on the downstream image classification task. The adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM and PGD) designed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can also cause severe performance drop for vision transformers. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of vision transformers fine-tuned with the off-the-shelf methods under adversarial attacks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. We further propose a data-augmented virtual adversarial training approach called MixVAT, which is able to enhance the robustness of pre-trained vision transformers against adversarial attacks on the downstream tasks with the unlabelled data. Extensive results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over baselines on adversarial robustness, without compromising generalization ability of the model."}}

However, when the classes in source and target domains are imbalanced, most existing UDA methods experience significant performance drop, as the decision boundary usually favors the majority classes. Some recent class-imbalanced domain adaptation (CDA) methods aim to tackle the challenge of biased label distribution by exploiting pseudo-labeled target samples during training process. However, these methods suffer from the issues with unreliable pseudo labels and error accumulation during training. In this paper, we propose a pairwise adversarial training approach for class-imbalanced domain adaptation. Unlike conventional adversarial training in which the adversarial samples are obtained from the lp ball of the original samples, we generate adversarial samples from the interpolated line of the aligned pairwise samples from source and target domains. The pairwise adversarial training (PAT) is a novel data-augmentation method which can be integrated into existing UDA models to tackle with the CDA problem. Experimental results and ablation studies show that the UDA models integrated with our method achieve considerable improvements on benchmarks compared with the original models as well as the state-of-the-art CDA methods.

Estimating the abundance, movement, and survival of brook trout in the wild is an important task for environmental management, and current methods often involve physical tagging or collection of DNA samples for each of the fish as their unique identifier. However, this process is expensive and inefficient. Meanwhile, although deep learning methods have proven effective for individual recognition of humans, it remains challenging to apply this system to wildlife biology due to fewer available images, different biometric patterns, and relatively poor image quality. In this paper, we develop a framework to automate the process of individual recognition of brook trout. Distinguished from simply adopting traditional feature descriptors (e.g., SIFT and HOG) or using deep neural networks on the raw images, our framework utilizes multiple modalities consisting of the region of interest and gray-scaled pigmentation patterns. We use these multiple modality features in a Convolutional Neural network to generate feature vectors as fish descriptors. These descriptors are then used to distinguish individual brook trout by ranking their relative distance in latent space. Our experimental framework demonstrates better results than baseline methods such as SIFT and HOG while being more robust to distortions characteristic of large imagery datasets collected through crowdsourcing and citizen science."}}
