To alleviate the two issues, state-of-the-art methods reweight each instance by leveraging a small amount of clean and unbiased data. Yet, these methods overlook class-level information within each instance, which can be further utilized to improve performance. To this end, in this paper, we propose Generalized Data Weighting (GDW) to simultaneously mitigate label noise and class imbalance by manipulating gradients at the class level. To be specific, GDW unrolls the loss gradient to class-level gradients by the chain rule and reweights the flow of each gradient separately. In this way, GDW achieves remarkable performance improvement on both issues. Aside from the performance gain, GDW efficiently obtains class-level weights without introducing any extra computational cost compared with instance weighting methods. Specifically, GDW performs a gradient descent step on class-level weights, which only relies on intermediate gradients. Extensive experiments in various settings verify the effectiveness of GDW. For example, GDW outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.56% under the 60% uniform noise setting in CIFAR10. Our code is available at https://github.com/GGchen1997/GDW-NIPS2021.\n\n"}}

In this paper, we focus on biological sequence design to maximize some sequence score. A recent approach employs bidirectional learning, combining a forward mapping for exploitation and a backward mapping for constraint, and it relies on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of an infinitely wide network to build a proxy model. Though effective, the NTK cannot learn features because of its parametrization, and its use prevents the incorporation of powerful pre-trained Language Models (LMs) that can capture the rich biophysical information in millions of biological sequences. We adopt an alternative proxy model, adding a linear head to a pre-trained LM, and propose a linearization scheme. This yields a closed-form loss and also takes into account the biophysical information in the pre-trained LM. In addition, the forward mapping and the backward mapping play different roles and thus deserve different weights during sequence optimization. To achieve this, we train an auxiliary model and leverage its weak supervision signal via a bi-level optimization framework to effectively learn how to balance the two mappings. Further, by extending the framework, we develop the first learning rate adaptation module \\textit{Adaptive}-$\\eta$, which is compatible with all gradient-based algorithms for offline model-based optimization.

However, existing protein language models are usually pretrained on protein sequences without considering the important protein structural information. To this end, we propose a novel structure-aware protein self-supervised learning method to effectively capture structural information of proteins. In particular, a well-designed graph neural network (GNN) model is pretrained to preserve the protein structural information with self-supervised tasks from a pairwise residue distance perspective and a dihedral angle perspective, respectively. Furthermore, we propose to leverage the available protein language model pretrained on protein sequences to enhance the self-supervised learning. Specifically, we identify the relation between the sequential information in the protein language model and the structural information in the specially designed GNN model via a novel pseudo bi-level optimization scheme.

This methodology frequently suffers from the out-of-distribution problem where the proxy function often returns poor designs. To mitigate this problem, we propose BiDirectional learning for offline Infinite-width model-based optimization (BDI). BDI consists of two mappings: the forward mapping leverages the static dataset to predict the scores of the high-scoring designs, and the backward mapping leverages the high-scoring designs to predict the scores of the static dataset. The backward mapping, neglected in previous work, can distill more information from the static dataset into the high-scoring designs, which effectively mitigates the out-of-distribution problem. For a finite-width DNN model, the loss function of the backward mapping is intractable and only has an approximate form, which leads to a significant deterioration of the design quality. We thus adopt an infinite-width DNN model, and propose to employ the corresponding neural tangent kernel to yield a closed-form loss for more accurate design updates.

Bi-level optimization embeds one problem within another and the gradient-based category solves the outer-level task by computing the hypergradient, which is much more efficient than classical methods such as the evolutionary algorithm. In this survey, we first give a formal definition of the gradient-based bi-level optimization. Next, we delineate criteria to determine if a research problem is apt for bi-level optimization and provide a practical guide on structuring such problems into a bi-level optimization framework, a feature particularly beneficial for those new to this domain. More specifically, there are two formulations: the single-task formulation to optimize hyperparameters such as regularization parameters and the distilled data, and the multi-task formulation to extract meta-knowledge such as the model initialization. With a bi-level formulation, we then discuss four bi-level optimization solvers to update the outer variable including explicit gradient update, proxy update, implicit function update, and closed-form update. Finally, we wrap up the survey by highlighting two prospective future directions: (1) Effective Data Optimization for Science examined through the lens of task formulation. (2) Accurate Explicit Proxy Update analyzed from an optimization standpoint."}}
