Key to our approach is a novel latent factor model that takes into account network interference and generalizes the factor models typically used in panel data settings. We propose an estimator\u2013the Network Synthetic Interventions estimator\u2014and show that it consistently estimates the counterfactual outcomes for a unit under an arbitrary set of treatments, if certain observation patterns hold in the data. We corroborate our theoretical findings with simulations. In doing so, our framework extends the Synthetic Control and Synthetic Interventions methods to incorporate network interference."}}

This influence has drawn scrutiny, with many calling for regulations on filtering algorithms, but designing and enforcing regulations remains challenging. In this work, we examine three questions. First, given a regulation, how would one design an audit to enforce it? Second, does the audit impose a performance cost on the platform? Third, how does the audit affect the content that the platform is incentivized to filter? In response to these questions, we propose a method such that, given a regulation, an auditor can test whether that regulation is met with only black-box access to the filtering algorithm. We then turn to the platform's perspective. The platform's goal is to maximize an objective function while meeting regulation. We find that there are conditions under which the regulation does not place a high performance cost on the platform and, notably, that content diversity can play a key role in aligning the interests of the platform and regulators."}}
