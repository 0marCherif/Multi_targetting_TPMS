However, the use of stochastic gradient descent combined with the nonconvexity of the underlying optimization problems renders parameter learning susceptible to initialization. To address this issue, a variety of methods that rely on random parameter initialization or knowledge distillation have been proposed in the past. In this paper, we propose FuseInit, a novel method to initialize shallower networks by fusing neighboring layers of deeper networks that are trained with random initialization. We develop theoretical results and efficient algorithms for mean-square error (MSE)-optimal fusion of neighboring dense-dense, convolutional-dense, and convolutional-convolutional layers. We show experiments for a range of classification and regression datasets, which suggest that deeper neural networks are less sensitive to initialization and shallower networks can perform better (sometimes as well as their deeper counterparts) if initialized with FuseInit."}}

To assist students in choosing a sequence of courses, choosing majors and successful academic pathways; many institutions provide several on-site academic advising services supported by data driven educational technologies. Accurate performance prediction can serve as the backbone for degree planning software, personalized advising systems and early warning systems that can identify students at-risk of dropping from their field of study. In this work, we present a deep learning based recommender system approach called Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) for predicting the grade a student will earn in a course that he/she plans to take in the next-term. Prior grade prediction methods are based on matrix factorization (MF) where students and courses are represented in a latent \"knowledge\" space. The deep learning inspired approach provides added flexibility in learning the latent spaces in comparison to MF approaches. The proposed approach also incorporates instructor information besides student and course information. Moreover, for proper analysis of the learned model parameters, we assume the embeddings obtained for students, courses and instructors should be non-negative. This non-negative NCF model referred by NCFnn model adds a rectified linear units (ReLU) on the embedding layer of NCF. The experimental results on datasets from George Mason University, a large, public university in the United States, demonstrate that the proposed NCF approaches significantly outperform competitive baselines across different test sets."}}

To extend the delivery of current remediation methods from single type of sources to combinations of different material types, we propose an adaptive remediation system with multi-modal remediation content. The system operates in four main phases: ingesting a library of multi-modal content files into bite-sized chunks, linking them based on topical and contextual relevance, then modeling users\u2019 real-time knowledge state when they interact with the delivered course through the system and determining whether remediation is needed, and finally identifying a set of remediation segments addressing the current knowledge weakness with the relevance links. We conducted two studies to test our developed adaptive remediation system in an advanced engineering course taught at an undergraduate institution in the US and evaluated our system on productivity. Both studies show that our system is effective in increasing the productivity by at least 50%."}}

While prior work has focused on identifying users most likely to answer and/or to provide the highest quality answers to a question, the promptness of the response is also a key factor of user satisfaction. To address this, we propose point process and neural network-based algorithms for three prediction tasks regarding a user's response to a question: whether the user will answer, the net votes that will be received on the answer, and the time that will elapse before the answer. These algorithms learn over a set of 20 features we define for each pair of user and question that quantify both topical and structural aspects of the forums, including discussion post similarities and social centrality measures. Through evaluation on a Stack Overflow dataset consisting of 20,000 question threads, we find that our method outperforms baselines on each prediction task by more than 20%. We also find that the importance of the features varies depending on the task and the amount of historical data available for inference. At the end, we design a question recommendation system that incorporates these predictions to jointly optimize response quality and timing in forums subject to user constraints."}}

In total, 8.5~h of gait time series are distributed. The measured population was composed of healthy subjects as well as patients with neurological or orthopedic disorders. An outstanding feature of this data set is the amount of signal metadata that are provided. In particular, the start and end time stamps of more than 40,000 footsteps are available, as well as a number of contextual information about each trial.

In particular, we focus on the role of communication in a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem. We consider a learning algorithm in which agents make decisions based on their own observations of the environment, as well as the observations of other agents, which are collected through communication between agents. We first identify two potential benefits of this type of information sharing when agents' observation quality is heterogeneous: (1) it can facilitate coordination among agents, and (2) it can enhance the learning of all participants, including the better informed agents. We show however that these benefits of communication depend in general on its timing, so that delayed information sharing may be preferred in certain scenarios."}}
