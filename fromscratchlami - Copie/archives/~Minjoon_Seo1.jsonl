This is especially a challenging problem because the research community still lacks a coherent dataset for assessing the adaptability of LMs to frequently-updated knowledge corpus such as Wikipedia. To this end, we introduce TemporalWiki, a lifelong benchmark for ever-evolving LMs that utilizes the difference between consecutive snapshots of English Wikipedia and English Wikidata for training and evaluation, respectively. The benchmark hence allows researchers to periodically track an LM\u2019s ability to retain previous knowledge and acquire updated/new knowledge at each point in time. We also find that training an LM on the diff data through continual learning methods achieves similar or better perplexity than on the entire snapshot in our benchmark with 12 times less computational cost, which verifies that factual knowledge in LMs can be safely updated with minimal training data via continual learning."}}

In this paper, we explore how the retrieval of soft prompts obtained through prompt tuning can assist hard prompts in zero-shot task generalization. Specifically, we train soft prompt embeddings for each prompt through prompt tuning, store the samples of the training instances (hard prompt + input instances) mapped with the prompt embeddings, and retrieve the corresponding prompt embedding of the training instance closest to the query instance during inference. Results show this simple approach enhances the performance of T0 on unseen tasks by outperforming it on 10 out of 11 datasets as well as improving the mean accuracy of T0 on BIG-bench benchmark by 2.39% points while adding only 0.007% additional parameters. Also, using interpolation of multiple embeddings and variance-based ranking further improve accuracy and robustness to different evaluation prompts, widening the performance gap."}}

Flipped Learning Makes Language Models Stronger Zero-Shot Learners", "abstract": "Instruction-tuning, which fine-tunes the language model (LM) on various downstream tasks with task instruction, has improved the zero-shot task generalization performance. However, instruction-tuned LMs still struggle to generalize to challenging unseen tasks containing novel labels. In this paper, we propose Flipped Learning, an alternative method of instruction-tuning which trains the LM to generate the task instruction given the input instance and label. During inference, the LM trained with Flipped Learning, referred to as FLIPPED, selects the label option that is most likely to generate the task instruction. On 14 tasks of the BIG-bench benchmark, the 11B-sized FLIPPED outperforms zero-shot T0-11B and even a 16 times larger 3-shot GPT-3 (175B) on average by 8.4% and 9.7% points, respectively. Flipped Learning gives particularly large improvements on tasks with unseen labels, outperforming T0-11B by up to +20% average F1 score. This indicates that the strong task generalization of Flipped Learning comes from improved generalization to novel labels. "}}

The utterances were collected from 222 hospital staff members, including physicians, nurses, and insurance review and health records teams. To construct the QA dataset on structured EHR data, we conducted a poll at a university hospital and used the responses to create seed questions. We then manually linked these questions to two open-source EHR databases, MIMIC-III and eICU, and included various time expressions and held-out unanswerable questions in the dataset, which were also collected from the poll. Our dataset poses a unique set of challenges: the model needs to 1) generate SQL queries that reflect a wide range of needs in the hospital, including simple retrieval and complex operations such as calculating survival rate, 2) understand various time expressions to answer time-sensitive questions in healthcare, and 3) distinguish whether a given question is answerable or unanswerable. We believe our dataset, EHRSQL, can serve as a practical benchmark for developing and assessing QA models on structured EHR data and take a step further towards bridging the gap between text-to-SQL research and its real-life deployment in healthcare. EHRSQL is available at https://github.com/glee4810/EHRSQL."}}

However, instruction learning has been predominantly approached as a fine-tuning problem, including instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, where LLMs are multi-task fine-tuned on various tasks with instructions. In this paper, we present a surprising finding that applying in-context learning to instruction learning, referred to as In-Context Instruction Learning (ICIL), significantly improves the zero-shot task generalization performance for both pretrained and instruction-fine-tuned models. One of the core advantages of ICIL is that it uses a single fixed prompt to evaluate all tasks, which is a concatenation of cross-task demonstrations. In particular, we demonstrate that the most powerful instruction-fine-tuned baseline (text-davinci-003) also benefits from ICIL by 9.3%, indicating that the effect of ICIL is complementary to instruction-based fine-tuning."}}

Unlike prior retrieval-augmented LMs that train language models with special cross attention mechanisms to encode the retrieved text, REPLUG simply prepends retrieved documents to the input for the frozen black-box LM. This simple design can be easily applied to any existing retrieval and language models. Furthermore, we show that the LM can be used to supervise the retrieval model, which can then find documents that help the LM make better predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that REPLUG with the tuned retriever significantly improves the performance of GPT-3 (175B) on language modeling by 6.3%, as well as the performance of Codex on five-shot MMLU by 5.1%."}}

Previous work has shown that scaling the number of training tasks is the key component in making stronger MT LMs. In this work, we report an unexpected finding that an expert LM fine-tuned on just a single task can outperform an MT LM trained with 300+ different tasks on 11 different unseen datasets and on 13 datasets of the BIG-bench benchmark by a mean accuracy of 3.20% and 1.29%, respectively. This finding casts doubt on the previously held belief that simply scaling the number of tasks makes stronger MT LMs. Leveraging this finding, we further show that this distributed approach of training a separate expert LM per training task instead of a single MT LM for zero-shot inference possesses many benefits including (1) avoiding negative task transfer that often occurs during instruction tuning, (2) being able to continually learn new tasks without having to re-train on previous tasks to avoid catastrophic forgetting, and (3) showing compositional capabilities when merging individual experts together.

By highlighting a critical limitation of existing LMs and methods, we urge the community to develop new approaches to developing LMs that actually follow the given instructions in order to prevent catastrophic consequences that may occur if we prematurely endow LMs with real-world responsibilities."}}

The bi-encoder approach maps the document and query embeddings to common vector space and performs a nearest neighbor search. It stably shows high performance and efficiency across different domains but has an embedding space bottleneck as it interacts in L2 or inner product space. The generative retrieval model retrieves by generating a target sequence and overcomes the embedding space bottleneck by interacting in the parametric space. However, it fails to retrieve the information it has not seen during the training process as it depends solely on the information encoded in its own model parameters. To leverage the advantages of both approaches, we propose Contextualized Generative Retrieval model, which uses contextualized embeddings (output embeddings of a language model encoder) as vocab embeddings at the decoding step of generative retrieval. The model uses information encoded in both the non-parametric space of contextualized token embeddings and the parametric space of the generative retrieval model. Our approach of generative retrieval with contextualized vocab embeddings shows higher performance than generative retrieval with only vanilla vocab embeddings in the document retrieval task, an average of 6% higher performance in KILT (NQ, TQA) and 2X higher in NQ-320k, suggesting the benefits of using contextualized embedding in generative retrieval models."}}
