Most prominent work in this area focuses on learning controllers or policies that either operate on visual observations or state estimates derived from vision. However, such methods perform poorly on fine-grained manipulation tasks that require reasoning about contact forces or about objects occluded by the hand itself. In this work, we present T-Dex, a new approach for tactile-based dexterity, that operates in two phases. In the first phase, we collect 2.5 hours of play data, which is used to train self-supervised tactile encoders. This is necessary to bring high-dimensional tactile readings to a lower-dimensional embedding. In the second phase, given a handful of demonstrations for a dexterous task, we learn non-parametric policies that combine the tactile observations with visual ones. Across five challenging dexterous tasks, we show that our tactile-based dexterity models outperform purely vision and torque-based models by an average of 1.7X.\nFinally, we provide a detailed analysis on factors critical to T-Dex including the importance of play data, architectures, and representation learning."}}

Perhaps one of the most powerful techniques to learn complex manipulation strategies is imitation learning. However, collecting and learning from demonstrations in dexterous manipulation is quite challenging. The complex, high-dimensional action-space involved with multi-finger control often leads to poor sample efficiency of learning-based methods. In this work, we propose `Dexterous Imitation Made Easy' (DIME) a new imitation learning framework for dexterous manipulation. DIME only requires a single RGB camera to observe a human operator and teleoperate our robotic hand. Once demonstrations are collected, DIME employs standard imitation learning methods to train dexterous manipulation policies. On both simulation and real robot benchmarks we demonstrate that DIME can be used to solve complex, in-hand manipulation tasks such as `flipping', `spinning', and `rotating' objects with the Allegro hand."}}

However, a naive application of Bayesian methods in non-stationary environments leads to slow adaptation and results in state estimates that may converge confidently to the wrong parameter value. A common solution when learning in changing environments is to discard/downweight past data; however, this simple mechanism of \"forgetting\" fails to account for the fact that many real-world environments involve revisiting similar states. We propose a new framework, Bayes with Adaptive Memory (BAM), that takes advantage of past experience by allowing the agent to choose which past observations to remember and which to forget. We demonstrate that BAM generalizes many popular Bayesian update rules for non-stationary environments. Through a variety of experiments, we demonstrate the ability of BAM to continuously adapt in an ever-changing world."}}

In realistic scenarios, dynamics are non-stationary and the causal variables such as environment parameters cannot necessarily be precisely measured or inferred, even during training. We propose Implicit Identification for Dynamics Adaptation (IIDA), a simple method to allow predictive models to adapt to changing environment dynamics. IIDA assumes no access to the true variations in the world and instead implicitly infers properties of the environment from a small amount of contextual data. We demonstrate IIDA's ability to perform well in unseen environments through a suite of simulated experiments on MuJoCo environments and a real robot dynamic sliding task. In general, IIDA significantly reduces model error and results in higher task performance over commonly used methods. Our code, video of the method, and latest paper is available here https://bennevans.github.io/icra-iida/"}}
