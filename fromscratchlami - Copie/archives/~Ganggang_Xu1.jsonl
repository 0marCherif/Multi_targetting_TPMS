A novel nonparametric approach is developed to efficiently and consistently estimate the covariance functions of the latent Gaussian processes at all levels. To predict the functional principal component scores, we propose a consistent estimation procedure by maximizing the conditional likelihood of super-positions of point processes. We further extend our procedure to the bivariate point process case in which potential correlations between the processes can be assessed. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are investigated, and the effectiveness of our procedures is illustrated through a simulation study and an application to a stock trading dataset."}}

The constructions of the proposed indexes are based on the Mallow\u2019s distance and can be easily computed using MCMC samples for univariate or multivariate posterior distributions. Consequently, the proposed indexes can serve as meaningful and useful exploratory tools to better understand the roles played by the priors in a hierarchical model, including their influences on the posteriors that are used to make statistical inferences. These relationships are otherwise ambiguous. The proposed methods can be applied to both the continuous and binary outcome variables. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be easily adapted to various settings of clinical trials, where Bayesian hierarchical models are deem appropriate. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using extensive simulation studies and a real data example."}}

In this paper, we propose a nonparametric testing procedure based on quantized samples. In contrast to the classic nonparametric approach, our method lives on a coarse grid of sample information and are simple-to-use. Under mild technical conditions, we establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed procedures including asymptotic null distribution of the quantization test statistic as well as its minimax power optimality. Concrete quantizers are constructed for achieving the minimax optimality in practical use. Simulation results and a real data analysis are provided to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed test. Our work bridges the classical nonparametric inference to modern lossy data setting."}}

However, two long standing challenges associated with this distribution family have remained unsolved until this day: how to find an optimal estimation procedure and how to make valid statistical inference on unknown parameters. To overcome these two challenges, a computationally efficient estimation procedure based on maximizing an approximated likelihood function of Tukey\u2019s g -and- h distribution is proposed and is shown to have the same estimation efficiency as the maximum likelihood estimator under mild conditions. The asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimator is derived and a series of approximated likelihood ratio test statistics are developed to conduct hypothesis tests involving two shape parameters of Tukey\u2019s g -and- h distribution. Simulation examples and an analysis of air pollution data are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation and testing procedures."}}
