Case studies from the past show that seismic activity may lead to changes in the local geomagnetic and ionospheric field, which may operate as potential precursors and postcursors to large-magnitude earthquakes. However, detailed and data-driven research has yet to support the existence of precursors and postcursors. This work makes an attempt to build data-driven deep learning networks that can learn the temporal changes in geophysical phenomena before and after large magnitude earthquake events. First, we do numerous experiments using various machine learning and deep learning models, but none of them are sufficiently generalizable to forecast earthquakes from potential precursors. Our negative findings may make sense as there is not any conclusive and comprehensive evidence yet supporting the existence of earthquake precursors. We, therefore consider detecting earthquakes from postcursors data to spot potential pitfalls and outline the scope of possibility. Our tests indicate that while detecting earthquakes from postcursor data might be promising, it would fall short. Poor performance could be brought on by a lack of data and extremely complex relationships. However, we are leaving room for future research with deeper networks and data augmentation. "}}

We address this issue by introducing a shortwave-infrared (SWIR) band where clouds are highly reflective, and snow is absorptive. As SWIR is typically of a lower resolution compared to VNIR, this study proposes a multiresolution fully convolutional neural network (FCN) that can effectively detect clouds and snow in VNIR images. We fuse the multiresolution bands within a deep FCN and perform semantic segmentation at the higher, VNIR resolution. Such a fusion-based classifier, trained in an end-to-end manner, achieved 94.31% overall accuracy and an F1 score of 97.67% for clouds on Resourcesat-2 data captured over the state of Uttarakhand, India. These scores were found to be 30% higher than a Random Forest classifier, and 10% higher than a standalone single-resolution FCN. Apart from being useful for cloud detection purposes, the study also highlights the potential of convolutional neural networks for multi-sensor fusion problems."}}

The newly open water resulted from sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice variations using three distinct data-driven causality approaches that have been proposed recently: Temporal Causality Discovery Framework Non-combinatorial Optimization via Trace Exponential and Augmented lagrangian for Structure learning (NOTEARS) and Directed Acyclic Graph-Graph Neural Networks (DAG-GNN). We apply these three algorithms to 39\u00a0years of historical time-series data sets, which include 11 atmospheric variables from ERA-5 reanalysis product and passive microwave satellite retrieved sea ice extent. By comparing the causality graph results of these approaches with what we summarized from the literature, it shows that the static graphs produced by NOTEARS and DAG-GNN are relatively reasonable. The results from NOTEARS indicate that relative humidity and precipitation dominate sea ice changes among all variables, while the results from DAG-GNN suggest that the horizontal and meridional wind are more important for driving sea ice variations. However, both approaches produce some unrealistic cause-effect relationships. Additionally, these three methods cannot well detect the delayed impact of one vari..."}}

Assessment of this reduction and its causes is required to project future ice mass loss. Annual snow accumulation is an important component of the surface mass balance of ice sheets. While in situ snow accumulation measurements are temporally and spatially limited due to their high cost, airborne radar sounders can achieve ice sheet wide coverage by capturing and tracking annual snow layers in the radar images or echograms. In this paper, we use deep learning to uniquely identify the position of each annual snow layer in the Snow Radar echograms taken across different regions over the Greenland ice sheet. We train with more than 15,000 images generated from radar echograms and estimate the thickness of each snow layer within a mean absolute error of 0.54 to 7.28 pixels, depending on dataset. A highly precise snow layer thickness can help improve weather models and, thus, support glaciological studies. Such a well-trained deep learning model can be used with ever-growing datasets to aid in the accurate assessment of snow accumulation on the dynamically changing ice sheets."}}

There is a large amount of heterogeneous radar data from the polar regions that have been gathered through expensive missions. However, retrieving meaningful information from this large volume of data is still a great challenge. With the advancement of machine learning techniques in recent years, many scientists are eager to take advantage of these algorithms and techniques to explore and mine Arctic and Antarctic data. These advancements, however, have happened mainly in the area of supervised learning where the models are data hungry and require large amounts of annotated data. Generating simulated data can be an effective and inexpensive approach to provide large labeled datasets for training machine learning models. In this work, we explore two approaches to simulate arctic snow radar echogram images, namely a radar scattering physics based approach combined with some statistical measures and a purely data-driven approach based on a conditional generative adversarial network. Using several image comparison metrics, we analyze the utility of both methods for the purpose of simulating echograms. Our results show that the physics simulator generates images with good structural similarities, while the purely data-driven approach achieves better textural similarities for simulated image. Finally, we also show that by augmenting our real dataset by the simulated echograms, we can improve our deep learning model for tracking internal layers of snow."}}

Although popular computer vision datasets like Cityscapes, MS-COCO, PASCAL provide good benchmarks for several tasks (e.g. image classification, segmentation, object detection), these datasets are hardly suitable for post disaster damage assessments. On the other hand, existing natural disaster datasets include mainly satellite imagery which has low spatial resolution and a high revisit period. Therefore, they do not have a scope to provide quick and efficient damage assessment tasks. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can effortlessly access difficult places during any disaster and collect high resolution imagery that is required for aforementioned tasks of computer vision. To address these issues we present a high resolution UAV imagery, FloodNet, captured after the hurricane Harvey. This dataset demonstrates the post flooded damages of the affected areas. The images are labeled pixel-wise for semantic segmentation task and questions are produced for the task of visual question answering. FloodNet poses several challenges including detection of flooded roads and buildings and distinguishing between natural water and flooded water. With the advancement of deep learning algorithms, we can analyze the impact of any disaster which can make a precise understanding of the affected areas. In this paper, we compare and contrast the performances of baseline methods for image classification, semantic segmentation, and visual question answering on our dataset.

Real time assessment of this reduction is required so as to monitor its global climatic impact. In this paper, we introduce a novel way of estimating the thickness of each internal ice layer using Snow Radar images and Fully Convolutional Networks. The estimated thickness can be used to understand snow accumulation each year. To understand the depth and structure of each internal ice layer, we perform multiclass semantic segmentation on radar images, which hasn't been performed before. As the radar images lack good training labels, we carry out a pre-processing technique to get a clean set of labels. After detecting each ice layer uniquely, we calculate its thickness and compare it with the processed ground truth. This is the first time that each ice layer is detected separately and its thickness calculated through automated techniques. Through this procedure we were able to estimate the ice-layer thicknesses within a Mean Absolute Error of approximately 3.6 pixels. Such a Deep Learning based method can be used with ever-increasing datasets to make accurate assessments for cryospheric studies."}}
