These diffusion bridges are particularly useful for image restoration, as the degraded images are structurally informative priors for reconstructing the clean images. I$^2$SB belongs to a tractable class of Schr\\\"odinger bridge, the nonlinear extension to score-based models, whose marginal distributions can be computed analytically given boundary pairs. This results in a simulation-free framework for nonlinear diffusions, where the I$^2$SB training becomes scalable by adopting practical techniques used in standard diffusion models. We validate I$^2$SB in solving various image restoration tasks, including inpainting, super-resolution, deblurring, and JPEG restoration on ImageNet 256x256 and show that I$^2$SB surpasses standard conditional diffusion models with more interpretable generative processes. Moreover, I$^2$SB matches the performance of inverse methods that additionally require the knowledge of the corruption operators. Our work opens up new algorithmic opportunities for developing efficient nonlinear diffusion models on a large scale. scale. Project page and codes: https://i2sb.github.io/"}}

Our algorithm outperforms baselines significantly, as evidenced by experiments for synthetic datasets and a real-world single-cell RNA sequence dataset. Additionally, the proposed approach can reasonably reconstruct the evolution of velocity distribution, from position snapshots only, when there is a ground truth velocity that is nevertheless inaccessible."}}

Since their training already involves expensive gradient computation by solving a backward ODE, deriving efficient second-order methods becomes highly nontrivial. Nevertheless, inspired by the recent Optimal Control (OC) interpretation of training deep networks, we show that a specific continuous-time OC methodology, called Differential Programming, can be adopted to derive backward ODEs for higher-order derivatives at the same O(1) memory cost. We further explore a low-rank representation of the second-order derivatives and show that it leads to efficient preconditioned updates with the aid of Kronecker-based factorization. The resulting method \u2013 named SNOpt \u2013 converges much faster than first-order baselines in wall-clock time, and the improvement remains consistent across various applications, e.g. image classification, generative flow, and time-series prediction. Our framework also enables direct architecture optimization, such as the integration time of Neural ODEs, with second-order feedback policies, strengthening the OC perspective as a principled tool of analyzing optimization in deep learning.
