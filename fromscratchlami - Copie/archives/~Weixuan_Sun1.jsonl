However, its central component, softmax attention, prohibits vision transformers from scaling up to high-resolution images, due to both the computational complexity and memory footprint being quadratic. Although linear attention was introduced in natural language processing (NLP) tasks to mitigate a similar issue, directly applying existing linear attention to vision transformers may not lead to satisfactory results. We investigate this problem and find that computer vision tasks focus more on local information compared with NLP tasks. Based on this observation, we present a Vicinity Attention that introduces a locality bias to vision transformers with linear complexity. Specifically, for each image patch, we adjust its attention weight based on its 2D Manhattan distance measured by its neighbouring patches. In this case, the neighbouring patches will receive stronger attention than far-away patches. Moreover, since our Vicinity Attention requires the token length to be much larger than the feature dimension to show its efficiency advantages, we further propose a new Vicinity Vision Transformer (VVT) structure to reduce the feature dimension without degenerating the accuracy. We perform extensive experiments on the CIFAR100, ImageNet1K, and ADE20K datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method. Our method has a slower growth rate of GFlops than previous transformer-based and convolution-based networks when the input resolution increases. In particular, our approach achieves state-of-the-art image classification accuracy with 50% fewer parameters than previous methods.Vicinity Vision Transformer"}}

However, they usually suffer from degraded performances on various tasks and corpus. In this paper, we examine existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify two key issues that lead to such performance gaps: 1) unbounded gradients in the attention computation adversely impact the convergence of linear transformer models; 2) attention dilution which trivially distributes attention scores over long sequences while neglecting neighbouring structures. To address these issues, we first identify that the scaling of attention matrices is the devil in unbounded gradients, which turns out unnecessary in linear attention as we show theoretically and empirically. To this end, we propose a new linear attention that replaces the scaling operation with a normalization to stabilize gradients. For the issue of attention dilution, we leverage a diagonal attention to confine attention to only neighbouring tokens in early layers. Benefiting from the stable gradients and improved attention, our new linear transformer model, transNormer, demonstrates superior performance on text classification and language modeling tasks, as well as on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark, surpassing vanilla transformer and existing linear variants by a clear margin while being significantly more space-time efficient.

Recently, the transformer-based models have shown strong performance on various sequence modeling tasks, which rely on attention to capture pairwise token relations, and position embedding to inject positional information. While showing good performance, the transformer models are inefficient to scale to long input sequences, mainly due to the quadratic space-time complexity of attention. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose to model sequences with a relative position encoded Toeplitz matrix and use a Toeplitz matrix-vector production trick to reduce the space-time complexity of the sequence modeling to log linear. A lightweight sub-network called relative position encoder is proposed to generate relative position coefficients with a fixed budget of parameters, enabling the proposed Toeplitz neural network to deal with varying sequence lengths. In addition, despite being trained on 512-token sequences, our model can extrapolate input sequence length up to 14K tokens in inference with consistent performance. Extensive experiments on autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling, image modeling, and the challenging Long-range Arena Benchmark show that our method achieves better performance than its competitors in most downstream tasks while being significantly faster."}}

However, the existing encoding methods of a vanilla transformer are not always directly applicable to a linear transformer, because the latter requires a decomposition of the query and key representations into separate kernel functions. Nevertheless, principles to design encoding methods suitable for linear transformers remain under-studied. In this work, we put together a variety of existing encoding methods under a canonical form and further propose a family of relative positional encodings via unitary transformation. Our formulation leads to a principled framework that can be used to develop new relative positional encoding methods that preserve linear space-time complexity. Equipping with different parameters, the proposed unitary relative positional encoding family (URPE) derives effective encoding for various applications. Experiments show that compared with existing encoding methods, unitary encoding achieves competitive performance on language modeling and various challenging downstream tasks, such as machine translation and text classification. In the meantime, it highlights a general paradigm to design broadly more relative positional encoding methods, applicable inclusively to linear and vanilla transformers."}}

Some studies alleviate the computational costs by reducing the number of tokens attended in attention calculation, but the complexity is still quadratic. Another promising way is to replace Softmax attention with linear attention, which owns linear complexity but presents a clear performance drop. We find that such a drop in linear attention results from the lack of attention concentration to critical features. Therefore, we propose a feature fixation module to reweight feature importance of the query and key prior to computing linear attention. Specifically, we regard the query, key, and value as latent representations of the input token, and learn the feature fixation ratio by aggregating Query-Key-Value information. This is beneficial for measuring the feature importance comprehensively. Furthermore, we improve the feature fixation by neighborhood association, which leverages additional guidance from spatial and temporal neighboring tokens. Our proposed method significantly improves the linear attention baseline, and achieves state-of-the-art performance among linear video Transformers on three popular video classification benchmarks. Our performance is even comparable to some quadratic Transformers with fewer parameters and higher efficiency."}}

As CAMs only highlight the most discriminative regions of objects, the generated pseudo labels are usually unsatisfactory to serve directly as supervision. To solve this, most existing approaches follow a multi-training pipeline to refine CAMs for better pseudo-labels, which includes: 1) re-training the classification model to generate CAMs; 2) post-processing CAMs to obtain pseudo labels; and 3) training a semantic segmentation model with the obtained pseudo labels. However, this multi-training pipeline requires complicated adjustment and additional time. To address this, we propose a class-conditional inference strategy and an activation aware mask refinement loss function to generate better pseudo labels without retraining the classifier. The class conditional inference-time approach is presented to separately and iteratively reveal the classification network\u2019s hidden object activation to generate more complete response maps. Further, our activation aware mask refinement loss function introduces a novel way to exploit saliency maps during segmentation training and refine the foreground object masks without suppressing background objects.
