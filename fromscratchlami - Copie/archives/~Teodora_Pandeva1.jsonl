We transform this problem into a noisy multiview independent component analysis (ICA) task by assuming that each observed dataset (view)  is a  linear mixture of independent latent biological processes. Furthermore, we assume that each view contains  a mixture of shared and individual sources. To computationally estimate the sources, we optimize a constrained form of the joint log-likelihood of the observed data among all views.  Finally, we apply the proposed model in a challenging real-life application, where the estimated shared sources from two large transcriptome datasets (observed data) provided by two different labs (two different views) lead to a more plausible representation of the underlying graph structure than existing baselines."}}

We investigate the special setting of noisy linear ICA, referred to as ShIndICA,  where the observations are split among different views, each receiving a mixture of shared and individual sources. We prove that the corresponding linear structure is identifiable and the sources distribution can be recovered. To computationally estimate the sources, we optimize a constrained form of the joint log-likelihood of the observed data among all views. Furthermore, we propose a model selection procedure for recovering the number of shared sources. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the advantages of our model over baselines. We apply  ShIndICA in a challenging real-life task, using three transcriptome datasets provided by three different labs (three different views). The recovered sources were used for a downstream graph inference task, facilitating the discovery of a plausible representation of the data's underlying graph structure."}}

Unfortunately, they are also known for having an unstable training process and might loose parts of the data distribution for heterogeneous input data. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN extension for multi-modal distribution learning (MMGAN). In our approach, we model the latent space as a Gaussian mixture model with a number of clusters referring to the number of disconnected data manifolds in the observation space, and include a clustering network, which relates each data manifold to one Gaussian cluster. Thus, the training gets more stable. Moreover, MMGAN allows for clustering real data according to the learned data manifold in the latent space. By a series of benchmark experiments, we illustrate that MMGAN outperforms competitive state-of-the-art models in terms of clustering performance."}}
