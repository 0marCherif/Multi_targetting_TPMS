Although the GFLOPs of a vision transformer can be decreased by reducing the number of tokens in the network, there is no setting that is optimal for all input images. In this work, we therefore introduce a differentiable parameter-free Adaptive Token Sampler (ATS) module, which can be plugged into any existing vision transformer architecture. ATS empowers vision transformers by scoring and adaptively sampling significant tokens. As a result, the number of tokens is not constant anymore and varies for each input image. By integrating ATS as an additional layer within the current transformer blocks, we can convert them into much more efficient vision transformers with an adaptive number of tokens. Since ATS is a parameter-free module, it can be added to the off-the-shelf pre-trained vision transformers as a plug and play module, thus reducing their GFLOPs without any additional training. Moreover, due to its differentiable design, one can also train a vision transformer equipped with ATS. We evaluate the efficiency of our module in both image and video classification tasks by adding it to multiple SOTA vision transformers. Our proposed module improves the SOTA by reducing their computational costs (GFLOPs) by 2\n, while preserving their accuracy on the ImageNet, Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets.

As their design is quite different compared to CNNs, it is interesting to study if transformers are vulnerable to backdoor attacks and how different transformer architectures affect attack success rates. Backdoor attacks happen when an attacker poisons a small part of the training images with a specific trigger or backdoor which will be activated later. The model performance is good on clean test images, but the attacker can manipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger on an image at test time. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of state-of-the-art architectures through the lens of backdoor robustness, specifically how attention mechanisms affect robustness. We show that the popular vision transformer architecture (ViT) is the least robust architecture and ResMLP, which belongs to a class called Feed Forward Networks (FFN), is the most robust one to backdoor attacks among state-of-the-art architectures. We also find an intriguing difference between transformers and CNNs \u2013 interpretation algorithms effectively highlight the trigger on test images for transformers but not for CNNs. Based on this observation, we find that a test-time image blocking defense reduces the attack success rate by a large margin for transformers. We also show that such blocking mechanisms can be incorporated during the training process to improve robustness even further. We believe our experimental findings will encourage the community to understand the building block components in  developing novel architectures robust to backdoor attacks."}}

Some recent self-supervised learning methods like mean-shift (MSF) cluster images by pulling the embedding of a query image to be closer to its nearest neighbors (NNs). Since most NNs are close to the query by design, the averaging may not affect the embedding of the query much. On the other hand, far away NNs may not be semantically related to the query. We generalize the mean-shift idea by constraining the search space of NNs using another source of knowledge so that NNs are far from the query while still being semantically related. We show that our method (1) outperforms MSF in SSL setting when the constraint utilizes a different augmentation of an image from the previous epoch, and (2) outperforms PAWS in semi-supervised setting with less training resources when the constraint ensures that the NNs have the same pseudo-label as the query.

However, it is shown that such explanations are not always consistent with human priors, such as consistency across image transformations. Given an interpretation algorithm, e.g., Grad-CAM, we introduce a novel training method to train the model to produce more consistent explanations. Since obtaining the ground truth for a desired model interpretation is not a well-defined task, we adopt ideas from contrastive self-supervised learning, and apply them to the interpretations of the model rather than its embeddings. We show that our method, Contrastive Grad-CAM Consistency (CGC), results in Grad-CAM interpretation heatmaps that are more consistent with human annotations while still achieving comparable classification accuracy. Moreover, our method acts as a regularizer and improves the accuracy on limited-data, fine-grained classification settings. In addition, because our method does not rely on annotations, it allows for the incorporation of unlabeled data into training, which enables better generalization of the model.

State-of-the-art self-supervised methods for learning representations from images (e.g., MoCo, BYOL, MSF) use an inductive bias that random augmentations (e.g., random crops) of an image should produce similar embeddings. We show that such methods are vulnerable to backdoor attacks - where an attacker poisons a small part of the unlabeled data by adding a trigger (image patch chosen by the attacker) to the images. The model performance is good on clean test images, but the attacker can manipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger at test time. Backdoor attacks have been studied extensively in supervised learning and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study them for self-supervised learning. Backdoor attacks are more practical in self-supervised learning, since the use of large unlabeled data makes data inspection to remove poisons prohibitive. We show that in our targeted attack, the attacker can produce many false positives for the target category by using the trigger at test time. We also propose a defense method based on knowledge distillation that succeeds in neutralizing the attack. Our code is available here: https://github.com/UMBCvisionISSL-Backdoor"}}

We show that with simple changes to the network architecture, regression can outperform more complex state-of-the-art approaches for knowledge distillation from self-supervised models. Surprisingly, the addition of a multi-layer perceptron head to the CNN backbone is beneficial even if used only during distillation and discarded in the downstream task. Deeper non-linear projections can thus be used to accurately mimic the teacher without changing inference architecture and time. Moreover, we utilize independent projection heads to simultaneously distill multiple teacher networks. We also find that using the same weakly augmented image as input for both teacher and student networks aids distillation. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed changes in various self-supervised distillation settings."}}

This additional knowledge may come from annotated labels in the supervised setting or an SSL model from another modality in the SSL setting. Our main idea is to generalize the mean-shift algorithm by constraining the search space of nearest neighbors, resulting in semantically purer representations.\nOur method simply pulls the embedding of an instance closer to its nearest neighbors in a search space that is constrained using the additional knowledge. By leveraging this non-contrastive loss, we show that the supervised ImageNet-1k pretraining with our method results in better transfer performance as compared to the baselines. Further, we demonstrate that our method is relatively robust to label noise. Finally, we show that it is possible to use the noisy constraint across modalities to train self-supervised video models."}}
