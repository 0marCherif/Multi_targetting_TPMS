To remedy this limitation, new approaches suggest solutions based on citizen science that requires active participation. In contrast, as a non-traditional data source, social media has been increasingly used in many disaster response and management studies in recent years. Inspired by this trend, we propose to capitalize on social media data to mine landslide-related information automatically with the help of artificial intelligence techniques. Specifically, we develop a state-of-the-art computer vision model to detect landslides in social media image streams in real-time. To that end, we first create a large landslide image dataset labeled by experts with a data-centric perspective, and then, conduct extensive model training experiments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model can be deployed in an online fashion to support global landslide susceptibility maps and emergency response."}}

While disaster management efforts were taken, crisis responders struggled to understand the country-wide flood extent, population exposure, urgent needs of affected people, and various types of damage. To tackle this challenge, we leverage remote and social sensing with geospatial data using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for text and image processing. Our satellite-based analysis over a one-month period (25 Aug\u201325 Sep) revealed that 11.48% of Pakistan was inundated. When combined with geospatial data, this meant 18.9 million people were at risk across 160 districts in Pakistan, with adults constituting 50% of the exposed population. Our social sensing data analysis surfaced 106.7k reports pertaining to deaths, injuries, and concerns of the affected people. To understand the urgent needs of the affected population, we analyzed tweet texts and found that South Karachi, Chitral and North Waziristan required the most basic necessities like food and shelter. Further analysis of tweet images revealed that Lasbela, Rajanpur, and Jhal Magsi had the highest damage reports normalized by their population. These damage reports were found to correlate strongly with affected people reports and need reports, achieving an R-Square of 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. Our extensive study shows that combining remote sensing, social sensing, and geospatial data can provide accurate and timely information during a disaster event, which is crucial in prioritizing areas for immediate and gradual response."}}

To monitor public adherence, researchers aimed to rapidly develop efficient systems that can detect faces with masks automatically. However, the lack of representative and novel datasets proved to be the biggest challenge. Early attempts to collect face mask datasets did not account for potential race, gender, and age biases. Therefore, the resulting models show inherent biases toward specific race groups, such as Asian or Caucasian. In this work, we present a novel face mask detection dataset that contains images posted on Twitter during the pandemic from around the world. Unlike previous datasets, the proposed Bias-Aware Face Mask Detection (BAFMD) dataset contains more images from underrepresented race and age groups to mitigate the problem for the face mask detection task. We perform experiments to investigate potential biases in widely used face mask detection datasets and illustrate that the BAFMD dataset yields models with better performance and generalization ability. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/Alpkant/BAFMD."}}

This time-critical task, when performed using traditional approaches such as experts surveying the disaster areas, poses serious challenges and delays response. This paper presents an AI-based system that leverages citizen science to collect damage images reported on social media and perform rapid damage assessment in real-time. Several image processing models in the system tackle non-trivial challenges posed by social media as a data source, such as high-volume of redundant and irrelevant content. The system determines the severity of damage using a state-of-the-art computer vision model. Together with a response organization in the US, we deployed the system to identify damage reports during a major real-world disaster. We observe that almost 42% of the images are unique, 28% relevant, and more importantly, only 10% of them contain either mild or severe damage. Experts from our partner organization provided feedback on the system's mistakes, which we used to perform additional experiments to retrain the models. Consequently, the retrained models based on expert feedback on the target domain data helped us achieve significant performance improvements."}}

The widespread usage of social networking sites, especially during mass convergence events, such as health emergencies, provides instant access to citizen-generated data offering rich information about public opinions, sentiments, and situational updates useful for authorities to gain insights. We offer a large-scale social sensing dataset comprising two billion multilingual tweets posted from 218 countries by 87 million users in 67 languages. We used state-of-the-art machine learning models to enrich the data with sentiment labels and named-entities. Additionally, a gender identification approach is proposed to segregate user gender. Furthermore, a geolocalization approach is devised to geotag tweets at country, state, county, and city granularities, enabling a myriad of data analysis tasks to understand real-world issues at national and sub-national levels. We believe this multilingual data with broader geographical and longer temporal coverage will be a cornerstone for researchers to study impacts of the ongoing global health catastrophe and to manage adverse consequences related to people\u2019s health, livelihood, and social well-being."}}
