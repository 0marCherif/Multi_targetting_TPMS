We show that our algorithm enjoys the $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{K \\epsilon^2})$ per-agent sample complexity for general nonconvex bilevel optimization and $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{K \\epsilon})$ for Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz objective, achieving a speedup that scales linearly with the network size $K$. The sample complexities are optimal in both $\\epsilon$ and $K$.\nWe test our algorithm on the examples of hyperparameter tuning and decentralized reinforcement learning. Simulated experiments confirmed that our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art training efficiency and test accuracy."}}

In this paper, we address both problems in a joint manner by recovering an ideal affinity tensor from an imperfect input. By taking into account the relationship of the affinities induced by the cluster structures, we are able to significantly improve the affinity input, such as repairing those entries corrupted by gross outliers. More importantly, the recovered ideal affinity tensor also directly indicates the number of clusters and their membership, thus solving the model selection and clustering jointly. To enforce the requisite global consistency in the affinities demanded by the cluster structure, we impose a number of constraints, specifically, among others, the tensor should be low rank and sparse, and it should obey what we call the rank-1 sum constraint. To solve this highly non-smooth and non-convex problem, we exploit the mathematical structures, and express the original problem in an equivalent form amenable for numerical optimization and convergence analysis. To scale to large problem sizes, we also propose an alternative formulation, so that those problems can be efficiently solved via stochastic optimization in an online fashion. We evaluate our algorithm with different applications to demonstrate its superiority, and show it can adapt to a large variety of settings."}}

We consider this problem in the domain where the affinity relations involve groups of more than two nodes. Building on the previous formulation for the pairwise affinity case, we exploit the mathematical structures in the higher order case. We express the original minimal-rank and positive semi-definite (PSD) constraints in a form amenable for numerical implementation, as the original constraints are either intractable or even undefined in general in the higher order case. To scale to large problem sizes, we also propose an alternative formulation, so that it can be efficiently solved via stochastic optimization in an online fashion. We evaluate our algorithm with different applications to demonstrate its superiority, and show it can adapt to varying levels of unbalancedness of clusters."}}
