AlphaZero masters playing without human knowledge, while MuZero also learns the game rules and environment's dynamics without the access to a simulator during planning, which makes it applicable to complex environments. Both algorithms adopt Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) during self-play, usually using hundreds of simulations for one move. For stochasticity, Stochastic MuZero was proposed to learn a stochastic model and uses the learned model to perform the tree search. Recently, Gumbel MuZero was proposed to ensure the policy improvement and can thus learn reliably with a small number of simulations. However, Gumbel MuZero used a deterministic model as in MuZero, limiting its performance in stochastic environments. In this paper, we propose to combine Gumbel MuZero and Stochastic MuZero, the first attempt to apply Gumbel MuZero to a stochastic environment. Our experiment on the stochastic puzzle game 2048 demonstrates that the combined algorithm can perform well and achieve an average score of 394,645 with only 3 simulations during training, greatly reducing the computational resource needed for training."}}

An example that is well-studied is the category of life-and-death (L&D) problems for Go, which helps players hone their skill of identifying region safety. Many previous methods like lambda search try null moves first, then derive so-called relevance zones (RZs), outside of which the opponent does not need to search. This paper first proposes a novel RZ-based approach, called the RZ-Based Search (RZS), to solving L&D problems for Go. RZS tries moves before determining whether they are null moves post-hoc. This means we do not need to rely on null move heuristics, resulting in a more elegant algorithm, so that it can also be seamlessly incorporated into AlphaZero's super-human level play in our solver. To repurpose AlphaZero for solving, we also propose a new training method called Faster to Life (FTL), which modifies AlphaZero to entice it to win more quickly. We use RZS and FTL to solve L&D problems on Go, namely solving 68 among 106 problems from a professional L&D book while a previous state-of-the-art program TSUMEGO-EXPLORER solves 11 only. Finally, we discuss that the approach is generic in the sense that RZS is applicable to solving many other goal-achieving problems for board games."}}

An RZT stores exact game values for patterns that are discovered during a Relevance-Zone-Based Search (RZS), which is the current state-of-the-art in solving L&D problems in Go. Positions that share the same pattern can reuse the same exact game value in the RZT. The pattern matching scheme for RZTs is implemented using a radix tree, taking into consideration patterns with different shapes. To improve the efficiency of table lookups, we designed a heuristic that prevents redundant lookups. The heuristic can safely skip previously queried patterns for a given position, reducing the overhead to 10% of the original cost. We also analyze the time complexity of the RZT both theoretically and empirically. Experiments show the overhead of traversing the radix tree in practice during lookup remain flat logarithmically in relation to the number of entries stored in the table. Experiments also show that the use of an RZT instead of a traditional transposition table significantly reduces the number of searched nodes on two data sets of 7x7 and 19x19 L&D Go problems."}}

When more simulations are executed, MCTS can achieve higher performance but also requires enormous amounts of CPU and GPU resources. However, not all states require a long searching time to identify the best action that the agent can find. For example, in 19x19 Go and NoGo, we found that for more than half of the states, the best action predicted by DNN remains unchanged even after searching 2 minutes. This implies that a significant amount of resources can be saved if we are able to stop the searching earlier when we are confident with the current searching result. In this paper, we propose to achieve this goal by predicting the uncertainty of the current searching status and use the result to decide whether we should stop searching. With our algorithm, called Dynamic Simulation MCTS (DS-MCTS), we can speed up a NoGo agent trained by AlphaZero 2.5 times faster while maintaining a similar winning rate, which is critical for training and conducting experiments. Also, under the same average simulation count, our method can achieve a 61\\% winning rate against the original program."}}
