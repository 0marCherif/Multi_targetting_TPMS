Within the current data selling mechanisms, data consumers have difficulties in making purchasing decisions due to uncertain IoT data quality and inflexible pricing interface. To resolve these issues, potential solutions could be to launch data demonstrations and release free sampling data to reduce the uncertainty about data quality, and to charge based on the volume of data actually used to enable flexible pricing. However, there is still no clear understanding of economic benefits of these mechanisms. In this paper, we design the optimal data selling mechanisms for IoT data exchange, and derive the following two results. First, whether to deploy a data demonstration and how much free sampling data to release depend on the extent of data consumers' inaccuracy perceptions for data quality, which varies over a wide range in IoT applications. We found that the data vendor has no incentive to conduct these strategies if data consumers extremely overestimate data quality. Second, although flexible data pricing mechanisms provide convenience for real-time and streaming IoT data exchange, it brings less economic benefits to the data vendor compared with the fixed pricing scheme, which sells the whole data set with a fixed price. We evaluate the optimal selling mechanisms on a real-world Taxi GPS data set, and evaluation results verify the insights derived from our theoretical analysis."}}

Online Data Selection for Federated Learning with Limited Storage", "abstract": "Machine learning models have been deployed in mobile networks to deal with massive data from different layers to enable automated network management and intelligence on devices. To overcome high communication cost and severe privacy concerns of centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to achieve distributed machine learning among networked devices. While the computation and communication limitation has been widely studied, the impact of on-device storage on the performance of FL is still not explored. Without an effective data selection policy to filter the massive streaming data on devices, classical FL can suffer from much longer model training time (4 \u00d7) and significant inference accuracy reduction (7%), observed in our experiments. In this work, we take the first step to consider the online data selection for FL with limited on-device storage. We first define a new data valuation metric for data evaluation and selection in FL with theoretical guarantees for speeding up model convergence and enhancing final model accuracy, simultaneously. We further design ODE, a framework of Online Data sElection for FL, to coordinate networked devices to store valuable data samples. Experimental results on one industrial dataset and three public datasets show the remarkable advantages of ODE over the state-of-the-art approaches. Particularly, on the industrial dataset, ODE achieves as high as 2.5 \u00d7 speedup of training time and 6% increase in inference accuracy, and is robust to various factors in practical environments."}}

The current deployed two-stage ad auction usually retrieves an ad subset by a coarse ad quality metric in a pre-auction stage, and then determines the auction outcome by a refined metric in the subsequent stage. However, this simple and greedy solution suffers from performance degradation, as it regards the decision in each stage separately, leading to an improper ad selection metric for the pre-auction stage. In this work, we explicitly investigate the relation between the coarse and refined ad quality metrics, and design a two-stage ad auction by taking the decision interaction between the two stages into account. We decouple the design of the two-stage auction by solving a stochastic subset selection problem in the pre-auction stage and conducting a general second price (GSP) auction in the second stage. We demonstrate that this decouple still preserves the incentive compatibility of the auction mechanism. As the proposed formulation of the pre-auction stage is an NP-hard problem, we propose a scalable approximation solution by defining a new subset selection metric, namely Pre-Auction Score (PAS). Experiment results on both public and industrial dataset demonstrate the improvement on social welfare and revenue of the proposed two-stage ad auction, than the intuitive greedy two-stage auction and other baselines."}}

However, a large number of advertisers fail to achieve their desired advertising performance due to the lack of ad exposure guarantee in the dynamic advertising environment. In this work, we propose a bidding-based ad delivery algorithm for mobile livestreaming ads that can provide advertisers with bidding strategies for optimizing diverse marketing objectives under general ad performance guaranteed constraints, such as ad exposure and cost-efficiency constraints. By modeling the problem as an online integer programming and applying primal-dual theory, we can derive the bidding strategy from solving the optimal dual variables. The initialization of the dual variables is realized through a deep neural network that captures the complex relation between dual variables and dynamic advertising environments. We further propose a control-based bidding algorithm to adjust the dual variables in an online manner based on the real-time advertising performance feedback and constraints. Experiments on a real-world industrial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our bidding algorithm in terms of optimizing marketing objectives and guaranteeing ad constraints."}}

Extensive works have studied the performance guarantee of the global model, however, it is still unclear how each individual client influences the collaborative training process. In this work, we defined a new notion, called {\\em Fed-Influence}, to quantify this influence over the model parameters, and proposed an effective and efficient algorithm to estimate this metric. In particular, our design satisfies several desirable properties: (1) it requires neither retraining nor retracing, adding only linear computational overhead to clients and the server; (2) it strictly maintains the tenets of federated learning, without revealing any client's local private data; and (3) it works well on both convex and non-convex loss functions, and does not require the final model to be optimal. Empirical results on a synthetic dataset and the FEMNIST dataset demonstrate that our estimation method can approximate Fed-Influence with small bias. Further, we show an application of Fed-Influence in model debugging."}}

Age of Information (AoI), as a new metric, has received considerable attention to evaluate the performance of real-time information processing systems. In recent years, edge computing is becoming an efficient paradigm to reduce the AoI and to provide the real-time services. Considering the substantial deployment cost and the resulting resource limitation in edge computing, a proper pricing mechanism is highly necessary to fully utilize edge resources and then minimize the overall AoI of the whole system. However, there are two challenges to design this mechanism: 1) the priorities (or values) of the real-time computing tasks, critical to the efficient resource allocation, are usually private information of users and may be manipulated by selfish users for their own interests; 2) due to the time-varying property of AoI, the values of the tasks discount with time, making the traditional pricing mechanisms infeasible. In this paper, we extend the classical Myerson Theorem to the online setting with time discounting tasks values, and accordingly propose an online auction mechanism, called PreDisc, including an allocation rule and a payment rule. We leverage dynamic programming to greedily allocate resources in each time slot, and charge the winning user with a new critical price, extended from the classical Myerson payment rule. A preemption factor is further employed to make a trade-off between the newly arrived tasks and ongoing tasks. We prove that PreDisc guarantees the economic property of strategy-proofness and achieves a constant competitive ratio. We conduct extensive simulations and the results demonstrate that PreDisc outperforms the traditional mechanisms, in terms of both weighted AoI and revenue of edge service providers. Compared with the optimal solution in offline VCG mechanism, PreDisc has much lower computation complexity with only a slight performance loss."}}

In this paper, we study noisy aggregate statistics trading from the perspective of a data broker in data markets. We thus propose ERATO, which enables aggrEgate statistics pRicing over privATe cOrrelated data. On one hand, ERATO guarantees arbitrage freeness against cunning data consumers. On the other hand, ERATO compensates data owners for their privacy losses using both bottom-up and top-down designs. We further apply ERATO to three practical aggregate statistics, namely weighted sum, probability distribution fitting, and degree distribution, and extensively evaluate their performances on MovieLens dataset, 2009 RECS dataset, and two SNAP large social network datasets, respectively. Our analysis and evaluation results reveal that ERATO well balances utility and privacy, achieves arbitrage freeness, and compensates data owners more fairly than differential privacy based approaches."}}

However, most of the existing online pricing mechanisms assume buyers have fixed valuations over the time horizon, which cannot capture the dynamic nature of valuation in emerging applications. In this paper, we study the problem of revenue maximization in online auctions with unknown time discounting valuations, and model it as non-stationary multi-armed bandit optimization. We design an online pricing mechanism, namely Biased-UCB, based on unique features of the discounting valuations. We use competitive analysis to theoretically evaluate the performance guarantee of our pricing mechanism, and derive the competitive ratio. Numerical results show that our design achieves good performance in terms of revenue maximization on a real-world bidding dataset."}}
