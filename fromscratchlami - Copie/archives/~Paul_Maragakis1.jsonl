Machine learning models that can propose novel molecules with specific characteristics are powerful new tools to break through the intractability of searching chemical space. Most of these models generate molecular graphs\u2014representations that describe the topology of covalently bonded atoms in a molecule\u2014because the bonding information in the graphs is required for many downstream applications, such as virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation. These models, however, do not themselves generate 3D coordinates for the atoms within a molecule (which are also required for these applications), and thus they cannot easily incorporate information about 3D geometry when optimizing molecular properties. In this paper, we present GEN3D, a model that concurrently generates molecular graphs and 3D geometries, and is equivariant to rotations, translations, and atom permutations. The model extends a partially generated molecule by computing a conditional distribution over atom types, bonds, and spatial locations, and then sampling from that distribution to update the molecular graph and geometries, one atom at a time. We found that GEN3D proposes molecules that have much higher rates of chemical validity, and much better atom-distance distributions, than those generated with previous models. In addition, we validated our model\u2019s geometric accuracy by forcing it to predict geometries for benchmark molecular graph inputs, and found that it also advances the state of the art on this test. We believe that the advantages that GEN3D provides over other models will enable it to contribute substantially to structure-based drug discovery efforts."}}

The use of deep-learning technologies could augment the typical practice of using human intuition in the design cycle, and thereby expedite drug discovery projects. Here, we present DESMILES, a deep neural network model that advances the state of the art in machine learning approaches to molecular design. We applied DESMILES to a previously published benchmark that assesses the ability of a method to modify input molecules to inhibit the dopamine receptor D2, and DESMILES yielded a 77% lower failure rate compared to state-of-the-art models. To explain the ability of DESMILES to hone molecular properties, we visualize a layer of the DESMILES network, and further demonstrate this ability by using DESMILES to tailor the same molecules used in the D2 benchmark test to dock more potently against seven different receptors."}}

The machine's specialized hardware dramatically increases the speed of MD calculations, making possible for the first time the simulation of biological molecules at an atomic level of detail for periods on the order of a millisecond---about two orders of magnitude beyond the previous state of the art. Anton is now running simulations on a timescale at which many critically important, but poorly understood phenomena are known to occur, allowing the observation of aspects of protein dynamics that were previously inaccessible to both computational and experimental study. Here, we report Anton's performance when executing actual MD simulations whose accuracy has been validated against both existing MD software and experimental observations. We also discuss the manner in which novel algorithms have been coordinated with Anton's co-designed, application-specific hardware to achieve these results."}}
