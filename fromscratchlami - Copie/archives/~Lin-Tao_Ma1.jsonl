To reconcile the HTS data, we also propose a new flexible reconciliation strategy via the attention-based encoder-decoder neural network, unlike the existing methods with strong assumptions, such as unbiased forecasts and Gaussian noises. In addition, by using the reparameterization trick, we are able to combine forecasting and reconciliation into a trainable end-to-end model.

The hierarchical time series (HTS) forecasting includes two sub-tasks, i.e., forecasting and reconciliation. In the previous works, hierarchical information is only integrated in the reconciliation step to maintain coherency, but not in forecasting step for accuracy improvement. In this paper, we propose two novel tree-based feature integration mechanisms, i.e., top-down convolution and bottom-up attention to leverage the information of the hierarchical structure to improve the forecasting performance. Moreover, unlike most previous reconciliation methods which either rely on strong assumptions or focus on coherent constraints only,we utilize deep neural optimization networks, which not only achieve coherency without any assumptions, but also allow more flexible and realistic constraints to achieve task-based targets, e.g., lower under-estimation penalty and meaningful decision-making loss to facilitate the subsequent downstream tasks. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our tree-based feature integration mechanism achieves superior performances on hierarchical forecasting tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and our neural optimization networks can be applied to real-world tasks effectively without any additional effort under coherence and task-based constraints"}}

In recent works, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been introduced as a promising approach to learn the resource management policies to guide the scaling actions under the dynamic and uncertain cloud environment. However, RL methods face the following challenges in steering predictive autoscaling, such as lack of accuracy in decision-making, inefficient sampling and significant variability in workload patterns that may cause policies to fail at test time. To this end, we propose an end-to-end predictive meta model-based RL algorithm, aiming to optimally allocate resource to maintain a stable CPU utilization level, which incorporates a specially-designed deep periodic workload prediction model as the input and embeds the Neural Process [11, 16] to guide the learning of the optimal scaling actions over numerous application services in the Cloud. Our algorithm not only ensures the predictability and accuracy of the scaling strategy, but also enables the scaling decisions to adapt to the changing workloads with high sample efficiency.

In this paper we aim at modeling latent dynamics of event propagation in graph, where the event sequence propagates in a directed weighted graph whose nodes represent event marks (e.g., event types). Most existing works have only considered encoding sequential event history into event representation and ignored the information from the latent graph structure. Besides they also suffer from poor model explainability, i.e., failing to uncover causal influence across a wide variety of nodes. To address these problems, we propose a Graph Regularized Point Process (GRPP) that can be decomposed into: 1) a graph propagation model that characterizes the event interactions across nodes with neighbors and inductively learns node representations; 2) a temporal attentive intensity model, whose excitation and time decay factors of past events on the current event are constructed via the contextualization of the node embedding. Moreover, by applying a graph regularization method, GRPP provides model interpretability by uncovering influence strengths between nodes. Numerical experiments on various datasets show that GRPP outperforms existing models on both the propagation time and node prediction by notable margins."}}

Conventional SSM with fixed-order Markovian assumption often falls short in handling the long-range temporal dependencies and/or highly non-linear correlation in time-series data, which is crucial for accurate forecasting. To this extend, we present External Memory Augmented State Space Model (EMSSM) within the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework. Unlike the common fixed-order Markovian SSM, our model features an external memory system, in which we store informative latent state experience, whereby to create ``memoryful\" latent dynamics modeling complex long-term dependencies. Moreover, conditional normalizing flows are incorporated in our emission model, enabling the adaptation to a broad class of underlying data distributions. We further propose a Monte Carlo Objective that employs an efficient variational proposal distribution, which fuses the filtering and the dynamic prior information, to approximate the posterior state with proper particles. Our results demonstrate the competitiveness of forecasting performance of our proposed model comparing with other state-of-the-art SSMs."}}
