Nerve excitability of motor axons innervating the slow-twitch soleus (SOL) and fast-twitch tibialis anterior (TA) muscles was tested. The experiments were conducted with pentobarbital sodium (SP) anesthetic and compared with previous results that used ketamine-xylazine (KX). Nerve excitability indices measured with SP show definitive differences between TA and SOL motor axons that extend beyond previous reports. Nerve excitability indices sensitive to changes in Ih indicated an increase in SOL axons compared with TA axons [e.g., S3 t=7.949 (df=10), P<0.001; hyperpolarizing threshold electrotonus (90 \u2013100 ms), t=2.659 (df=20); P<0.01; hyperpolarizing I/V slope, t=4.308 (df=19); P<0.001]. SOL axons also had a longer strength-duration time constant [t=3.35 (df=20); P<0.003] and a longer and larger magnitude relative refractory period [RRP (ms) t=3.53 (df=12); P<0.004; Refractoriness at 2 ms, t=0.0055 (df=9); P<0.006]. Anesthetic choice affected many measures of peripheral nerve excitability with differences most apparent in tests of threshold electrotonus and recovery cycle. For example, recovery cycle with KX lacked a clear superexcitable and late subexcitable period. We conclude that KX had a confounding effect on nerve excitability results consistent with ischemic depolarization. Results using SP revealed the full extent of differences in nerve excitability measures between putative slow and fast motor axons of the rat. These results provide empirical evidence, beyond conduction velocity, that the biophysical properties of motor axons vary with the type of muscle fiber innervated. These differences suggest that fast axons may be predisposed to dysfunction during hyperpolarizing stresses, e.g., electrogenic sodium pumping following sustained impulse conduction."}}
