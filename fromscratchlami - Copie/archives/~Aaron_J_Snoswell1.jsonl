Recent approaches to machine learning (ML) documentation have demonstrated the promise of discursive frameworks for deliberation about these complexities. However, these developments have been grounded in a static ML paradigm, leaving the role of feedback and post-deployment performance unexamined. Meanwhile, recent work in reinforcement learning has shown that the effects of feedback and optimization objectives on system behavior can be wide-ranging and unpredictable. In this paper we sketch a framework for documenting deployed and iteratively updated learning systems, which we call Reward Reports. Taking inspiration from various contributions to the technical literature on reinforcement learning, we outline Reward Reports as living documents that track updates to design choices and assumptions behind what a particular automated system is optimizing for. They are intended to track dynamic phenomena arising from system deployment, rather than merely static properties of models or data. After presenting the elements of a Reward Report, we discuss a concrete example: Meta's BlenderBot 3 chatbot. Several others for game-playing (DeepMind's MuZero), content recommendation (MovieLens), and traffic control (Project Flow) are included in the appendix."}}

Within the popular expectation maximization (EM) framework for learning probabilistic MI-IRL models, we present a warm-start strategy based on up-front clustering of the demonstrations in feature space. Our theoretical analysis shows that this warm-start solution produces a near-optimal reward ensemble, provided the behavior modes satisfy mild separation conditions. We also propose a MI-IRL performance metric that generalizes the popular Expected Value Difference measure to directly assesses learned rewards against the ground-truth reward ensemble. Our metric elegantly addresses the difficulty of pairing up learned and ground truth rewards via a min-cost flow formulation, and is efficiently computable. We also develop a MI-IRL benchmark problem that allows for more comprehensive algorithmic evaluations. On this problem, we find our MI-IRL warm-start strategy helps avoid poor quality local minima reward ensembles, resulting in a significant improvement in behavior clustering. Our extensive sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the quality of the learned reward ensembles is improved under various settings, including cases where our theoretical assumptions do not necessarily hold. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by discovering distinct driving styles in a large real-world dataset of driver GPS trajectories."}}

We first present a generalized MaxEnt formulation based on minimizing a KL-divergence instead of maximizing an entropy. This improves the previous heuristic derivation of the MaxEnt IRL model (for stochastic MDPs), allows a unified view of MaxEnt IRL and Relative Entropy IRL, and leads to a model-free learning algorithm for the MaxEnt IRL model. Second, a careful review of existing inference algorithms and implementations showed that they approximately compute the marginals required for learning the model. We provide examples to illustrate this, and present an efficient and exact inference algorithm. Our algorithm can handle variable length demonstrations; in addition, while a basic version takes time quadratic in the maximum demonstration length L, an improved version of this algorithm reduces this to linear using a padding trick. Experiments show that our exact algorithm improves reward learning as compared to the approximate ones. Furthermore, our algorithm scales up to a large, real-world dataset involving driver behaviour forecasting. We provide an optimized implementation compatible with the OpenAI Gym interface. Our new insight and algorithms could possibly lead to further interest and exploration of the original MaxEnt IRL model."}}
