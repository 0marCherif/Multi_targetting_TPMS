However, they perform poorly when applied to videos with rare scenes or objects, primarily due to the bias of existing video datasets. We tackle this problem from two different angles: algorithm and dataset. From the perspective of algorithms, we propose Spatial-aware Multi-Aspect Debiasing (SMAD), which incorporates both explicit debiasing with multi-aspect adversarial training and implicit debiasing with the spatial actionness reweighting module, to learn a more generic representation invariant to non-action aspects. To neutralize the intrinsic dataset bias, we propose OmniDebias to leverage web data for joint training selectively, which can achieve higher performance with far fewer web data. To verify the effectiveness, we establish evaluation protocols and perform extensive experiments on both re-distributed splits of existing datasets and a new evaluation dataset focusing on the action with rare scenes. We also show that the debiased representation can generalize better when transferred to other datasets and tasks."}}

Existing systems use the same embedding model to compute representations (embeddings) for the query and gallery images. Such systems inherently face a hard accuracy-efficiency trade-off: the embedding model needs to be large enough to ensure high accuracy, yet small enough to enable query-embedding computation on resource-constrained platforms. This trade-off could be mitigated if gallery embeddings are generated from a large model and query embeddings are extracted using a compact model. The key to building such a system is to ensure representation compatibility between the query and gallery models. In this paper, we address two forms of compatibility: One enforced by modifying the parameters of each model that computes the embeddings. The other by modifying the architectures that compute the embeddings, leading to compatibility-aware neural architecture search (CMP-NAS). We test CMP-NAS on challenging retrieval tasks for fashion images (DeepFashion2), and face images (IJB-C). Compared to ordinary (homogeneous) visual search using the largest embedding model (paragon), CMP-NAS achieves 80-fold and 23-fold cost reduction while maintaining accuracy within 0.3% and 1.6% of the paragon on DeepFashion2 and IJB-C respectively."}}

Our work tackles the emergent problem of reducing predictive inconsistencies arising as negative flips: test samples that are correctly predicted by a less accurate model, but incorrectly by a more accurate one. We introduce REGression constrained Neural Architecture Search (REG-NAS) to design a family of highly accurate models that engender fewer negative flips. REG-NAS consists of two components: (1) A novel architecture constraint that enables a larger model to contain all the weights of the smaller one thus maximizing weight sharing. This idea stems from our observation that larger weight sharing among networks leads to similar sample-wise predictions and results in fewer negative flips; (2) A novel search reward that incorporates both Top-1 accuracy and negative flips in the architecture search metric. We demonstrate that \\regnas can successfully find desirable architectures with few negative flips in three popular architecture search spaces. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach, REG-NAS enables 33-48% relative reduction of negative flips."}}

Existing methods to reduce the negative flip rate (NFR) either do so at the expense of overall accuracy by forcing a new model to imitate the old models, or use ensembles, which multiply inference cost prohibitively. We analyze the role of ensembles in reducing NFR and observe that they remove negative flips that are typically not close to the decision boundary, but often exhibit large deviations in the distance among their logits. Based on the observation, we present a method, called Ensemble Logit Difference Inhibition ELODI, to train a classification system that achieves paragon performance in both error rate and NFR, at the inference cost of a single model. The method distills a homogeneous ensemble to a single student model which is used to update the classification system. ELODI also introduces a generalized distillation objective, Logit Difference Inhibition (LDI), which penalizes changes in the logits between the reference ensemble and the student single model.\nOn multiple image classification benchmarks, model updates with ELODI demonstrate superior accuracy retention and NFR reduction.

OmniSource overcomes the barriers between data formats, such as images, short videos, and long untrimmed videos for webly-supervised learning. First, data samples with multiple formats, curated by task-specific data collection and automatically filtered by a teacher model, are transformed into a unified form. Then a joint-training strategy is proposed to deal with the domain gaps between multiple data sources and formats in webly-supervised learning. Several good practices, including data balancing, resampling, and cross-dataset mixup are adopted in joint training. Experiments show that by utilizing data from multiple sources and formats, OmniSource is more data-efficient in training. With only 3.5M images and 800K minutes videos crawled from the internet without human labeling (less than 2% of prior works), our models learned with OmniSource improve Top-1 accuracy of 2D- and 3D-ConvNet baseline models by 3.0% and 3.9%, respectively, on the Kinetics-400 benchmark. With OmniSource, we establish new records with different pretraining strategies for video recognition. Our best models achieve 80.4%, 80.5%, and 83.6 Top-1 accuracies on the Kinetics-400 benchmark respectively for training-from-scratch, ImageNet pre-training and IG-65M pre-training."}}

Most of the current state- of-the-art literature either aims at improving performance through changes to the backbone CNN network, or they ex- plore different trade-offs between computational efficiency and performance, again through altering the backbone net- work. However, almost all of these works maintain the same last layers of the network, which simply consist of a global average pooling followed by a fully connected layer. In this work we focus on how to improve the representa- tion capacity of the network, but rather than altering the backbone, we focus on improving the last layers of the net- work, where changes have low impact in terms of computa- tional cost. In particular, we show that current architectures have poor sensitivity to finer details and we exploit recent advances in the fine-grained recognition literature to im- prove our model in this aspect. With the proposed approach, we obtain state-of-the-art performance on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-V1, the two major large-scale action recognition benchmarks."}}

This unique design enables the TSN framework to efficiently learn action models by using the whole video. The learned models could be easily deployed for action recognition in both trimmed and untrimmed videos with simple average pooling and multi-scale temporal window integration, respectively. We also study a series of good practices for the implementation of the TSN framework given limited training samples. Our approach obtains the state-the-of-art performance on five challenging action recognition benchmarks: HMDB51 (71.0 percent), UCF101 (94.9 percent), THUMOS14 (80.1 percent), ActivityNet v1.2 (89.6 percent), and Kinetics400 (75.7 percent). In addition, using the proposed RGB difference as a simple motion representation, our method can still achieve competitive accuracy on UCF101 (91.0 percent) while running at 340 FPS. Furthermore, based on the proposed TSN framework, we won the video classification track at the ActivityNet challenge 2016 among 24 teams."}}

The key to this problem is to trade accuracy for efficiency in an effective way, i.e. reducing the computing cost while maintaining competitive performance. To seek a good balance, previous efforts usually focus on optimizing the model architectures. This paper explores an alternative approach, that is, to reallocate the computation over a scale-time space. The basic idea is to perform expensive detection sparsely and propagate the results across both scales and time with substantially cheaper networks, by exploiting the strong correlations among them. Specifically, we present a unified framework that integrates detection, temporal propagation, and across-scale refinement on a Scale-Time Lattice. On this framework, one can explore various strategies to balance performance and cost. Taking advantage of this flexibility, we further develop an adaptive scheme with the detector invoked on demand and thus obtain improved tradeoff. On ImageNet VID dataset, the proposed method can achieve a competitive mAP 79.6% at 20 fps, or 79.0% at 62 fps as a performance/speed tradeoff."}}

This formulation not only leads to greater expressive power but also stronger generalization capability. On two large datasets, Kinetics and NTU-RGBD, it achieves substantial improvements over mainstream methods."}}
