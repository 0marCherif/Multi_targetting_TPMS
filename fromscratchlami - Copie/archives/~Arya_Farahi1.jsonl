Modeling patterns and trends in this data is of particular importance to a variety of stakeholders, particularly as Detroit emerges from Chapter 9 bankruptcy, but the structure in such data is complex, and the city lacks dedicated resources for in-depth analysis. The City of Detroit's Operations and Infrastructure Group and the University of Michigan initiated a collaboration which seeks to address this unmet need by analyzing data from the City of Detroit's vehicle fleet. This work presents a case study and provides the first data-driven benchmark, demonstrating a suite of methods to aid in data understanding and prediction for large vehicle maintenance datasets. We present analyses to address three key questions raised by the stakeholders, related to discovering multivariate maintenance patterns over time; predicting maintenance; and predicting vehicle-and fleet-level costs. We present a novel algorithm, PRISM, for automating multivariate sequential data analyses using tensor decomposition. This work is a first of its kind that presents both methodologies and insights to guide future civic data research."}}

After elevated levels of lead were detected in residents' drinking water, followed by an increase in blood lead levels in area children, the state and federal governments directed over 125 million to replace water service lines, the pipes connecting each home to the water system. In the absence of accurate records, and with the high cost of determining buried pipe materials, we put forth a number of predictive and procedural tools to aid in the search and removal of lead infrastructure. Alongside these statistical and machine learning approaches, we describe our interactions with government officials in recommending homes for both inspection and replacement, with a focus on the statistical model that adapts to incoming information. Finally, in light of discussions about increased spending on infrastructure development by the federal government, we explore how our approach generalizes beyond Flint to other municipalities nationwide."}}

The city government published the results of these tests, creating a valuable dataset that is key to understanding the causes and extent of the lead contamination event in Flint. This is the nation's largest dataset on lead in a municipal water system. In this paper, we predict the lead contamination for each household's water supply, and we study several related aspects of Flint's water troubles, many of which generalize well beyond this one city. For example, we show that elevated lead risks can be (weakly) predicted from observable home attributes. Then we explore the factors associated with elevated lead. These risk assessments were developed in part via a crowd sourced prediction challenge at the University of Michigan. To inform Flint residents of these assessments, they have been incorporated into a web and mobile application funded by Google.org. We also explore questions of self-selection in the residential testing program, examining which factors are linked to when and how frequently residents voluntarily sample their water."}}
