In this paper we initiate the study of Pandora's problem with combinatorial costs, capturing many real-life scenarios where search cost is non-additive. Weitzman's celebrated algorithm [1979] establishes the remarkable result that, for additive costs, the optimal search strategy is non-adaptive and computationally feasible. We inquire to which extent this structural and computational simplicity extends beyond additive cost functions. Our main result is that the class of submodular cost functions admits an optimal strategy that follows a fixed, non-adaptive order, thus preserving the structural simplicity of additive cost functions. In contrast, for the more general class of subadditive (or even XOS) cost functions, the optimal strategy may already need to determine the search order adaptively. On the computational side, obtaining any approximation to the optimal utility requires super polynomially many queries to the cost function, even for a strict subclass of submodular cost functions."}}

We provide a complete characterization of the regret regimes for fixed-price mechanisms under different feedback models in the two cases where the learner can post either the same or different prices to buyers and sellers. We begin by showing that the minimax regret after $T$ rounds is of order $\\sqrt{T}$ in the full-feedback scenario. Under partial feedback, any algorithm that has to post the same price to buyers and sellers suffers worst-case linear regret. However, when the learner can post two different prices at each round, we design an algorithm enjoying regret of order $T^{3/4}$ ignoring log factors. We prove that this rate is optimal by presenting a surprising $T^{3/4}$ lower bound, which is the main technical contribution of the paper."}}

In this work, we study an extension where the directed feedback graph is stochastic, following a distribution similar to the classical Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model. Specifically, in each round every edge in the graph is either realized or not with a distinct probability for each edge. We prove nearly optimal regret bounds of order $\\min\\bigl\\{\\min_{\\varepsilon} \\sqrt{(\\alpha_\\varepsilon/\\varepsilon) T},\\, \\min_{\\varepsilon} (\\delta_\\varepsilon/\\varepsilon)^{1/3} T^{2/3}\\bigr\\}$ (ignoring logarithmic factors), where $\\alpha_{\\varepsilon}$ and $\\delta_{\\varepsilon}$ are graph-theoretic quantities measured on the support of the stochastic feedback graph $\\mathcal{G}$ with edge probabilities thresholded at $\\varepsilon$. Our result, which holds without any preliminary knowledge about $\\mathcal{G}$, requires the learner to observe only the realized out-neighborhood of the chosen action. When the learner is allowed to observe the realization of the entire graph (but only the losses in the out-neighborhood of the chosen action), we derive a more efficient algorithm featuring a dependence on weighted versions of the independence and weak domination numbers that exhibits improved bounds for some special cases."}}

Besides a direct, and optimal, SSPI for the basic single choice problem [Rubinstein et al., 2020], most existing SSPI results were obtained via an elegant, but inherently lossy reduction to order-oblivious secretary (OOS) policies [Azar et al., 2014]. Motivated by this discrepancy, we develop an intuitive and versatile greedy-based technique that yields SSPIs directly rather than through the reduction to OOSs. Our results can be seen as generalizing and unifying a number of existing results in the area of prophet and secretary problems. Our algorithms significantly improve on the competitive guarantees for a number of interesting scenarios (including general matching with edge arrivals, bipartite matching with vertex arrivals, and certain matroids), and capture new settings (such as budget additive combinatorial auctions). Complementing our algorithmic results, we also consider mechanism design variants. Finally, we analyze the power and limitations of different SSPI approaches by providing a partial converse to the reduction from SSPI to OOS given by Azar et al."}}

One agent/job arrives at every time step, with parameters drawn from the underlying distribution. We design a posted-price mechanism which can be efficiently computed and is revenue-optimal in expectation and in retrospect, up to additive error. The prices are posted prior to learning the agent\u2019s type, and the computed pricing scheme is deterministic, depending only on the length of the allotted time interval and on the earliest time the server is available. We also prove that the proposed pricing strategy is robust to imprecise knowledge of the job distribution and that a distribution learned from polynomially many samples is sufficient to obtain a near-optimal truthful pricing strategy."}}
