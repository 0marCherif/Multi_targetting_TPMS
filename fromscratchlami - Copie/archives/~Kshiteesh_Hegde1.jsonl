We conduct an extensive study of intrinsic scale for several networks, ranging from structured (e.g. road networks) to ad-hoc and unstructured (e.g. crowd sourced information networks), to biological. We find: (a) The intrinsic scale is surprisingly small (7-20 vertices), even though the networks are many orders of magnitude larger. (b) The intrinsic scale quantifies \"structure\" in a network - networks which are explicitly constructed for specific tasks have smaller intrinsic scale. (c) The structure at different scales can be fragile (easy to disrupt) or robust."}}

We zoom in to the network using lenses of different sizes to capture the local structure of the network. These network signatures are then weighted to provide a set of predicted labels for every node. We achieve a peak accuracy of $\\sim42\\%$ (random=$11\\%$) on two networks with $\\sim100,000$ and $\\sim1,000,000$ nodes each. Further, we perform better than random even when the given node is connected to up to 5 different types of networks. Finally, we perform this analysis on homogeneous networks and show that highly structured networks have high homogeneity."}}

To test our approach, we implant nodes from a terrorist network in a wide variety of benign real networks to create a topologically heterogeneous network. We capture local information using structured image embeddings of adjacency matrices and identify the terrorist nodes. We recover up to 85% of the terrorist-like nodes implanted in friendly host networks while keeping the false positive rate as low as 1%."}}

However, most recommender systems today are designed in the context of an offline setting. The online setting is, however, much more challenging because the existing methods do not work very effectively for very large-scale systems. In many applications, it is desirable to provide real-time recommendations in large-scale scenarios. The main problem in applying streaming algorithms for recommendations is that the in-core storage space for memory-resident operations is quite limited. In this paper, we present a probabilistic neighborhood-based algorithm for performing recommendations in real-time. We present experimental results, which show the effectiveness of our approach in comparison to state-of-the-art methods."}}
