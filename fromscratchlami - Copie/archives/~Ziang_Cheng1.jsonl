Our system recovers scene geometry and reflectance using only multi-view images captured by a smartphone. The key idea is to exploit smartphone's built-in flashlight as a minimally controlled light source, and decompose image intensities into two photometric components -- a static appearance corresponds to ambient flux, plus a dynamic reflection induced by the moving flashlight. Our method does not require flash/non-flash images to be captured in pairs. Building on the success of neural light fields, we use an off-the-shelf method to capture the ambient reflections, while the flashlight component enables physically accurate photometric constraints to decouple reflectance and illumination. Compared to existing inverse rendering methods, our setup is applicable to non-darkroom environments yet sidesteps the inherent difficulties of explicit solving ambient reflections. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that our method is easy to implement, casual to set up, and consistently outperforms existing in-the-wild inverse rendering techniques. Finally, our neural reconstruction can be easily exported to PBR textured triangle mesh ready for industrial renderers."}}

Previous methods uniformly rely on max-flow/min-cut solutions for move-making, and have achieved generally good performance on a variety of applications. Early research suggests that path-augmenting algorithms such as BK tend to perform well on grid-structured graphs. Unlike conventional graph-cuts methods, our algorithm does not require the exact max-flow/min-cut solution for update. Instead, any cut/flow of a subproblem can be used for primal/dual update, which allows the max-flow solver to stop at any time during execution. Thanks to the dynamicity of our approach, the energy convergence rate can be improved by several times in our experiments on GPU."}}

Previous methods impose additional constraints by exploiting either empirical or datadriven priors. In this paper, we revisit intrinsic image decomposition with the aid of near-infrared (NIR) imagery.\nWe show that NIR band is considerably less sensitive to\ntextures and can be exploited to reduce ambiguity caused\nby reflectance variation, promoting a simple yet powerful\nprior for shading smoothness. With this observation, we\nformulate intrinsic decomposition as an energy minimisation problem. Unlike existing methods, our energy formulation decouples reflectance and shading estimation, into\na convex local shading component based on NIR-RGB image pair, and a reflectance component that encourages reflectance homogeneity both locally and globally. We further\nshow the minimisation process can be approximated by a\nseries of multi-dimensional convolutions, each within linear\ntime complexity. To validate the proposed algorithm, a NIRRGB dataset is captured over real-world objects, where our\nNIR-assisted approach demonstrates superiority over RGB\nmethods."}}
