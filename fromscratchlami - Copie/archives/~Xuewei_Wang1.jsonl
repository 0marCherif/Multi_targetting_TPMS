However, little is known about how identities and inquiry strategies influence the conversation's effectiveness. We conducted an online study involving 790 participants to be persuaded by a chatbot for charity donation. We designed a two by four factorial experiment (two chatbot identities and four inquiry strategies) where participants were randomly assigned to different conditions. Findings showed that the perceived identity of the chatbot had significant effects on the persuasion outcome (i.e., donation) and interpersonal perceptions (i.e., competence, confidence, warmth, and sincerity). Further, we identified interaction effects among perceived identities and inquiry strategies. We discuss the findings for theoretical and practical implications for developing ethical and effective persuasive chatbots. Our published data, codes, and analyses serve as the first step towards building competent ethical persuasive chatbots."}}

To do so, the first step is to understand the intricate organization of strategic disclosures and appeals employed in human persuasion conversations. We designed an online persuasion task where one participant was asked to persuade the other to donate to a specific charity. We collected a large dataset with 1,017 dialogues and annotated emerging persuasion strategies from a subset. Based on the annotation, we built a baseline classifier with context information and sentence-level features to predict the 10 persuasion strategies used in the corpus. Furthermore, to develop an understanding of personalized persuasion processes, we analyzed the relationships between individuals\u2019 demographic and psychological backgrounds including personality, morality, value systems, and their willingness for donation. Then, we analyzed which types of persuasion strategies led to a greater amount of donation depending on the individuals\u2019 personal backgrounds. This work lays the ground for developing a personalized persuasive dialogue system."}}

Various technologies have been developed to perform ASL recognition, including optical signal sensing, electrical signal sensing, and mechanical signal sensing. However, wearable devices using those methods have bulky and complex sensing modules that lead to long-term discomfort as well as poor accuracy. In this paper, we present an epidermal-iontronic sensing (EIS)-based wearable device that wears on finger joints for 35 fingerspelling ASL recognitions (i.e., 26 alphabets from A to Z and 9 digits from one to nine). Compared to current on-market devices, such design is lighter, comfortable to wear and has better appearance according to user comments. When bending the finger, a physical contact forms between the ionic material and the epidermis of skin, leading to an electric double layer (EDL) established at the interface. Therefore, a significant capacitive change can be achieved with various finger gestures. By using Nafion as the ionic sensing material, we developed a sensing device to provide excellent flexibility and optical transparency. We used machine learning methods, such as neural networks to track and perform ASL recognition using the signals obtained from the designed device. The algorithm achieved a within-user accuracy of 99.6% and a cross-user accuracy of 76.1% when adapted the model to different users. This wearable device is low-cost and has broad potential to be integrated in future application of human-machine interactions (HMI), smart home controls, and nonverbal communications."}}
