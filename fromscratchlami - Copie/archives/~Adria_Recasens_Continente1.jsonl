For this reason, one can think that machines with this type of ability would interact better with people. However, there are no current systems capable of understanding in detail people\u2019s emotional states. Previous research on computer vision to recognize emotions has mainly focused on analyzing the facial expression, usually classifying it into the 6 basic emotions [11]. However, the context plays an important role in emotion perception, and when the context is incorporated, we can infer more emotional states. In this paper we present the \u201cEmotions in Context Database\u201d (EMOTIC), a dataset of images containing people in context in non-controlled environments. In these images, people are annotated with\n26 emotional categories and also with the continuous dimensions valence, arousal, and dominance [21]. With the EMOTIC dataset, we trained a Convolutional Neural Network model that jointly analyses the person and the whole scene to recognize rich information about emotional states. With this, we show the importance of considering the context for recognizing people\u2019s emotions in images, and provide a benchmark in the task of emotion recognition in visual context."}}

This information is useful to make inferences about 3D shape, physical properties and object interactions. While the problem of tracking arbitrary physical points on surfaces over longer video clips has received some attention, no dataset or benchmark for evaluation existed, until now.  In this paper, we first formalize the problem, naming it tracking any point (TAP). We introduce a companion benchmark,TAP-Vid, which is composed of both real-world videos with accurate human annotations of point tracks, and synthetic videos with perfect ground-truth point tracks. Central to the construction of our benchmark is a novel semi-automatic crowdsourced pipeline which uses optical flow estimates to compensate for easier, short-term motion like camera shake, allowing annotators to focus on harder sections of the video. We validate our pipeline on synthetic data and propose a simple end-to-end point tracking model, TAP-Net, showing that it outperforms all prior methods on our benchmark when trained on synthetic data."}}

There has been a lot of research in providing machines with a similar capacity of recognizing emotions. From a computer vision perspective, most of the previous efforts have been focusing in analyzing the facial expressions and, in some cases, also the body pose. Some of these methods work remarkably well in specific settings. However, their performance is limited in natural, unconstrained environments. Psychological studies show that the scene context, in addition to facial expression and body pose, contributes important information to our perception of people's emotions. However, the processing of the context for automatic emotion recognition has not been explored in depth, partly due to the lack of proper data. In this paper we present EMOTIC, a dataset of images of people in natural and different situations annotated with their apparent emotion. The EMOTIC database combines two different types of emotion representation: (1) a set of 26 discrete categories, and (2) the continuous dimensions Valence, Arousal, and Dominance. We also present a detailed statistical and algorithmic analysis of the dataset along with annotators' agreement analysis. Using the EMOTIC database we train different CNN models for emotion recognition, combining the information of the person bounding box with the information present in the scene context. Our results show how scene context contributes important information to automatically recognize emotional states and motivate further research in this direction."}}

Our goal is to learn the correspondence between spoken words and abstract visual attributes, from a dataset of spoken descriptions of images. Building upon recent findings that GAN representations can be manipulated to edit semantic concepts in the generated output, we propose a new method to use such GAN-generated images to train a model using a triplet loss. To apply the method, we develop Audio CLEVRGAN, a new dataset of audio descriptions of GAN-generated CLEVR images, and we describe a training procedure that creates a curriculum of GAN-generated images that focuses training on image pairs that differ in a specific, informative way. Training is done without additional supervision beyond the spoken captions and the GAN. We find that training that takes advantage of GAN-generated edited examples results in improvements in the model's ability to learn attributes compared to previous results. Our proposed learning framework also results in models that can associate spoken words with some abstract visual concepts such as color and size."}}

Our differentiable layer can be added as a preprocessing block to existing task networks and trained altogether in an end-to-end fashion. The effect of the layer is to efficiently estimate how to sample from the original data in order to boost task performance. For example, for an image classification task in which the original data might range in size up\u00a0to several megapixels, but where the desired input images to the task network are much smaller, our layer learns how best to sample from the underlying high resolution data in a manner which preserves task-relevant information better than uniform downsampling. This has the effect of creating distorted, caricature-like intermediate images, in which idiosyncratic elements of the image that improve task performance are zoomed and exaggerated. Unlike alternative approaches such as spatial transformer networks, our proposed layer is inspired by image saliency, computed efficiently from uniformly downsampled data, and degrades gracefully to a uniform sampling strategy under uncertainty. We apply our layer to improve existing networks for the tasks of human gaze estimation and fine-grained object classification.
