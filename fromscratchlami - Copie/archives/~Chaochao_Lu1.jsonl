Existing models of composition learning for image retrieval are generally built with large-scale datasets, demanding extensive training samples, ie, query-target pairs, as supervision, which restricts their application for the scenario of few-shot learning with only few query-target pairs available. Recently, prompt tuning with frozen pretrained language models has shown remarkable performance when the amount of training data is limited. Inspired by this, we propose a prompt tuning mechanism with the pretrained CLIP model for the task of few-shot composition learning for image retrieval. Specifically, we regard the representation of the reference image as a trainable visual prompt, prefixed to the embedding of the text sequence. One challenge is to efficiently train visual prompt with few-shot samples. To deal with this issue, we further propose a self-upervised auxiliary task via ensuring that the reference image can retrieve itself when no modification information is given from the text, which facilitates training for the visual prompt, while not requiring additional annotations for query-target pairs. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our proposed model can yield superior performance when trained with only few query-target pairs."}}

Prior work addressing this, either explicitly or implicitly, attempted to find a data representation that has an invariant relationship with the target. This is done by leveraging a diverse set of training environments to reduce the effect of spurious features and build an invariant predictor. However, these methods have generalization guarantees only when both data representation and classifiers come from a linear model class. We propose invariant Causal Representation Learning (iCaRL), an approach that enables out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in the nonlinear setting (i.e., nonlinear representations and nonlinear classifiers). It builds upon a practical and general assumption: the prior over the data representation (i.e., a set of latent variables encoding the data) given the target and the environment belongs to general exponential family distributions, i.e., a more flexible conditionally non-factorized prior that can actually capture complicated dependences between the latent variables. Based on this, we show that it is possible to identify the data representation up to simple transformations. We also show that all direct causes of the target can be fully discovered, which further enables us to obtain generalization guarantees in the nonlinear setting. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms a variety of baseline methods. "}}

In this paper, we propose a principled framework for adaptive RL, called AdaRL, that adapts reliably and efficiently to changes across domains with a few samples from the target domain, even in partially observable environments. Specifically, we leverage a parsimonious graphical representation that characterizes structural relationships over variables in the RL system. Such graphical representations provide a compact way to encode what and where the changes across domains are, and furthermore inform us with a minimal set of changes that one has to consider for the purpose of policy adaptation. We show that by explicitly leveraging this compact representation to encode changes, we can efficiently adapt the policy to the target domain, in which only a few samples are needed and further policy optimization is avoided. We illustrate the efficacy of AdaRL through a series of experiments that vary factors in the observation, transition and reward functions for Cartpole and Atari games."}}

The generated images have exactly the same resolution as the training images, which is dictated by the number of layers in the underlying neural network. Recent work has shown, however, that feeding spatial noise vectors into a fully convolutional neural network enables both generation of arbitrary resolution output images as well as training on arbitrary resolution training images. While this work has provided impressive empirical results, little theoretical interpretation was provided to explain the underlying generative process. In this paper we provide a firm theoretical interpretation for infinite spatial generation, by drawing connections to spatial stochastic processes. We use the resulting intuition to improve upon existing spatially infinite generative models to enable more efficient training through a model that we call an infinite generative adversarial network, or $\\infty$-GAN. Experiments on world map generation, panoramic images and texture synthesis verify the ability of $\\infty$-GAN to efficiently generate images of arbitrary size."}}

Based on the proposed approach, we extend one representative of reinforcement learning algorithms: the Actor-Critic method, to its deconfounding variant, which is also straightforward to be applied to other algorithms. In addition, due to lack of datasets in this direction, a benchmark is developed for deconfounding reinforcement learning algorithms by revising OpenAI Gym and MNIST. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are superior to traditional reinforcement learning algorithms in confounded environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that confounders are taken into consideration for addressing full reinforcement learning problems."}}
