We use multilingual pre-training with random-projection quantization and speech-text modality matching to achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream multilingual ASR and speech-to-text translation tasks.

However, even as so much of the ASR training process has become automated and more \"end-to-end\", the data augmentation policy (what augmentation functions to use, and how to apply them) remains hand-crafted. We present Graph-Augment, a technique to define the augmentation space as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and search over this space to optimize the augmentation policy itself. We show that given the same computational budget, policies produced by G-Augment are able to perform better than SpecAugment policies obtained by random search on fine-tuning tasks on CHiME-6 and AMI. G-Augment is also able to establish a new state-of-the-art ASR performance on the CHiME-6 evaluation set (30.7% WER). We further demonstrate that G-Augment policies show better transfer properties across warm-start to cold-start training and model size compared to random-searched SpecAugment policies."}}

In this work, we demonstrate that a modality-matched joint speech and text model can be leveraged to train a massively multilingual ASR model without any supervised (manually transcribed) speech for some languages. This paper explores the use of jointly learnt speech and text representations in a massively multilingual, zero supervised speech, real-world setting to expand the set of languages covered by ASR with only unlabeled speech and text in the target languages. Using the FLEURS dataset, we define the task to cover $102$ languages, where transcribed speech is available in $52$ of these languages and can be used to improve end-to-end ASR quality on the remaining $50$. First, we show that by combining speech representations with byte-level text representations and use of language embeddings, we can dramatically reduce the Character Error Rate (CER) on languages with no supervised speech from 64.8\\% to 30.8\\%, a relative reduction of 53\\%. Second, using a subset of South Asian languages we show that Maestro-U can promote knowledge transfer from languages with supervised speech even when there is limited to no graphemic overlap. Overall, Maestro-U closes the gap to oracle performance by 68.5\\% relative and reduces the CER of 19 languages below 15\\%."}}

Fine-tuning the entire model or a subset of the parameters using light-weight adaptation has shown considerable success across different specialization tasks. Fine-tuning a model for a large number of domains typically requires starting a new training job for every domain posing scaling limitations. Once these models are trained, deploying them also poses significant scalability challenges for inference for real-time applications. In this paper, building upon prior light-weight adaptation techniques, we propose a modular framework that enables us to substantially improve scalability for model training and inference. We introduce Submodels that can be quickly and dynamically loaded for on-the-fly inference. We also propose multiple approaches for training those Submodels in parallel using an embedding space in the same training job. We test our framework on an extreme use-case which is speech model personalization for atypical speech, requiring a Submodel for each user. We obtain 128x Submodel throughput with a fixed computation budget without a loss of accuracy. We also show that learning a speaker-embedding space can scale further and reduce the amount of personalization training data required per speaker."}}

Self-supervised learning from speech signals aims to learn the latent structure inherent in the signal, while self-supervised learning from text attempts to capture lexical information. Learning aligned representations from unpaired speech and text sequences is a challenging task. Previous work either implicitly enforced the representations learnt from these two modalities to be aligned in the latent space through multi-tasking and parameter sharing or explicitly through conversion of modalities via speech synthesis. While the former suffers from interference between the two modalities, the latter introduces additional complexity. In this paper, we propose Maestro, a novel algorithm to learn unified representations from both these modalities simultaneously that can transfer to diverse downstream tasks such as Automated Speech Recognition(ASR) and Speech Translation(ST). Maestro learns unified representations through sequence alignment, duration prediction and matching embeddings in the learned space through an aligned masked-language model loss. We establish a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on VoxPopuli multilingual ASR with a 8% relative reduction in Word Error Rate (WER), multi-domain SpeechStew ASR (3.7%relative) and 21 languages to English multilingual ST on CoVoST 2 with an improvement of 2.8BLEU averaged over 21 languages."}}

Voice Conversion (VC) modifies speaker characteristics of input speech. This is an attractive feature for ASR data augmentation. In this paper, we demonstrate that voice conversion can be used as a data augmentation technique to improve ASR performance, even on LibriSpeech, which contains 2,456 speakers. For ASR augmentation, it is necessary that the VC model be robust to a wide range of input speech. This motivates the use of a non-autoregressive, non-parallel VC model, and the use of a pretrained ASR encoder within the VC model. This work suggests that despite including many speakers, speaker diversity may remain a limitation to ASR quality. Finally, interrogation of our VC performance has provided useful metrics for objective evaluation of VC quality."}}

Existing multilingual TTS typically supports tens of languages, which are a small fraction of the thousands of languages in the world. One difficulty to scale multilingual TTS to hundreds of languages is collecting high-quality speech-text paired data in low-resource languages. This study extends Maestro, a speech-text joint pretraining framework for automatic speech recognition (ASR), to speech generation tasks. To train a TTS model from various types of speech and text data, different training schemes are designed to handle supervised (paired TTS and ASR data) and unsupervised (untranscribed speech and unspoken text) datasets. Experimental evaluation shows that 1) multilingual TTS models trained on Virtuoso can achieve significantly better naturalness and intelligibility than baseline ones in seen languages, and 2) they can synthesize reasonably intelligible and naturally sounding speech for unseen languages where no high-quality paired TTS data is available."}}
