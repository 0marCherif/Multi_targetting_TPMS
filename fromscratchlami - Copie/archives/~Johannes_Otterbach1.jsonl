To address this challenge, we propose \\textsc{Auto-Compressing Subset Pruning}, \\acosp, as a new online compression method. The core of \\acosp consists of learning a channel selection mechanism for individual channels of each convolution in the segmentation model based on an effective temperature annealing schedule. We show a crucial interplay between providing a high-capacity model at the beginning of training and the compression pressure forcing the model to compress concepts into retained channels. We apply \\acosp to \\segnet and \\pspnet architectures and show its success when trained on the \\camvid, \\city, \\voc, and \\ade datasets. The results are competitive with existing baselines for compression of segmentation models at low compression ratios and outperform them significantly at high compression ratios, yielding acceptable results even when removing more than 93% of the parameters. In addition, \\acosp is conceptually simple, easy to implement, and can readily be generalized to other data modalities, tasks, and architectures."}}

In this work, we focus on developing \\emph{dynamic} ordering policies for multi-echelon inventory optimization. Traditional inventory optimization methods aim to determine a \\emph{static} reordering policy. Thus, these policies are not able to adjust to dynamic changes such as those observed during the COVID-19 crisis. On the other hand, conventional strategies offer the advantage of being interpretable, which is a crucial feature for supply chain managers in order to communicate decisions to their stakeholders.\n\nTo address this limitation, we propose an interpretable reinforcement learning approach that aims to be as interpretable as the traditional static policies while being as flexible and environment-agnostic as other deep learning-based reinforcement learning solutions. We propose to use Neural Additive Models as an interpretable dynamic policy of a reinforcement learning agent, showing that this approach is competitive with a standard full connected policy. Finally, we use the interpretability property to gain insights into a complex ordering strategy for a simple, linear three-echelon inventory supply chain."}}

SOC describes the buildup of large-scale and long-range spatio-temporal correlations as a result of only local interactions and dissipation. The simulation of SOC dynamics is typically based on Monte-Carlo (MC) methods, which are however numerically expensive and do not scale beyond certain system sizes. We investigate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as an effective surrogate model to learn the dynamics operator for a paradigmatic SOC system, inspired by an experimentally accessible physics example: driven Rydberg atoms. To this end, we generalize existing GNN simulation approaches to predict dynamics for the internal state of the node. We show that we can accurately reproduce the MC dynamics as well as generalize along the two important axes of particle number and particle density. This paves the way to model much larger systems beyond the limits of traditional MC methods. While the exact system is inspired by the dynamics of Rydberg atoms, the approach is quite general and can readily be applied to other systems."}}

In this work, we design a general solution operator for two different time-independent PDEs using graph neural networks (GNNs) and spectral graph convolutions. We train the networks on simulated data from a finite elements solver on a variety of shapes and inhomogeneities. In contrast to previous works, we focus on the ability of the trained operator to generalize to previously unseen scenarios. Specifically, we test generalization to meshes with different shapes and superposition of solutions for a different number of inhomogeneities. We find that training on a diverse dataset with lots of variation in the finite element meshes is a key ingredient for achieving good generalization results in all cases. With this, we believe that GNNs can be used to learn solution operators that generalize over a range of properties and produce solutions much faster than a generic solver. Our dataset, which we make publicly available, can be used and extended to verify the robustness of these models under varying conditions."}}

Availability of sufficient pixel-level annotations for the training data is a hurdle. Active learning helps learning from small amounts of data by suggesting the most promising samples for labeling. In this work, we propose a new pool-based method for active learning, which proposes promising patches extracted from full image, in each acquisition step. The problem is framed in an exploration-exploitation framework by combining an embedding based on Uniform Manifold Approximation to model representativeness with entropy as uncertainty measure to model informativeness. We applied our proposed method to the autonomous driving datasets CamVid and Cityscapes and performed a quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art baselines. We find that our active learning method achieves better performance compared to previous methods."}}

In this work, we introduce a novel technique, DAAIN, to detect OOD inputs and AA for image segmentation in a unified setting. Our approach monitors the inner workings of a neural network and learns a density estimator of the activation distribution. We equip the density estimator with a classification head to discriminate between regular and anomalous inputs. To deal with the high-dimensional activation-space of typical segmentation networks, we subsample them to obtain a homogeneous spatial and layer-wise coverage. The subsampling pattern is chosen once per monitored model and kept fixed for all inputs. Since the attacker has access to neither the detection model nor the sampling key, it becomes harder for them to attack the segmentation network, as the attack cannot be backpropagated through the detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an ESPNet trained on the Cityscapes dataset as segmentation model, an affine Normalizing Flow as density estimator and use blue noise to ensure homogeneous sampling. Our model can be trained on a single GPU making it compute efficient and deployable without requiring specialized accelerators."}}
