Instead of assessing every individual label, most XMC methods rely on label trees or filters to derive short ranked label lists as prediction, thereby reducing computational overhead. Specifically, existing studies obtain ranked label lists with a fixed length for prediction and evaluation. However, these predictions are unreasonable since data points have varied numbers of relevant labels. The greatly small and large list lengths in evaluation, such as Precision@5 and Recall@100, can also lead to the ignorance of other relevant labels or the tolerance of many irrelevant labels. In this paper, we aim to provide reasonable prediction for extreme multi-label classifica- tion with dynamic numbers of predicted labels. In particular, we propose a novel framework, Model-Agnostic List Truncation with Ordinal Regression (MALTOR), to leverage the ranking properties and truncate long ranked label lists for better accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on six large-scale real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MALTOR significantly outperforms sta- tistical baseline methods and conventional ranked list truncation methods in ad-hoc retrieval with both linear and deep XMC models. The results of an ablation study also shows the effectiveness of each individual component in our proposed MALTOR."}}

The existing question routing algorithms simply predict the ranking of users based on query content. As a consequence, the question raiser information is ignored. On the other hand, they lack learnable scoring functions to explicitly compute ranking scores.To tackle these challenges, we propose NeRank that (1) jointly learns representations of question content, question raiser, and question answerers by a heterogeneous information network embedding algorithm and a long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The embeddings of the three types of entities are unified in the same latent space, and (2) conducts question routing for personalized queries, i.e., queries with two entities (question content, question raiser), by a convolutional scoring function taking the learned embeddings of all three types of entities as input. Using the scores, NeRank routes new questions to high-ranking answerers that are skillfulness in the question domain and have similar backgrounds to the question raiser.Experimental results show that NeRank significantly outperforms competitive baseline question routing models that ignore the raiser information in three ranking metrics. In addition, NeRank is convergeable in several thousand iterations and insensitive to parameter changes, which prove its effectiveness, scalability, and robustness."}}

Among the different types of semantic text matching, long-document-to-long-document text matching has many applications, but has rarely been studied. Most existing approaches for semantic text matching have limited success in this setting, due to their inability to capture and distill the main ideas and topics from long-form text. In this paper, we propose a novel Siamese multi-depth attention-based hierarchical recurrent neural network (SMASH RNN) that learns the long-form semantics, and enables long-form document based semantic text matching. In addition to word information, SMASH RNN is using the document structure to improve the representation of long-form documents. Specifically, SMASH RNN synthesizes information from different document structure levels, including paragraphs, sentences, and words. An attention-based hierarchical RNN derives a representation for each document structure level. Then, the representations learned from the different levels are aggregated to learn a more comprehensive semantic representation of the entire document. For semantic text matching, a Siamese structure couples the representations of a pair of documents, and infers a probabilistic score as their similarity. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of SMASH RNN with three practical applications, including email attachment suggestion, related article recommendation, and citation recommendation. Experimental results on public data sets demonstrate that SMASH RNN significantly outperforms competitive baseline methods across various classification and ranking scenarios in the context of semantic matching of long-form documents."}}

Major service providers, such as Netflix (for movies) and Spotify (for music), usually have a large customer base. More often than not, users may share an account. This has attracted increasing attention recently, as account sharing not only compromises the service provider's financial interests but also impairs the performance of recommendation systems and consequently the quality of service provided to the users. To address this issue, this paper focuses on the problem of user identification in shared accounts. Our goal is three-fold: (1) Given an account, along with its historical session logs, we identify a set of users who share such account; (2) Given a new session issued by an account, we find the corresponding user among the identified users of such account; (3) We aim to boost the performance of item recommendation by user identification. While the mapping between users and accounts is unknown, we propose an unsupervised learning-based framework, Session-based Heterogeneous graph Embedding for User Identification (SHE-UI), to differentiate and model the preferences of users in an account, and to group sessions by these users. In SHE-UI, a heterogeneous graph is constructed to represent items such as songs and their available metadata such as artists, genres, and albums. An item-based session embedding technique is proposed using a normalized random walk in the heterogeneous graph. Our experiments conducted on two large-scale music streaming datasets, Last.fm and KKBOX, show that SHE-UI not only accurately identifies users, but also significantly improves the performance of item recommendation over the state-of-the-art methods."}}

Software developers have various alternatives to contribute themselves to the communities and collaborate with others. However, nowadays there is no effective recommender suggesting developers appropriate repositories in both the academia and the industry. Although existing one-class collaborative filtering (OCCF) approaches can be applied to this problem, they do not consider particular constraints of social coding such as the programming languages, which, to some extent, associate the repositories with the developers. The aim of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of leveraging user programming language preference to improve the performance of OCCF-based repository recommendation. Based on matrix factorization, we propose language-regularized matrix factorization (LRMF), which is regularized by the relationships between user programming language preferences. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the real-world dataset of GitHub. The results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms five competitive baselines."}}

Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method in terms of constructing reasonable type hierarchy for knowledge base systems."}}

Given a query prefix and its context (e.g., previous queries), conventional context-aware approaches often produce relevant queries to the context. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of exploiting the context to learn user reformulation behavior for boosting prediction performance. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of how the users reformulate their queries. Based on the analysis, we propose a supervised approach to query auto-completion, where three kinds of reformulation-related features are considered, including term-level, query-level and session-level features. These features carefully capture how the users change preceding queries along the query sessions. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the large-scale query log of a commercial search engine. The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement over 4 competitive baselines."}}
