However, its role for Ordinary Differential Equation based networks (Neural ODEs) is still poorly understood. This paper investigates how different normalization techniques affect the performance of Neural ODEs. Particularly, we show that it is possible to achieve $93\\%$ accuracy on the CIFAR-10 classification task, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported accuracy among  Neural ODEs tested on this problem."}}
