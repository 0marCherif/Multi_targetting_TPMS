We propose a novel curriculum learning approach for image classification that adapts the loss function by changing the label representation. The idea is to use a probability distribution over classes as target label, where the class probabilities reflect the similarity to the true class. Gradually, this label representation is shifted towards the standard one-hot-encoding. That is, in the beginning minor mistakes are corrected less than large mistakes, resembling a teaching process in which broad concepts are explained first before subtle differences are taught.\nThe class similarity can be based on prior knowledge. For the special case of the labels being natural words, we propose a generic way to automatically compute the similarities. The natural words are embedded into Euclidean space using a standard word embedding. The probability of each class is then a function of the cosine similarity between the vector representations of the class and the true label. The proposed label-similarity curriculum learning (LCL) approach was empirically evaluated using several popular deep learning architectures for image classification tasks applied to five datasets including ImageNet, CIFAR100, and AWA2. In all scenarios, LCL was able to improve the classification accuracy on the test data compared to standard training. "}}

Contextual bandits are a sub-class of MABs where, at every time step, the learner has access to side information that is predictive of the best arm. Simple regret minimization assumes that the learner only incurs regret after a pure exploration phase. In this work, we study simple regret minimization for contextual bandits. Motivated by applications where the learner has separate training and autonomous modes, we assume that the learner experiences a pure exploration phase, where feedback is received after every action but no regret is incurred, followed by a pure exploitation phase in which regret is incurred but there is no feedback. We present the Contextual-Gap algorithm and establish performance guarantees on the simple regret, i.e., the regret during the pure exploitation phase. Our experiments examine a novel application to adaptive sensor selection for magnetic field estimation in interplanetary spacecraft, and demonstrate considerable improvement over algorithms designed to minimize the cumulative regret."}}

In this work, we propose a multi-task learning framework for contextual bandit problems. Like multi-task learning in the batch setting, the goal is to leverage similarities in contexts for different arms so as to improve the agent's ability to predict rewards from contexts. We propose an upper confidence bound-based multi-task learning algorithm for contextual bandits, establish a corresponding regret bound, and interpret this bound to quantify the advantages of learning in the presence of high task (arm) similarity. We also describe an effective scheme for estimating task similarity from data, and demonstrate our algorithm's performance on several data sets."}}

This problem arises in several applications where data distributions fluctuate because of environmental, technical, or other sources of variation. We introduce a formal framework for DG, and argue that it can be-viewed as a kind of supervised learning problem by augmenting the original feature space with the marginal distribution of feature vectors. While our framework has several connections to conventional analysis of supervised learning algorithms, several unique aspects of DG require new methods of analysis.\n\nThis work lays the learning theoretic foundations of domain generalization, building on our earlier conference paper where the problem of DG was introduced (Blanchard et al., 2011). We present two formal models of data generation, corresponding notions of risk, and distribution-free generalization error analysis. By focusing our attention on kernel methods, we also provide more quantitative results and a universally consistent algorithm. An efficient implementation is provided for this algorithm, which is experimentally compared to a pooling strategy on one synthetic and three real-world data sets."}}

Recent advances in deep clustering and unsupervised representation learning are based on the idea that different views of an input image (generated through data augmentation techniques) must be close in the representation space (exemplar consistency), and/or similar images must have similar cluster assignments (population consistency). We define an additional notion of consistency, consensus consistency, which ensures that representations are learned to induce similar partitions for variations in the representation space, different clustering algorithms or different initializations of a single clustering algorithm. We define a clustering loss by executing variations in the representation space and seamlessly integrate all three consistencies (consensus, exemplar and population) into an end-to-end learning framework.

We dub this situation the resource-constrained setting. This leads to situations where the offline dataset (available for training) can contain fully processed features (using powerful language models, image models, complex sensors, etc.) which are not available when actions are actually taken online.\nThis disconnect leads to an interesting and unexplored problem in offline RL: Is it possible to use a richly processed offline dataset to train a policy which has access to fewer features in the online environment? \nIn this work, we introduce and formalize this novel resource-constrained problem setting. We highlight the performance gap between policies trained using the full offline dataset and policies trained using limited features. \nWe address this performance gap with a policy transfer algorithm which first trains a teacher agent using the offline dataset where features are fully available, and then transfers this knowledge to a student agent that only uses the resource-constrained features. To better capture the challenge of this setting, we propose a data collection procedure: Resource Constrained-Datasets for RL (RC-D4RL). We evaluate our transfer algorithm on RC-D4RL and the popular D4RL benchmarks and observe consistent improvement over the baseline (TD3+BC without transfer)."}}

In this work, we leverage this idea together with ensemble learning to perform clustering and representation learning. Ensemble learning is widely used in the supervised learning setting but has not yet been practical in deep clustering. Previous works on ensemble learning for clustering neither work on the feature space nor learn  features. We propose a novel ensemble learning algorithm dubbed Consensus Clustering with Unsupervised Representation Learning (ConCURL) which learns representations by creating a consensus on multiple clustering outputs. Specifically, we generate a cluster ensemble using random transformations on the embedding space, and define a consensus loss function that measures the disagreement among the constituents of the ensemble. Thus, diverse ensembles minimize this loss function in a synergistic way, which leads to better representations that work with all cluster ensemble constituents. Our proposed method ConCURL is easy to implement and integrate into any representation learning or deep clustering block. ConCURL outperforms all state of the art methods on various computer vision datasets. Specifically, we beat the closest state of the art method by 5.9 percent on the ImageNet-10 dataset, and by 18 percent on the ImageNet-Dogs dataset in terms of clustering accuracy. We further shed some light on the under-studied overfitting issue in clustering and show that our method does not overfit as much as existing methods, and thereby generalizes better for new data samples.

These learned binary representations may then be used in hashing based retrieval methods, typically by retrieving all neighboring elements in the Hamming ball with radius 1 or 2.  Prior studies focus on tasks with a few dozen to a few hundred semantic categories at most, and it is not currently well known how these methods scale to domains with richer semantic structure.  In this study, we focus on learning embeddings for the use in exact hashing retrieval, where Approximate Nearest Neighbor search comprises of a simple table lookup. We propose similarity learning methods in which the optimized similarity is the angular similarity (the probability of collision under SimHash.)  We demonstrate the benefits of these embeddings on a variety of domains, including a coocurrence modelling task on a large scale text corpus; a rich structure of which cannot be handled by a few hundred semantic groups."}}
