Current posturographic practices record the body's center-of-pressure displacement (statokinesigram) while the patient stands on a force platform. Statokinesigrams, after appropriate signal processing, can offer numerous posturographic features, which however challenges the efforts for valid statistics via standard univariate approaches. In this work, we present the ts-AUC, a non-parametric multivariate two-sample test, which we employ to analyze statokinesigram differences among PS patients that are fallers (PSf) and non-fallers (PSNF). We included 123 PS patients who were classified into PSF or PSNF based on clinical assessment and underwent simple Romberg Test (eyes open/eyes closed). We analyzed posturographic features using both multiple testing with p-value adjustment and the ts-AUC. While the ts-AUC showed significant difference between groups (p-value = 0.01), multiple testing did not show any such difference. Interestingly, significant difference between the two groups was found only using the open-eyes protocol. PSF showed significantly increased antero-posterior movements as well as increased posturographic area, compared to PSNF. Our study demonstrates the superiority of the ts-AUC test compared to standard statistical tools in distinguishing PSF and PSNF in the multidimensional feature space. This result highlights more generally the fact that machine learning-based statistical tests can be seen as a natural extension of classical statistical approaches and should be considered, especially when dealing with multifactorial assessments."}}

This approach highlights the local dynamics of the trajectories, and we show that the resulting characterization can be used to provide a global score in order to evaluate the postural control. We evaluate our approach using the statokinesigram of 126 community-dwelling elderly, and show that it provides an efficient tool to discriminate between fallers and non-fallers."}}

Additionally, to fundamental physiological changes, the workload may be also characterized sometimes by contextual task-related elements. We aimed to investigate the workload of helicopter pilots and develop predictive models related to the tasks\u2019 context. Eight pilots completed an unknown case-scenario (~1\u00a0h) in a helicopter simulator. The scenario included changing mission during flight and receiving/transferring an injured subject to the near hospital. We selected interesting scenario\u2019s periods/\u201ctasks\u201d (e.g., searching hospital, urgent landing) where pilots gave oral evaluations (0\u2013100). Performed tasks had various contexts. We developed a multitasking learning approach to \u201cpool together\u201d all tasks because some of them, although different, may carry useful information about others, so they should neither be merged nor be processed totally independently. Interestingly, it seems that physiological and contextual parameters change order of descriptive power, depending on the task."}}

This method is based on the Navier-Stokes equation and a fast iterative algorithm. Its reliability was demonstrated: 1) in a synthetic phantom by comparison against simplified Bernoulli equation applied at peak velocities, and 2) in a healthy subject and a patient with aortic coarctation, in which absolute pressure distribution within the aortic arch was consistent with established physiopathological knowledge. Such local absolute aortic pressures may be useful in the understanding of hemodynamic changes secondary to cardiovascular alterations. Also, their addition to the already available indices of risk of aortic complications such as dilatation and dissection definition may prove of major clinical usefulness."}}
