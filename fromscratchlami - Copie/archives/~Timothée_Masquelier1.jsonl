In CNNs, RFs can simply be enlarged by increasing the convolution kernel sizes. Yet the number of trainable parameters, which scales quadratically with the kernel's size in the 2D case, rapidly becomes prohibitive, and the training is notoriously difficult. This paper presents a new method to increase the RF size without increasing the number of parameters. The dilated convolution (DC) has already been proposed for the same purpose. DC can be seen as a convolution with a kernel that contains only a few non-zero elements placed on a regular grid. Here we present a new version of the DC in which the spacings between the non-zero elements, or equivalently their positions, are no longer fixed but learnable via backpropagation thanks to an interpolation technique. We call this method \u201cDilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings\u201d (DCLS) and generalize it to the n-dimensional convolution case. However, our main focus here will be on the 2D case. We first tried our approach on ResNet50: we drop-in replaced the standard convolutions with DCLS ones, which increased the accuracy of ImageNet1k classification at iso-parameters, but at the expense of the throughput. Next, we used the recent ConvNeXt state-of-the-art convolutional architecture and drop-in replaced the depthwise convolutions with DCLS ones. This not only increased the accuracy of ImageNet1k classification but also of typical downstream and robustness tasks, again at iso-parameters but this time with negligible cost on throughput, as ConvNeXt uses separable convolutions. Conversely, classic DC led to poor performance with both ResNet50 and ConvNeXt. The code of the method is based on PyTorch and available at: https://github.com/K-H-Ismail/Dilated-Convolution-with-Learnable-Spacings-PyTorch."}}

Despite this, the binary firing characteristic makes training SNNs more challenging. To learn the parameters of deep SNNs in an event-driven fashion as in inference of SNNs, backpropagation with respect to spike timing is proposed. Although this event-driven learning has the advantages of lower computational cost and memory occupation, the accuracy is far below the recurrent neural network-like learning approaches. In this paper, we first analyze the commonly used temporal backpropagation training approach and prove that the sum of gradients remains unchanged between fully-connected and convolutional layers. Secondly, we show that the max pooling layer meets the above invariance rule, while the average pooling layer does not, which will suffer the gradient vanishing problem but can be revised to meet the requirement. Thirdly, we point out the reverse gradient problem for time-based gradients and propose a backward kernel that can solve this problem and keep the property of the invariable sum of gradients. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR10 among time-based training methods. Also, this is the first time that the time-based backpropagation approach successfully trains SNN on the CIFAR100 dataset.

In this work, we report speech command (SC) recognition experiments using supervised SNNs. We explored the Leaky-Integrate-Fire (LIF) neuron model for this task, and show that a model comprised of stacked dilated convolution spiking layers can reach an error rate very close to standard DNNs on the Google SC v1 dataset: 5.5%, while keeping a very sparse spiking activity, below 5%, thank to a new regularization term. We also show that modeling the leakage of the neuron membrane potential is useful, since the LIF model outperformed its non-leaky model counterpart significantly."}}

However, the non-differentiability of spiking neurons makes the backpropagation of error a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a new temporal learning algorithm, STiDi-BP, in which we ignore backward recursive gradient computation, and to avoid the non-differentiability of SNNs, we use a linear approximation to compute the derivative of latency with respect to the potential. We apply gradient descent to each layer independently based on an estimation of the temporal error in that layer. To do so, we calculate the desired firing time of each neuron and compare it to its actual firing time. In STiDi-BP, we employ the time-to-first-spike temporal coding, one spike per neuron, and use spiking neuron models with piecewise linear postsynaptic potential which provide large computational benefits. To evaluate the performance of the proposed learning rule, we run three experiments on the XOR problem, the face/motorbike categories of the Caltech 101 dataset, and the MNIST dataset. Experimental results show that the STiDi-BP outperforms traditional BP in terms of accuracy and/or computational cost."}}

At inference time, thresholds are applied on the confidence scores outputted by a probabilistic classifier, in order to decide which classes are detected active. In this work, we consider having at disposal a trained classifier and we seek to automatically optimize the decision thresholds according to a performance metric of interest, in our case F-measure (micro-F1). We propose a new method, called SGL-Thresh for Surrogate Gradient Learning of Thresholds, that makes use of gradient descent. Since F1 is not differentiable, we propose to approximate the thresholding operation gradients with the gradients of a sigmoid function. We report experiments on three datasets, using state-of-the-art pre-trained deep neural networks. In all cases, SGL-Thresh outperformed three other approaches: a default threshold value (defThresh), an heuristic search algorithm and a method estimating F1 gradients numerically. It reached 54.9\\% F1 on AudioSet eval, compared to 50.7% with defThresh. SGL-Thresh is very fast and scalable to a large number of tags.

That means, for instance, high priority requirements for an audio conference and low ones for a file transfer, to enhance user experience. As internet traffic becomes increasingly encrypted, the mainstream classic traffic recognition technique, payload inspection, is rendered ineffective. This paper uses machine learning techniques for encrypted traffic classification, looking only at packet size and time of arrival. Spiking neural networks (SNN), largely inspired by how biological neurons operate, were used for two reasons. Firstly, they are able to recognize time-related data packet features. Secondly, they can be implemented efficiently on neuromorphic hardware with a low energy footprint. Here we used a very simple feedforward SNN, with only one fully-connected hidden layer, and trained in a supervised manner using the newly introduced method known as Surrogate Gradient Learning. Surprisingly, such a simple SNN reached an accuracy of 95.9% on ISCX datasets, outperforming previous approaches. Besides better accuracy, there is also a very significant improvement on simplicity: input size, number of neurons, trainable parameters are all reduced by one to four orders of magnitude. Next, we analyzed the reasons for this good accuracy. It turns out that, beyond spatial (i.e. packet size) features, the SNN also exploits temporal ones, mostly the nearly synchronous (within a 200ms range) arrival times of packets with certain sizes. Taken together, these results show that SNNs are an excellent fit for encrypted internet traffic classification: they can be more accurate than conventional artificial neural networks (ANN), and they could be implemented efficiently on low power embedded systems."}}
