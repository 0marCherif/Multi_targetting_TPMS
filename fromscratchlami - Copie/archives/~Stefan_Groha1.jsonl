As opposed to classical approaches to survival analysis which include only alive-dead transitions, states can be competing in nature and transient, enabling richer modelling of complex clinical event series. Classical multi-state models, such as the Cox-Markov model, struggle to capture idiosyncratic, non-linear, time dependent, or high-dimensional covariates for which more sophisticated machine learning models are needed. Recently proposed extensions can overcome these limitations, however, they do not allow for uncertainty quantification of the model prediction, and typically have limited interpretability at the individual or population level. Here, we introduce SurviVAEl, a multi-state survival framework based on a VAE architecture, enabling uncertainty quantification and interpretable patient trajectory clustering."}}

Advances like the Cox proportional hazard model have enabled researchers to better describe hazard rates for the occurrence of single fatal events, but are unable to accurately model competing events and transitions. Common phenomena are often better described through multiple states, for example: the progress of a disease modeled as healthy, sick and dead instead of healthy and dead, where the competing nature of death and disease has to be taken into account. Moreover, Cox models are limited by modeling assumptions, like proportionality of hazard rates and linear effects. Individual characteristics can vary significantly between observational units, like patients, resulting in idiosyncratic hazard rates and different disease trajectories. These considerations require flexible modeling assumptions. To overcome these issues, we propose the use of neural ordinary differential equations as a flexible and general method for estimating multi-state survival models by directly solving the Kolmogorov forward equations. To quantify the uncertainty in the resulting individual cause-specific hazard rates, we further introduce a variational latent variable model and show that this enables meaningful clustering with respect to multi-state outcomes as well as interpretability regarding covariate values. We show that our model exhibits state-of-the-art performance on popular survival data sets and demonstrate its efficacy in a multi-state setting"}}

Recent data collections provide a comprehensive characterization of cancer cell data, including genetic data on copy number alterations (CNAs). We explore the potential to capture information contained in cancer genomic information using a novel topology-based approach that encodes each cancer sample as a persistence diagram of topological features, i.e., high-dimensional voids represented in the data. We find that this technique has the potential to extract meaningful low-dimensional representations in cancer somatic genetic data and demonstrate the viability of some applications on finding substructures in cancer data as well as comparing similarity of cancer types."}}
