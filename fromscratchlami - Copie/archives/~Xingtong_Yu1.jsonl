To address this issue, we propose the Pixel Adapter Module (PAM) based on graph attention to address pixel distortion caused by upsampling. The PAM effectively captures local structural information by allowing each pixel to interact with its neighbors and update features. Unlike previous graph attention mechanisms, our approach achieves 2-3 orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency and memory utilization by eliminating the dependency on sparse adjacency matrices and introducing a sliding window approach for efficient parallel computation.

When classifying categories at different hierarchy levels, traditional uni-modal approaches focus primarily on image features, revealing limitations in complex scenarios. Recent studies integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with class hierarchies have shown promise, yet they fall short of fully exploiting the hierarchical relationships. These efforts are constrained by their inability to perform effectively across varied granularity of categories. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework (HGCLIP) that effectively combines CLIP with a deeper exploitation of the Hierarchical class structure via Graph representation learning. We explore constructing the class hierarchy into a graph, with its nodes representing the textual or image features of each category. After passing through a graph encoder, the textual features incorporate hierarchical structure information, while the image features emphasize class-aware features derived from prototypes through the attention mechanism. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements on both generic and fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks. Our codes are fully available at https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/HGCLIP."}}

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique for graph representation learning. However, their efficacy within an end-to-end supervised framework is significantly tied to the availabilityof task-specific labels. To mitigate labeling costs and enhance robustness in few-shot settings, pre-training on self-supervised tasks has emerged as a promising method, while prompting has been proposed to further narrow the objective gap between pretext and downstream tasks. Although there has been some initial exploration of prompt-based learning on graphs, they primarily leverage a single pretext task, resulting in a limited subset of general knowledge that could be learned from the pre-training data. Hence, in this paper, we propose MultiGPrompt, a novel multi-task pre-training and prompting framework to exploit multiple pretext tasks for more comprehensive pre-trained knowledge. First, in pre-training, we design a set of pretext tokens to synergize multiple pretext tasks. Second, we propose a dual-prompt mechanism consisting of composed and open prompts to leverage task-specific and global pre-training knowledge, to guide downstream tasks in few-shot settings.
