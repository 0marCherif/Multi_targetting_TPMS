Through a back-and-forth dialogue, users can quickly hone in on just the right items. Many approaches to conversational recommendation, however, only partially explore the user preference space and make limiting assumptions about how user feedback can be best incorporated, resulting in long dialogues and poor recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel conversational recommendation framework with two unique features: (i) a greedy NDCG attribute selector, to enhance user personalization in the interactive preference elicitation process by prioritizing attributes that most effectively represent the actual preference space of the user; and (ii) a user representation refiner, to effectively fuse together the user preferences collected from the interactive elicitation process to obtain a more personalized understanding of the user. Through extensive experiments on four frequently used datasets, we find the proposed framework not only outperforms all the state-of-the-art conversational recommenders (in terms of both recommendation performance and conversation efficiency), but also provides a more personalized experience for the user under the proposed multi-groundtruth multi-round conversational recommendation setting."}}

They can accurately capture a user's current detailed preference -- through a multi-round interaction cycle -- to effectively guide users to a more personalized recommendation. Alas, conversational recommender systems can be plagued by the adverse effects of bias, much like traditional recommenders. In this work, we argue for increased attention on the presence of and methods for counteracting bias in these emerging systems. As a starting point, we propose three fundamental questions that should be deeply examined to enable fairness in conversational recommender systems."}}

Perhaps surprisingly, conversational recommender systems can be plagued by popularity bias, much like traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we systematically study the problem of popularity bias in CRSs. We demonstrate the existence of popularity bias in existing state-of-the-art CRSs from an exposure rate, a success rate, and a conversational utility perspective, and propose a suite of popularity bias metrics designed specifically for the CRS setting. We then introduce a debiasing framework with three unique features: (i) Popularity-Aware Focused Learning to reduce the popularity-distorting impact on preference prediction; (ii) Cold-Start Item Embedding Reconstruction via Attribute Mapping, to improve the modeling of cold-start items; and (iii) Dual-Policy Learning, to better guide the CRS when dealing with either popular or unpopular items. Through extensive experiments on two frequently used CRS datasets, we find the proposed model-agnostic debiasing framework not only mitigates the popularity bias in state-of-the-art CRSs but also improves the overall recommendation performance."}}

Recent studies on open-book QG, where supportive answer-context pairs are provided to models, have achieved promising progress. However, generating natural questions under a more practical closed-book setting that lacks these supporting documents still remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a new QG model for this closed-book setting that is designed to better understand the semantics of long-form abstractive answers and store more information in its parameters through contrastive learning and an answer reconstruction module. Through experiments, we validate the proposed QG model on both public datasets and a new WikiCQA dataset. Empirical results show that the proposed QG model outperforms baselines in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. In addition, we show how to leverage the proposed model to improve existing question-answering systems. These results further indicate the effectiveness of our QG model for enhancing closed-book question-answering tasks."}}
