New methods in brain imaging are emerging that have the speed and resolution to capture events in the brain at the pace at which neurons typically communicate. These methods measure voltage in neurons by using light, and therefore can access very detailed brain signaling patterns. However, the adoption of these methods by a larger community, and not a restricted set of experts, is limited by the lack of computational tools, thereby greatly hindering progress in this field. In this paper, we present VolPy, a software framework that greatly facilitates the preprocessing of this new type of imaging datasets. This pipeline incorporates efficient and optimized algorithms that can identify neurons and extract their activity with great accuracy. The presented software will make this new imaging modality accessible to a wide audience."}}

Whereas previous methods required the specimen to be stable, e.g. anesthetized or head-fixed, new brain imaging techniques using microendoscopic lenses and miniaturized microscopes have enabled deep brain imaging in freely moving mice. However, the very large background fluctuations, the inevitable movements and distortions of imaging field, and the extensive spatial overlaps of fluorescent signals complicate the goal of efficiently extracting accurate estimates of neural activity from the observed video data. Further, current activity extraction methods are computationally expensive due to the complex background model and are typically applied to imaging data long after the experiment is complete. Moreover, in some scenarios it is necessary to perform experiments in real-time and closed-loop\u2014analyzing data on-the-fly to guide the next experimental steps or to control feedback \u2013, and this calls for new methods for accurate real-time processing. Here we address both issues by adapting a popular extraction method to operate online and extend it to utilize GPU hardware that enables real time processing. Our algorithms yield similar high-quality results as the original offline approach, but outperform it with regard to computing time and memory requirements. Our results enable faster and scalable analysis, and open the door to new closed-loop experiments in deep brain areas and on freely-moving preparations. Our algorithms can be used for newly enabled real-time analysis of streaming data, as well as swapped in directly to replace the computationally costly offline approach."}}

For example, associating spatial locations with rewards requires to predict not only expected reward at new spatial locations but also its uncertainty to avoid catastrophic events and forage safely. A powerful and flexible framework for nonlinear regression that takes uncertainty into account in a principled Bayesian manner is Gaussian process (GP) regression. Here I propose that the brain implements GP regression and present neural networks (NNs) for it. First layer neurons, e.g.\\ hippocampal place cells, have tuning curves that correspond to evaluations of the GP kernel. Output neurons explicitly and distinctively encode predictive mean and variance, as observed in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) for the case of reward prediction. Because the weights of a NN implementing exact GP regression do not arise with biological plasticity rules, I present approximations to obtain local (anti-)Hebbian synaptic learning rules. The resulting neuronal network approximates the full GP well compared to popular sparse GP approximations and achieves comparable predictive performance."}}

In this technique, a fluorescent calcium indicator changes its brightness when a neuron fires an action potential due to an associated increase in intracellular calcium. However, while a number of algorithms have been proposed for estimating spike rates from the measured signal, the problem is far from solved. We organized a public competition using a data set for which ground truth data was available. Participants were given a training set to develop new algorithms, and the performance of the algorithms was evaluated on a hidden test set. Here we report on the results of this competition and discuss the progress made towards better algorithms to infer spiking activity from imaging data."}}

These limits often mean that only a small fraction of the activity of large neuronal populations can be observed at high spatio-temporal resolution. For imaging of very large populations with single cell resolution, temporal resolution is typically sacrificed. Here we propose a multi-scale approach to achieve single cell precision using fast imaging at reduced spatial resolution. In the first phase the spatial location and shape of each neuron is obtained at standard spatial resolution; in the second phase imaging is performed at much lower spatial resolution. We show that we can apply a demixing algorithm to accurately recover each neuron\u2019s activity from the low-resolution data by exploiting the high-resolution cellular maps estimated in the first imaging phase. Thus by decreasing the spatial resolution in the second phase, we can compress the video data significantly, and potentially acquire images over an order-of-magnitude larger area, or image at significantly higher temporal resolution, with minimal loss in accuracy of the recovered neuronal activity. We evaluate this approach on real data from light-sheet and 2-photon calcium imaging."}}

Here we introduce OnACID, an Online framework for the Analysis of streaming Calcium Imaging Data, including i) motion artifact correction, ii) neuronal source extraction, and iii) activity denoising and deconvolution. Our approach combines and extends previous work on online dictionary learning and calcium imaging data analysis, to deliver an automated pipeline that can discover and track the activity of hundreds of cells in real time, thereby enabling new types of closed-loop experiments. We apply our algorithm on two large scale experimental datasets, benchmark its performance on manually annotated data, and show that it outperforms a popular offline approach."}}

Our approach follows previous work in casting the activity extraction problem as a sparse nonnegative deconvolution problem. To solve this optimization problem, we introduce a new algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster than previous methods, and progresses through the data sequentially from beginning to end, thus enabling, in principle, real-time online estimation of neural activity during the imaging session. This computational advance thus opens the door to new closed-loop experiments."}}
