One of the most popular type of models is graph attention networks. These models were introduced to allow a node to aggregate information from the features of neighbor nodes in a non-uniform way, in contrast to simple graph convolution which does not distinguish the neighbors of a node. In this paper, we study theoretically this expected behaviour of graph attention networks. We prove multiple results on the performance of the graph attention mechanism for the problem of node classification for a contextual stochastic block model. Here the features of the nodes are obtained from a mixture of Gaussians and the edges from a stochastic block model where the features and the edges are coupled in a natural way. First, we show that in an \"easy\" regime, where the distance between the means of the Gaussians is large enough, graph attention is able to distinguish inter-class from intra-class edges, and thus it maintains the weights of important edges and significantly reduces the weights of unimportant edges. As a corollary, we show that this implies perfect node classification. However, a classical argument shows that in the \"easy\" regime, the graph is not needed at all to classify the data with high probability. In the \"hard\" regime, we show that every attention mechanism fails to distinguish intra-class from inter-class edges. We evaluate our theoretical results on synthetic and real-world data."}}

However, higher-order relations in practice contain complex patterns and are often highly irregular. So, it is often challenging to design an HNN that suffices to express those relations while keeping computational efficiency. Inspired by hypergraph diffusion algorithms, this work proposes a new HNN architecture named ED-HNN, which provably approximates any continuous equivariant hypergraph diffusion operators that can model a wide range of higher-order relations. ED-HNN can be implemented efficiently by combining star expansions of hypergraphs with standard message passing neural networks. ED-HNN further shows great superiority in processing heterophilic hypergraphs and constructing deep models. We evaluate ED-HNN for node classification on nine real-world hypergraph datasets. ED-HNN uniformly outperforms the best baselines over these nine datasets and achieves more than 2%$\\uparrow$ in prediction accuracy over four datasets therein. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Graph-COM/ED-HNN."}}

{"id": "HCkJQJyoHN", "cdate": 1621629827484, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Local Hyper-Flow Diffusion", "abstract": "Recently, hypergraphs have attracted a lot of attention due to their ability to capture complex relations among entities. The insurgence of hypergraphs has resulted in data of increasing size and complexity that exhibit interesting small-scale and local structure, e.g., small-scale communities and localized node-ranking around a given set of seed nodes. Popular and principled ways to capture the local structure are the local hypergraph clustering problem and the related seed set expansion problem. In this work, we propose the first local diffusion method that achieves edge-size-independent Cheeger-type guarantee for the problem of local hypergraph clustering while applying to a rich class of higher-order relations that covers a number of previously studied special cases. Our method is based on a primal-dual optimization formulation where the primal problem has a natural network flow interpretation, and the dual problem has a cut-based interpretation using the $\\ell_2$-norm penalty on associated cut-costs. We demonstrate the new technique is significantly better than state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world data.\n"}}

Establishing cost-effective pandemic control policies requires identifying good targets. New computational models from network theory and epidemic simulations over real contact networks provide a valuable tool for finding the right bottlenecks to target upon. Here we study a computationally efficient network centrality measure that enables us to detect local transmission bottlenecks, i.e., contact edges that are especially important for the spread of disease among small communities or local network structures inside large networks. We find that pandemic intervention strategies that target at local network structures significantly outperform interventions that solely focus on the entire network structure as a whole, which are traditionally believed to be the most effective."}}

Sparsity, on the other hand, is a common characteristic of MIP problems, and it is an important part of why the simplex method works so well inside branch-and-cut. In this work, we evaluate the strength of split cuts that exploit sparsity. In particular, we show that restricting ourselves to sparse disjunctions\u2014and furthermore, ones that have small disjunctive coefficients\u2014still leads to a significant portion of the total gap closed with arbitrary split cuts. We also show how to exploit sparsity structure that is implicit in the MIP formulation to produce splits that are sparse yet still effective. Our results indicate that one possibility to produce good split cuts is to try and exploit such structure."}}
