While many alternatives exist, this is often achieved by adding a border of zeros around the inputs. In this work, we show that adversarial attacks often result in perturbation anomalies at the image boundaries, which are the areas where padding is used. Consequently, we aim to provide an analysis of the interplay between padding and adversarial attacks and seek an answer to the question of how different padding modes (or their absence) affect adversarial robustness in various scenarios."}}

Amongst the severest ones is the sensitivity to distribution shifts which allows models to be easily fooled into wrong predictions by small perturbations to inputs that are often imperceivable to humans and do not have to carry semantic meaning. Adversarial training poses a partial solution to address this issue by training models on worst-case perturbations. Yet, recent work has also pointed out that the reasoning in neural networks is different from humans. Humans identify objects by shape, while neural nets mainly employ texture cues. Exemplarily, a model trained on photographs will likely fail to generalize to datasets containing sketches. Interestingly, it was also shown that adversarial training seems to favorably increase the shift toward shape bias. In this work, we revisit this observation and provide an extensive analysis of this effect on various architectures, the common \u2113 <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> - and \u2113 <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</inf> -training, and Transformer-based models. Further, we provide a possible explanation for this phenomenon from a frequency perspective."}}

However, designing effective out-of-distribution tests that encompass all possible scenarios while preserving accurate label information is a challenging task. Existing methodologies often entail a compromise between variety and constraint levels for attacks and sometimes even both. In a first step towards a more holistic robustness evaluation of image classification models, we introduce an attack method based on image solarization that is conceptually straightforward yet avoids jeopardizing the global structure of natural images independent of the intensity. Through comprehensive evaluations of multiple ImageNet models, we demonstrate the attack's capacity to degrade accuracy significantly, provided it is not integrated into the training augmentations. Interestingly, even then, no full immunity to accuracy deterioration is achieved. In other settings, the attack can often be simplified into a black-box attack with model-independent parameters. Defenses against other corruptions do not consistently extend to be effective against our specific attack. Project website: https://github.com/paulgavrikov/adversarial_solarization"}}
