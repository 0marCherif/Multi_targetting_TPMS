However, generalization of these tools is currently limited by sensitivity to variations in tissue preparation, staining procedures and scanning equipment that lead to domain shift in digitized slides. To overcome this limitation and improve model generalization, we studied the effectiveness of two Synthetic DOmain-Targeted Augmentation (S-DOTA) methods, namely CycleGAN-enabled Scanner Transform (ST) and targeted Stain Vector Augmentation (SVA), and compared them against the International Color Consortium (ICC) profile-based color calibration (ICC Cal) method and a baseline method using traditional brightness, color and noise augmentations. We evaluated the ability of these techniques to improve model generalization to various tasks and settings: four models, two model types (tissue segmentation and cell classification), two loss functions, six labs, six scanners, and three indications (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), prostate adenocarcinoma). We compared these methods based on the macro-averaged F1 scores on in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets across multiple domains, and found that S-DOTA methods (i.e., ST and SVA) led to significant improvements over ICC Cal and baseline on OOD data while maintaining comparable performance on ID data. Thus, we demonstrate that S-DOTA may help address generalization due to domain shift in real world applications."}}

Machine learning problems in medical imaging often deal with rare diseases, making it important for these models to work in a label-imbalanced setting. Furthermore, these imbalances can occur in out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets when the models are deployed in the real-world. We leverage the idea that decoupling feature and classifier learning can lead to improved decision boundaries for label imbalanced datasets. To this end, we investigate the integration of supervised contrastive learning with multiple instance learning (SC-MIL). Specifically, we propose a joint-training MIL framework in the presence of label imbalance that progressively transitions from learning bag-level representations to optimal classifier learning. We perform experiments with different imbalance settings for two well-studied problems in cancer pathology: subtyping of non-small cell lung cancer and subtyping of renal cell carcinoma. SC-MIL provides large and consistent improvements over other techniques on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD held-out sets across multiple imbalanced settings."}}

In this work, we propose a simple formulation of MIL models, which enables interpretability while maintaining similar predictive performance. Our Additive MIL models enable spatial credit assignment such that the contribution of each region in the image can be exactly computed and visualized. We show that our spatial credit assignment coincides with regions used by pathologists during diagnosis and improves upon classical attention heatmaps from attention MIL models. We show that any existing MIL model can be made additive with a simple change in function composition. We also show how these models can debug model failures, identify spurious features, and highlight class-wise regions of interest, enabling their use in high-stakes environments such as clinical decision-making."}}

Collecting annotations in histopathology requires highly specialized pathologists, making it expensive and time-consuming. Self-training can alleviate annotation constraints by learning from both labeled and unlabeled data, reducing the amount of annotations required from pathologists. We study the design of teacher-student self-training systems for Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) using clinical histopathology datasets with limited annotations. We evaluate the models on in-distribution and out-of-distribution test data under clinical data shifts. We demonstrate that through self-training, the best student model statistically outperforms the teacher with a $3\\%$ absolute difference on the macro F1 score. The best student model also approaches the performance of a fully supervised model trained with twice as many annotations."}}

However, standard ML models often lack the rigorous evaluation required for clinical decisions. Machine learning techniques for natural images are ill-equipped to deal with pathology images that are significantly large and noisy, require expensive labeling, are hard to interpret, and are susceptible to spurious correlations. We propose a set of practical guidelines for ML evaluation in pathology that address the above concerns. The paper includes measures for setting up the evaluation framework, effectively dealing with variability in labels, and a recommended suite of tests to address issues related to domain shift, robustness, and confounding variables. We hope that the proposed framework will bridge the gap between ML researchers and domain experts, leading to wider adoption of ML techniques in pathology and improving patient outcomes."}}
