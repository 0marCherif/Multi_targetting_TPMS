Through representation learning and alignment with real-world offline data, Stasis allows for the evaluation of RL algorithms in offline environments with adjustable characteristics, such as observability, heterogeneity and levels of missing data. We aim to introduce environments the encourage training  RL agents that are capable of maintaining a level of performance and robustness comparable to agents trained in real-world online environments, while avoiding the high cost and risks associated with making mistakes during online training. We provide examples of two environments that will be part of Stasis and discuss its implications for the deployment of RL-based systems in sensitive and high-risk areas of application."}}

This is a potential biomarker for neurodegeneration, e.g. as part of Alzheimer's disease. Early detection of neurodegeneration manifesting as a higher brain age can potentially facilitate better medical care and planning for affected individuals. Many studies have been proposed for the prediction of chronological age from brain MRI using machine learning and specifically deep learning techniques. Contrary to most studies, which use the whole brain volume, in this study, we develop a new deep learning approach that uses 3D patches of the brain as well as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop a localised brain age estimator. In this way, we can obtain a visualization of the regions that play the most important role for estimating brain age, leading to more anatomically driven and interpretable results, and thus confirming relevant literature which suggests that the ventricles and the hippocampus are the areas that are most informative. In addition, we leverage this knowledge in order to improve the overall performance on the task of age estimation by combining the results of different patches using an ensemble method, such as averaging or linear regression. The network is trained on the UK Biobank dataset and the method achieves state-of-the-art results with a Mean Absolute Error of 2.46 years for purely regional estimates, and 2.13 years for an ensemble of patches before bias correction, while 1.96 years after bias correction."}}

Typically, models are defined with respect to a parameter space, where non-equal parameters can produce the same input-output map. Our proposed method, GENNI, allows us to efficiently identify parameters that are functionally equivalent and then visualise the subspace of the resulting equivalence class. By doing so, we are now able to better explore questions surrounding identifiability, with applications to optimisation and generalizability, for commonly used or newly developed neural network architectures."}}

While convolutional layers map between high-order activation tensors, the fully connected layers operate on flattened activation vectors. Despite empirical success, this approach has notable drawbacks. Flattening followed by fully connected layers discards multilinear structure in the activations and requires many parameters. We address these problems by incorporating tensor algebraic operations that preserve multilinear structure at every layer. First, we introduce Tensor Contraction Layers (TCLs) that reduce the dimensionality of their input while preserving their multilinear structure using tensor contraction. Next, we introduce Tensor Regression Layers (TRLs), which express outputs through a low-rank multilinear mapping from a high-order activation tensor to an output tensor of arbitrary order. We learn the contraction and regression factors end-to-end, and produce accurate nets with fewer parameters. Additionally, our layers regularize networks by imposing low-rank constraints on the activations (TCL) and regression weights (TRL). Experiments on ImageNet show that, applied to VGG and ResNet architectures, TCLs and TRLs reduce the number of parameters compared to fully connected layers by more than 65% while maintaining or increasing accuracy. In addition to the space savings, our approach's ability to leverage topological structure can be crucial for structured data such as MRI. In particular, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over comparable architectures on three tasks associated with the UK Biobank dataset."}}

Yet, conventional pricing strategies are based on business rules that are poorly optimized and do not respond to changing market conditions. This paper describes the dynamic pricing model developed by Deepair solutions, an AI technology provider for travel suppliers. We present a pricing model that provides dynamic pricing recommendations specific to each customer interaction and optimizes expected revenue per customer. The unique nature of personalized pricing provides the opportunity to search over the market space to find the optimal price-point of each ancillary for each customer, without violating customer privacy. In this paper, we present and compare three approaches for dynamic pricing of ancillaries, with increasing levels of sophistication: (1) a two-stage forecasting and optimization model using a logistic mapping function; (2) a two-stage model that uses a deep neural network for forecasting, coupled with a revenue maximization technique using discrete exhaustive search; (3) a single-stage end-to-end deep neural network that recommends the optimal price. We describe the performance of these models based on both offline and online evaluations. We also measure the real-world business impact of these approaches by deploying them in an A/B test on an airline's internet booking website. We show that traditional machine learning techniques outperform human rule-based approaches in an online setting by improving conversion by 36% and revenue per offer by 10%. We also provide results for our offline experiments which show that deep learning algorithms outperform traditional machine learning techniques for this problem. Our end-to-end deep learning model is currently being deployed by the airline in their booking system."}}

However, they have limited generalization ability to data outside the training domain, and a lack of robustness to noise and adversarial attacks. By building better inductive biases, we can improve robustness and also obtain smaller networks that are more memory and computationally efficient. While standard CNNs use matrix computations, we study tensor layers that involve higher-order computations and provide better inductive bias. Specifically, we impose low-rank tensor structures on the weights of tensor regression layers to obtain compact networks, and propose tensor dropout, a randomization in the tensor rank for robustness. We show that our approach outperforms other methods for large-scale image classification on ImageNet and CIFAR-100. We establish a new state-of-the-art accuracy for phenotypic trait prediction on the largest dataset of brain MRI, the UK Biobank brain MRI dataset, where multi-linear structure is paramount. In all cases, we demonstrate superior performance and significantly improved robustness, both to noisy inputs and to adversarial attacks. We rigorously validate the theoretical validity of our approach by establishing the link between our randomized decomposition and non-linear dropout."}}

In this work, we introduce an adaptive meta-decision framework that uses Thompson sampling, a popular multi-armed bandit solution method, to route customer requests to various pricing models based on their online performance. We show that this adaptive approach outperform a uniformly random selection policy by improving the expected revenue per offer by 43% and conversion score by 58% in an offline simulation."}}
