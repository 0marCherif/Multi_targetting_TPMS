However, GCN based traffic flow forecasting methods often fail to simultaneously capture the short-term and long-term temporal relations carried by the traffic flow data, and also suffer the over-smoothing problem. To overcome the problems, we propose a hierarchical traffic flow forecasting network by merging newly designed the long-term temporal Transformer network (LTT) and the spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (STGC). Specifically, LTT aims to learn the long-term temporal relations among the traffic flow data, while the STGC module aims to capture the short-term temporal relations and spatial relations among the traffic flow data, respectively, via cascading between the one-dimensional convolution and the graph convolution. In addition, an attention fusion mechanism is proposed to combine the long-term with the short-term temporal relations as the input of the graph convolution layer in STGC, in order to mitigate the over-smoothing problem of GCN. Experimental results on three public traffic flow datasets prove the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method."}}

However, existing deep clustering methods usually ignore the relationship between the data. Fortunately, the graph convolutional network can handle such relationships, opening a new research direction for deep clustering. In this paper, we propose a cross-attention based deep clustering framework, named Cross-Attention Fusion based Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (CaEGCN), which contains four main modules: the cross-attention fusion module which innovatively concatenates the Content Auto-encoder module (CAE) relating to the individual data and Graph Convolutional Auto-encoder module (GAE) relating to the relationship between the data in a layer-by-layer manner, and the self-supervised model that highlights the discriminative information for clustering tasks. While the cross-attention fusion module fuses two kinds of heterogeneous representation, the CAE module supplements the content information for the GAE module, which avoids the over-smoothing problem of GCN. In the GAE module, two novel loss functions are proposed that reconstruct the content and relationship between the data, respectively. Finally, the self-supervised module constrains the distributions of the middle layer representations of CAE and GAE to be consistent. Experimental results on different types of datasets prove the superiority and robustness of the proposed CaEGCN."}}

Existing approaches adopt the tensor nuclear norm (TNN) as a convex approximation of non-convex tensor rank function. However, TNN treats the different singular values equally and over-penalizes the main rank components, leading to sub-optimal tensor representation. In this paper, we devise a better surrogate of tensor rank, namely the tensor logarithmic Schatten- <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$p$</tex-math></inline-formula> norm ( <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{TLS}_{p}$</tex-math></inline-formula> N), which fully considers the physical difference between singular values by the non-convex and non-linear penalty function. Further, a tensor logarithmic Schatten- <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$p$</tex-math></inline-formula> norm minimization ( <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{TLS}_{p}$</tex-math></inline-formula> NM)-based multi-view subspace clustering ( <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{TLS}_{p}$</tex-math></inline-formula> NM-MSC) model is proposed. Specially, the proposed <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{TLS}_{p}$</tex-math></inline-formula> NM can not only protect the larger singular values encoded with useful structural information, but also remove the smaller ones encoded with redundant information. Thus, the learned tensor representation with compact low-rank structure will well explore the complementary information and accurately characterize the high-order correlation among multi-views. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to solve the non-convex multi-block <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{TLS}_{p}$</tex-math></inline-formula> NM-MSC model where the challenging <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{TLS}_{p}$</tex-math></inline-formula> NM problem is carefully handled. Importantly, the algorithm convergence analysis is mathematically established by showing that the sequence generated by the algorithm is of Cauchy and converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point.

However, most existing KGC methods generally fail to handle the complex concepts hidden in triplets, so the learned embeddings of entities or relations may deviate from the true situation. In this article, we propose a novel Multi-concept Representation Learning (McRL) method for the KGC task, which mainly consists of a multi-concept representation module, a deep residual attention module, and an interaction embedding module. Specifically, instead of the single-feature representation, the multi-concept representation module projects each entity or relation to multiple vectors to capture the complex conceptual information hidden in them. The deep residual attention module simultaneously explores the inter- and intra-connection between entities and relations to enhance the entity and relation embeddings corresponding to the current contextual situation. Moreover, the interaction embedding module further weakens the noise and ambiguity to obtain the optimal and robust embeddings. We conduct the link prediction experiment to evaluate the proposed method on several standard datasets, and experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art KGC methods."}}
