Human motion sequences are represented by multivariate time series in the joint-trajectories space. Under this structured time series framework, we first propose Kernelized Temporal Cut (KTC), an extension of previous works on change-point detection by incorporating Hilbert space embedding of distributions, to handle the nonparametric and high dimensionality issues of human motions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which yields realtime segmentation, and produces high action segmentation accuracy. Second, a spatio-temporal manifold framework is proposed to model the latent structure of time series data. Then an efficient spatio-temporal alignment algorithm Dynamic Manifold Warping (DMW) is proposed for multivariate time series to calculate motion similarity between action sequences (segments). Furthermore, by combining the temporal segmentation algorithm and the alignment algorithm, online human action recognition can be performed by associating a few labeled examples from motion capture data. The results on human motion capture data and 3D depth sensor data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in automatically segmenting and recognizing motion sequences, and its ability to handle noisy and partially occluded data, in the transfer learning module."}}

In the local learning stage, RMMSL efficiently estimates local tangent space by weighted low-rank matrix factorization. In the global learning stage, we propose a robust manifold clustering method based on local structure learning results. The proposed clustering method is designed to get the flattest manifolds clusters by introducing a novel curved-level similarity function. Our approach is evaluated and compared to state-of-the-art methods on synthetic data, handwritten digit images, human motion capture data and motorbike videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which yields higher clustering accuracy, and produces promising results for challenging tasks of human motion segmentation and motion flow learning from videos."}}

The problem has attracted attention in previous research work, but non-parametric outlier filtering and inlier denoising are still challenging. Tensor voting is a non-parametric algorithm that can infer local data geometric structure. Standard tensor voting considers outlier noise explicitly, but may suffer from serious problems if the inlier data is also noisy. In this paper, we propose probabilistic Tensor Voting, a Bayesian extension of standard tensor voting, taking into consideration both probabilistic and geometric meaning. Probabilistic tensor voting explicitly considers both outlier and inlier noise, and can handle them simultaneously. In the new framework, the representation consists of a 2nd order symmetric tensor, a polarity vector, and a new type 2 polarity vector orthogonal to the first one. We give a theoretical interpretation of our framework. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms other methods, including standard tensor voting."}}

It combines visual tracking, motion pattern learning and multi-target tracking. Tracking in crowded scenes is very challenging due to hundreds of similar objects, cluttered background, small object size, and occlusions. However, structured crowded scenes exhibit clear motion pattern(s), which provides rich prior information. In MST, tracking and detection are performed jointly, and motion pattern information is integrated in both steps to enforce scene structure constraint. MST is initially used to track a single target, and further extended to solve a simplified version of the multi-target tracking problem. Experiments are performed on real-world challenging sequences, and MST gives promising results. Our method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods both in terms of track ratio and accuracy."}}

The algorithm has a closed-form solution that is efficient to compute. We evaluated and compared the algorithm to alternative methods on two image data sets. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which yields visually appealing denoising results, incurs smaller reconstruction errors and results in lower error rates when the denoised data are used in supervised learning tasks."}}
