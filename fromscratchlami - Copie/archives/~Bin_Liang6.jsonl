However, the occurrence of uncertain predictions by these classifiers poses a challenge to their reliability when deployed in practical applications. Much effort has been devoted to designing various probes in order to understand what PLMs capture. But few studies have delved into factors influencing PLM-based classifiers' predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called CUE, which aims to interpret uncertainties inherent in the predictions of PLM-based models. In particular, we first map PLM-encoded representations to a latent space via a variational auto-encoder. We then generate text representations by perturbing the latent space which causes fluctuation in predictive uncertainty. By comparing the difference in predictive uncertainty between the perturbed and the original text representations, we are able to identify the latent dimensions responsible for uncertainty and subsequently trace back to the input features that contribute to such uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets encompassing linguistic acceptability classification, emotion classification, and natural language inference show the feasibility of our proposed framework.

In practice, we need to deal with targets unseen in the annotated training data. As such, detecting stance for an unknown or unseen target is an important research problem. This paper presents a novel approach that automatically identifies and adapts the target-dependent and target-independent roles that a word plays with respect to a specific target in stance expressions, so as to achieve cross-target stance detection. More concretely, we explore a novel solution of constructing heterogeneous target-adaptive pragmatics dependency graphs (TPDG) for each sentence towards a given target. An in-target graph is constructed to produce inherent pragmatics dependencies of words for a distinct target. In addition, another cross-target graph is constructed to develop the versatility of words across all targets for boosting the learning of dominant word-level stance expressions available to an unknown target. A novel graph-aware model with interactive Graphical Convolutional Network (GCN) blocks is developed to derive the target-adaptive graph representation of the context for stance detection. The experimental results on a number of benchmark datasets show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-target stance detection."}}

Compared with sarcasm detection purely on texts, multi-modal sarcasm detection is more adapted to the rapidly growing social media platforms, where people are interested in creating multi-modal messages. When focusing on the multi-modal sarcasm detection for tweets consisting of texts and images on Twitter, the significant clue of improving the performance of multi-modal sarcasm detection evolves into how to determine the incongruity relations between texts and images. In this paper, we investigate multi-modal sarcasm detection from a novel perspective, so as to determine the sentiment inconsistencies within a certain modality and across different modalities by constructing heterogeneous in-modal and cross-modal graphs (InCrossMGs) for each multi-modal example. Based on it, we explore an interactive graph convolution network (GCN) structure to jointly and interactively learn the incongruity relations of in-modal and cross-modal graphs for determining the significant clues in sarcasm detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal sarcasm detection."}}

In this paper, we revisit sarcasm detection from a novel perspective, so as to account for the long-range literal sentiment inconsistencies. More concretely, we explore a novel scenario of constructing an affective graph and a dependency graph for each sentence based on the affective information retrieved from external affective commonsense knowledge and the syntactical information of the sentence. Based on it, an Affective Dependency Graph Convolutional Network (ADGCN) framework is proposed to draw long-range incongruity patterns and inconsistent expressions over the context for sarcasm detection by means with interactively modeling the affective and dependency information. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in sarcasm detection."}}

However, it is observed that about 60% of the testing aspects in commonly used public datasets are unknown to the training set. That is, some sentiment features carry the same polarity regardless of the aspects they are associated with (aspect-invariant sentiment), which props up the high accuracy of existing ABSA models when inevitably inferring sentiment polarities for those unknown testing aspects. Therefore, in this paper, we revisit ABSA from a novel perspective by deploying a novel supervised contrastive learning framework to leverage the correlation and difference among different sentiment polarities and between different sentiment patterns (aspect-invariant/-dependent). This allows improving the sentiment prediction for (unknown) testing aspects in the light of distinguishing the roles of valuable sentiment features. Experimental results on 5 benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in ABSA. We further extend existing neural network-based ABSA models with our proposed framework and achieve improved performance."}}

In the task of ACSA, some existing methods simply bound the aspect category (entity and attribute) as an integrated whole or adopt a randomly initialized embedding to represent the aspect category, which introduces a defective representation of aspect and leads to the ignorance of independent contextual sentiment of entity and attribute. Some other methods only consider the entity and disregard the attribute in predicting the sentiment polarity of aspect category, which leads to the ignorance of the collaboration between the entity and attribute. To this end, we propose a Gated Interactive Network (GIN) for aspect category sentiment analysis in this paper. To be specific, for each context and the corresponding aspect, we adopt two attention-based networks to learn the contextual sentiment for the entity and attribute independently and interactively. Further, based on the interactive attentions learned from entities and attributes, the coordinative gate units are exploited to reconcile and purify the sentiment features for the aspect sentiment prediction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the task of ACSA."}}

However, it is observed that some sentiment expressions carry the same polarity regardless of the aspects they are associated with. In such cases, it is not necessary to incorporate aspect information for ABSA. More observations on the experimental results show that blindly leveraging interactions between aspects and context as features may introduce noises when analyzing those aspect-invariant sentiment expressions, especially when the aspect-related annotated data is insufficient. Hence, in this paper, we propose an Adversarial Multi-task Learning framework to identify the aspect-invariant/dependent sentiment expressions without extra annotations. In addition, we adopt a gating mechanism to control the contribution of representations derived from aspect-invariant and aspect-dependent hidden states when generating the final contextual sentiment representations for the given aspect. This essentially allows the exploitation of aspect-invariant sentiment features for better ABSA results. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that extending existing neural models using our proposed framework achieves superior performance. In addition, the aspect-invariant data extracted by the proposed framework can be considered as pivot features for better transfer learning of the ABSA models on unseen aspects."}}
