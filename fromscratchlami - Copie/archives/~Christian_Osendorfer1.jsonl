In the family of hierarchical graphical models that emerges, the latent space is populated by higher order objects that are inferred jointly with the latent representations they act on. To explicitly demonstrate the effect of these higher order objects, we show that the inferred latent transformations reflect interpretable properties in the observation space. Furthermore, the model is structured in such a way that in the absence of transformations, we can run inference and obtain generative capabilities comparable with standard variational autoencoders. Finally, utilizing the trained encoder, we outperform the baselines by a wide margin on a challenging out-of-distribution classification task."}}

We utilize graph neural networks to iteratively parameterize an adaptive anisotropic kernel that produces point weights for weighted least-squares plane fitting in local neighborhoods. The approach retains the interpretability and efficiency of traditional sequential plane fitting while benefiting from adaptation to data set statistics through deep learning. This results in a state-of-the-art surface normal estimator that is robust to noise, outliers and point density variation, preserves sharp features through anisotropic kernels and equivariance through a local quaternion-based spatial transformer. Contrary to previous deep learning methods, the proposed approach does not require any hand-crafted features or preprocessing. It improves on the state-of-the-art results while being more than two orders of magnitude faster and more parameter efficient."}}

The proposed solution produces high-quality images even in the zero-shot setting and allows for more freedom in changes to the content geometry. This is made possible by introducing a novel Two-Stage Peer-Regularization Layer that recombines style and content in latent space by means of a custom graph convolutional layer. Contrary to the vast majority of existing solutions, our model does not depend on any pre-trained networks for computing perceptual losses and can be trained fully end-to-end thanks to a new set of cyclic losses that operate directly in latent space and not on the RGB images. An extensive ablation study confirms the usefulness of the proposed losses and of the Two-Stage Peer-Regularization Layer, with qualitative results that are competitive with respect to the current state of the art using a single model for all presented styles. This opens the door to more abstract and artistic neural image generation scenarios, along with simpler deployment of the model."}}

RNPs model the state space with Neural Processes. Given time series observed on fast real-world time scales but containing slow long-term variabilities, RNPs may derive appropriate slow latent time scales. They do so in an efficient manner by establishing conditional independence among subsequences of the time series. Our theoretically grounded framework for stochastic processes expands the applicability of NPs while retaining their benefits of flexibility, uncertainty estimation, and favorable runtime with respect to Gaussian Processes (GPs). We demonstrate that state spaces learned by RNPs benefit predictive performance on real-world time-series data and nonlinear system identification, even in the case of limited data availability."}}
