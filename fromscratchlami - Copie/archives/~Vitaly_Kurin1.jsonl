While recent years have seen a surge in methodological improvements in this area, they mostly focused on building specialist models. Specialist models are capable of learning to neurally execute either only one algorithm or a collection of algorithms with identical control-flow backbone. Here, instead, we focus on constructing a generalist neural algorithmic learner---a single graph neural network processor capable of learning to execute a wide range of algorithms, such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, path-finding and geometry. We leverage the CLRS benchmark to empirically show that, much like recent successes in the domain of perception, generalist algorithmic learners can be built by \"incorporating\" knowledge. That is, it is possible to effectively learn algorithms in a multi-task manner, so long as we can learn to execute them well in a single-task regime. Motivated by this, we present a series of improvements to the input representation, training regime and processor architecture over CLRS, improving average single-task performance by over 20% from prior art. We then conduct a thorough ablation of multi-task learners leveraging these improvements. Our results demonstrate a generalist learner that effectively incorporates knowledge captured by specialist models."}}

Participants were tasked with developing a program or agent that can win (i.e., \u2018ascend\u2019 in) the popular dungeon-crawler game of NetHack by interacting with the NetHack Learning Environment (NLE), a scalable, procedurally generated, and challenging Gym environment for reinforcement learning (RL). The challenge showcased community-driven progress in AI with many diverse approaches significantly beating the previously best results on NetHack. Furthermore, it served as a direct comparison between neural (e.g., deep RL) and symbolic AI, as well as hybrid systems, demonstrating that on NetHack symbolic bots currently outperform deep RL by a large margin. Lastly, no agent got close to winning the game, illustrating NetHack\u2019s suitability as a long-term benchmark for AI research."}}

Several ad-hoc multi-task optimization algorithms have instead been proposed, inspired by various hypotheses about what makes multi-task settings difficult.  The majority of these optimizers require per-task gradients, and introduce significant memory, runtime, and implementation overhead. We show that unitary scalarization, coupled with standard regularization and stabilization techniques from single-task learning, matches or improves upon the performance of complex multi-task optimizers in popular supervised and reinforcement learning settings. We then present an analysis suggesting that many specialized multi-task optimizers can be partly interpreted as forms of regularization, potentially explaining our surprising results. We believe our results call for a critical reevaluation of recent research in the area."}}

Results have so far been limited to training on small agents, with the performance of GNNs deteriorating rapidly as the number of sensors and actuators grows. A key motivation for the use of GNNs in the supervised learning setting is their applicability to large graphs, but this benefit has not yet been realised for locomotion control. We identify the weakness with a common GNN architecture that causes this poor scaling: overfitting in the MLPs within the network that encode, decode, and propagate messages. To combat this, we introduce Snowflake, a GNN training method for high-dimensional continuous control that freezes parameters in parts of the network that suffer from overfitting. Snowflake significantly boosts the performance of GNNs for locomotion control on large agents, now matching the performance of MLPs, and with superior transfer properties.\n"}}

However, benchmarks that are widely adopted by the community are not explicitly designed for evaluating specific capabilities of RL methods. While there exist environments for assessing particular open problems in RL (such as exploration, transfer learning, unsupervised environment design, or even language-assisted RL), it is generally difficult to extend these to richer, more complex environments once research goes beyond proof-of-concept results. We present MiniHack, a powerful sandbox framework for easily designing novel RL environments. MiniHack is a one-stop shop for RL experiments with environments ranging from small rooms to complex, procedurally generated worlds. By leveraging the full set of entities and environment dynamics from NetHack, one of the richest grid-based video games, MiniHack allows designing custom RL testbeds that are fast and convenient to use. With this sandbox framework, novel environments can be designed easily, either using a human-readable description language or a simple Python interface. In addition to a variety of RL tasks and baselines, MiniHack can wrap existing RL benchmarks and provide ways to seamlessly add additional complexity."}}

Solvers using GQSAT are complete SAT solvers that either provide a satisfying assignment or a proof of unsatisfiability, which is required for many SAT applications. The branching heuristic commonly used in SAT solvers today suffers from bad decisions during their warm-up period, whereas GQSAT has been trained to examine the structure of the particular problem instance to make better decisions at the beginning of the search. Training GQSAT is data efficient and does not require elaborate dataset preparation or feature engineering to train. We train GQSAT on small SAT problems using RL interfacing with an existing SAT solver. We show that GQSAT is able to reduce the number of iterations required to solve SAT problems by 2-3X, and it generalizes to unsatisfiable SAT instances, as well as to problems with 5X more variables than it was trained on. We also show that, to a lesser extent, it generalizes to SAT problems from different domains by evaluating it on graph coloring. Our experiments show that augmenting SAT solvers with agents trained with RL and graph neural networks can improve performance on the SAT search problem."}}
