Data federations notably increase the amount of data available for data-intensive applications such as smart mobility planning and public health emergency responses. Yet they also challenge the conventional implementation of range aggregation queries because the raw data cannot be shared within the federation and the data partition at each data silo is fixed during query processing. These constraints limit the design space of distributed range aggregation query processing and render existing solutions inefficient on large-scale data. In this work, we propose the first-of-its-kind approximate algorithms for efficient range aggregation over spatial data federation. We devise novel single-silo sampling algorithms that process queries in parallel and design a level sampling based algorithm which reduces the time complexity of local queries at each data silo to <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(\\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon })$</tex-math></inline-formula> , where <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\epsilon$</tex-math></inline-formula> is the approximation ratio of the accuracy guarantee.

Previous transportation recommendation solutions fail to deliver satisfactory user experience because their recommendations only consider routes in one transportation mode (uni-modal, e.g., taxi, bus, cycle) and largely overlook situational context. In this work, we propose <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf {Hydra}$</tex-math></inline-formula> , a multi-task deep learning based recommendation system that offers multi-modal transportation planning and is adaptive to various situational context (e.g., nearby point-of-interest (POI) distribution and weather). We leverage the availability of existing routing engines and big urban data, and design a novel two-level framework that integrates uni-modal and multi-modal (e.g., taxi-bus, bus-cycle) routes as well as heterogeneous urban data for intelligent multi-modal transportation recommendation. In addition to urban context features constructed from multi-source urban data, we learn the latent representations of users, origin-destination (OD) pairs and transportation modes based on user implicit feedbacks, which captures the collaborative transportation mode preferences of users and OD pairs. Moreover, we propose two models to recommend the proper route among various uni-modal and multi-modal transportation routes: (1) a light-weight gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) based recommendation model; and (2) a multi-task wide and deep learning (MTWDL) based recommendation model. We also optimize the framework to support real-time, large-scale route query and recommendation.

For the practical deployment of federated learning, data source selection is compulsory due to the limited communication cost and budget in real-world applications. The necessity of data source selection is further amplified in presence of data heterogeneity among clients. Prior solutions are either low in efficiency with exponential time cost or lack theoretical guarantees. Inspired by the diminishing marginal accuracy phenomenon in federated learning, we study the problem from the perspective of submodular optimization. In this paper, we aim at efficient data source selection with theoretical guarantees. We prove that data source selection in federated learning is a monotone submodular maximization problem and propose FDSS, an efficient algorithm with a constant approximate ratio. Furthermore, we extend FDSS to FDSS-d for dynamic data source selection. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms."}}

However, the success halts within individual ride hailing platforms because sharing raw order dispatching data across platforms may leak user privacy and business secrets. Such data isolation not only impairs user experience but also decreases the potential revenues of the platforms. In this paper, we advocate federated order dispatching for cross-platform ride hailing, where multiple platforms collaboratively make dispatching decisions without sharing their local data. Realizing this concept calls for new federated learning strategies that tackle the unique challenges on effectiveness, privacy and efficiency in the context of order dispatching. In response, we devise Federated Learning-to-Dispatch (Fed-LTD), a framework that allows effective order dispatching by sharing both dispatching models and decisions while providing privacy protection of raw data and high efficiency. We validate Fed-LTD via large-scale trace-driven experiments with Didi GAIA dataset. Extensive evaluations show that Fed-LTD outperforms single-platform order dispatching by 10.24% to 54.07% in terms of total revenue."}}

Shared mobility refers to transportation services that are shared among users, where a central issue is route planning. Given a set of workers and requests, route planning finds for each worker a route, i.e., a sequence of locations to pick up and drop off passengers/parcels that arrive from time to time, with different optimization objectives. Previous studies lack practicability due to their conflicted objectives and inefficiency in inserting a new request into a route, a basic operation called insertion. In addition, previous route planning solutions fail to exploit the appearance patterns of future requests hidden in historical data for optimization. In this paper, we present a unified formulation of route planning called URPSM. It has a well-defined parameterized objective function which eliminates the contradicted objectives in previous studies and enables flexible multi-objective route planning for shared mobility. We propose two insertion-based frameworks to solve the URPSM problem. The first is built upon the plain-insertion widely used in prior studies, which processes online requests only, whereas the second relies on a new insertion operator called prophet-insertion that handles both online and predicted requests. Novel dynamic programming algorithms are designed to accelerate both insertions to only linear time. Theoretical analysis shows that no online algorithm can have a constant competitive ratio for the URPSM problem under the competitive analysis model, yet our prophet-insertion-based framework can achieve a constant optimality ratio under the instance-optimality model. Extensive experimental results on real datasets show that our insertion-based solutions outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in both effectiveness and efficiency by a large margin (e.g., up to 30\\( \\times \\) more effective in the objective and up to 20\\( \\times \\) faster)."}}

A key to automated item distribution is to plan paths for robots, also known as task planning, where each task is to deliver racks with items to pickers for processing and then return the rack back. Prior solutions are unfit for large-scale robotized warehouses due to the inflexibility to time-varying item arrivals and the low efficiency for high throughput. In this paper, we propose a new task planning problem called TPRW, which aims to minimize the end-to-end makespan that incorporates the entire item distribution pipeline, known as a fulfilment cycle. Direct extensions from state-of-the-art path finding methods are ineffective to solve the TPRW problem because they fail to adapt to the bottleneck variations of fulfillment cycles. In response, we propose Efficient Adaptive Task Planning, a framework for large-scale robotized warehouses with time-varying item arrivals. It adaptively selects racks to fulfill at each timestamp via rein-forcement learning, accounting for the time-varying bottleneck of the fulfillment cycles. Then it finds paths for robots to transport the selected racks. The framework adopts a series of efficient optimizations on both time and memory to handle large-scale item throughput. Evaluations on both synthesized and real data show an improvement of 37.1% in effectiveness and 75.5% in efficiency over the state-of-the-arts."}}
