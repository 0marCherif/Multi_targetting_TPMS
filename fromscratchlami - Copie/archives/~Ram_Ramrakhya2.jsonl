In this paper, we show that an alternative 2-stage strategy is far more effective: (1) offline pretraining of visual representations with self-supervised learning (SSL) using large-scale pre-rendered images of indoor environments (Omnidata), and (2) online finetuning of visuomotor representations on specific tasks with image augmentations under long learning schedules. We call this method Offline Visual Representation Learning (OVRL). We conduct large-scale experiments -- on 3 different 3D datasets (Gibson, HM3D, MP3D), 2 tasks (ImageNav, ObjectNav), and 2 policy learning algorithms (RL, IL) -- and find that the OVRL representations lead to significant across-the-board improvements in state of art, on ImageNav from 29.2% to 54.2% (+25% absolute, 86% relative) and on ObjectNav from 18.1% to 23.2% (+5.1% absolute, 28% relative). Importantly, both results were achieved by the same visual encoder generalizing to datasets that were not seen during pretraining. While the benefits of pretraining sometimes diminish (or entirely disappear) with long finetuning schedules, we find that OVRL's performance gains continue to increase (not decrease) as the agent is trained for 2~billion frames of experience."}}

We find that as we increase the size of the IL-pretraining dataset and get to high IL accuracies, the improvements from RL-finetuning are smaller, and that 90% of the performance of our best IL\u2192RL policy can be achieved with less than half the number of IL demonstrations.

Such general-purpose methods offer advantages of simplicity in design, positive scaling with available compute, and versatile applicability to multiple tasks. Our work builds upon the recent success of self-supervised learning (SSL) for pre-training vision transformers (ViT). However, while the training recipes for convolutional networks are mature and robust, the recipes for ViTs are contingent and brittle, and in the case of ViTs for visual navigation, yet to be fully discovered. Specifically, we find that vanilla ViTs do not outperform ResNets on visual navigation. We propose the use of a compression layer operating over ViT patch representations to preserve spatial information along with policy training improvements. These improvements allow us to demonstrate positive scaling laws for the first time in visual navigation tasks. Consequently, our model advances state-of-the-art performance on ImageNav from 54.2% to 82.0% success and performs competitively against concurrent state-of-art on ObjectNav with success rate of 64.0% vs. 65.0%. Overall, this work does not present a fundamentally new approach, but rather recommendations for training a general-purpose architecture that achieves state-of-art performance today and could serve as a strong baseline for future methods."}}

First, we develop a virtual teleoperation data-collection infrastructure - connecting Habitat simulator running in a web browser to Amazon Mechanical Turk, allowing remote users to teleoperate virtual robots, safely and at scale. We collect 80k demonstrations for OBJECTNAV and 12k demonstrations for PICK&PLACE, which is an order of magnitude larger than existing human demonstration datasets in simulation or on real robots. Our virtual teleoperation data contains 29.3M actions, and is equivalent to 22.6k hours of real-world teleoperation time, and illustrates rich, diverse strategies for solving the tasks. Second, we use this data to answer the question - how does large-scale imitation learning (IL) (which has not been hitherto possible) compare to reinforcement learning (RL) (which is the status quo)? On OBJECTNAV, we find that IL (with no bells or whistles) using 70k human demonstrations outperforms RL using 240k agent-gathered trajectories. This effectively establishes an \u2018exchange rate\u2019 - a single human demonstration appears to be worth ~4 agent-gathered ones. More importantly, we find the IL-trained agent learns efficient object-search behavior from humans - it peeks into rooms, checks corners for small objects, turns in place to get a panoramic view - none of these are exhibited as prominently by the RL agent, and to induce these behaviors via contemporary RL techniques would require tedious reward engineering. Finally, accuracy vs. training data size plots show promising scaling behavior, suggesting that simply collecting more demonstrations is likely to advance the state of art further. On PICK&PLACE, the comparison is starker - IL agents achieve ~18% success on episodes with new object-receptacle locations when trained with 9.5k human demonstrations, while RL agents fail to get beyond 0%. Overall, our work provides compelling evidence for investing in large-scale imitation learning."}}
