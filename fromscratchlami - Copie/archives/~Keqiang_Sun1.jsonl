Recently, both optimization-based and learning-based face reconstruction methods have taken advantage of the emerging differentiable renderer and shown promising results. However, the differentiable renderer, mainly based on graphics rules, simplifies the realistic mechanism of the illumination, reflection, etc., of the real world, thus can-not produce realistic images. This brings a lot of domain-shift noise to the optimization or training process. In this work, we introduce a novel Generative Adversarial Renderer (GAR) and propose to tailor its inverted version to the general fitting pipeline, to tackle the above problem. Specifically, the carefully designed neural renderer takes a face normal map and a latent code representing other fac-tors as inputs and renders a realistic face image. Since the GAR learns to model the complicated real-world image, instead of relying on the simplified graphics rules, it is capable of producing realistic images, which essentially inhibits the domain-shift noise in training and optimization. Equipped with the elaborated GAR, we further proposed a novel approach to predict 3D face parameters, in which we first obtain fine initial parameters via Renderer Invertingand then refine it with gradient-based optimizers. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative adversarial renderer and the novel optimization-based face reconstruction framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple face reconstruction datasets."}}

However, these methods focus on 2D image generative models, which are prone to producing inconsistent face images under large expression and pose changes. In this paper, we propose a new NeRF-based conditional 3D face synthesis framework, which enables 3D controllability over the generated face images by imposing explicit 3D conditions from 3D face priors. At its core is a conditional Generative Occupancy Field (cGOF) that effectively enforces the shape of the generated face to commit to a given 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) mesh. To achieve accurate control over fine-grained 3D face shapes of the synthesized image, we additionally incorporate a 3D landmark loss as well as a volume warping loss into our synthesis algorithm. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is able to generate high-fidelity face images and shows more precise 3D controllability than state-of-the-art 2D-based controllable face synthesis methods."}}

In this paper, we investigate a new perspective of facial landmark detection and demonstrate it leads to further notable improvement. Given that any face images can be factored into space of style that captures lighting, texture and image environment, and a style-invariant structure space, our key idea is to leverage disentangled style and shape space of each individual to augment existing structures via style translation. With these augmented synthetic samples, our semi-supervised model surprisingly outperforms the fully-supervised one by a large margin. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our idea with state-of-the-art results on WFLW, 300W, COFW, and AFLW datasets. Our proposed structure is general and could be assembled into any face alignment frameworks. The code is made publicly available at https://github.com/thesouthfrog/stylealign."}}

However, these algorithms are neither accurate nor stable in motion-blurred videos. The missing of structure information makes it difficult for state-of-the-art facial landmark detection algorithms to yield good results. In this paper, we propose a framework named FAB that takes advantage of structure consistency in the temporal dimension for facial landmark detection in motion-blurred videos. A structure predictor is proposed to predict the missing face structural information temporally, which serves as a geometry prior. This allows our framework to work as a virtuous circle. On one hand, the geometry prior helps our structure-aware deblurring network generates high quality deblurred images which lead to better landmark detection results. On the other hand, better landmark detection results help structure predictor generate better geometry prior for the next frame. Moreover, it is a flexible video-based framework that can incorporate any static image-based methods to provide a performance boost on video datasets. Extensive experiments on Blurred-300VW, the proposed Realworld Motion Blur (RWMB) datasets and 300VW demonstrate the superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods. Datasets and models will be publicly available at https://keqiangsun.github.io/projects/FAB/FAB.html."}}
