Labelling is a tedious process that can take hours per image. Automatically annotating video sequences by propagating sparsely labeled frames through time is a more scalable alternative. In this work, we propose a novel label propagation method, termed Warp-Refine Propagation, that combines semantic cues with geometric cues to efficiently auto-label videos. Our method learns to refine geometrically-warped labels and infuse them with learned semantic priors in a semi-supervised setting by leveraging cycle-consistency across time. We quantitatively show that our method improves label-propagation by a noteworthy margin of 13.1 mIoU on the ApolloScape dataset. Furthermore, by training with the auto-labelled frames, we achieve competitive results on three semantic-segmentation benchmarks, improving the state-of-the-art by a large margin of 1.8 and 3.61 mIoU on NYU-V2 and KITTI, while matching the current best results on Cityscapes."}}

However, the user cannot see the phone or their hands in a fully immersive VR setting, impeding their ability for precise touch input. We propose mounting a mirror above the phone screen such that the front-facing camera captures the thumbs on or near the screen. This enables the creation of semi-transparent overlays of thumb shadows and inference of fingertip hover points with deep learning, which help the user aim for targets on the phone. A study compares the effect of visual feedback on touch precision in a controlled task and qualitatively evaluates three example applications demonstrating the potential of the technique. The results show that the enabled style of feedback is effective for thumb-size targets, and that the VR experience can be enriched by using smartphones as VR controllers supporting precise touch input."}}

This enables efficient parameter-sharing, while still allowing for instrument-specific parameterization. Meta-TasNet is shown to be more effective than the models trained independently or in a multi-task setting, and achieve performance comparable with state-of-the-art methods. In comparison to the latter, our extractors contain fewer parameters and have faster run-time performance. We discuss important architectural considerations, and explore the costs and benefits of this approach."}}

Adversarial sample generation methods range from simple to complex optimization techniques. Majority of these methods generate adversaries through optimization objectives that are tied to the pre-softmax or softmax output of the network. In this work we, (i) show the drawbacks of such attacks, (ii) propose two new evaluation metrics: Old Label New Rank (OLNR) and New Label Old Rank (NLOR) in order to quantify the extent of damage made by an attack, and (iii) propose a new adversarial attack FDA: Feature Disruptive Attack, to address the drawbacks of existing attacks. FDA works by generating image perturbation that disrupt features at each layer of the network and causes deep-features to be highly corrupt. This allows FDA adversaries to severely reduce the performance of deep networks. We experimentally validate that FDA generates stronger adversaries than other state-of-the-art methods for image classification, even in the presence of various defense measures. More importantly, we show that FDA disrupts feature-representation based tasks even without access to the task-specific network or methodology.

It is also demonstrated that there exist input-agnostic perturbations, called universal adversarial perturbations, which can change the inference of target model on most of the data samples. However, existing methods to craft universal perturbations are (i) task specific, (ii) require samples from the training data distribution, and (iii) perform complex optimizations. Additionally, because of the data dependence, fooling ability of the crafted perturbations is proportional to the available training data. In this paper, we present a novel, generalizable and data-free approaches for crafting universal adversarial perturbations. Independent of the underlying task, our objective achieves fooling via corrupting the extracted features at multiple layers. Therefore, the proposed objective is generalizable to craft image-agnostic perturbations across multiple vision tasks such as object recognition, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation. In the practical setting of black-box attack scenario (when the attacker does not have access to the target model and it's training data), we show that our objective outperforms the data dependent objectives to fool the learned models. Further, via exploiting simple priors related to the data distribution, our objective remarkably boosts the fooling ability of the crafted perturbations. Significant fooling rates achieved by our objective emphasize that the current deep learning models are now at an increased risk, since our objective generalizes across multiple tasks without the requirement of training data for crafting the perturbations. To encourage reproducible research, we have released the codes for our proposed algorithm."}}

In the task of 3D object pose estimation, recent data driven deep neural network based approaches suffer from scarcity of real images with 3D keypoint and pose annotations. Drawing inspiration from human cognition, where the annotators use a 3D CAD model as structural reference to acquire ground-truth viewpoints for real images; we propose an iterative Semantic Pose Alignment Network, called iSPA-Net. Our approach focuses on exploiting semantic 3D structural regularity to solve the task of fine-grained pose estimation by predicting viewpoint difference between a given pair of images. Such image comparison based approach also alleviates the problem of data scarcity and hence enhances scalability of the proposed approach for novel object categories with minimal annotation. The fine-grained object pose estimator is also aided by correspondence of learned spatial descriptor of the input image pair. The proposed pose alignment framework enjoys the faculty to refine its initial pose estimation in consecutive iterations by utilizing an online rendering setup along with effectiveness of a non-uniform bin classification of pose-difference. This enables iSPA-Net to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various real image viewpoint estimation datasets. Further, we demonstrate effectiveness of the approach for multiple applications. First, we show results for active object viewpoint localization to capture images from similar pose considering only a single image as pose reference. Second, we demonstrate the ability of the learned semantic correspondence to perform unsupervised part-segmentation transfer using only a single part-annotated 3D template model per object class. To encourage reproducible research, we have released the codes for our proposed algorithm."}}

Driven by deep neural networks, recent methods have brought significant improvements to object pose estimation. However, they suffer due to scarcity of keypoint/pose-annotated real images and hence can not exploit the object's 3D structural information effectively. In this work, we propose a data-efficient method which utilizes the geometric regularity of intraclass objects for pose estimation. First, we learn pose-invariant local descriptors of object parts from simple 2D RGB images. These descriptors, along with keypoints obtained from renders of a fixed 3D template model are then used to generate keypoint correspondence maps for a given monocular real image. Finally, a pose estimation network predicts 3D pose of the object using these correspondence maps. This pipeline is further extended to a multi-view approach, which assimilates keypoint information from correspondence sets generated from multiple views of the 3D template model. Fusion of multi-view information significantly improves geometric comprehension of the system which in turn enhances the pose estimation performance. Furthermore, use of correspondence framework responsible for the learning of pose invariant keypoint descriptor also allows us to effectively alleviate the data-scarcity problem. This enables our method to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple real-image viewpoint estimation datasets, such as Pascal3D+ and ObjectNet3D. To encourage reproducible research, we have released the codes for our proposed approach."}}
