For the supervised setting, we provide an analysis of a Ridge classifier (with high regularization parameter) with and without knowledge of the low-rank structure of the data. Our results quantify analytically the gain in misclassification errors achieved by exploiting the low-rank structure for denoising purposes, as opposed to treating data as mere vectors. We further provide a similar analysis in the context of clustering, thereby quantifying the exact performance gap between tensor methods and standard approaches which treat data as simple vectors."}}

We further show some consequences of our findings to the context of transfer learning, essentially by proposing a simple yet effective initialization procedure that significantly accelerates the learning of the Softmax layer weights as the target domain gets closer to the source one. Experiments are notably performed on the datasets: MNIST, Fashion MNIST, Cifar10, and Cifar100 and using a standard CNN architecture."}}

These networks, although effective in multiple tasks such as classification or object detection, tend to focus on the most discriminative part of an object rather than retrieving all its relevant features. This behavior penalizes the performance of a CNN for the re-identification task, since it should identify diverse and fine grained features. It is then essential to make the network learn a wide variety of finer characteristics in order to make the re-identification process of people effective and robust to finer changes. In this article, we introduce Deep Miner, a method that allows CNNs to \"mine\" richer and more diverse features about people for their re-identification. Deep Miner is specifically composed of three types of branches: a Global branch (G-branch), a Local branch (L-branch) and an Input-Erased branch (IE-branch). G-branch corresponds to the initial backbone which predicts global characteristics, while L-branch retrieves part level resolution features. The IE-branch for its part, receives partially suppressed feature maps as input thereby allowing the network to \"mine\" new features (those ignored by G-branch) as output. For this special purpose, a dedicated suppression procedure for identifying and removing features within a given CNN is introduced. This suppression procedure has the major benefit of being simple, while it produces a model that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) re-identification methods. Specifically, we conduct experiments on four standard person re-identification benchmarks and witness an absolute performance gain up to 6.5% mAP compared to SOTA."}}

The presented method is particularly compared to baselines where we specifically show that the additional learned mappings significantly improve the performance (accuracy and computation) of the student network."}}
