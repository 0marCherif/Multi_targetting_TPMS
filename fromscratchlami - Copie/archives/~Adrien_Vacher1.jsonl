So far, no quantitative criterion has yet been put forward to tune the parameter of these models and select maps that best approximate the ground truth. To perform this task, we propose to leverage the Brenier formulation of OT. Theoretically, we show that this formulation guarantees that, up to sharp a distortion parameter depending on the smoothness/strong convexity and a statistical deviation term, the selected map achieves the lowest quadratic error to the ground truth. This criterion, estimated via convex optimization, enables parameter tuning and model selection among entropic regularization of OT, input convex neural networks and smooth and strongly convex nearest-Brenier (SSNB) models.\nWe also use this criterion to question the use of OT in Domain-Adaptation (DA). In a standard DA experiment, it enables us to identify the potential that is closest to the true OT map between the source and the target. Yet, we observe that this selected potential is far from being the one that performs best for the downstream transfer classification task."}}

However, rather than the distance itself, the object of interest for applications such as generative modeling is the underlying optimal transport map. Hence, computational and statistical guarantees need to be obtained for the estimated maps themselves. In this paper, we propose the first tractable algorithm for which the statistical $L^2$ error on the maps nearly matches the existing minimax lower-bounds for smooth map estimation. Our method is based on solving the semi-dual formulation of optimal transport with an infinite-dimensional sum-of-squares reformulation, and leads to an algorithm which has dimension-free polynomial rates in the number of samples, with potentially exponentially dimension-dependent constants."}}
