To stay competitive, enterprises desire agile and dynamic response strategies to quickly react to disruptions and recover supply-chain functions. Although both centralized and multi-agent approaches have been studied, their implementation requires prior knowledge of disruptions and agent-rule-based reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a model-based multi-agent framework that enables agent coordination and dynamic agent decision-making to respond to supply chain disruptions in an agile and effective manner. Through a small-scale simulated case study, we showcase the feasibility of the proposed approach under several disruption scenarios that affect a supply chain network differently, and analyze performance trade-offs between the proposed distributed and centralized methods."}}

In this paper, we present our work using mixed-integer programming and simulation for redesigning routes and bus schedules for University of Michigan (UM)'s campus bus system during the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a hub-and-spoke design and utilize real data of student activities to identify hub locations and bus stops to be used in the new routes. Using the same total number of buses to operate, each new bus route has 50\\% or fewer seats being used and takes maximumly 15 minutes, to reduce disease transmission through expiratory aerosol. We sample a variety of scenarios that cover variations of peak demand, social-distancing requirements, and break-down buses, to demonstrate the system resiliency of the new routes and schedules via simulation. The new bus routes are implemented and used by all UM campuses during the academic year 2020-2021, to ensure social distancing and short travel time. Our approach can be generalized to redesign public transit systems with social distancing requirement during the pandemic to reduce passengers' infection risk."}}
