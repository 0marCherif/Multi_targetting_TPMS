In this paper, we propose a novel geometric-based approach called Tangent Attack (TA), which identifies an optimal tangent point of a virtual hemisphere located on the decision boundary to reduce the distortion of the attack. Assuming the decision boundary is locally flat, we theoretically prove that the minimum $\\ell_2$ distortion can be obtained by reaching the decision boundary along the tangent line passing through such tangent point in each iteration. To improve the robustness of our method, we further propose a generalized method which replaces the hemisphere with a semi-ellipsoid to adapt to curved decision boundaries. Our approach is free of pre-training. Extensive experiments conducted on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our approach can consume only a small number of queries to achieve the low-magnitude distortion.

We show that a simple local-search based on-line algorithm can give a bicriteria constant approximation for the problem with O(k^2 log^2(nD)) swaps of medians (recourse) in total, where D is the diameter of the metric. When restricted to the problem without outliers, our algorithm is simpler, deterministic and gives better approximation ratio and recourse, compared to that of Lattanzi-Vassilvitskii [18]."}}

Specifically, we propose a method called Trimmed (Gradient) Expectation Maximization which adds a trimming gradients step and a hard thresholding step to the Expectation step (E-step) and the Maximization step (M-step), respectively. We show that under some mild assumptions and with an appropriate initialization, the algorithm is corruption-proofing and converges to the (near) optimal statistical rate geometrically when the fraction of the corrupted samples $$\\epsilon$$ \u03f5 is bounded by $${\\tilde{O}}\\bigg (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\bigg )$$ O ~ ( 1 n ) .

In the online with recourse model, clients arrive one by one and our algorithm needs to maintain good solutions at all time steps with only a few changes to the previously made decisions (called recourse). We show that the classic local search technique can lead to a (1+\u221a2+\u03b5)-competitive online algorithm for facility location with only O(log n/\u03b5 log 1/\u03b5) amortized facility and client recourse, where n is the total number of clients arrived during the process. We then turn to the dynamic algorithm model for the problem, where the main goal is to design fast algorithms that maintain good solutions at all time steps. We show that the result for online facility location, combined with the randomized local search technique of Charikar and Guha [Charikar and Guha, 2005], leads to a (1+\u221a2+\u03b5)-approximation dynamic algorithm with total update time of \u00d5(n\u00b2) in the incremental setting against adaptive adversaries. The approximation factor of our algorithm matches the best offline analysis of the classic local search algorithm. Finally, we study the fully dynamic model for facility location, where clients can both arrive and depart. Our main result is an O(1)-approximation algorithm in this model with O(|F|) preprocessing time and O(nlog\u00b3 D) total update time for the HST metric spaces, where |F| is the number of potential facility locations. Using the seminal results of Bartal [Bartal, 1996] and Fakcharoenphol, Rao and Talwar [Fakcharoenphol et al., 2003], which show that any arbitrary N-point metric space can be embedded into a distribution over HSTs such that the expected distortion is at most O(log N), we obtain an O(log |F|) approximation with preprocessing time of O(|F|\u00b2log |F|) and O(nlog\u00b3 D) total update time. The approximation guarantee holds in expectation for every time step of the algorithm, and the result holds in the oblivious adversary model."}}
