In this paper, we construct an ICRL benchmark in the context of RL application domains, including robot control, and autonomous driving. For each environment, we design relevant constraints and train expert agents to generate demonstration data. Besides, unlike existing baselines that learn a deterministic constraint, we propose a variational ICRL method to model a posterior distribution of candidate constraints. We conduct extensive experiments on these algorithms under our benchmark and show how they can facilitate studying important research challenges for ICRL.

Behavioral and motion planning are the key components in an autonomous driving system. The behavioral planning is responsible for high-level decision making required to follow traffic rules and interact with other road participants. The motion planner role is to generate feasible, safe trajectories for a self-driving vehicle to follow. The trajectories are generated through an optimization scheme to optimize a cost function based on metrics related to smoothness, movability, and comfort, and subject to a set of constraints derived from the planned behavior, safety considerations, and feasibility. A common practice is to manually design the cost function and constraints. Recent work has investigated learning the cost function from human driving demonstrations. While effective, the practical application of such approaches is still questionable in autonomous driving. In contrast, this paper focuses on learning driving constraints, which can be used as an add-on module to existing autonomous driving solutions. To learn the constraint, the planning problem is formulated as a constrained Markov Decision Process, whose elements are assumed to be known except the constraints. The constraints are then learned by learning the distribution of expert trajectories and estimating the probability of optimal trajectories belonging to the learned distribution. The proposed scheme is evaluated using NGSIM dataset, yielding less than 1% collision rate and out of road maneuvers when the learned constraints is used in an optimization-based motion planner."}}

Existing methods use some combination of metrics to evaluate a trajectory, either taking a worst case view or allowing for some probabilistic estimate, to eliminate or minimize the risk of collision respectively. Typically, these approaches assume occluded regions of the environment are unsafe and must be avoided, resulting in overly conservative trajectories-particularly when there are no hidden risks present. We propose a local trajectory planning algorithm which generates safe trajectories that maximize observations on un-certain regions. In particular, we seek to gain information on occluded areas that are most likely to pose a risk to the ego vehicle on its future path. Calculating the information gain is a computationally complex problem; our method approximates the maximum information gain and results in vehicle motion that remains safe but is less conservative than state-of-the-art approaches. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method within the CARLA simulator in different scenarios."}}

As an emerging research topic, CIRL does not have common benchmarks, and previous works tested their algorithms with hand-crafted environments (e.g., grid worlds). In this paper, we construct a CIRL benchmark in the context of two major application domains: robot control and autonomous driving. We design relevant constraints for each environment and empirically study the ability of different algorithms to recover those constraints based on expert trajectories that respect those constraints. To handle stochastic dynamics, we propose a variational approach that infers constraint distributions, and we demonstrate its performance by comparing it with other CIRL baselines on our benchmark.

The two-track structure allows focusing on different aspects of the distribution shift. Track 1 is open to any method and will give ML researchers with different backgrounds an opportunity to solve a real-world autonomous driving challenge. Track 2 is designed for strictly offline learning methods. Therefore, direct comparisons can be made between different methods with the aim to identify new promising research directions. The proposed setup consists of 1) realistic traffic generated using real-world data and micro simulators to ensure fidelity of the scenarios, 2) framework accommodating diverse methods for solving the problem, and 3) baseline method. As such it provides a unique opportunity for the principled investigation into various aspects of autonomous vehicle deployment."}}

Sample efficiency and unreliable performance in rare but challenging scenarios are two of the major obstacles. Drawing inspiration from the effectiveness of deliberate practice for achieving expert-level human performance, we propose a new adversarial sampling approach guided by a failure predictor named \"CoachNet\". CoachNet is trained online along with the agent to predict the probability of failure. This probability is then used in a stochastic sampling process to guide the agent to more challenging episodes. This way, instead of wasting time on scenarios that the agent has already mastered, training is focused on the agent's \"weak spots\". We present the design of CoachNet, explain its underlying principles, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness in improving sample efficiency and test-time robustness in common continuous control tasks."}}
