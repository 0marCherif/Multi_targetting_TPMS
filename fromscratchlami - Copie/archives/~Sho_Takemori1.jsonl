However, the majority of work on self-training has focused on the objective of improving accuracy whereas practical machine learning systems can have complex goals (e.g. maximizing the minimum of recall across classes, etc.) that are non-decomposable in nature. In this work, we introduce the Cost-Sensitive Self-Training (CSST) framework which generalizes the self-training-based methods for optimizing non-decomposable metrics. We prove that our framework can better optimize the desired non-decomposable metric utilizing unlabeled data, under similar data distribution assumptions made for the analysis of self-training.  Using the proposed CSST framework, we obtain practical self-training methods (for both vision and NLP tasks) for optimizing different non-decomposable metrics using deep neural networks.  Our results demonstrate that CSST achieves an improvement over the state-of-the-art in majority of the cases across datasets and objectives."}}

Previous recommenders targeting for the causal effect employ the inverse propensity scoring (IPS) in causal inference. However, IPS is prone to suffer from high variance. The matching estimator is another representative method in causal inference field. It does not use propensity and hence free from the above variance problem. In this work, we unify traditional neighborhood recommendation methods with the matching estimator, and develop robust ranking methods for the causal effect of recommendations. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform various baselines in ranking metrics for the causal effect. The results suggest that the proposed methods can achieve more sales and user engagement than previous recommenders."}}

However, a click feedback that is intended for a purchase indicates that the user's interest level is greater than that of a user who clicks just to view a page. Thus, compared with the unary positive feedback, some other types of user feedback are considered more reliable because of their ability to indicate the different preference levels of users. Some recommender systems focus on using such multiple-level positive feedback to develop model-based methods. In this paper, we take them into account to implement a nearest-neighbor method that demonstrates competitive performance for session-based recommendation. Herein, we present experimental evaluations on different domain datasets to demonstrate the benefits of our proposed method. Our results show that incorporating such multiple-level preferences of users with the neighbor-based model leads to an improvement in performance for session-based recommendation."}}

Learning a user's preference from implicit feedback is difficult since inaction in such data can be because of either dislike for an item or unawareness. Exposure modeling has been proposed recently to address this ambiguity by decomposing inaction into dislike and unawareness. A user's awareness of items can be affected by several factors, and exposure modeling has been extended to include social and temporal influences on exposure to provide better recommendations. However, recommendation itself should also affect a user's awareness of items. Recommendations boost awareness differently for different users; while some users are attentive to and trust recommendations, others neglect or distrust recommendations. Furthermore, if a user purchases an item from a recommendation list, the user would have likely noticed other items on the same list. In this paper, we extend exposure modeling by considering the influence of recommendations on exposure. We accomplish this by incorporating: (1) user-dependent increase in awareness of recommended items and (2) indirect increase in awareness of an item by the purchase of other items from the same recommendation list. Through experiments using public datasets with recommendation logs, we demonstrate that considering recommendation influence improves purchase prediction."}}

Typical evaluations of recommenders regard the purchase of a recommended item as a success. However, the item may have been purchased even without the recommendation. An uplift is defined as an increase in user actions caused by recommendations. Situations with and without a recommendation cannot both be observed for a specific user-item pair at a given time instance, making uplift-based evaluation and optimization challenging. This paper proposes new evaluation metrics and optimization methods for the uplift in a recommender system. We apply a causal inference framework to estimate the average uplift for the offline evaluation of recommenders. Our evaluation protocol leverages both purchase and recommendation logs under a currently deployed recommender system, to simulate the cases both with and without recommendations. This enables the offline evaluation of the uplift for newly generated recommendation lists. For optimization, we need to define positive and negative samples that are specific to an uplift-based approach. For this purpose, we deduce four classes of items by observing purchase and recommendation logs. We derive the relative priorities among these four classes in terms of the uplift and use them to construct both pointwise and pairwise sampling methods for uplift optimization. Through dedicated experiments with three public datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization methods in improving the uplift."}}
