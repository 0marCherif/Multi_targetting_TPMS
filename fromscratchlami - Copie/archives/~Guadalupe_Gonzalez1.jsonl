However, there has been no work in generating explanations on the fly during model training and utilizing them to improve the expressive power of the underlying GNN models. In this work, we introduce a novel explanation-directed neural message passing framework for GNNs, EXPASS (EXplainable message PASSing), which aggregates only embeddings from nodes and edges identified as important by a GNN explanation method. EXPASS can be used with any existing GNN architecture and subgraph-optimizing explainer to learn accurate graph embeddings. We theoretically show that EXPASS alleviates the oversmoothing problem in GNNs by slowing the layer-wise loss of Dirichlet energy and that the embedding difference between the vanilla message passing and EXPASS framework can be upper bounded by the difference of their respective model weights. Our empirical results show that graph embeddings learned using EXPASS improve the predictive performance and alleviate the oversmoothing problems of GNNs, opening up new frontiers in graph machine learning to develop explanation-based training frameworks."}}

We formulate this task as a graph classification problem on which graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results. However, GNNs are difficult to train on sparse low-dimensional features according to our empirical evidence. Here, we present graph augmented features, integrating graph structural information and raw node attributes with varying ratios, to ease the training of networks. We further introduce a novel neural network architecture on graphs, the Graph Attentional Autoencoder (GAA) to predict food compounds with anticancer properties based on perturbed protein networks. We demonstrate that the method outperforms the baseline approach and state-of-the-art graph classification models in this task.\n"}}

Herein, we introduce a unique network-based machine learning platform to identify putative food-based cancer-beating molecules. These have been identified through their molecular biological network commonality with clinically approved anti-cancer therapies. A machine-learning algorithm of random walks on graphs (operating within the supercomputing DreamLab platform) was used to simulate drug actions on human interactome networks to obtain genome-wide activity profiles of 1962 approved drugs (199 of which were classified as \u201canti-cancer\u201d with their primary indications). A supervised approach was employed to predict cancer-beating molecules using these \u2018learned\u2019 interactome activity profiles. The validated model performance predicted anti-cancer therapeutics with classification accuracy of 84\u201390%. A comprehensive database of 7962 bioactive molecules within foods was fed into the model, which predicted 110 cancer-beating molecules (defined by anti-cancer drug likeness threshold of >70%) with expected capacity comparable to clinically approved anti-cancer drugs from a variety of chemical classes including flavonoids, terpenoids, and polyphenols. This in turn was used to construct a \u2018food map\u2019 with anti-cancer potential of each ingredient defined by the number of cancer-beating molecules found therein. Our analysis underpins the design of next-generation cancer preventative and therapeutic nutrition strategies.\n"}}

However, unsupervised NE still remains challeng- ing due to the uncertainty in defining a learning objective. In addition, it is still an unexplored research question whether existing NE methods adapt well to heterophilous networks. This paper introduces the first empirical study on the influence of homophily ratio on the performance of existing unsupervised NE methods and reveals their limitations. Inspired by our empirical findings, we design unsupervised NE task as an r-ego network discrimination problem and further develop a SELf-supErvised Network Embedding (Selene) framework for learning useful node representations for both homophilous and heterophilous networks. Specifically, we propose a dual-channel feature em- bedding mechanism to fuse node attributes and network struc- ture information and leverage a sampling and anonymisation strategy to break the implicit homophily assumption of existing embedding mechanisms. Lastly, we introduce a negative-sample- free SSL objective function to optimise the framework. We conduct extensive experiments and a series of ablation studies on 12 real-world datasets and 20 synthetic networks. Results demonstrate Selene\u2019s superior performance and confirm the effectiveness of each component. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zhiqiangzhongddu/Selene.\n"}}
