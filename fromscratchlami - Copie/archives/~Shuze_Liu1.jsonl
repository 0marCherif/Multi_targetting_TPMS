The payoff of this active action depends on his own private type as well as a random and unknown state of nature. To decide between this active action and another passive action, which always leads to a safe constant utility, the decision maker may purchase information from an information seller. The seller can access the realized state of nature, and this information is useful for the decision maker (i.e., the information buyer ) to better estimate his payoff from the active action. We study the seller's problem of designing a revenue-optimal pricing scheme to sell her information to the buyer. Suppose the buyer's private type and the state of nature are drawn from two independent distributions, we fully characterize the optimal pricing mechanism for the seller in closed form. Specifically, under a natural linearity assumption of the buyer payoff function, we show that an optimal pricing mechanism is the threshold mechanism which charges each buyer type some upfront payment and then reveals whether the realized state is above some threshold or below it. The payment and the threshold are generally different for different buyer types, and are carefully tailored to accommodate the different amount of risks each buyer type can take. The proof of our results relies on novel techniques and concepts, such as upper/lower virtual values and their mixtures, which may be of independent interest.

Therefore, we need 'stronger' smart contracts with flexible structures that are resilient in such unexpected situations. In this paper, we propose a generic mechanism to strengthen smart contracts and handle possible unexpected situations. Given a smart contract, this mechanism automatically generates an action list which offers actions as interfaces to change parameters of smart contracts and a voting system that utilizes a limited voter group randomly chosen from the peers. Each action in the action list can change a corresponding parameter of smart contracts. The actions, when approved by the majority, are executed to change the parameters. When users face unexpected situations in a transaction, they choose some actions as the solution and pass them to the voting system. Since a smart contract has finite parameters, there are finite actions. By arranging and combining these actions, our mechanism offers solutions that can handle wide-ranging unexpected situations. Also, to execute a solution, the majority of voters need to approve it, thus not violating the protocol of the original smart contract. Voters are rewarded based on quadratic rules for peer prediction, which makes telling true preferences the only way to maximize rewards. Using machine learning, we predict users' preferences based on the voting records. The predictions are provided as default values for future votes to avoid users' need to vote manually each time."}}
