Recent machine learning methods have formulated protein-small molecule docking as a generative problem with significant performance boosts over both traditional and deep learning baselines. In this work, we propose a similar approach for rigid protein-protein docking: DiffDock-PP is a diffusion generative model that learns to translate and rotate unbound protein structures into their bound conformations. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on DIPS with a median C-RMSD of 4.85, outperforming all considered baselines. Additionally, DiffDock-PP is faster than all search-based methods and generates reliable confidence estimates for its predictions."}}

Existing GNN benchmarking methods for molecular representation learning focus on comparing the GNNs' performances on some node/graph classification/regression tasks on certain datasets. However, there lacks a principled, task-agnostic method to directly compare two GNNs. Additionally, most of the existing self-supervised learning works incorporate handcrafted augmentations to the data, which has several severe difficulties to be applied on graphs due to their unique characteristics. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose GraphAC (Graph Adversarial Collaboration) \u2013 a conceptually novel, principled, task-agnostic, and stable framework for evaluating GNNs through contrastive self-supervision. We introduce a novel objective function: the Competitive Barlow Twins, that allow two GNNs to jointly update themselves from direct competitions against each other. GraphAC succeeds in distinguishing GNNs of different expressiveness across various aspects, and has demonstrated to be a principled and reliable GNN evaluation method, without necessitating any augmentations."}}

Unfortunately, the most commonly used GNNs, called Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) suffer from several fundamental limitations. To overcome these limitations, recent works have adapted the idea of positional encodings to graph data. This paper draws inspiration from the recent success of Laplacian-based positional encoding and defines a novel family of positional encoding schemes for graphs. We accomplish this by generalizing the optimization problem that defines the Laplace embedding to more general dissimilarity functions rather than the 2-norm used in the original formulation. This family of positional encodings is then instantiated by considering p-norms. We discuss a method for calculating these  positional encoding schemes, implement it in PyTorch and demonstrate how the resulting positional encoding captures different properties of the graph. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this novel family of positional encodings can improve the expressive power of MPNNs. Lastly, we present preliminary experimental results. "}}

An extremely fast computational binding method would enable key applications such as fast virtual screening or drug engineering. Existing methods are computationally expensive as they rely on heavy candidate sampling coupled with scoring, ranking, and fine-tuning steps. We challenge this paradigm with EquiBind, an SE(3)-equivariant geometric deep learning model performing direct-shot prediction of both i) the receptor binding location (blind docking) and ii) the ligand's bound pose and orientation. EquiBind achieves significant speed-ups and better quality compared to traditional and recent baselines. Further, we show extra improvements when coupling it with existing fine-tuning techniques at the cost of increased running time. Finally, we propose a novel and fast fine-tuning model that adjusts torsion angles of a ligand's rotatable bonds based on closed-form global minima of the von Mises angular distance to a given input atomic point cloud, avoiding previous expensive differential evolution strategies for energy minimization."}}
