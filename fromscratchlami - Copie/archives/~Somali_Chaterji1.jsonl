EC tools need to be manually configured for optimal performance. We find that the optimal parameters (e.g., k-mer size) are both tool- and dataset-dependent. Moreover, evaluating the performance (i.e., Alignment-rate or Gain) of a given tool usually relies on a reference genome, but quality reference genomes are not always available. We introduce Lerna for the automated configuration of k-mer-based EC tools. Lerna first creates a language model (LM) of the uncorrected genomic reads, and then, based on this LM, calculates a metric called the perplexity metric to evaluate the corrected reads for different parameter choices. Next, it finds the one that produces the highest alignment rate without using a reference genome. The fundamental intuition of our approach is that the perplexity metric is inversely correlated with the quality of the assembly after error correction. Therefore, Lerna leverages the perplexity metric for automated tuning of k-mer sizes without needing a reference genome."}}

While synchronous federated learning (Sync-FL) requires the devices to share local gradients synchronously to provide better guarantees, it suffers from the problem of stragglers. This is the scenario where the faster clients have to wait for the slower ones, slowing the entire training process. Conventional techniques completely drop the updates from the stragglers and lose the opportunity to learn from the data they hold, which is especially important in a non-iid setting. Asynchronous learning (Async-FL) provides a potential solution to allow the clients to function at their own pace, which typically achieves faster convergence. Since edge devices have a low compute, it is hard to train a video action recognition task on them. We present Kuiper, a variant of Async-FL, to help heterogeneous edge devices with limited resources learn a heavy model on video-action-recognition tasks with data distributed non-IID. Kuiper introduces a novel aggregation scheme, which solves the straggler problem while considering the different data distribution at different clients. Kuiper shows a 11% faster convergence compared to Oort15 [OSDI-21], up to 12% and 9% improvement in test accuracy compared to FedBuff16 [AISTAT-22] and Oort [OSDI-21] on HMDB51, and 10% and 9% on UCF101."}}

However, it requires the participating nodes to trust the server and its model updates, the server itself being a critical node susceptible to failure and compromise. A loss of trust in the server and a demand to aggregate the model independently for oneself has led decentralized peer-to-peer learning (P2PL) to gain traction lately. In this paper, we highlight the never before exposed vulnerabilities of P2PL towards malicious attacks and how P2PL behaves differently from FL in such a malicious environment. We then present a robust defense - P2PRISM as a secure aggregation protocol for P2PL."}}

Such a system is well suited to mobile devices with limited computing resources, and often running multiple contending applications. Existing solutions suffer from two major drawbacks. First, collecting feature values to decide on an execution branch is expensive. Second, there is a switching overhead for transitioning between branches and this overhead depends on the transition pair. LiteReconfig, an efficient and adaptive video object detection framework, addresses these challenges. LiteReconfig features a cost-benefit analyzer to decide which features to use, and which execution branch to run, at inference time. Furthermore, LiteReconfig has a content-aware accuracy prediction model, to select an execution branch tailored for frames in a video stream. We demonstrate that LiteReconfig achieves significantly improved accuracy under a set of varying latency objectives than existing systems, while maintaining up to 50 fps on an NVIDIA AGX Xavier board.

We observe that many existing detectors, previously deemed computationally costly for mobiles, intrinsically support adaptive inference, and offer a multi-branch object detection frame-work (MBODF). Here, an MBODF is referred to as a so-lution that has many execution branches and one can dy-namically choose from among them at inference time to sat-isfy varying latency requirements (e.g. by varying resolution of an input frame). In this paper, we ask, and answer, the wide-ranging question across all MBODFs: How to expose the right set of execution branches and then how to sched-ule the optimal one at inference time? In addition, we un-cover the importance of making a content-aware decision on which branch to run, as the optimal one is conditioned on the video content. Finally, we explore a content-aware scheduler, an Oracle one, and then a practical one, leveraging various lightweight feature extractors. Our evaluation shows that layered on Faster R-CNN-based MBODF, compared to 7 baselines, our Smartadapt achieves a higher Pareto optimal curve in the accuracy-vs-latency space for the ILSVRC VID dataset."}}

Our analysis highlights two major factors that limit performance: (a) lack of efficient communication methods between the serverless functions in the DAG, and (b) stragglers when a DAG stage invokes a set of parallel functions that must complete before starting the next DAG stage. To address these limitations, we propose WISEFUSE, an automated approach to generate an optimized execution plan for serverless DAGs for a user-specified latency objective or $ budget. We introduce three optimizations: (1) Fusion combines in-series functions together in a single VM to reduce the communication overhead between cascaded functions. (2) Bundling executes a group of parallel invocations of a function in one VM to improve resource sharing among the parallel workers to reduce skew. (3) Resource Allocation assigns the right VM size to each function or function bundle in the DAG to reduce the E2E latency and cost. We implement WISEFUSE to evaluate it experimentally using three popular serverless applications with different DAG structures, memory footprints, and intermediate data sizes. Compared to competing approaches and other alternatives, WISEFUSE shows significant improvements in E2E latency and cost. Specifically, for a machine learning pipeline, WISEFUSE achieves P95 latency that is 67% lower than Photons, 39% lower than Faastlane, and 90% lower than SONIC without increasing the $ cost."}}

Considering such devices, e.g., surveillance cameras or AR/VR gadgets, are resource constrained, although there has been significant work in creating lightweight deep neural networks (DNNs) for such clients, none of these can adapt to changing runtime conditions, e.g., changes in resource availability on the device, the content characteristics, or requirements from the user. In this article, we introduce ApproxNet, a video object classification system for embedded or mobile clients. It enables novel dynamic approximation techniques to achieve desired inference latency and accuracy trade-off under changing runtime conditions. It achieves this by enabling two approximation knobs within a single DNN model rather than creating and maintaining an ensemble of models, e.g., MCDNN [MobiSys-16]. We show that ApproxNet can adapt seamlessly at runtime to these changes, provides low and stable latency for the image and video frame classification problems, and shows the improvement in accuracy and latency over ResNet [CVPR-16], MCDNN [MobiSys-16], MobileNets [Google-17], NestDNN [MobiCom-18], and MSDNet [ICLR-18]."}}
