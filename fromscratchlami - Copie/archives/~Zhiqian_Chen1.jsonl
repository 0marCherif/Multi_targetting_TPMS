In this article, we focus on a specific type of SOP called spatial partitioning, which is a combinatorial problem due to the presence of discrete spatial units. Exact optimization methods do not scale with the size of the problem, especially within practicable time limits. This motivated us to develop population-based metaheuristics for solving such SOPs. However, the search operators employed by these population-based methods are mostly designed for real-parameter continuous optimization problems. For adapting these methods to SOPs, we apply domain knowledge in designing spatially aware search operators for efficiently searching through the discrete search space while preserving the spatial constraints. To this end, we put forward a simple yet effective algorithm called swarm-based spatial memetic algorithm (SPATIAL) and test it on the school (re)districting problem. Detailed experimental investigations are performed on real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of SPATIAL. Besides, ablation studies are performed to understand the role of the individual components of SPATIAL. Additionally, we discuss how SPATIAL is helpful in the real-life planning process and its applicability to different scenarios and motivate future research directions."}}

Comprehending the behaviors of flow is a formidable task, due to the intricate interplay between the distribution of seeds that initiate flow propagation, the propagation model, and the topology of the graph. The study of networks encompasses a diverse range of academic disciplines, including mathematics, physics, social science, and computer science. This interdisciplinary nature of network research is characterized by a high degree of specialization and compartmentalization, and the cooperation facilitated by them is inadequate. From a machine learning standpoint, there is a deficiency in a cohesive platform for assessing algorithms across various domains. One of the primary obstacles to current research in this field is the absence of a comprehensive curated benchmark suite to study the flow behaviors under network scenarios. To address this disparity, we propose the implementation of a novel benchmark suite that encompasses a variety of tasks, baseline models, graph datasets, and evaluation tools. In addition, we present a comprehensive analytical framework that offers a generalized approach to numerous flow-related tasks across diverse domains, serving as a blueprint and roadmap. Drawing upon the outcomes of our empirical investigation, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of current foundational models, and we underscore potential avenues for further study. The datasets, code, and baseline models have been made available for the public at: https://github.com/XGraphing/XFlow"}}

Each district comprises a set of schools mapped to attendance zones which are annually assessed to meet enrollment objectives. To support school officials in redrawing attendance boundaries, existing approaches have proven promising but still suffer from several challenges, including: 1) inability to scale to large school districts, 2) high computational cost of obtaining compact school attendance zones, and 3) lack of discussion on quantifying ethical considerations underlying the redrawing of school boundaries. Motivated by these challenges, this paper approaches the school redistricting problem from both computational and ethical standpoints. First, we introduce a practical framework based on sampling methods to solve school redistricting as a graph partitioning problem. Next, the advantages of adopting a modified objective function for optimizing discrete geometry to obtain compact boundaries are examined. Lastly, alternative metrics to address ethical considerations in real-world scenarios are formally defined and thoroughly discussed. Our findings highlight the inclusiveness and efficiency advantages of the designed framework and depict how tradeoffs need to be made to obtain qualitatively different school redistricting plans."}}

Such routine examination usually demands highly skilled radiologists to focus on a single patient with substantial time, causing the following two key challenges: 1) the dependency on the radiologist's experience leading to inconsistent diagnosis results across different radiologists; 2) limited examination efficiency due to the demanding time and energy consumption to the radiologist. This paper proposes to address these two issues in endoscopy using novel machine learning method in three-folds. Firstly, we build a novel and relatively big endoscopy dataset of 21,420 images from the widely used White Light Imaging (WLI) endoscopy and more recent Linked Color Imaging (LCI) endoscopy, which were annotated by experienced radiologists and validated with biopsy results, presenting a benchmark dataset. Secondly, we propose a novel machine learning model inspired by the human visual system, named as local attention grouping, to effectively extract key visual features, which is further improved by learning from multiple randomly selected regional images via ensemble learning. Such a method avoids the significant problem in the deep learning methods that decrease the resolution of original images to reduce the size of input samples, which would remove smaller lesions in endoscopy images. Finally, we propose a dual transfer learning strategy to train the model with co-distributed features between WLI and LCI images to further improve the performance.

On the other hand, many GConv-based models do not quantify the effect of graph topology and node features on performance, and are even surpassed by some models that do not consider graph structure or node properties. We quantify the information overlap between graph topology, node features, and labels in order to determine graph convolution's representation power in the node classification task. In this work, we first determine the linear separability of graph convoluted features using analysis of variance. Mutual information is used to acquire a better understanding of the possible non-linear relationship between graph topology, node features, and labels. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that a simple and efficient graph operation that concatenates only graph topology and node properties consistently outperforms conventional graph convolution, especially in the heterophily case. Extensive empirical research utilizing a synthetic dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrates that graph concatenation is a simple but more flexible alternative to graph convolution."}}

Due to the intricacy of IM, most current research concentrates on estimating the first-order contribution of the nodes to select a seed set, disregarding the higher-order interplay between different seeds. Consequently, the actual influence spread frequently deviates from expectations, and it remains unclear how the seed set quantitatively contributes to this deviation. To address this deficiency, this work dissects the influence exerted on individual seeds and their higher-order interactions utilizing the Sobol index, a variance-based sensitivity analysis. To adapt to IM contexts, seed selection is phrased as binary variables and split into distributions of varying orders. Based on our analysis with various Sobol indices, an IM algorithm dubbed SIM is proposed to improve the performance of current IM algorithms by over-selecting nodes followed by strategic pruning. A case study is carried out to demonstrate that the explanation of the impact effect can dependably identify the key higher-order interactions among seeds. SIM is empirically proved to be superior in effectiveness and competitive in efficiency by experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs."}}

These techniques have been increasingly adopted by U.S. courts of law and independent commissions as a tool for identifying partisan gerrymanders. Motivated by these recent developments, we develop a set of similar sampling techniques for designing school boundaries based on the flip proposal. Note that the flip proposal here refers to the change in the districting plan by a single assignment. These sampling-based techniques serve a dual purpose. They can be used as a baseline for comparing redistricting algorithms based on local search. Additionally, these techniques can help to infer the problem characteristics that may be further used for developing efficient redistricting methods. We empirically touch on both these aspects in regards to the problem of school redistricting."}}
