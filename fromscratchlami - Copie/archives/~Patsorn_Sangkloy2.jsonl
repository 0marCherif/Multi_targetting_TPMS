Argoverse was collected by a fleet of autonomous vehicles in Pittsburgh and Miami. The Argoverse 3D Tracking dataset includes 360\u25e6 images from 7 cameras with overlapping fields of view, 3D point clouds from long range LiDAR, 6-DOF pose, and 3D\ntrack annotations. Notably, it is the only modern AV dataset that provides forward-facing stereo imagery. The Argoverse Motion Forecasting dataset includes more than 300,000 5 second tracked scenarios with a particular vehicle identified for trajectory forecasting. Argoverse is the first autonomous vehicle dataset to include \u201cHD maps\u201d with 290 km of mapped lanes with geometric and semantic metadata.\nAll data is released under a Creative Commons license at  www.argoverse.org. In our baseline experiments, we illustrate how detailed map information such as lane direction, driveable area, and ground height improves the accuracy of 3D object tracking and motion forecasting. Our tracking and forecasting experiments represent only an initial exploration of the use of rich maps in robotic perception. We hope that Argoverse will enable the research community to explore these problems in greater depth."}}

The procedure allows users to control the generative process by specifying a set (arbitrary size) of desired examples based on which similar samples are generated from the model. The proposed approach, based on kernel mean matching, is applicable to any generative models which transform latent vectors to samples, and does not require retraining of the model. Experiments on various high-dimensional image generation problems (CelebA-HQ, LSUN bedroom, bridge, tower) show that our approach is able to generate images which are consistent with the input set, while retaining the image quality of the original model. To our knowledge, this is the first work that attempts to construct, at test time, a content-addressable generative model from a trained marginal model."}}

In baseline experiments, we use map information such as lane direction, driveable area, and ground height to improve the accuracy of 3D object tracking. We use 3D object tracking to mine for more than 300k interesting vehicle trajectories to create a trajectory forecasting benchmark. Motion forecasting experiments ranging in complexity from classical methods (k-NN) to LSTMs demonstrate that using detailed vector maps with lane-level information substantially reduces prediction error.

We propose two new statistical tests which are nonparametric, computationally efficient (runtime complexity is linear in the sample size), and interpretable. As a unique advantage, our tests can produce a set of examples (informative features) indicating the regions in the data domain where one model fits significantly better than the other. In a real-world problem of comparing GAN models, the test power of our new test matches that of the state-of-the-art test of relative goodness of fit, while being one order of magnitude faster."}}

Garment transfer is a challenging task that requires (i) disentangling the features of the clothing from the body pose and shape and (ii) realistic synthesis of the garment texture on the new body. We present a neural network architecture that tackles these sub-problems with two task-specific sub-networks. Since acquiring pairs of images showing the same clothing on different bodies is difficult, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach that generates training pairs from a single image via data augmentation. We present the first fully automatic method for garment transfer in unconstrained images without solving the difficult 3D reconstruction problem. We demonstrate a variety of transfer results and highlight our advantages over traditional image-to-image and analogy pipelines."}}

Previous image synthesis methods can be controlled by sketch and color strokes but we are the first to examine texture control. We allow a user to place a texture patch on a sketch at arbitrary locations and scales to control the desired output texture. Our generative network learns to synthesize objects consistent with these texture suggestions. To achieve this, we develop a local texture loss in addition to adversarial and content loss to train the generative network. We conduct experiments using sketches generated from real images and textures sampled from a separate texture database and results show that our proposed algorithm is able to generate plausible images that are faithful to user controls. Ablation studies show that our proposed pipeline can generate more realistic images than adapting existing methods directly."}}

These methods sidestep the traditional computer graphics rendering pipeline and instead generate imagery at the pixel level by learning from large collections of photos (e.g. faces or bedrooms). However, these methods are of limited utility because it is difficult for a user to control what the network produces. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial image synthesis architecture that is conditioned on sketched boundaries and sparse color strokes to generate realistic cars, bedrooms, or faces. We demonstrate a sketch based image synthesis system which allows users to scribble over the sketch to indicate preferred color for objects. Our network can then generate convincing images that satisfy both the color and the sketch constraints of user. The network is feed-forward which allows users to see the effect of their edits in real time. We compare to recent work on sketch to image synthesis and show that our approach generates more realistic, diverse, and controllable outputs. The architecture is also effective at user-guided colorization of grayscale images."}}

The eye tracking model self-calibrates by watching web visitors interact with the web page and trains a mapping between features of the eye and positions on the screen. This approach aims to provide a natural experience to everyday users that is not restricted to laboratories and highly controlled user studies. WebGazer has two key components: a pupil detector that can be combined with any eye detection library, and a gaze estimator using regression analysis informed by user interactions. We perform a large remote online study and a small in-person study to evaluate WebGazer. The findings show that WebGazer can learn from user interactions and that its accuracy is sufficient for approximating the user's gaze. As part of this paper, we release the first eye tracking library that can be easily integrated in any website for real-time gaze interactions, usability studies, or web research."}}
