After being deployed on public roads, autonomous vehicles need to interact with human road participants with different social preferences (e.g., selfish or courteous human drivers). To ensure that autonomous vehicles take safe and efficient maneuvers in different interactive traffic scenarios, we should be able to evaluate autonomous vehicles against reactive agents with different social characteristics in the simulation environment. We propose a socially-controllable behavior generation (SCBG) model for this purpose, which allows the users to specify the level of courtesy of the generated trajectory while ensuring realistic and human-like trajectory generation through learning from real-world driving data. Specifically, we define a novel and differentiable measure to quantify the level of courtesy of driving behavior, leveraging marginal and conditional behavior prediction models trained from real-world driving data. The proposed courtesy measure allows us to auto-label the courtesy levels of trajectories from real-world driving data and conveniently train an SCBG model generating trajectories based on the input courtesy values. We examined the SCBG model on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and showed that we were able to control the SCBG model to generate realistic driving behaviors with desired courtesy levels. Interestingly, we found that the SCBG model was able to identify different motion patterns of courteous behaviors according to the scenarios."}}

The goal of autonomous racing research is to develop software to control the vehicle at its limit of handling and achieve human-level racing performance. In this work, we investigate how to approach human expert-level racing performance with model-based planning and control methods using the high-fidelity racing simulator Gran Turismo Sport (GTS). GTS enables a unique opportunity for autonomous racing research, as many recordings of racing from highly skilled human players can served as expert emonstrations. By comparing the performance of the autonomous racing software with human experts, we better understand the performance gap of existing software and explore new methodologies in a principled manner. In particular, we focus on the commonly adopted model-based racing framework, consisting of an offline trajectory planner and an online Model Predictive Control-based (MPC) tracking controller. We thoroughly investigate the design challenges from three perspective, namely vehicle model, planning algorithm, and controller design, and propose novel solutions to improve the baseline approach toward human expert-level performance. We showed that the proposed control framework can achieve top 0.95% lap time among human-expert players in GTS. Furthermore, we conducted comprehensive ablation studies to validate the necessity of proposed modules, and pointed out potential future directions to reach human-best performance."}}

We are heading toward an intelligent and efficient transportation system where human errors are eliminated. While excited about the emergence of autonomous vehicles with increasing intelligence, the public has also raised concerns about their reliability. Modern autonomous driving systems usually adopt black-box deep-learning models for multiple function modules (e.g., perception, behavior prediction, behavior generation). The opaque nature of neural networks and their complex system architecture make it extremely difficult to understand the behavior of the overall system, which prevents humans from confidingly sharing the road and interacting with autonomous vehicles. This motivates the design of a more transparent system to build a foundation for trustworthy interaction between humans and autonomous vehicles.This dissertation is concerned with the design of an explainable autonomous driving system, leveraging the strengths of explainable artificial intelligence, control, and causality. In particular, we focus on the behavior system of an autonomous vehicle, which plays a crucial role in its interaction with human road participants. The work consists of two parts. In Part I, we explore methods to improve model interpretability. The goal is to ensure that the model is more intelligible for humans in the design stage, which is achieved by introducing hard or soft constraints formulated from domain knowledge. We demonstrate how to formulate domain knowledge of social interaction into structured reward functions (Chapter 2) and pseudo labels (Chapter 3) as well as how to utilize them to induce interpretable driving behavior models. We also introduce an interpretable and transferable hierarchical driving policy that combines deep learning with robust model-based control (Chapter 4). In Part II, we explore the usage of post hoc explanation techniques in diagnosing model behavior. We introduce two case studies, in which we utilize sparse graph attention to diagnose interaction modeling in behavior prediction (Chapter 5) and develop a Shapley-value-based method to study the inherent causality issue in conditional behavior prediction (Chapter 6)."}}

However, it still struggles to acquire skills in temporally extended tasks. In this paper, we study the problem of offline RL for temporally extended tasks. We propose a hierarchical planning framework, consisting of a low-level goal-conditioned RL policy and a high-level goal planner. The low-level policy is trained via offline RL. We improve the offline training to deal with out-of-distribution goals by a perturbed goal sampling process. The high-level planner selects intermediate sub-goals by taking advantages of model-based planning methods. It plans over future sub-goal sequences based on the learned value function of the low-level policy. We adopt a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to sample meaningful high-dimensional sub-goal candidates and to solve the high-level long-term strategy optimization problem. We evaluate our proposed method in long-horizon driving and robot navigation tasks. Experiments show that our method outperforms baselines with different hierarchical designs and other regular planners without hierarchy in these complex tasks."}}
