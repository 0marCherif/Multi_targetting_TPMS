State-of-the-art approaches in this area combine LLM decoding with sample pruning and reranking using test cases or heuristics based on the execution results. However, it is challenging to obtain test cases for many real-world language-to-code applications, and heuristics cannot well capture the semantic features of the execution results, such as data type and value range, which often indicates the correctness of the program. In this work, we propose LEVER, a simple approach to improve language-to-code generation by learning to verify the generated programs with their execution results. Specifically, we train verifiers to determine whether a program sampled from the LLMs is correct or not based on the natural language input, the program itself and its execution results. The sampled programs are reranked by combining the verification score with the LLM generation probability, and marginalizing over programs with the same execution results. On four datasets across the domains of table QA, math QA and basic Python programming, LEVER consistently improves over the base code LLMs(4.6% to 10.9% with code-davinci-002) and achieves new state-of-the-art results on all of them."}}

One key challenge of finetuning them to solve such math reasoning problems is that many existing datasets only contain one reference solution for each problem, despite the fact that there are often alternative solutions resembling different reasoning paths to the final answer. This way, the finetuned models are biased towards the limited reference solutions, which limits their generalization to unseen examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose to let the model perform sampling during training and learn from both self-sampled fully-correct solutions, which yield the correct answer upon execution, and partially-correct solutions, whose intermediate state matches an intermediate state of a known correct solution. We show that our use of self-sampled correct and partially-correct solutions can benefit learning and help guide the sampling process, leading to more efficient exploration of the solution space. Additionally, we explore various training objectives to support learning from multiple solutions per example and find they greatly affect the performance. Experiments on two math reasoning datasets show the effectiveness of our method compared to learning from a single reference solution with MLE, where we improve PASS@100 from 35.5% to 44.5% for GSM8K, and 27.6% to 36.2% PASS@80 for MathQA. Such improvements are also consistent across different model sizes."}}

In contrast, supervised fine-tuning is still needed for smaller models to achieve good performance. Such fine-tuning demands a large number of task-specific NL-code pairs, which are expensive to obtain. In this paper, we attempt to transfer the code generation ability of an LLM to a smaller model with the aid of weakly-supervised data. More specifically, we propose explicit knowledge transfer (EKT), which uses the few-shot capabilities of a teacher LLM to create NL-code pairs that we then filter for correctness and fine-tune the student on. We evaluate EKT on the task of generating code solutions to math word problems from the GSM8k dataset. We find that EKT not only yields better performance than training with expert iteration, but also outperforms knowledge distillation, another form of knowledge transfer. A GPT-Neo 1.3B model trained using EKT with a GPT-J teacher achieves a 12.4% pass@100 on GSM8k, while the same student and teacher trained with knowledge distillation yield only a 3.7% pass@100. We also show that it is possible for a student model to outperform the teacher using EKT."}}

Since the inputs and outputs of SKG tasks are heterogeneous, they have been studied separately by different communities, which limits systematic and compatible research on SKG. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing the UnifiedSKG framework, which unifies 21 SKG tasks into a text-to-text format, aiming to promote systematic SKG research, instead of being exclusive to a single task, domain, or dataset. We use UnifiedSKG to benchmark T5 with different sizes and show that T5, with simple modifications when necessary, achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all of the 21 tasks. We further demonstrate that multi-task prefix-tuning improves the performance on most tasks, largely improving the overall performance. UnifiedSKG also facilitates the investigation of zero-shot and few-shot learning, and we show that T0, GPT-3, and Codex struggle in zero-shot and few-shot learning for SKG. We also use UnifiedSKG to conduct a series of controlled experiments on structured knowledge encoding variants across SKG tasks. UnifiedSKG is easily extensible to more tasks, and it is open-sourced at https://github.com/hkunlp/unifiedskg."}}

However, most state-of-the-art pretrained language models (LM) are unable to efficiently process long text for many summarization tasks. In this paper, we propose Summ$^N$, a simple, flexible, and effective multi-stage framework for input texts that are longer than the maximum context length of typical pretrained LMs. Summ$^N$ first splits the data samples and generates a coarse summary in multiple stages and then produces the final fine-grained summary based on it. Our framework can process input text of arbitrary length by adjusting the number of stages while keeping the LM input size fixed. Moreover, it can deal with both single-source documents and dialogues, and it can be used on top of different backbone abstractive summarization models. To the best of our knowledge, Summ$^N$ is the first multi-stage split-then-summarize framework for long input summarization. Our experiments demonstrate that Summ$^N$ outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by improving ROUGE scores on three long meeting summarization datasets AMI, ICSI, and QMSum, two long TV series datasets from SummScreen, and a long document summarization dataset GovReport. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/Summ-N."}}

DYLE jointly trains an extractor and a generator and treats the extracted text snippets as the latent variable, allowing dynamic snippet-level attention weights during decoding. To provide adequate supervision, we propose simple yet effective heuristics for oracle extraction as well as a consistency loss term, which encourages the extractor to approximate the averaged dynamic weights predicted by the generator. We evaluate our method on different long-document and long-dialogue summarization tasks: GovReport, QMSum, and arXiv. Experiment results show that DYLE outperforms all existing methods on GovReport and QMSum, with gains up to 6.1 ROUGE, while yielding strong results on arXiv. Further analysis shows that the proposed dynamic weights provide interpretability of our generation process."}}

To match the evolving APIs from those libraries, open-source organizations often have to exert manual effort to refactor the APIs used in the code base. Moreover, due to the abundance of similar open-source libraries, data scientists working on a certain application may have an abundance of libraries to choose, maintain and migrate between. The manual refactoring between APIs is a tedious and error-prone task. Although recent research efforts were made on performing automatic API refactoring between different languages, previous work relies on statistical learning with collected pairwise training data for the API matching and migration. Using large statistical data for refactoring is not ideal because such training data will not be available for a new library or a new version of the same library. We introduce Synthesis for Open-Source API Refactoring (SOAR), a novel technique that requires no training data to achieve API migration and refactoring. SOAR relies only on the documentation that is readily available at the release of the library to learn API representations and mapping between libraries. Using program synthesis, SOAR automatically computes the correct configuration of arguments to the APIs and any glue code required to invoke those APIs. SOAR also uses the interpreter's error messages when running refactored code to generate logical constraints that can be used to prune the search space. Our empirical evaluation shows that SOAR can successfully refactor 80% of our benchmarks corresponding to deep learning models with up to 44 layers with an average run time of 97.23 seconds, and 90% of the data wrangling benchmarks with an average run time of 17.31 seconds."}}
