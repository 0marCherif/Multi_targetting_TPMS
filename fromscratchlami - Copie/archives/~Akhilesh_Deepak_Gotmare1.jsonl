Despite their success, they either adopt specific types of network architectures (encoder-only or decoder-only) for different downstream tasks or rely on a single architecture (encoder-decoder or UniLM-style encoder) for all tasks. The latter approach usually results in a sub-optimal performance on a subset of tasks. To address these limitations, we propose \u201cCodeT5Mix\u201d, a  mixture of encoder-decoder Transformers for code where its components can be flexibly combined based on the target  tasks during finetuning, while still enjoying the mutual benefits from the joint pretraining. To endow the model with both code understanding and generation capabilities, we pretrain CodeT5Mix  using a mixture of denoising, contrastive learning, matching, and Causal Language Modeling (CLM) tasks  on  large-scale multilingual code corpora in nine programming languages. Additionally, we design a weight sharing strategy in  decoders except the feedforward layers, which act as task-specific experts to reduce the  interference across tasks of various types. We extensively evaluate CodeT5Mix on seven tasks in four different modes and achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on most tasks such as text-to-code retrieval,  code completion and generation, and math programming. Particularly, we demonstrate that CodeT5Mix can be used as a unified semi-parametric retrieval-augmented generator with SoTA code generation performance. "}}

Recent approaches using large-scale pretrained language models (LMs) have shown promising results, yet they have some critical limitations. In particular, they often follow a standard supervised fine-tuning procedure to train a code generation model from natural language problem descriptions and ground-truth programs only. Such paradigm largely ignores some important but potentially useful signals in the problem specification such as unit tests, which thus results in poor performance when solving complex unseen coding tasks. We propose \u201cCodeRL\u201d to address the limitations, a new framework for program synthesis tasks through pretrained LMs and deep reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, during training, we treat the code-generating LM as an actor network, and introduce a critic network that is trained to predict the functional correctness of generated programs and provide dense feedback signals to the actor. During inference, we introduce a new generation procedure with a critical sampling strategy that allows a model to automatically regenerate programs based on feedback from example unit tests and critic scores. For the model backbones, we extended the encoder-decoder architecture of CodeT5 with enhanced learning objectives, larger model sizes, and better pretraining data. Our method not only achieves new SOTA results on the challenging APPS benchmark, but also shows strong zero-shot transfer capability with new SOTA results on the simpler MBPP benchmark."}}

Existing approaches are neither effective nor efficient enough towards a practical semantic code search system. In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate semantic code search framework with cascaded fast and slow models, in which a fast transformer encoder model is learned to optimize a scalable index for fast retrieval followed by learning a slow classification-based re-ranking model to improve the performance of the top K results from the fast retrieval. To further reduce the high memory cost of deploying two separate models in practice, we propose to jointly train the fast and slow model based on a single transformer encoder with shared parameters. The proposed cascaded approach is not only efficient and scalable, but also achieves state-of-the-art results with an average mean reciprocal ranking (MRR) score of 0.7795 (across 6 programming languages) as opposed to the previous state-of-the-art result of 0.713 MRR on the CodeSearchNet benchmark."}}

This is especially problematic because datasets used for training large LMs usually contain significant toxicity, hate, bias, and negativity. One promising approach to address this is to use discriminators to guide decoding from LMs, but existing methods for this are too slow to be useful in practice for many applications. We present GeDi as a significantly more efficient discriminator-based approach for guiding decoding. GeDi guides generation at each step by computing classification probabilities for all possible next tokens via Bayes rule by normalizing over two class-conditional distributions; one conditioned on the desired attribute, or control code, and another conditioned on the undesired attribute, or anti control code. We find that GeDi gives controllability on par with or better than previous controllable generation methods. GeDi results in significantly faster generation speeds than the only previous method that achieved comparable controllability in our experiments. We also show that GeDi can make GPT-2 and GPT-3 significantly less toxic while maintaining linguistic fluency, without sacrificing significantly on generation speed. Lastly, we find training GeDi on only three topics allows us to controllably generate new topics zero-shot from just a keyword."}}
