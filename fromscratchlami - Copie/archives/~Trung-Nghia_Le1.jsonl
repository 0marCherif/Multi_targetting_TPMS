It is an important problem in the computer vision field, where it has attracted the research community to attempt to solve this challenge at a high level to generate photorealistic images. Different techniques and strategies have been employed to achieve this purpose. Thus, the aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of various image synthesis models covering several aspects. First, the image synthesis concept is introduced. We then review different image synthesis methods divided into three categories: image generation from text, sketch, and other inputs, respectively. Each sub-category is introduced under the proper category based upon the general framework to provide a broad vision of all existing image synthesis methods. Next, brief details of the benchmarked datasets used in image synthesis are discussed along with specifying the image synthesis models that leverage them. Regarding the evaluation, we summarize the metrics used to evaluate the image synthesis models. Moreover, a detailed analysis based on the evaluation metrics of the results of the introduced image synthesis is provided. Finally, we discuss some existing challenges and suggest possible future research directions."}}

It has become essential to develop countermeasures against forged faces in social media. This paper presents a comprehensive study on two new countermeasure tasks: multi-face forgery detection and segmentation in-the-wild. Localizing forged faces among multiple human faces in unrestricted natural scenes is far more challenging than the traditional deepfake recognition task. To promote these new tasks, we have created the first large-scale dataset posing a high level of challenges that is designed with face-wise rich annotations explicitly for face forgery detection and segmentation, namely OpenForensics. With its rich annotations, our OpenForensics dataset has great potentials for research in both deepfake prevention and general human face detection. We have also developed a suite of benchmarks for these tasks by conducting an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art instance detection and segmentation methods on our newly constructed dataset in various scenarios."}}

We introduce mask-guided multimodal projected gradient descent (MM-PGD), in which adversarial examples are trained on different deep models. Image contents are protected by analyzing the properties of regions to identify the ones most suitable for blending in adversarial examples. We investigated two region identification strategies: class activation map-based MM-PGD, in which the internal behaviors of trained deep models are targeted; and human-vision-based MM-PGD, in which regions that attract less human attention are targeted. Experiments on the Places365 dataset demonstrated that these strategies are potentially effective in defending against black-box landmark recognition systems without the need for much image manipulation."}}

Thus, it is essential to measure their robustness against various attack methods, especially when a hand-crafted FVR system is used without any countermeasure methods. In this paper, we are the first in the literature to introduce master vein attacks in which we craft a vein-looking image so that it can falsely match with as many identities as possible by the FVR systems. We present two methods for generating master veins for use in attacking these systems. The first uses an adaptation of the latent variable evolution algorithm with a proposed generative model (a multi-stage combination of beta-VAE and WGAN-GP models). The second uses an adversarial machine learning attack method to attack a strong surrogate CNN-based recognition system. The two methods can be easily combined to boost their attack ability. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods alone and together achieved false acceptance rates up to 73.29% and 88.79%, respectively, against Miura's hand-crafted FVR system. We also point out that Miura's system is easily compromised by non-vein-looking samples generated by a WGAN-GP model with false acceptance rates up to 94.21%. The results raise the alarm about the robustness of such systems and suggest that master vein attacks should be considered an important security measure."}}

While existing approaches have made strides in addressing this issue, they are often limited to restricted settings such as image and sketch queries, which are often unfriendly interactions for common users. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel SHREC challenge track focusing on text-based fine-grained retrieval of 3D animal models. Unlike previous SHREC challenge tracks, the proposed task is considerably more challenging, requiring participants to develop innovative approaches to tackle the problem of text-based retrieval. Despite the increased difficulty, we believe this task can potentially drive useful applications in practice and facilitate more intuitive interactions with 3D objects. Five groups participated in our competition, submitting a total of 114 runs. While the results obtained in our competition are satisfactory, we note that the challenges presented by this task are far from fully solved. As such, we provide insights into potential areas for future research and improvements. We believe we can help push the boundaries of 3D object retrieval and facilitate more user-friendly interactions via vision-language technologies. https://aichallenge.hcmus.edu.vn/textanimar"}}

However, existing research has primarily overlooked a crucial aspect - the runtime of the underlying machine-learning model. While existing methods prioritize enhancing output quality, they often disregard the execution time, which restricts their applications on a limited range of devices. To address this gap, we propose Distilled Mobile Real-time Virtual Try-On (DM-VTON), a novel virtual try-on framework designed to achieve simplicity and efficiency. Our approach is based on a knowledge distillation scheme that leverages a strong Teacher network as supervision to guide a Student network without relying on human parsing. Notably, we introduce an efficient Mobile Generative Module within the Student network, significantly reducing the runtime while ensuring high-quality output. Additionally, we propose Virtual Try-on-guided Pose for Data Synthesis to address the limited pose variation observed in training images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve 40 frames per second on a single Nvidia Tesla T4 GPU and only take up 37 MB of memory while producing almost the same output quality as other state-of-the-art methods. DM-VTON stands poised to facilitate the advancement of real-time AR applications, in addition to the generation of lifelike attired human figures tailored for diverse specialized training tasks. https://sites.google.com/view/ltnghia/research/DMVTON"}}

Conventional approaches have attempted to address the task via prototype learning, known as point estimation. However, this mechanism is susceptible to noise and suffers from bias due to a significant scarcity of data. To overcome the disadvantages of the point estimation mechanism, we propose a novel approach, dubbed MaskDiff, which models the underlying conditional distribution of a binary mask, which is conditioned on an object region and $K$-shot information. Inspired by augmentation approaches that perturb data with Gaussian noise for populating low data density regions, we model the mask distribution with a diffusion probabilistic model. In addition, we propose to utilize classifier-free guided mask sampling to integrate category information into the binary mask generation process. Without bells and whistles, our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both base and novel classes of the COCO dataset while simultaneously being more stable than existing methods."}}

However, the transferability has not been understood in terms of to which class target model\u2019s predictions were misled (i.e., class-aware transferability). In this paper, we differentiate the cases in which a target model predicts the same wrong class as the source model (\"same mistake\") or a different wrong class (\"different mistake\") to analyze and provide an explanation of the mechanism. We find that (1) AEs tend to cause same mistakes, which correlates with \"non-targeted transferability\"; how-ever, (2) different mistakes occur even between similar models, regardless of the perturbation size. Furthermore, we present evidence that the difference between same mistakes and different mistakes can be explained by non-robust features, predictive but human-uninterpretable patterns: different mistakes occur when non-robust features in AEs are used differently by models. Non-robust features can thus provide consistent explanations for the class-aware transferability of AEs."}}

While several deep neural network models have been proposed to tackle those tasks, augmentation methods for COD and CIS have not been thoroughly explored. Augmentation strategies can help improve the performance of models by increasing the size and diversity of the training data and exposing the model to a wider range of variations in the data. Besides, we aim to automatically learn transformations that help to reveal the underlying structure of camouflaged objects and allow the model to learn to better identify and segment camouflaged objects. To achieve this, we propose a learnable augmentation method in the frequency domain for COD and CIS via Fourier transform approach, dubbed CamoFourier. Our method leverages a conditional generative adversarial network and cross-attention mechanism to generate a reference image and an adaptive hybrid swapping with parameters to mix the low-frequency component of the reference image and the high-frequency component of the input image. This approach aims to make camouflaged objects more visible for detection and segmentation models. Without bells and whistles, our proposed augmentation method boosts the performance of camouflaged object detectors and camouflaged instance segmenters by large margins."}}
