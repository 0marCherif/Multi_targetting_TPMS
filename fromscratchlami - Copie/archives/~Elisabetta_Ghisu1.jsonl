Over the last two decades, numerous graph kernels, i.e. kernel functions between graphs, have been proposed to solve the problem of assessing the similarity between graphs, thereby making it possible to perform predictions in both classification and regression settings. This manuscript provides a review of existing graph kernels, their applications, software plus data resources, and an empirical comparison of state-of-the-art graph kernels."}}

Despite their empirical success, most graph kernels use a naive aggregation of the final set of substructures, usually a sum or average, thereby potentially discarding valuable information about the distribution of individual components. Furthermore, only a limited instance of these approaches can be extended to continuously attributed graphs. We propose a novel method that relies on the Wasserstein distance between the node feature vector distributions of two graphs, which allows to find subtler differences in data sets by considering graphs as high-dimensional objects, rather than simple means. We further propose a Weisfeiler-Lehman inspired embedding scheme for graphs with continuous node attributes and weighted edges, enhance it with the computed Wasserstein distance, and thus improve the state-of-the-art prediction performance on several graph classification tasks."}}

However, as we show in this paper, simple but common instances of the popular R-convolution kernel framework can be meaningless when assessing the similarity of two time series through their subsequences. We therefore propose a meaningful approach based on optimal transport theory that simultaneously captures local and global characteristics of time series. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method achieves competitive classification accuracy in comparison to state-of-the art methods across a wide variety of data sets."}}

Graph kernels have been proposed as a powerful and efficient approach to this problem of graph comparison. Here we provide graphkernels, the first R and Python graph kernel libraries including baseline kernels such as label histogram based kernels, classic graph kernels such as random walk based kernels, and the state-of-the-art Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel. The core of all graph kernels is implemented in C\u2009++ for efficiency. Using the kernel matrices computed by the package, we can easily perform tasks such as classification, regression and clustering on graph-structured samples."}}
