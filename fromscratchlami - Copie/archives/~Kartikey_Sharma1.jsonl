In our setting, which is inspired by the Merlin-Arthur protocol from Interactive Proof Systems, two agents cooperate to provide a classification: the prover selects a small set of features as a certificate and presents it to the verifier who decides the class. A second, adversarial prover ensures the truthfulness of the system and allows us to connect the game-theoretic equilibrium between the provers and the verifier to guarantees on the exchanged features. We define completeness and soundness metrics to provide a lower bound on the mutual information between the features and the class. Our experiments demonstrate good agreement between theory and practice using neural network classifiers, and we show how our setup practically prevents manipulation."}}

In medical imaging, this is often not feasible due to privacy regulations. Whereas anonymization would be a solution, standard techniques have been shown to be partially reversible. Here, synthetic data using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with differential privacy guarantees could be a solution to ensure the patient's privacy while maintaining the predictive properties of the data. In this study, we implemented a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) with and without differential privacy guarantees to generate privacy-preserving labeled Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (TOF-MRA) image patches for brain vessel segmentation. The synthesized image-label pairs were used to train a U-net which was evaluated in terms of the segmentation performance on real patient images from two different datasets. Additionally, the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) was calculated between the generated images and the real images to assess their similarity. During the evaluation using the U-Net and the FID, we explored the effect of different levels of privacy which was represented by the parameter \u03f5. With stricter privacy guarantees, the segmentation performance and the similarity to the real patient images in terms of FID decreased. Our best segmentation model, trained on synthetic and private data, achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.75 for \u03f5 = 7.4 compared to 0.84 for \u03f5 = \u221e i..."}}

These guarantees consist of bounds on the mutual information of the features selected by this classifier. Our results are inspired by the Merlin-Arthur protocol from Interactive Proof Systems and express these bounds in terms of measurable metrics such as soundness and completeness. Compared to existing interactive setups we do not rely on optimal agents or on the assumption that features are distributed independently. Instead, we use the relative strength of the agents as well as the new concept of Asymmetric Feature Correlation which captures the precise kind of correlations that make interpretability guarantees difficult. %relates the information carried by sets of features to one of the individual features. We test our results through numerical experiments on two small-scale datasets where high mutual information can be verified explicitly."}}

In many applications, uncertainties are affected by decisions and cannot be modeled with current frameworks. This paper takes a step towards generalizing robust linear optimization to problems with decision-dependent uncertainties. In general settings, we show these problems to be NP-complete. To alleviate the computational inefficiencies, we introduce a class of uncertainty sets whose size depends on binary decisions. We propose reformulations that improve upon alternative standard linearization techniques. To illustrate the advantages of this framework, a shortest path problem is discussed, where the uncertain arc lengths are affected by decisions. Beyond the modeling and performance advantages, the proposed notion of proactive uncertainty control also mitigates over conservatism of current robust optimization approaches."}}
