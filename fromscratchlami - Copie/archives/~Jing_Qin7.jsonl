Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) is a popular method for this task, which considers the static background as the low-rank component and the moving objects in the foreground as the sparse component. To enhance the performance of RPCA, graph regularization is typically used to incorporate the sophisticated geometry of the background and temporal correlation. However, handling the graph Laplacians can be challenging due to the substantial number of data points. In this study, we propose a novel dual-graph regularized foreground-background separation model based on Sobolev smoothness. Our model is solved using a fast numerical algorithm based on the matrix CUR decomposition. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art computational efficiency."}}

Due to the development of communication technologies and a huge amount of decentralized data on many clients, collaborative machine learning has become the main interest while providing privacy-preserving frameworks. In particular, federated learning (FL) provides such a solution to learn a shared model while keeping training data at local clients. On the other hand, in a wide range of machine learning and signal processing applications, the desired solution naturally has a certain structure that can be framed as sparsity with respect to a certain dictionary. This problem can be formulated as an optimization problem with sparsity constraints and solving it efficiently has been one of the primary research topics in the traditional centralized setting. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework, federated gradient matching pursuit (FedGradMP), to solve the sparsity constrained minimization problem in the FL setting. We also generalize our algorithms to accommodate various practical FL scenarios when only a subset of clients participate per round, when the local model estimation at clients could be inexact, or when the model parameters are sparse with respect to general dictionaries. Our theoretical analysis shows the linear convergence of the proposed algorithms. A variety of numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the great potential of the proposed framework -- fast convergence both in communication rounds and computation time for many important scenarios without sophisticated parameter tuning."}}

To do so, we first formulate the attentional feature integration module to maximize the integration of the convolutional neural network (CNN) features at different CNN layers and generate the attentional multi-level integrated features (AMLIF). Then, from the AMLIF, we further predict a haze-free result for an atmospheric scattering model, as well as for four haze-layer separation models, and then fuse the results together to produce the final haze-free image. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we compare our network with several state-of-the-art methods on two widely-used dehazing benchmark datasets, as well as on two sets of real-world hazy images. Experimental results demonstrate clear quantitative and qualitative improvements of our method over the state-of-the-arts."}}

A sequence of observations is assumed to be defined on a low resolution spatio-temporal grid. It is further assumed that the sequence is generated by blurring of a captured scene with a spatio-temporal convolution kernel and is degraded by noise. Our method simultaneously exhibits deconvolution of the sequence of images from the effects of spatio-temporal blur, denoising of the data, and upsampling of the low-resolution sequence to a high resolution spatiotemporal grid. We perform the super-resolution in the spacetime domain, as opposed to super-resolving the sequence separately and sequentially to a higher spatial and then temporal resolution grid. Simultaneous space-time optimization achieves a more efficient and more accurate reconstruction than reconstructing a sequence frame by frame. The proposed super-resolution methodology is based on total variation regularization and computes the solution using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical results show our approach to be robust and computationally efficient."}}

Blind hyperspectral image unmixing is the process of identifying the pure spectra of individual materials (i.e., endmembers) and their proportions (i.e., abundances) at each pixel. In this article, we propose a novel blind hyperspectral unmixing model based on the graph total variation (gTV) regularization, which can be solved efficiently by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). To further alleviate the computational cost, we apply the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate a fully connected graph by a small subset of sampled points. Furthermore, we adopt the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme to solve the gTV-involved subproblem in ADMM by decomposing a gray-scale image into a bitwise form. A variety of numerical experiments on synthetic and real hyperspectral images are conducted, showcasing the potential of the proposed method in terms of identification accuracy and computational efficiency."}}
