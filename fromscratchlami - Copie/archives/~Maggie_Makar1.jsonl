In this work, we study conditional differential measurement error, where a subgroup of the population is known to be prone to differential measurement error. Under an assumption about the direction (but not magnitude) of the measurement error, we derive sharp bounds on the conditional average treatment effect and present an approach to estimate them. We empirically validate our approach on semi-synthetic da, showing that it gives more credible and informativebound than other approaches. In addition, we implement our approach on real data, showing its utility in guiding decisions about dietary modification intervals to improve nutritional intake."}}

Here, we discuss these connections through a causal lens, focusing on anti-causal prediction tasks, where the input to a classifier (e.g., an image) is assumed to be generated as a function of the target label and the protected attribute. By taking this perspective, we draw explicit connections between a common fairness criterion---separation---and a common notion of robustness---risk invariance. These connections provide new motivation for applying the separation criterion in anticausal settings, and show that fairness can be motivated entirely on the basis of achieving better performance. In addition, our findings suggest that robustness-motivated approaches can be used to enforce separation, and that they often work better in practice than methods designed to directly enforce separation. Using a medical dataset, we empirically validate our findings on the task of detecting pneumonia from X-rays, in a setting where differences in prevalence across sex groups motivates a fairness mitigation. Our findings highlight the importance of considering causal structure when choosing and enforcing fairness criteria."}}

In this work, assuming access to a representation based on domain knowledge (i.e., known concepts) that is invariant to shortcuts, we aim to learn robust and accurate models from biased training data. In contrast to previous work, we do not rely solely on known concepts, but allow the model to also learn unknown concepts. We propose two approaches for mitigating shortcuts that incorporate domain knowledge, while accounting for potentially important yet unknown concepts. The first approach is two-staged. After fitting a model using known concepts, it accounts for the residual using unknown concepts. While flexible, we show that this approach is vulnerable when shortcuts are correlated with the unknown concepts. This limitation is addressed by our second approach that extends a recently proposed regularization penalty. Applied to two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that both approaches can successfully mitigate shortcut learning."}}

In this work we ask: can we build reliable infection prediction models when the observed data is collected under limited, and biased testing that prioritizes testing symptomatic individuals? Our analysis suggests that under favorable conditions, incomplete testing might be sufficient to achieve relatively good out-of-sample prediction error. Favorable conditions occur when untested-infected individuals have sufficiently different characteristics from untested-healthy, and when the infected individuals are \"potent\", meaning they infect a large majority of their neighbors. We develop an algorithm that predicts infections, and show that it outperforms benchmarks on simulated data. We apply our model to data from a large hospital to predict Clostridioides difficile infections; a communicable disease that is characterized by asymptomatic (i.e., untested) carriers. Using a proxy instead of the unobserved untested-infected state, we show that our model outperforms benchmarks in predicting infections. "}}

However, it is often sufficient for the decision maker to have estimates of upper and lower bounds on the potential outcomes of decision alternatives to assess risks and benefits. We show that, in such cases, we can improve sample efficiency by estimating simple functions that bound these outcomes instead of estimating their conditional expectations, which may be complex and hard to estimate. Our analysis highlights a trade-off between the complexity of the learning task and the confidence with which the learned bounds hold. Guided by these findings, we develop an algorithm for learning upper and lower bounds on potential outcomes which optimize an objective function defined by the decision maker, subject to the probability that bounds are violated being small. Using a clinical dataset and a well-known causality benchmark, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms baselines, providing tighter, more reliable bounds."}}

While several methods for estimating ITEs have been recently suggested, these methods assume no constraints on the availability of data at the time of deployment or test time. This assumption is unrealistic in settings where data acquisition is a significant part of the analysis pipeline, meaning data about a test case has to be collected in order to predict the ITE. In this work, we present Data Efficient Individual Treatment Effect Estimation (DEITEE), a method which exploits the idea that adjusting for confounding, and hence collecting information about confounders, is not necessary at test time. DEITEE allows the development of rich models that exploit all variables at train time but identifies a minimal set of variables required to estimate the ITE at test time. Using 77 semi-synthetic datasets with varying data generating processes, we show that DEITEE achieves significant reductions in the number of variables required at test time with little to no loss in accuracy. Using real data, we demonstrate the utility of our approach in helping soon-to-be mothers make planning and lifestyle decisions that will impact newborn health."}}
