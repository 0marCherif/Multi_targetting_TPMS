A popular approach to enforcing PWC enforces arc consistency on the dual encoding of the problem, allowing to reuse existing AC algorithms. In this paper, we explore the benefit of this simple approach in the optimization context of cost function networks and soft local consistencies. Using a dual encoding, we obtain an equivalent binary cost function network where enforcing virtual arc consistency achieves virtual PWC on the original problem. We experimentally observed that adding extra non-binary cost functions before the dual encoding results in even stronger bounds. Such supplementary cost functions may be produced by bounded variable elimination or by adding ternary zero-cost functions. Experiments on (probabilistic) graphical models, from the UAI 2022 competition benchmark, show a clear improvement when using our approach inside a branch-and-bound solver compared to the state-of-the-art."}}

The two kinds of algorithms seem to have complementary strengths in practice, so that each kind of solver is better able to handle different families of instances. This suggests that a hybrid might match and outperform either, but the techniques used seem incompatible. In this paper, we focus on PMRES and OLL, two core-guided algorithms based on max resolution and soft cardinality constraints, respectively. We show that these algorithms implicitly discover cores of the original formula, as has been previously shown for PM1. Moreover, we show that in some cases, including unweighted instances, they compute the optimum hitting set of these cores at each iteration. We also give compact integer linear programs for each which encode this hitting set problem. Importantly, their continuous relaxation has an optimum that matches the bound computed by the respective algorithms. This goes some way towards resolving the incompatibility of implicit hitting set and core-guided algorithms, since solvers based on the implicit hitting set algorithm typically solve the problem by encoding it as a linear program."}}

Most methods for computing lower bounds in Branch-and-Bound minimization compute feasible dual solutions of a specific linear relaxation. These methods are more effective than solving the linear relaxation exactly, with better worst-case time complexity and better performance in practice. However, these algorithms are specialized to the structure of the linear relaxation of a CFN and cannot, for example, deal with constraints that cannot be expressed in extension, such as linear constraints of large arity. In this work, we show how to extend soft local consistencies, a set of approximate inference techniques for CFNs, so that they handle linear constraints, as well as combinations of linear constraints with at-most-one constraints. We embedded the resulting algorithm in toulbar2, an exact Branch-and-Bound solver for CFNs which has demonstrated superior results in several graphical model competitions and is state-of-the-art for solving large computational protein design (CPD) problems. We significantly improved performance of the solver in CPD with diversity guarantees. It also compared favorably with integer linear programming solvers on knapsack problems with conflict graphs."}}

However, scalability both for CP and other combinatorial optimization techniques for this problem is limited by the fact that the basic decision variables are set variables with domain sizes that may grow super polynomially with the number of random variables. Usual techniques for handling set variables in CP are not useful, as they lead to poor bounds. In this paper, we propose using decision trees as a data structure for storing sets of sets to represent set variable domains. We show that relatively simple operations are sufficient to implement all propagation and bounding algorithms, and that the use of these data structures improves scalability of a state of the art CP-based solver for BNSL."}}

Parallelization of exact methods remains a difficult challenge. We revisit the concept of parallel Branch-and-Bound in the framework of Cost Function Networks. We show how to adapt the anytime Hybrid Best-First Search algorithm in a Master-Worker protocol. The resulting parallel algorithm achieves good load-balancing without introducing new parameters to be tuned as is the case, for example, in Embarrassingly Parallel Search (EPS). It has also a small overhead due to its light communication messages. We performed an experimental evaluation on several benchmarks, comparing our parallel algorithm to its sequential version. We observed linear speed-up in some cases. Our approach compared favourably to the EPS approach and also to a state-of-the-art parallel exact integer programming solver."}}
