Constraint by the high cost of collecting and labeling 3D medical data, most of the deep learning models to date are driven by datasets with a limited number of organs of interest or samples, which still limits the power of modern deep models and makes it difficult to provide a fully comprehensive and fair estimate of various methods. To mitigate the limitations, we present AMOS, a large-scale, diverse, clinical dataset for abdominal organ segmentation. AMOS provides 500 CT and 100 MRI scans collected from multi-center, multi-vendor, multi-modality, multi-phase, multi-disease patients, each with voxel-level annotations of 15 abdominal organs, providing challenging examples and test-bed for studying robust segmentation algorithms under diverse targets and scenarios. We further benchmark several state-of-the-art medical segmentation models to evaluate the status of the existing methods on this new challenging dataset. We have made our datasets, benchmark servers, and baselines publicly available, and hope to inspire future research. Information can be found at https://amos22.grand-challenge.org."}}

Recent works construct the multi-scale context by aggregating convolutional feature maps extracted by different levels of a deep neural network. This is typically done by propagating and fusing features in a one-directional, top-down and bottom-up, manner. In this work, we introduce ZigZagNet, which aggregates a richer multi-context feature map by using not only dense top-down and bottom-up propagation, but also by introducing pathways crossing between different levels of the top-down and the bottom-up hierarchies, in a zig-zag fashion. Furthermore, the context information is exchanged and aggregated over multiple stages, where the fused feature maps from one stage are fed into the next one, yielding a more comprehensive context for improved segmentation performance. Our extensive evaluation on the public benchmarks demonstrates that ZigZagNet surpasses the state-of-the-art accuracy for both semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks."}}

In today\u2019s age of pre-trained deep networks and their powerful convolutional features, state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches differ mostly in how they choose to combine together these different kinds of information. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for aggregating features from different scales, which we refer to as Multi-Scale Context Intertwining (MSCI). In contrast to previous approaches, which typically propagate information between scales in a one-directional manner, we merge pairs of feature maps in a bidirectional and recurrent fashion, via connections between two LSTM chains. By training the parameters of the LSTM units on the segmentation task, the above approach learns how to extract powerful and effective features for pixel-level semantic segmentation, which are then combined hierarchically. Furthermore, rather than using fixed information propagation routes, we subdivide images into super-pixels, and use the spatial relationship between them in order to perform image-adapted context aggregation. Our extensive evaluation on public benchmarks indicates that all of the aforementioned components of our approach increase the effectiveness of information propagation throughout the network, and significantly improve its eventual segmentation accuracy."}}
