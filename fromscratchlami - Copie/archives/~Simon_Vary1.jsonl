We propose a new statistical method for direct imaging of exoplanets based on a likelihood ratio detection map, which assumes that the noise after the background subtraction step obeys a Laplacian distribution. We compare the method with two detection approaches based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) map after performing the background subtraction by the widely used Annular Principal Component Analysis (AnnPCA). The experimental results on the Beta Pictoris data set show the method outperforms SNR maps in terms of achieving the highest true positive rate (TPR) at zero false positive rate (FPR)."}}

Compressed sensing, matrix completion, and their variants (Eldar and Kutyniok, 2012; Foucart and Rauhut, 2013) have established that data satisfying low complexity models can be efficiently measured and recovered from a number of measurements proportional to the model complexity rather than the ambient dimension. This manuscript develops similar guarantees showing that $m\\times n$ matrices that can be expressed as the sum of a rank-$r$ matrix and a $s$-sparse matrix can be recovered by computationally tractable methods from $\\mathcal{O}(r(m+n-r)+s)\\log(mn/s)$ linear measurements. More specifically, we establish that the low-rank plus sparse matrix set is closed provided the incoherence of the low-rank component is upper bounded as $\\mu<\\sqrt{mn}/(r\\sqrt{s})$, and subsequently, the restricted isometry constants for the aforementioned matrices remain bounded independent of problem size provided $p/mn$, $s/p$, and $r(m+n-r)/p$ remain fixed. Additionally, we show that semidefinite programming and two hard threshold gradient descent algorithms, NIHT and NAHT, converge to the measured matrix provided the measurement operator's RIC's are sufficiently small. These results also provably solve convex and non-convex formulation of Robust PCA with the asymptotically optimal fraction of corruptions $\\alpha=\\mathcal{O}\\left(1/(\\mu r) \\right)$, where $s = \\alpha^2 mn$, and improve the previously best known guarantees by not requiring that the fraction of corruptions is spread in every column and row by being upper bounded by $\\alpha$. Numerical experiments illustrating these results are shown for synthetic problems, dynamic-foreground/static-background separation, and multispectral imaging."}}

Cand\u00e8s et al., J. ACM, 58 (2011), pp. 1--37] and low-rank matrix completion [B. Recht, M. Fazel, and P. A. Parrilo, SIAM Rev., 52 (2010), pp. 471--501] are extensions of PCA that allow for outliers and missing entries, respectively. It is well known that solving these problems requires a low coherence between the low-rank matrix and the canonical basis, since in the extreme cases---when the low-rank matrix we wish to recover is also sparse--- there is an inherent ambiguity. However, in both problems the well-posedness issue is even more fundamental; in some cases, both RPCA and matrix completion can fail to have any solutions due to the set of low-rank plus sparse matrices not being closed, which in turn is equivalent to the notion of the matrix rigidity function not being lower semicontinuous [Kumar et al., Comput. Complex., 23 (2014), pp. 531--563]. By constructing infinite families of matrices, we derive bounds on the rank and sparsity such that the set of low-rank plus sparse matrices is not closed. We also demonstrate numerically that a wide range of nonconvex algorithms for both RPCA and matrix completion have diverging components when applied to our constructed matrices. This is analogous to the case of sets of higher order tensors not being closed under canonical polyadic (CP) tensor rank, rendering the best low-rank tensor approximation unsolvable [V. de Silva and L.-H.
