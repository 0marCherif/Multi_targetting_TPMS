The recent deep feature reweighting (DFR) technique achieves state-of-the-art group robustness via simple last-layer retraining, but it requires held-out group and class annotations to construct a group-balanced reweighting dataset. In this work, we examine this impractical requirement and find that last-layer retraining can be surprisingly effective with no group annotations (other than for model selection) and only a handful of class annotations. We first show that last-layer retraining can greatly improve worst-group accuracy even when the reweighting dataset has only a small proportion of worst-group data. This implies a \"free lunch\" where holding out a subset of training data to retrain the last layer can substantially outperform ERM on the entire dataset with no additional data or annotations. To further improve group robustness, we introduce a lightweight method called selective last-layer finetuning (SELF), which constructs the reweighting dataset using misclassifications or disagreements. Our empirical and theoretical results present the first evidence that model disagreement upsamples worst-group data, enabling SELF to nearly match DFR on four well-established benchmarks across vision and language tasks with no group annotations and less than 3% of the held-out class annotations. Our code is available at this https URL."}}

Deep feature reweighting (DFR) improves group robustness via last-layer retraining, but it requires full group and class annotations for the reweighting dataset. To eliminate this impractical requirement, we propose a one-shot active learning method which constructs the reweighting dataset with the disagreement points between the ERM model with and without dropout activated. Our experiments show our approach achieves 94% of DFR performance on the Waterbirds and CelebA datasets despite using no group annotations and up to 21$\\times$ fewer class annotations."}}

Different from the previous approach that expresses the classifier thresholds as a function of all model parameters, we consider an alternative strategy where the thresholds are expressed as a function of only a subset of the model parameters, i.e., the last layer of the neural network. We propose new training procedures that optimize for the bottom and last layers separately, and solve them using standard gradient-based methods. Experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate our proposed method achieves performance comparable to the existing approach while being computationally efficient."}}

We investigate the problem of training models that are robust to shifts caused by changes in the distribution of class-priors or group-priors. The presence of skewed training priors can often lead to the models overfitting to spurious features. Unlike existing methods, which optimize for either the worst or the average performance over classes or groups, our work is motivated by the need for finer control over the robustness properties of the model. We present an extremely lightweight post-hoc approach that performs scaling adjustments to predictions from a pre-trained model, with the goal of minimizing a distributionally robust loss around a chosen target distribution. These adjustments are computed by solving a constrained optimization problem on a validation set and applied to the model during test time. Our constrained optimization objective is inspired from a natural notion of robustness to controlled distribution shifts. Our method comes with provable guarantees and empirically makes a strong case for distributional robust post-hoc classifiers.

Despite recent advances, VAEs usually require high-dimensional hierarchies of the latent codes to generate high-quality samples. We present DiffuseVAE, a novel generative framework that integrates VAE within a diffusion model framework, and leverage this to design a novel conditional parameterization for diffusion models. We show that the resulting model can improve upon the unconditional diffusion model in terms of sampling efficiency while also equipping diffusion models with the low-dimensional VAE inferred latent code. Furthermore, we show that the proposed model can generate high-resolution samples and exhibits synthesis quality comparable to state-of-the-art models on standard benchmarks. Lastly, we show that the proposed method can be used for controllable image synthesis and also exhibits out-of-the-box capabilities for downstream tasks like image super-resolution and denoising. "}}

We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. \nCrucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (a.k.a., score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of $1024\\times 1024$ images for the first time from a score-based generative model."}}

This provides a highly expressive parameter space for adaptation while constraining changes to the pretrained weights. We validate our method in a challenging few-shot setting of 5-100 images in the target domain. We show that our method has significant visual quality gains compared with existing GAN adapation methods.

However, the invertibility requirement restricts models to have the same latent dimensionality as the inputs. This imposes significant architectural, memory, and computational costs, making them more challenging to scale than other classes of generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a generative model based on probability flows that does away with the bijectivity requirement on the model and only assumes injectivity. This also provides another perspective on regularized autoencoders (RAEs), with our final objectives resembling RAEs with specific regularizers that are derived by lower bounding the probability flow objective. We empirically demonstrate the promise of the proposed model, improving over VAEs and AEs in terms of sample quality."}}

We study the regularizing effects of variational distributions on learning in generative models from two perspectives. First, we analyze the role that the choice of variational family plays in imparting uniqueness to the learned model by restricting the set of optimal generative models. Second, we study the regularization effect of the variational family on the local geometry of the decoding model. This analysis uncovers the regularizer implicit in the \u03b2-VAE objective, and leads to an approximation consisting of a deterministic autoencoding objective plus analytic regularizers that depend on the Hessian or Jacobian of the decoding model, unifying VAEs with recent heuristics proposed for training regularized autoencoders. We empirically verify these findings, observing that the proposed deterministic objective exhibits similar behavior to the \u03b2-VAE in terms of objective value and sample quality."}}
