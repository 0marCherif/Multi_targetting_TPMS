Using this framework we identify the subspace of features used by CNNs to classify largescale vision benchmarks, and reveal some intriguing aspects of their robustness to distributions shift. Specifically, by manipulating the frequency content in CIFAR-10 we show that the existence of redundant features on a dataset can harm the networks\u2019 robustness to distribution shifts. We demonstrate that completely erasing the redundant information from the training set can efficiently solve this problem. This paper is a short version of (Ortiz-Jimenez et al., 2020)."}}

To that end, we start by focusing on a very simple problem, i.e., classifying a class of linearly separable distributions, and show that, depending on the direction of the discriminative feature of the distribution, many state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have a surprisingly hard time solving this simple task. We then define as neural anisotropy directions (NADs) the vectors that encapsulate the directional inductive bias of an architecture. These vectors, which are specific for each architecture and hence act as a signature, encode the preference of a network to separate the input data based on some particular features. We provide an efficient method to identify NADs for several CNN architectures and thus reveal their directional inductive biases. Furthermore, we show that, for the CIFAR-10 dataset, NADs characterize the features used by CNNs to discriminate between different classes."}}

Influence of discriminative features on deep network boundaries", "abstract": "mportant insights towards the explainability of neural networks reside in the characteristics of their decision boundaries. In this work, we borrow tools from the field of adversarial robustness, and propose a new perspective that relates dataset features to the distance of samples to the decision boundary. This enables us to carefully tweak the position of the training samples and measure the induced changes on the boundaries of CNNs trained on large-scale vision datasets. We use this framework to reveal some intriguing properties of CNNs. Specifically, we rigorously confirm that neural networks exhibit a high invariance to non-discriminative features, and show that the decision boundaries of a DNN can only exist as long as the classifier is trained with some features that hold them together. Finally, we show that the construction of the decision boundary is extremely sensitive to small perturbations of the training samples, and that changes in certain directions can lead to sudden invariances in the orthogonal ones. This is precisely the mechanism that adversarial training uses to achieve robustness."}}

Although most attacks usually change values of many image's pixels, it has been shown that deep networks are also vulnerable to sparse alterations of the input. However, no computationally efficient method has been proposed to compute sparse perturbations. In this paper, we exploit the low mean curvature of the decision boundary, and propose SparseFool, a geometry inspired sparse attack that controls the sparsity of the perturbations. Extensive evaluations show that our approach computes sparse perturbations very fast, and scales efficiently to high dimensional data. We further analyze the transferability and the visual effects of the perturbations, and show the existence of shared semantic information across the images and the networks. Finally, we show that adversarial training can only slightly improve the robustness against sparse additive perturbations computed with SparseFool."}}

Adversarial training has been shown to be an effective approach to improving the robustness of the classifiers against such attacks especially in the white-box setting. In this work, we demonstrate that some geometric consequences of adversarial training on the decision boundary of deep networks give an edge to certain types of black-box attacks. In particular, we introduce a highly parallelizable black-box attack against the classifiers equipped with an $\\ell_2$ norm similarity detector, which exploits the low mean curvature of the decision boundary. We use this black-box attack to demonstrate that adversarially-trained networks might be easier to fool in certain scenarios. Moreover, we define a metric called robustness gain to show that while adversarial training is an effective method to improve the robustness in the white-box attack setting, it may not provide such a good robustness gain against the more realistic decision-based black-box attacks."}}

However, explanation methods are easily manipulated through visually imperceptible perturbations that generate misleading explanations. The geometry of the decision surface of the DNNs has been identified as the main cause of this phenomenon and several \\emph{smoothing} approaches have been proposed to build more robust explanations.\nIn this work, we provide a thorough evaluation of the quality and robustness of the explanations derived by smoothing approaches. Their different properties are evaluated with extensive experiments, which reveal the settings where the smoothed explanations are better, and also worse than the explanations derived by the common Gradient method. By making the connection with the literature on adversarial attacks, we further show that such smoothed explanations are robust primarily against additive $\\ell_p$-norm attacks. However, a combination of additive and non-additive attacks can still manipulate these explanations, which reveals shortcomings in their robustness properties."}}

Still, a growing body of work keeps leveraging this approximation to successfully analyze important deep learning phenomena and design algorithms for new applications. In our work, we provide strong empirical evidence to determine the practical validity of such approximation by conducting a systematic comparison of the behavior of different neural networks and their linear approximations on different tasks. We show that the linear approximations can indeed rank the learning complexity of certain tasks for neural networks, even when they achieve very different performances. However, in contrast to what was previously reported, we discover that neural networks do not always perform better than their kernel approximations, and reveal that the performance gap heavily depends on architecture, dataset size and training task. We discover that networks overfit to these tasks mostly due to the evolution of their kernel during training, thus, revealing a new type of implicit bias."}}

In this paper, we provide a quantitative analysis of the robustness of classifiers to universal perturbations, and draw a formal link between the robustness to universal perturbations, and the geometry of the decision boundary. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the robustness of classifiers under two decision boundary models (flat and curved models). We show in particular that the robustness of deep networks to universal perturbations is driven by a key property of their curvature: there exist shared directions along which the decision boundary of deep networks is systematically positively curved. Under such conditions, we prove the existence of small universal perturbations. Our analysis further provides a novel geometric method for computing universal perturbations, in addition to explaining their properties."}}
