Although adequate solutions can be achieved for small problem instances, their efficiency degrades for large-scale ones. In this work, we propose a new improvement learning-based framework based on imitation learning where classical heuristics serve as experts to encourage the policy model to mimic and produce similar and better solutions. Moreover, to improve scalability, we propose Clockwise Clustering, a novel augmented framework for decomposing large-scale CVRP into subproblems by clustering sequentially nodes in clockwise order, and then learning to solve them simultaneously. Our approaches enhance state-of-the-art CVRP solvers while attaining competitive solution quality on several well-known datasets, including real-world instances with sizes up to 30,000 nodes. Our best methods are able to achieve new state-of-the-art solutions for several large instances and generalize to a wide range of CVRP variants and solvers. We also contribute new datasets and results to test the generalizability of our deep RL algorithms."}}

We endeavor to provide DRO solutions for a class of sum of fractionals, non-convex optimization which is used for decision making in prominent areas such as facility location and security games. In contrast to previous work, we find it more tractable to optimize the equivalent variance regularized form of DRO rather than the minimax form. We transform the variance regularized form to a mixed-integer second-order cone program (MISOCP), which, while guaranteeing global optimality, does not scale enough to solve problems with real-world datasets. We further propose two abstraction approaches based on clustering and stratified sampling to increase scalability, which we then use for real-world datasets. Importantly, we provide global optimality guarantees for our approach and show experimentally that our solution quality is better than the locally optimal ones achieved by state-of-the-art gradient-based methods. We experimentally compare our different approaches and baselines and reveal nuanced properties of a DRO solution."}}
