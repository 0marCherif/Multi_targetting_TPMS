We propose Prediction Decomposition Attribution (PreDecomp), a novel individualized feature attribution for gradient boosted trees when they are trained with $\\ell_2$ regularization. Theoretical analysis shows that the inner product between PreDecomp and labels on in-sample data is essentially the total gain of a tree, and that it can faithfully recover additive models in the population case when features are independent. Inspired by the connection between PreDecomp and total gain, we also propose TreeInner, a family of debiased global feature attributions defined in terms of the inner product between any individualized feature attribution and labels on out-sample data for each tree. Numerical experiments on a simulated dataset and a genomic ChIP dataset show that TreeInner has state-of-the-art feature selection performance.

We consider situations where there are additional meta-data labels (such as group labels), denoted by $z$, that can account for such changes in the distribution. In particular, we assume that the prior distribution $p(y, z)$, which models the dependence between the class label $y$ and the \"nuisance\" factors $z$, may change across domains, either due to a change in the correlation between these terms, or a change in one of their marginals. However, we assume that the generative model for features $p(x|y, z)$ is invariant across domains. We note that this corresponds to an expanded version of the widely used \"label shift\" assumption, where the labels now also include the nuisance factors $z$. Based on this observation, we propose a test-time label shift correction that adapts to changes in the joint distribution $p(y, z)$ using EM applied to unlabeled samples from the target domain distribution, $p_t(x)$. Importantly, we are able to avoid fitting a generative model $p(x|y,z)$, and merely need to reweight the outputs of a discriminative model $p_s(y,z|x)$ trained on the source distribution. We evaluate our method, which we call \"Test-Time Label-Shift Adaptation\" (TTLSA), on several standard image and text datasets, as well as the CheXpert chest X-ray dataset, and show that it improves performance over methods that target invariance to changes in the distribution, as well as baseline empirical risk minimization methods.

This paper, on the other hand, considers a relatively new problem, which could be thought of as an inverse of action recognition: given a prescribed action type, we aim to generate plausible human motion sequences in 3D. Importantly, the set of generated motions are expected to maintain its diversity to be able to explore the entire action-conditioned motion space; meanwhile, each sampled sequence faithfully resembles a natural human body articulation dynamics. Motivated by these objectives, we follow the physics law of human kinematics by adopting the Lie Algebra theory to represent the natural human motions; we also propose a temporal Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) that encourages a diverse sampling of the motion space.
