In particular, we consider the problem of finding the arm with the maximum reward (i.e., the maximizing problem) or one that has sufficiently high reward (i.e., the satisficing problem) under this model. We propose novel algorithms GRUB (GRaph based UcB) and zeta-GRUB for these problems and provide theoretical characterization of their performance which specifically elicits the benefit of the graph side information. We also prove a lower bound on the data requirement that shows a large class of problems where these algorithms are near-optimal. We complement our theory with experimental results that show the benefit of capitalizing on such side information."}}

This problem, known as quadratic feasibility, encompasses the well known phase retrieval problem and has applications in a wide range of important areas including power system state estimation and x-ray crystallography. In general, not only is the the quadratic feasibility problem NP-hard to solve, but it may in fact be unidentifiable. In this paper, we establish conditions under which this problem becomes identifiable, and further prove isometry properties in the case when the matrices {A <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub> } <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i=1</sub> <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup> are Hermitian matrices sampled from a complex Gaussian distribution. Moreover, we explore a nonconvex optimization formulation of this problem, and establish salient features of the associated optimization landscape that enables gradient algorithms with an arbitrary initialization to converge to a globally optimal point with a high probability. Our results also reveal sample complexity requirements for successfully identifying a feasible solution in these contexts."}}

Server activity is intermittent, with the server switching between ON and OFF periods alternatively. Each player spends a certain cost to sample the server state, and the per-player payoff is inversely proportional to the number of simultaneously connected/arrived players. The objective of each player is to arrive/sample the server as soon as any ON period begins while incurring minimal sensing cost and to avoid having many other players overlap in time with itself. For this competition model, we propose a distributed randomized learning algorithm (strategy to sample the server) for each player, which is shown to converge to a unique non-trivial fixed point. The fixed point is moreover shown to be a Nash equilibrium of a game, where each player's utility function is demonstrated to possess all the required selfish tradeoffs."}}
