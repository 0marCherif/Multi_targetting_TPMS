This design of using multiple runs of denoising is informed by our theoretical analysis of the conditional distribution of the reversed  sample. Specifically, when the data density of a clean sample is high, its conditional density under the reverse process in a diffusion model is also high;  thus sampling from the latter conditional distribution can purify the adversarial example and return the corresponding clean sample with a high probability. By using the highest density point in the conditional distribution as the reversed sample, we identify the robust region of a given instance under the diffusion model's reverse process. We show that this robust region is a union of multiple convex sets, and is potentially much larger than the robust regions identified in previous works. In practice, DensePure can approximate the label of the high density region in the conditional distribution so that it can enhance certified robustness.

However, sampling from them is still slow because it involves emulating a reverse stochastic process with hundreds-to-thousands of neural network evaluations. Inspired by the recent success of neural operators in accelerating differential equations solving, we approach this problem by solving the underlying neural differential equation from an operator learning perspective. We examine probability flow ODE trajectories in diffusion model and observe a compact energy spectrum that can be learned efficiently in Fourier space. With this insight, we propose diffusion Fourier neural operator (DFNO) with temporal convolution in Fourier space to parameterize the operator that maps initial condition to the solution trajectory. DFNO can apply to any diffusion models and generate high-quality samples in one step. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art clean FID of 5.9 (legacy FID 4.72) on CIFAR-10 using one network evaluation. "}}

However, adversarial audio examples can cause abnormal behaviors for those acoustic systems, while being hard for humans to perceive. Various methods, such as transformation-based defenses and adversarial training, have been proposed to protect acoustic systems from adversarial attacks, but they are less effective against adaptive attacks. Furthermore, directly applying the methods from the image domain can lead to suboptimal results because of the unique properties of audio data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial purification-based defense pipeline, AudioPure, for acoustic systems via off-the-shelf diffusion models. Taking advantage of the strong generation ability of diffusion models, AudioPure first adds a small amount of noise to the adversarial audio and then runs the reverse sampling step to purify the noisy audio and recover clean audio. AudioPure is a plug-and-play method that can be directly applied to any pretrained classifier without any fine-tuning or re-training. We conduct extensive experiments on the speech command recognition task to evaluate the robustness of AudioPure. Our method is effective against diverse adversarial attacks (e.g. L2 or L\u221e-norm). It outperforms the existing methods under both strong adaptive white-box and black-box attacks bounded by L2 or L\u221e-norm (up to +20% in robust accuracy). Besides, we also evaluate the certified robustness for perturbations bounded by L2-norm via randomized smoothing. Our pipeline achieves a higher certified accuracy than baselines."}}

A major cause of model unfairness is the imbalanced representation of different groups in training data. Recently, several works aim to alleviate this issue using generated data. However, these approaches often use generated data to obtain similar amounts of data across groups, which is not optimal for achieving high fairness due to different learning difficulties and generated data qualities across groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel adaptive sampling approach that leverages both real and generated data for fairness. We design a bilevel optimization that finds the optimal data sampling ratios among groups and between real and generated data while training a model. The ratios are dynamically adjusted considering both the model's accuracy as well as its fairness. To efficiently solve our non-convex bilevel optimization, we propose a simple approximation to the solution given by the implicit function theorem. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy on the CelebA and ImageNet People Subtree datasets. We also observe that our method adaptively relies less on the generated data when it has poor quality."}}

However, existing methods require extensive training/fine-tuning with a large dataset, often unavailable in real-world generation tasks. In this work, we propose a new retrieval-based framework for controllable molecule generation. We use a small set of exemplar molecules,  i.e., those that (partially) satisfy the design criteria, to steer the pre-trained generative model towards synthesizing molecules that satisfy the given design criteria. We design a retrieval mechanism that retrieves and fuses the exemplar molecules with the input molecule, which is trained by a new self-supervised objective that predicts the nearest neighbor of the input molecule. We also propose an iterative refinement process to dynamically update the generated molecules and retrieval database for better generalization. Our approach is agnostic to the choice of generative models and requires no task-specific fine-tuning. On various tasks ranging from simple design criteria to a challenging real-world scenario for designing lead compounds that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, we demonstrate our approach extrapolates well beyond the retrieval database, and achieves better performance and wider applicability than previous methods."}}

Although the success of deep learning further accelerates the adoption of 3D point clouds in the physical world, deep learning is notoriously vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Various defense solutions have been proposed to build robust models against adversarial attacks. In this work, we identify that the state-of-the-art empirical defense, adversarial training, has a major limitation in 3D point cloud models due to gradient obfuscation, resulting in significant degradation of robustness against strong attacks. To bridge the gap, we propose PointDP, a purification strategy that leverages diffusion models to defend against 3D adversarial attacks. Since PointDP does not rely on predefined adversarial examples for training, it can defend against diverse threats. We extensively evaluate PointDP on six representative 3D point cloud architectures and leverage sixteen strong and adaptive attacks to demonstrate its lower-bound robustness. Our evaluation shows that PointDP achieves significantly better (i.e., 12.6\\%-40.3\\%) adversarial robustness than state-of-the-art methods under strong attacks bounded by different $\\ell_p$ norms.

Instead of relying on hand-engineered prompts, recent works learn prompts using the training data from downstream tasks. While effective, training on domain-specific data reduces a model's generalization capability to unseen new domains. In this work, we propose test-time prompt tuning (TPT), a method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample. TPT optimizes the prompt by minimizing the entropy with confidence selection so that the model has consistent predictions across different augmented views of each test sample. In evaluating generalization to natural distribution shifts, TPT improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP by 3.6\\% on average, surpassing previous prompt tuning approaches that require additional task-specific training data. In evaluating cross-dataset generalization with unseen categories, TPTperforms on par with the state-of-the-art approaches that use additional training data."}}
