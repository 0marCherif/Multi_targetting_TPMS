The underlying idea of the proposed distance is to interpret the gene expression array of a single cell as a discrete probability measure. The distance between two cells is hence computed by solving an Optimal Transport problem between the two corresponding discrete measures. In the Optimal Transport model, we use two types of cost function for measuring the distance between a pair of genes. The first cost function exploits a gene embedding, called gene2vec, which is used to map each gene to a high dimensional vector: the cost of moving a unit of mass of gene expression from a gene to another is set to the Euclidean distance between the corresponding embedded vectors. The second cost function is based on a Pearson distance among pairs of genes. In both cost functions, the more two genes are correlated, the lower is their distance. We exploit the Gene Mover's Distance to solve two classification problems: the classification of cells according to their condition and according to their type. To assess the impact of our new metric, we compare the performances of a $k$-Nearest Neighbor classifier using different distances. The computational results show that the Gene Mover's Distance is competitive with the state-of-the-art distances used in the literature."}}

Any valid total coloring induces a partition of the elements of $G$ into total matchings, which are defined as subsets of vertices and edges that can take the same color. In this paper, we propose Integer Linear Programming models for both the Total Coloring and the Total Matching problems, and we study the strength of the corresponding Linear Programming relaxations. The total coloring is formulated as the problem of finding the minimum number of total matchings that cover all the graph elements. This covering formulation can be solved by a Column Generation algorithm, where the pricing subproblem corresponds to the Weighted Total Matching Problem. Hence, we study the Total Matching Polytope. We introduce three families of nontrivial valid inequalities: vertex-clique inequalities based on standard clique inequalities of the Stable Set Polytope, congruent-$2k3$ cycle inequalities based on the parity of the vertex set induced by the cycle, and even-clique inequalities induced by complete subgraphs of even order. We prove that congruent-$2k3$ cycle inequalities are facet-defining only when $k = 4$, while the vertex-clique and even-cliques are always facet-defining. Finally, we present preliminary computational results of a Column Generation algorithm for the Total Coloring Problem and a Cutting Plane algorithm for the Total Matching Problem."}}

The computation of a Wasserstein Barycenter is formulated as an optimization problem over the space of discrete probability measures. In practice, the barycenter is a discrete probability measure which minimizes the sum of the pairwise Wasserstein distances between the barycenter itself and each input measure. While this problem can be formulated using Linear Programming techniques, it remains a challenging problem due to the size of real-life instances. In this paper, we propose simple but efficient primal heuristics, which exploit the properties of the optimal plan obtained while computing the Wasserstein Distance between a pair of probability measures. In order to evaluate the proposed primal heuristics, we have performed extensive computational tests using random Gaussian distributions, the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, and the Fashion MNIST dataset introduced by Zalando. We also used Translated MNIST, a modification of MNIST which contains original images, rescaled randomly and translated into a larger image. We compare the barycenters computed by our heuristics with the exact solutions obtained with a commercial Linear Programming solver, and with a state-of-the-art algorithm based on Gaussian convolutions. Our results show that the proposed heuristics yield in very short run time and an average optimality gap significantly smaller than 1%."}}

Recent works in computer vision and machine learning have shown the benefits of measuring Wasserstein distances of order 1 between histograms with $n$ bins by solving a classical transportation problem on very large complete bipartite graphs with $n$ nodes and $n^2$ edges. The main contribution of our work is to approximate the original transportation problem by an uncapacitated min cost flow problem on a reduced flow network of size $O(n)$ that exploits the geometric structure of the cost function. More precisely, when the distance among the bin centers is measured with the 1-norm or the $\\infty$-norm, our approach provides an optimal solution. When the distance among bins is measured with the 2-norm, (i) we derive a quantitative estimate on the error between optimal and approximate solution; (ii) given the error, we construct a reduced flow network of size $O(n)$."}}

Wasserstein Barycenters were recently introduced to mathematically generalize the concept of averaging a set of points, to the concept of averaging a set of clouds of points, such as, for instance, two-dimensional images. In Machine Learning terms, the Wasserstein Barycenter problem is a generative constrained optimization problem, since the values of the decision variables of the optimal solution give a new image that represents the \u201caverage\u201d of the input images. Unfortunately, in the recent literature, Linear Programming is repeatedly described as an inefficient method to compute Wasserstein Barycenters. In this paper, we aim at disproving such claim. Our family of Linear Programming models rely on different types of Kantorovich-Wasserstein distances used to compute a barycenter, and they are efficiently solved with a modern commercial Linear Programming solver. We numerically show the strength of the proposed models by computing and plotting the barycenters of all digits included in the classical MNIST dataset."}}

Students rank projects according to their preferences for the topic and side constraints limit the possibilities to team up students in the project topics. The goal is to find assignments that are fair and that maximize the collective satisfaction. Moreover, we consider issues of stability and envy from the students\u2019 viewpoint. This problem arises as a crucial activity in the organization of a first year course at the Faculty of Science of the University of Southern Denmark. We formalize the student-project allocation problem as a mixed integer linear programming problem and focus on different ways to model fairness and utilitarian principles. On the basis of real-world data, we compare empirically the quality of the allocations found by the different models and the computational effort to find solutions by means of a state-of-the-art commercial solver. We provide empirical evidence about the effects of these models on the distribution of the student assignments, which could be valuable input for policy makers in similar settings. Building on these results we propose novel combinations of the models that, for our case, attain feasible, stable, fair and collectively satisfactory solutions within a minute of computation. Since 2010, these solutions are used in practice at our institution."}}

Although these inequalities subsume many of the valid inequalities known for the problem, their exact separation has only been investigated in few special cases obtained by restricting the induced subgraph to a specific topology. In this work, we propose a different approach in which, rather than imposing topological restrictions on the induced subgraph, we assume the right-hand side of the inequality to be fixed to a given (but arbitrary) constant. We then study the arising separation problem, which corresponds to the problem of finding a maximum weight subgraph with a bounded stability number. After proving its hardness and giving some insights on its polyhedral structure, we propose an exact branch-and-cut method for its solution. Computational results show that the separation of topology-free rank inequalities with a fixed right-hand side yields a substantial improvement over the bound provided by the fractional clique polytope (which is obtained with rank inequalities where the induced subgraph is restricted to a clique), often better than that obtained with Lov\u00e1sz\u2019s Theta function via semidefinite programming."}}
