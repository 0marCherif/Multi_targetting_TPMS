Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting for Fake Audio Detection", "abstract": "Current fake audio detection algorithms achieve promising performances on most datasets. However, their performance may be significantly degraded when dealing with audio of a different dataset. The orthogonal weight modification to overcome catastrophic forgetting does not consider the similarity of some audio, including fake audio obtained by the same algorithm and genuine audio, on different datasets. To overcome this limitation, we propose a continual learning algorithm for fake audio detection to overcome catastrophic forgetting, called Regularized Adaptive Weight Modification (RAWM). Specifically, when fine-tuning a detection network, our approach adaptively computes the direction of weight modification according to the ratio of genuine utterances and fake utterances. The adaptive modification direction ensures the network can detect fake audio on the new dataset while preserving its knowledge of previous model, thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In addition, orthogonal weight modification of fake audios in the new dataset will skew the distribution of inferences on audio in the previous dataset with similar acoustic characteristics, so we introduce a regularization constraint to force the network to remember this distribution. We evaluate our approach across multiple datasets and obtain a significant performance improvement on cross-dataset experiments."}}

Analyzing Vocoder Fingerprints for Fake Audio", "abstract": "In recent years, vocoders powered by deep neural networks (DNNs) have found much success in the task of generating raw waveforms from acoustic features, as the audio generated becomes increasingly realistic. This development however raises a few challenges, especially in the field of forensics, where the attribution of audio to real or generated sources is vital. To our knowledge, our investigation constitutes the first efforts to answer the question on the existence of vocoder fingerprints and to analyze them. In this paper, we present our discoveries in identifying the sources of generated audio waveforms. Our experiments conducted on the multi-speaker LibriTTS dataset show that (1) vocoder models do leave model-specific fingerprints on the audio they generate, and (2) minor differences in vocoder training can result in sufficiently different fingerprints in generated audio as to allow for distinguishing between the two. We believe that these differences are strong evidence that there exist vocoder-specific fingerprints that can be exploited for source identification purposes."}}
