Building test schedules, which focus on the right tests and make optimal use of the available resources, both time and hardware, under consideration of vast requirements on the selection of test cases and their assignment to certain test execution machines, is a complex optimization task. Manual solutions are time-consuming and often error-prone. Furthermore, when software and hardware components and test scripts are frequently added, removed or updated, static test execution scheduling is no longer feasible and the motivation for automation taking care of dynamic changes grows. Since 2012, our work has focused on transferring technology based on constraint programming for automating the testing of industrial robotic systems at ABB Robotics. After having successfully transferred constraint satisfaction models dedicated to test case generation, we present the results of a project called DynTest whose goal is to automate the scheduling of test execution from a large test repository, on distinct industrial robots. This paper reports on our experience and lessons learned for successfully transferring constraint-based optimization models for test execution scheduling at ABB Robotics. Our experience underlines the benefits of a close collaboration between industry and academia for both parties."}}

Upon request, automated vehicles must be able to explain their decisions to the driver and the car passengers, to the pedestrians and other vulnerable road users and potentially to external auditors in case of accidents. However, nowadays, most explainable methods still rely on quantitative analysis of the AD scene representations captured by multiple sensors. This paper proposes a novel representation of AD scenes, called Qualitative eXplainable Graph (QXG), dedicated to qualitative spatiotemporal reasoning of long-term scenes. The construction of this graph exploits the recent Qualitative Constraint Acquisition paradigm. Our experimental results on NuScenes, an open real-world multi-modal dataset, show that the qualitative eXplainable graph of an AD scene composed of 40 frames can be computed in real-time and light in space storage which makes it a potentially interesting tool for improved and more trustworthy perception and control processes in AD."}}

On the one hand, the precise modelling of these constraints, which are formulated in various relation algebras, entails a number of possible logical combinations and requires expertise in constraint-based modelling. On the other hand, active constraint acquisition (CA) has been used successfully to support non-experienced users in learning conjunctive constraint networks through the generation of a sequence of queries. In this paper, we propose GEACQ, which stands for Generic Qualitative Constraint Acquisition, an active CA method that learns qualitative constraints via the concept of qualitative queries. GEACQ combines qualitative queries with time-bounded path consistency (PC) and background knowledge propagation to acquire the qualitative constraints of any scheduling or packing problem. We prove soundness, completeness and termination of GEACQ by exploiting the jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint property of qualitative calculus and we give an experimental evaluation that shows (i) the efficiency of our approach in learning temporal constraints and, (ii) the use of GEACQ on real scheduling instances."}}

In this paper, we introduce a failure-oriented class augmentation (FoCA) technique to address the problem of imbalanced performance in image classification, where the trained model has performance deficits in some of the dataset's classes. By employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment these deficit classes, we finetune the model towards a balanced performance among the different classes and an overall better performance on the whole dataset. Unlike earlier works, during training, our method focuses on those classes with the lowest accuracy after the initial training phase. Only these classes are augmented to boost the accuracy, which leads to better performance. FoCA is designed to be used with a light-weight GAN method to make the GAN-based augmentation viable and effective, even for datasets with only few images per class, while simultaneously requiring less computation than other, more complex GAN methods. Our implementation of FoCA combines this light-weight GAN method for class-wise data augmentation with state-of-the-art deep neural network techniques for training. Experiments show an overall improvement from FoCA with competitive or better accuracy than the previous state-of-the-art on five datasets with different sizes and image resolutions."}}

For researchers interested in bugs, tangled commits mean that they actually study not only bugs, but also other concerns irrelevant for the study of bugs. Objective We want to improve our understanding of the prevalence of tangling and the types of changes that are tangled within bug fixing commits. Methods We use a crowd sourcing approach for manual labeling to validate which changes contribute to bug fixes for each line in bug fixing commits. Each line is labeled by four participants. If at least three participants agree on the same label, we have consensus. Results We estimate that between 17% and 32% of all changes in bug fixing commits modify the source code to fix the underlying problem. However, when we only consider changes to the production code files this ratio increases to 66% to 87%. We find that about 11% of lines are hard to label leading to active disagreements between participants. Due to confirmed tangling and the uncertainty in our data, we estimate that 3% to 47% of data is noisy without manual untangling, depending on the use case. Conclusion Tangled commits have a high prevalence in bug fixes and can lead to a large amount of noise in the data. Prior research indicates that this noise may alter results. As researchers, we should be skeptics and assume that unvalidated data is likely very noisy, until proven otherwise."}}

However, the unlabeled, noisy, irregular time-series data and the large area to be covered make it challenging to detect illegal activities. Existing solutions focus only on trajectory reconstruction and probabilistic models that do ignore the context, such as the neighboring vessels. We propose a novel representation learning method that considers both temporal and spatial contexts learned in a self-supervised manner, using a selection of pretext tasks that do not require to be labeled manually. The underlying model encodes the representation of maritime vessel data compactly and effectively. This generic encoder can then be used as input for more complex tasks lacking labeled data."}}

By feeding a supervised Machine Learning (ML) model with data composed of known boundaries and extracted features of COPs, it is possible to train the model to estimate boundaries of a new COP instance. In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing body of knowledge on ML for Constraint Programming (CP) which learns from problem instances. Second, we introduce a boundary estimation framework that is applied as a tool to support a CP solver. Within this framework, different ML models are discussed and evaluated regarding their suitability for boundary estimation, and countermeasures to avoid unfeasible estimations that avoid the solver to find an optimal solution are shown. Third, we present an experimental study with distinct CP solvers on seven COPs. Our results show that near-optimal boundaries can be learned for these COPs with only little overhead. These estimated boundaries reduce the objective domain size by 60-88% and can help the solver to find near-optimal solutions early during search."}}
