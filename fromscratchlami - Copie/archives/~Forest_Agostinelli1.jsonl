Recently, deep reinforcement learning has been used to train deep neural networks (DNNs) as heuristic functions for planning problems. While DNNs can be powerful function approximators that, combined with reinforcement learning, require little to no domain-specific knowledge to learn, there is no formal way to specify goals to DNNs. We introduce a method of training DNN heuristic functions to estimate the distance between a given state and a goal, where a goal is represented as a set of atoms in first-order logic. We then use answer set programming to specify goals, where a set of atoms representing a goal is obtained from the stable model of an answer set program. The DNN heuristic function is then combined with search to reach goals. In our experiments with the Rubik's cube and Sokoban, we show that we can specify and reach a variety of different goals without any need to re-train the DNN. Furthermore, since the specification language is first-order logic, one can specify a goal without having to know what states meet that specification, beforehand. Therefore, our approach can also be used to discover states that meet a given specification."}}

In many domains, explainable solutions are a necessary condition while optimality is not. Therefore, we seek to constrain solutions to the space of solutions that can be explained to a human. To do this, we build on inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques that allow us to define robust background knowledge and inductive biases. By combining ILP with a given inscrutable planner, we are able to construct an explainable graph representing solutions to all states in the state space. This graph can then be summarized using a variety of methods such as hierarchical representations and simple if/else rules. We test our approach on Towers of Hanoi and discuss future work for applications to the Rubik\u2019s cube."}}

This paper describes the process of defining explanations in the context of a collaborative AI platform, ALLURE, which teaches the user how to solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube. A macro-action in our collaborative AI algorithm refers to a set of moves that takes the cube from initial state to goal state - a process that was not transparent nor accessible when we revealed back-end logic to the front-end for user engagement.\u00a0By providing\u00a0macro-action explanations to the user in a chatbot as well as a visual representation of the moves being performed on a virtual Rubik\u2019s Cube, we created an XAI interface to engage and guide the user through a subset of the solutions that can later be applied to the remaining solutions of the AI. After initial usability testing, our study provides some useful and practical XAI user interface design implications."}}

This is because the computation and memory requirements of A* search grow linearly with the size of the action space. This burden becomes even more apparent when A* search uses a heuristic function learned by computationally expensive function approximators, such as deep neural networks. To address this problem, we introduce Q* search, a search algorithm that uses deep Q-networks to guide search in order to take advantage of the fact that the sum of the transition costs and heuristic values of the children of a node can be computed with a single forward pass through a deep Q-network without explicitly generating those children. This significantly reduces computation time and requires only one node to be generated per iteration. We use Q* search to solve the Rubik's cube when formulated with a large action space that includes 1872 meta-actions and find that this 157-fold increase in the size of the action space incurs less than a 4-fold increase in computation time and less than a 3-fold increase in number of nodes generated when performing Q* search. Furthermore, Q* search is up to 129 times faster and generates up to 1288 times fewer nodes than A* search. Finally, although obtaining admissible heuristic functions from deep neural networks is an ongoing area of research, we prove that Q* search is guaranteed to find a shortest path given a heuristic function that neither overestimates the cost of a shortest path nor underestimates the transition cost."}}
