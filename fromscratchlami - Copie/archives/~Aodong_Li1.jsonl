In this paper, we determine a set of conditions under which the ranking of anomaly scores generalizes from labeled queries to unlabeled data. Inspired by these conditions, we propose a new querying strategy for active anomaly detection that leads to systematic improvements over current approaches for this problem. It selects a diverse set of data points for labeling, achieving high data coverage with a limited budget. These labeled data points provide weak supervision to the unsupervised anomaly detection problem. However, correctly identifying anomalies requires an estimate of the fraction of anomalies in the data. We show how this anomaly rate can be estimated from the query set by importance-weighting, removing the associated bias due to the non-uniform sampling procedure. Extensive experiments on image, tabular, and video data sets show that our approach results in state-of-the-art active anomaly detection performance."}}

We derive a new Bayesian online inference approach to simultaneously infer these distribution shifts and adapt the model to the detected changes by integrating ideas from change point detection, switching dynamical systems, and Bayesian online learning. Using a binary \u2018change variable,\u2019 we construct an informative prior such that--if a change is detected--the model partially erases the information of past model updates by tempering to facilitate adaptation to the new data distribution. Furthermore, the approach uses beam search to track multiple change-point hypotheses and selects the most probable one in hindsight. Our proposed method is model-agnostic, applicable in both supervised and unsupervised learning settings, suitable for an environment of concept drifts or covariate drifts, and yields improvements over state-of-the-art Bayesian online learning approaches."}}

To address this problem we propose a new Bayesian meta-algorithm that can both (i) make inferences about subtle distribution shifts based on minimal sequential observations and (ii) accordingly adapt a model in an online fashion. The approach uses beam search over multiple change point hypotheses to perform inference on a hierarchical sequential latent variable modeling framework. Our proposed approach is model-agnostic, applicable to both supervised and unsupervised learning, and yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art Bayesian online learning approaches."}}
