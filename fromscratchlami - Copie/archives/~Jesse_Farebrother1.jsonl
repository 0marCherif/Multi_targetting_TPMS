Analogous to how the successor representation (SR) describes the expected consequences of behaving according to a given policy, our distributional successor measure (SM) describes the distributional consequences of this behaviour. We formulate the distributional SM as a distribution over distributions and provide theory connecting it with distributional and model-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose an algorithm that learns the distributional SM from data by minimizing a two-level maximum mean discrepancy. Key to our method are a number of algorithmic techniques that are independently valuable for learning generative models of state. As an illustration of the usefulness of the distributional SM, we show that it enables zero-shot risk-sensitive policy evaluation in a way that was not previously possible."}}

Analogous scaling laws remain elusive for reinforcement learning domains, however, where increasing the parameter count of a model often hurts its final performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that incorporating Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) modules, and in particular Soft MoEs (Puigcerver et al., 2023), into value-based networks results in more parameter-scalable models, evidenced by substantial performance increases across a variety of training regimes and model sizes. This work thus provides strong empirical evidence towards developing scaling laws for reinforcement learning."}}

Our method is data-centric, leveraging data collected on a STEM. The data samples are processed and filtered to produce symbolic representations, which we use to train a neural network to predict transition probabilities. These learned transition dynamics are then leveraged to guide a single silicon atom throughout the lattice to pre-determined target destinations. We present empirical analyses that demonstrate the efficacy and generality of our approach."}}

However, learning policies that can perform multiple tasks and leverage prior experience to learn faster remains challenging. Despite previous attempts to improve on these areas, our understanding of multi-task training and generalization in reinforcement learning remains limited. In this work we propose to investigate the generalization capabilities of a popular actor-critic method, IMPALA. We build on previous work that has advocated for the use of modes and difficulties of Atari 2600 games as a benchmark for transfer learning in reinforcement learning. We do so by pretraining an agent on multiple flavours of the same game before finetuning on the remaining unseen ones. This protocol simplifies the multi-task pretraining phase by limiting negative interference between tasks and allows us to better understand the dynamics of multi-task training and generalization. We find that, given a fixed amount of pretraining data, agents trained with more variations of a game are able to generalize better. Surprisingly we observe that this advantage can be more pronounced after finetuning for 200M environment frames than when doing zero-shot transfer. This highlights the importance of the learned representation and that performance after finetuning might more appropriate to evaluate generalization in reinforcement learning. We also find that, even though small networks have remained popular to solve Atari 2600 games increasing the capacity of the value and policy network is critical to achieve good performance as we increase the number of pretraining modes and difficulties. Overall our findings emphasize key points that are crucial for efficient multi-task training and generalization in reinforcement learning."}}
