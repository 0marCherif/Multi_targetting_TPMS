Current retrospective rigid intra-slice motion correction techniques jointly optimize estimates of the image and the motion parameters. In this paper, we use a deep network to reduce the joint image-motion parameter search to a search over rigid motion parameters alone. Our network produces a reconstruction as a function of two inputs: corrupted k-space data and motion parameters. We train the network using simulated, motion-corrupted k-space data generated from known motion parameters. At test-time, we estimate unknown motion parameters by minimizing a data consistency loss between the motion parameters, the network-based image reconstruction given those parameters, and the acquired measurements. Intra-slice motion correction experiments on simulated and realistic 2D fast spin echo brain MRI achieve high reconstruction fidelity while retaining the benefits of explicit data consistency-based optimization."}}

Our work is motivated by the challenges arising in MRI acquisition where the signal is a corrupted Fourier transform of the desired image. The proposed joint learning schemes enable both correction of artifacts native to the frequency space and manipulation of image space representations to reconstruct coherent image structures at every layer of the network. This is in contrast to most current deep learning approaches for image reconstruction that treat frequency and image space features separately and often operate exclusively in one of the two spaces. We demonstrate the advantages of joint convolutional learning for a variety of tasks, including motion correction, denoising, reconstruction from undersampled acquisitions, and combined undersampling and motion correction on simulated and real world multicoil MRI data. The joint models produce consistently high quality output images across all tasks and datasets. When integrated into a state of the art unrolled optimization network with physics-inspired data consistency constraints for undersampled reconstruction, the proposed architectures significantly improve the optimization landscape, which yields an order of magnitude reduction of training time. This result suggests that joint representations are particularly well suited for MRI signals in deep learning networks.
