CNVs play important roles in the development of diseases and complex traits. CNV detection with short-read DNA sequencing technology is challenging because CNVs significantly vary in size and are similar to DNA sequencing artifacts. Many methods have been developed but still yield unsatisfactory results with high computational costs. Here, we propose CNV-Net, a novel approach for CNV detection using a six-layer convolutional neural network. We encode DNA sequencing information into RGB images and train the convolutional neural network with these images. The fitted convolutional neural network can then be used to predict CNVs from DNA sequencing data. We benchmark CNV-Net with two high-quality whole-genome sequencing datasets available from the Genome in a Bottle Consortium, considered as gold standard benchmarking datasets for CNV detection. We demonstrate that CNV-Net is more accurate and efficient in CNV detection than current tools."}}
