While effective, existing DA methods suffer from a substantial drop in performance when applied to a multi-class training setting, due to the co-existence of low-quality pseudo labels and class imbalance issues. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a novel ReDB framework tailored for learning to detect all classes at once. Our approach produces Reliable, Diverse, and class-Balanced pseudo 3D boxes to iteratively guide the self-training on a distributionally different target domain. To alleviate disruptions caused by the environmental discrepancy (e.g., beam numbers), the proposed cross-domain examination (CDE) assesses the correctness of pseudo labels by copy-pasting target instances into a source environment and measuring the prediction consistency. To reduce computational overhead and mitigate the object shift (e.g., scales and point densities), we design an overlapped boxes counting (OBC) metric that allows to uniformly downsample pseudo-labeled objects across different geometric characteristics. To confront the issue of inter-class imbalance, we progressively augment the target point clouds with a class-balanced set of pseudo-labeled target instances and source objects, which boosts recognition accuracies on both frequently appearing and rare classes. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets using both voxel-based (i.e., SECOND) and point-based 3D detectors (i.e., PointRCNN) demonstrate that our proposed ReDB approach outperforms existing \u2026"}}

Active learning (AL) seeks to mitigate the annotation burden through algorithms that use fewer labels and can attain performance comparable to fully supervised learning. Although AL has shown promise, current approaches prioritize the selection of unlabeled point clouds with high uncertainty and/or diversity, leading to the selection of more instances for labeling and reduced computational efficiency. In this paper, we resort to a novel kernel coding rate maximization (KECOR) strategy which aims to identify the most informative point clouds to acquire labels through the lens of information theory. Greedy search is applied to seek desired point clouds that can maximize the minimal number of bits required to encode the latent features. To determine the uniqueness and informativeness of the selected samples from the model perspective, we construct a proxy network of the 3D detector head and compute the outer product of Jacobians from all proxy layers to form the empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) matrix. To accommodate both one-stage (i.e., SECOND) and two-stage detectors (i.e., PVRCNN), we further incorporate the classification entropy maximization and well trade-off between detection performance and the total number of bounding boxes selected for annotation. Extensive experiments conducted on two 3D benchmarks and a 2D detection dataset evidence the superiority and versatility of the proposed approach. Our results show that approximately 44% box-level annotation costs and 26% computational time are reduced compared to the state-of-the-art AL method, without compromising detection performance."}}

To overcome this limitation, we jointly investigate three novel criteria in our framework CRB for point cloud acquisition - label conciseness, feature representativeness and \ngeometric balance, which hierarchically filters out the point clouds of redundant 3D bounding box labels, latent features and geometric characteristics (e.g., point cloud density) from the unlabeled sample pool and greedily selects informative ones with fewer objects to annotate. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed criteria aligns the marginal distributions of the selected subset and the prior distributions of the unseen test set, and minimizes the upper bound of the generalization error.

As a result, the previous methods cannot guarantee that the generated visual features can truthfully reflect the corresponding semantics. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Cycle-consistent Adversarial Networks for Zero-Shot Learning (CANZSL). It encourages a visual feature generator to synthesize realistic visual features from semantics, and then inversely translate back the synthesized visual features to the corresponding semantic space by a semantic feature generator. Furthermore, in this paper a more challenging and practical ZSL problem is considered where\nthe original semantics are from natural language with irrelevant words instead of clean semantics, which are widely used in previous work. Specifically, a multi-modal consistent bidirectional generative adversarial model is trained to handle unseen instances by suppressing noise in the natural language. A forward one-to-many mapping from the class level descriptions to the visual features is coupled with\nan inverse many-to-one mapping from the visual space to the semantic space. Thus, a multi-modal cycle-consistency loss between the synthesized semantic representations and the ground truth can be learned and leveraged to enforce the generated semantic features to approximate to the real distribution in semantic space. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on natural language based zero-shot learning tasks.\n"}}

To bridge the gap between the seen and unseen classes, most GZSL methods attempt to associate the visual features of seen classes with attributes or to generate unseen samples directly. Nevertheless, the visual features used in prior approaches do not necessarily encode semantically related information that the shared attributes refer to, which greatly degrades the model generalization to unseen classes. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel semantics disentangling framework for the generalized zero-shot learning task (SDGZSL), where the visual features depicted unseen classes are firstly estimated by a conditional VAE and then factorized into semantic-consistent and semantic-unrelated latent vectors. In particular, a total correlation penalty is applied to guarantee the independence between the two factorized representations, and the semantic consistency of which is measured by the derived relation network. Extensive experiments conducted on four GZSL benchmark datasets have evidenced that the semantic-consistent features disentangled by the proposed SDGZSL are more generalizable in tasks of canonical and generalized zero-shot learning."}}

Neverthe-less, prior works strictly assume that each source domain shares the identical group of classes with the target domain, which could hardly be guaranteed as the target label space is not observable. In this paper, we consider a more versatile setting of MSDA, namely Generalized Multi-source Domain Adaptation, wherein the source domains are partially over-lapped, and the target domain is allowed to contain novel cat-egories that are not presented in any source domains. This new setting is more elusive than any existing domain adaptation protocols due to the coexistence of the domain and cate-gory shifts across the source and target domains. To address this issue, we propose a variational domain disentanglement (VDD) framework, which decomposes the domain represen-tations and semantic features for each instance by encouraging dimension-wise independence. To identify the target sam-ples of unknown classes, we leverage online pseudo labeling, which assigns the pseudo-labels to unlabeled target data based on the confidence scores.

However, most existing OSDA approaches are limited due to three main reasons, including: (1) the lack of essential theoretical analysis of generalization bound, (2) the reliance on the coexistence of source and target data during adaptation, and (3) failing to accurately estimate the uncertainty of model predictions. We propose a Progressive Graph Learning (PGL) framework that decomposes the target hypothesis space into the shared and unknown subspaces, and then progressively pseudo-labels the most confident known samples from the target domain for hypothesis adaptation. Moreover, we tackle a more realistic source-free open-set domain adaptation (SF-OSDA) setting that makes no assumption about the coexistence of source and target domains, and introduce a balanced pseudo-labeling (BP-L) strategy in a two-stage framework, namely SF-PGL. Different from PGL that applies a class-agnostic constant threshold for all target samples for pseudo-labeling, the SF-PGL model uniformly selects the most confident target instances from each category at a fixed ratio. The confidence thresholds in each class are regarded as the 'uncertainty' of learning the semantic information, which are then used to weigh the classification loss in the adaptation step. We conducted unsupervised and semi-supervised OSDA and SF-OSDA experiments on the benchmark image classification and action recognition datasets. Additionally, we find that balanced pseudo-labeling plays a significant role in improving calibration, which makes the trained model less prone to over-confident or under-confident predictions on the target data.
