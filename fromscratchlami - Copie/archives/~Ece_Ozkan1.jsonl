For most applications, annotation is an expensive task in addition to data collection. Thus, learning from limited labeled data is very critical for data-limited problems, such as in healthcare applications, to have the ability to learn in a sample-efficient manner. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can learn meaningful representations from exploiting structures in unlabeled data, which allows the model to achieve high accuracy in various downstream tasks, even with limited annotations. In this work, we extend contrastive learning, an efficient implementation of SSL, to cardiac imaging. We propose to use generated M(otion)-mode images from readily available B(rightness)-mode echocardiograms and design contrastive objectives with structure and patient-awareness. Experiments on EchoNet-Dynamic show that our proposed model can achieve an AUROC score of 0.85 by simply training a linear head on top of the learned representations, and is insensitive to the reduction of labeled data."}}

This generalization enables us to invoke properties of Herding that show that divMbest enforces implausible constraints which may yield wrong assumptions for some problem settings. Our experiments in semantic segmentation demonstrate that seeing divMbest as an instance of Herding leads to better alternatives for the implausible constraints of divMbest."}}
