Given the goal of learning local policies that enable decentralized execution, agents are commonly assumed to be independent of each other, even in centralized training. However, such an assumption may prohibit agents from learning the optimal joint policy. To address this problem, we explicitly take the dependency among agents into centralized training. Although this leads to the optimal joint policy, it may not be factorized for decentralized execution. Nevertheless, we theoretically show that from such a joint policy, we can always derive another joint policy that achieves the same optimality but can be factorized for decentralized execution. To this end, we propose multi-agent conditional policy factorization (MACPF), which takes more centralized training but still enables decentralized execution. We empirically verify MACPF in various cooperative MARL tasks and demonstrate that MACPF achieves better performance or faster convergence than baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/PKU-RL/FOP-DMAC-MACPF."}}

However, existing works heavily rely on the purity of the data, exhibiting performance degradation or even catastrophic failure when learning from contaminated datasets containing impure trajectories of diverse levels. e.g., expert level, medium level, etc., while offline contaminated data logs exist commonly in the real world.  To mitigate this, we first introduce gradient penalty over the learned value function to tackle the exploding Q-function gradients. We then relax the closeness constraints towards non-optimal actions with critic weighted constraint relaxation. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques effectively tame the non-optimal trajectories for policy constraint offline RL methods, evaluated on a set of contaminated D4RL Mujoco and Adroit datasets."}}

Compared to other environments studied in most previous work, ours presents new generalization challenges for competitive reinforcement learning. It is a multi-agent problem with one agent competing against its opponent; and it requires the generalization ability as it has diverse targets to control and diverse opponents to compete with. We describe the observation, action, and reward specifications for the Honor of Kings domain and provide an open-source Python-based interface for communicating with the game engine. We provide twenty target heroes with a variety of tasks in Honor of Kings Arena and present initial baseline results for RL-based methods with feasible computing resources.  Finally, we showcase the generalization challenges imposed by Honor of Kings Arena and possible remedies to the challenges. All of the software, including the environment-class, are publicly available."}}

Even though these AI systems have achieved or even exceeded human-level performance, they still suffer from the lack of policy diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel Macro-Goals Guided framework, called MGG, to learn diverse policies in MOBA games. MGG abstracts strategies as macro-goals from human demonstrations and trains a Meta-Controller to predict these macro-goals. To enhance policy diversity, MGG samples macro-goals from the Meta-Controller prediction and guides the training process towards these goals. Experimental results on the typical MOBA game Honor of Kings demonstrate that MGG can execute diverse policies in different matches and lineups, and also outperform the state-of-the-art methods over 102 heroes."}}

The key idea lies in the coordinated adaptation of step size during the policy update process among multiple agents. We prove the monotonicity of policy improvement when optimizing a theoretically-grounded joint objective, and derive a simplified optimization objective based on a set of approximations. We then interpret that such an objective in CoPPO can achieve dynamic credit assignment among agents, thereby alleviating the high variance issue during the concurrent update of agent policies. Finally, we demonstrate that CoPPO outperforms several strong baselines and is competitive with the latest multi-agent PPO method (i.e. MAPPO) under typical multi-agent settings, including cooperative matrix games and the StarCraft II micromanagement tasks.

While most research focuses on the state-action function part through reducing the bootstrapping error in value function approximation induced by the distribution shift of training data, the effects of error propagation in generative modeling have been neglected. In this paper, we analyze the error in generative modeling. We propose AQL (action-conditioned Q-learning), a residual generative model to reduce policy approximation error for offline RL. We show that our method can learn more accurate policy approximations in different benchmark datasets. In addition, we show that the proposed offline RL method can learn more competitive AI agents in complex control tasks under the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, Honor of Kings."}}

Learning to Draft in MOBA Games with Neural Networks and Tree Search", "abstract": "Hero drafting is essential in MOBA game playing as it builds the team of each side and directly affects the match outcome. State-of-the-art drafting methods fail to consider: 1) drafting efficiency when the hero pool is expanded; 2) the multi-round nature of a MOBA 5v5 match series, i.e., two teams play best-of-N and the same hero is only allowed to be drafted once throughout the series. In this paper, we formulate the drafting process as a multi-round combinatorial game and propose a novel drafting algorithm based on neural networks and Monte-Carlo tree search, named JueWuDraft. Specifically, we design a long-term value estimation mechanism to handle the best-of-N drafting case.
