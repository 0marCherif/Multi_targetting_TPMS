As models are being increasingly used, on devices, to automate tasks and power new applications, there have been concerns that such white-box access to its parameters, as opposed to the black-box setting which only provides query access to the model, increases the attack surface. Directly extending the shadow modelling technique from the black-box to the white-box setting has been shown, in general, not to perform better than black-box only attacks. A key reason is misalignment, a known characteristic of deep neural networks. We here present the first systematic analysis of the causes of misalignment in shadow models and show the use of a different weight initialisation to be the main cause of shadow model misalignment. Second, we extend several re-alignment techniques, previously developed in the model fusion literature, to the shadow modelling context, where the goal is to re-align the layers of a shadow model to those of the target model.We show re-alignment techniques to significantly reduce the measured misalignment between the target and shadow models. Finally, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of white-box membership inference attacks (MIA). Our analysis reveals that (1) MIAs suffer from misalignment between shadow models, but that (2) re-aligning the shadow models improves, sometimes significantly, MIA performance. On the CIFAR10 dataset with a false positive rate of 1\\%, white-box MIA using re-aligned shadow models improves the true positive rate by 4.5\\%.Taken together, our results highlight that on-device deployment increase the attack surface and that the newly available information can be used by an attacker."}}

While membership inference attacks (MIAs), based on shadow modeling, have become the standard to evaluate the privacy of synthetic data, they currently assume the attacker to have access to an auxiliary dataset sampled from a similar distribution as the training dataset. This is often seen as a very strong assumption in practice, especially as the proposed main use cases for synthetic tabular data (e.g. medical data, financial transactions) are very specific and don't have any reference datasets directly available. We here show how this assumption can be removed, allowing for MIAs to be performed using only the synthetic data. Specifically, we developed three different scenarios: (S1) Black-box access to the generator, (S2) only access to the released synthetic dataset and (S3) a theoretical setup as upper bound for the attack performance using only synthetic data. Our results show that MIAs are still successful, across two real-world datasets and two synthetic data generators. These results show how the strong hypothesis made when auditing synthetic data releases - access to an auxiliary dataset - can be relaxed, making the attacks more realistic in practice."}}

Shadow modeling-based Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have become the standard approach to evaluate the privacy risk of synthetic data. While very effective, they require a large number of datasets to be created and models trained to evaluate the risk posed by a single record. The privacy risk of a dataset is thus currently evaluated by running MIAs on a handful of records selected using ad-hoc methods. We here propose what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first principled vulnerable record identification technique for synthetic data publishing, leveraging the distance to a record's closest neighbors. We show our method to strongly outperform previous ad-hoc methods across datasets and generators. We also show evidence of our method to be robust to the choice of MIA and to specific choice of parameters. Finally, we show it to accurately identify vulnerable records when synthetic data generators are made differentially private. The choice of vulnerable records is as important as more accurate MIAs when evaluating the privacy of synthetic data releases, including from a legal perspective. We here propose a simple yet highly effective method to do so. We hope our method will enable practitioners to better estimate the risk posed by synthetic data publishing and researchers to fairly compare ever improving MIAs on synthetic data."}}

Governments and law enforcement agencies around the world have however raised concerns that E2EE also allows illegal content to be shared undetected. Client-side scanning (CSS), using perceptual hashing (PH) to detect known illegal content before it is shared, is seen as a promising solution to prevent the diffusion of illegal content while preserving encryption. While these proposals raise strong privacy concerns, proponents of the solutions have argued that the risk is limited as the technology has a limited scope: detecting known illegal content. In this paper, we show that modern perceptual hashing algorithms are actually fairly flexible pieces of technology and that this flexibility could be used by an adversary to add a secondary hidden feature to a client-side scanning system. More specifically, we show that an adversary providing the PH algorithm can ``hide\" a secondary purpose of face recognition of a target individual alongside its primary purpose of image copy detection. We first propose a procedure to train a dual-purpose deep perceptual hashing model by jointly optimizing for both the image copy detection and the targeted facial recognition task. Second, we extensively evaluate our dual-purpose model and show it to be able to reliably identify a target individual 67% of the time while not impacting its performance at detecting illegal content. We also show that our model is neither a general face detection nor a facial recognition model, allowing its secondary purpose to be hidden. Finally, we show that the secondary purpose can be enabled by adding a single illegal looking image to the database. Taken together, our results raise concerns that a deep perceptual hashing-based CSS system could turn billions of user devices into tools to locate targeted individuals."}}

Theoretical solutions relying on differential privacy guarantees are difficult to implement correctly with reasonable accuracy, while ad-hoc solutions might contain unknown vulnerabilities. Evaluating the privacy provided by QBSes must thus be done by evaluating the accuracy of a wide range of privacy attacks. However, existing attacks against QBSes require time and expertise to develop, need to be manually tailored to the specific systems attacked, and are limited in scope. In this paper, we develop QuerySnout, the first method to automatically discover vulnerabilities in query-based systems. QuerySnout takes as input a target record and the QBS as a black box, analyzes its behavior on one or more datasets, and outputs a multiset of queries together with a rule to combine answers to them in order to reveal the sensitive attribute of the target record. QuerySnout uses evolutionary search techniques based on a novel mutation operator to find a multiset of queries susceptible to lead to an attack, and a machine learning classifier to infer the sensitive attribute from answers to the queries selected. We showcase the versatility of QuerySnout by applying it to two attack scenarios (assuming access to either the private dataset or to a different dataset from the same distribution), three real-world datasets, and a variety of protection mechanisms. We show the attacks found by QuerySnout to consistently equate or outperform, sometimes by a large margin, the best attacks from the literature. We finally show how QuerySnout can be extended to QBSes that require a budget, and apply QuerySnout to a simple QBS based on the Laplace mechanism. Taken together, our results show how powerful and accurate attacks against QBSes can already be found by an automated system, allowing for highly complex QBSes to be automatically tested \"at the pressing of a button\". We believe this line of research to be crucial to improve the robustness of systems providing privacy-preserving access to personal data in theory and in practice."}}

Client-side scanning based on perceptual hashing has been recently proposed by governments and researchers to detect illegal content in E2EE communications. We propose the first framework to evaluate the robustness of perceptual hashing-based client-side scanning to detection avoidance attacks and show current systems to not be robust. We propose three adversarial attacks---a general black-box attack and two white-box attacks for discrete cosine transform-based algorithms--against perceptual hashing algorithms. In a large-scale evaluation, we show perceptual hashing-based client-side scanning mechanisms to be highly vulnerable to detection avoidance attacks in a black-box setting, with more than 99.9\\% of images successfully attacked while preserving the content of the image. We further show several mitigation strategies, such as expanding the database with hashes of images modified using our attack, or increasing the detection threshold, to be ineffective against our attack. Taken together, our results shed serious doubts on the robustness of perceptual hashing-based client-side scanning mechanisms currently proposed by governments, organizations, and researchers around the world."}}

Yet what -- and under which conditions -- a model leaks about its dataset, is not well understood. Most previous works study the leakage of information about an individual record. Yet in many situations, global dataset information such as its underlying distribution, e.g. $k$-way marginals or correlations are similarly sensitive or secret. We here explore for the first time whether a model leaks information about the correlations between the input variables of its training dataset, something we name correlation inference attack. We first propose a model-less attack, showing how an attacker can exploit the spherical parametrization of correlation matrices to make an informed guess based on the correlations between the input variables and the target variable alone. Second, we propose a model-based attack, showing how an attacker can exploit black-box access to the model to infer the correlations using shadow models trained on synthetic datasets. Our synthetic data generation approach combines Gaussian copula-based generative modeling with a carefully adapted procedure for sampling correlation matrices under constraints. Third, we evaluate our model-based attack against Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron models and show it to strongly outperform the model-less attack on three real-world tabular datasets, indicating that the models leak information about the correlations. We also propose a novel correlation inference-based attribute inference attack (CI-AIA), and show it to obtain state-of-the-art performance. Taken together, our results show how attackers can use the model to extract information about the dataset distribution, and use it to improve their prior on sensitive attributes of individual records."}}
