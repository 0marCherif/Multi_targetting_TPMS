A recently emerging paradigm for reducing the reliance of large model training on massive labeled data is to take advantage of abundantly available labeled data from a related source task to boost the performance of the model in a desired target task where there may not be a lot of data available. This approach, which is called transfer learning, has been applied successfully in many application domains. However, despite the fact that many transfer learning algorithms have been developed, the fundamental understanding of \"when\" and \"to what extent\" transfer learning can reduce sample complexity is still limited. In this work, we take a step towards foundational understanding of transfer learning by focusing on binary classification with linear models and Gaussian features and develop statistical minimax lower bounds in terms of the number of source and target samples and an appropriate notion of similarity between source and target tasks. To derive this bound, we reduce the transfer learning problem to hypothesis testing via constructing a packing set of source and target parameters by exploiting Gilbert-Varshamov bound, which in turn leads to a lower bound on sample complexity. We also evaluate our theoretical results by experiments on real data sets."}}

Transfer learning is gaining traction as a promising technique to alleviate this barrier by utilizing the data of a related but different \\emph{source} task to compensate for the lack of data in a \\emph{target} task where there are few labeled training data. While there has been many recent algorithmic advances in this domain, a fundamental understanding of when and how much one can transfer knowledge from a related domain to reduce the amount of labeled training data is far from understood. We provide a precise answer to this question for binary classification problems by deriving a novel lower bound on the generalization error that can be achieved by \\emph{any} transfer learning algorithm (regardless of its computational complexity) as a function of the amount of source and target samples. Our lower bound depends on a natural notion of distance that can be easily computed on real world data sets. Other key features of our lower bound are that it does not depend on the source/target data distributions and requires minimal assumptions that enables it application to a broad range of problems. We also consider a more general setting where there are more than one source domains for knowledge transfer to the target task and develop new bounds on generalization error in this setting. We also corroborate our theoretical findings on real image classification and action recognition data sets. These experiments demonstrate that our natural notion of distance is indicative of the difficulty of knowledge transfer between different pairs of source/target tasks, allowing us to investigate the effect of different sources on the target generalization error. Furthermore, to evaluate the sharpness of our bounds we compare our developed lower bounds with upper-bounds achieved by transfer learning base-lines that utilize weighted empirical risk minimization on the combination of source(s) and target data sets."}}

We propose Lagrange Coded Computing (LCC), a new framework to simultaneously provide (1) resiliency against stragglers that may prolong computations; (2) security against Byzantine (or malicious) workers that deliberately modify the computation for their benefit; and (3) (information-theoretic) privacy of the dataset amidst possible collusion of workers. LCC, which leverages the well-known Lagrange polynomial to create computation redundancy in a novel coded form across workers, can be applied to any computation scenario in which the function of interest is an arbitrary multivariate polynomial of the input dataset, hence covering many computations of interest in machine learning. LCC significantly generalizes prior works to go beyond linear computations. It also enables secure and private computing in distributed settings, improving the computation and communication efficiency of the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we prove the optimality of LCC by showing that it achieves the optimal tradeoff between resiliency, security, and privacy, i.e., in terms of tolerating the maximum number of stragglers and adversaries, and providing data privacy against the maximum number of colluding workers. Finally, we show via experiments on Amazon EC2 that LCC speeds up the conventional uncoded implementation of distributed least-squares linear regression by up to $13.43\\times$, and also achieves a $2.36\\times$-$12.65\\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art straggler mitigation strategies."}}

Scaling these approaches to massive data sizes requires proper distributed gradient descent schemes where distributed worker nodes compute partial gradients based on their partial and local data sets, and send the results to a master node where all the computations are aggregated into a full gradient and the learning model is updated. However, a major performance bottleneck that arises is that some of the worker nodes may run slow. These nodes a.k.a. stragglers can significantly slow down computation as the slowest node may dictate the overall computational time. We propose a distributed computing scheme, called Batched Coupon's Collector (BCC) to alleviate the effect of stragglers in gradient methods. We prove that our BCC scheme is robust to a near optimal number of random stragglers. We also empirically demonstrate that our proposed BCC scheme reduces the run-time by up to 85.4% over Amazon EC2 clusters when compared with other straggler mitigation strategies. We also generalize the proposed BCC scheme to minimize the completion time when implementing gradient descent-based algorithms over heterogeneous worker nodes."}}

The computation is carried out on a distributed system consisting of a master node and multiple worker nodes. Such distributed systems are significantly slowed down due to the presence of slow-running machines (stragglers) as well as various communication bottlenecks. We propose \"polynomially coded regression\" (PCR) that substantially reduces the effect of stragglers and lessens the communication burden in such systems. The key idea of PCR is to encode the partial data stored at each worker, such that the computations at the workers can be viewed as evaluating a polynomial at distinct points. This allows the master to compute the final gradient by interpolating this polynomial. PCR significantly reduces the recovery threshold, defined as the number of workers the master has to wait for prior to computing the gradient. In particular, PCR requires a recovery threshold that scales inversely proportionally with the amount of computation/storage available at each worker. In comparison, state-of-the-art straggler-mitigation schemes require a much higher recovery threshold that only decreases linearly in the per worker computation/storage load. We prove that PCR's recovery threshold is near minimal and within a factor two of the best possible scheme. Our experiments over Amazon EC2 demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art schemes, PCR improves the run-time by 1.50x ~ 2.36x with naturally occurring stragglers, and by as much as 2.58x ~ 4.29x with artificial stragglers."}}
