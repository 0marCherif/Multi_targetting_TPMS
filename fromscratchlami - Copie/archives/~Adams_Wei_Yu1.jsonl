Recently, the graph research community has been trying to replicate the success of self-supervised pretraining in natural language processing, with several successes claimed. However, we find the benefit brought by self-supervised pretraining on small molecular data can be negligible in many cases. We conduct thorough ablation studies on the key components of GNN pretraining, including pretraining objectives, data splitting methods, input features, pretraining dataset scales, and GNN architectures, to see how they affect the accuracy of the downstream tasks. Our first important finding is, self-supervised graph pretraining do not always have statistically significant advantages over non-pretraining methods in many settings. Secondly, although noticeable improvement can be observed with additional supervised pretraining, the improvement may diminish with richer features or more balanced data splits. Thirdly, hyper-parameters could have larger impacts on accuracy of downstream tasks than the choice of pretraining tasks, especially when the scales of downstream tasks are small. Finally, we provide our conjectures where the complexity of some pretraining methods on small molecules might be insufficient, followed by empirical evidences on different pretraining datasets."}}

However, the requirement for expensive annotations including clean image captions and regional labels limits the scalability of existing approaches, and complicates the pretraining procedure with the introduction of multiple dataset-specific objectives. In this work, we relax these constraints and present a minimalist pretraining framework, named Simple Visual Language Model (SimVLM). Unlike prior work, SimVLM reduces the training complexity by exploiting large-scale weak supervision, and is trained end-to-end with a single prefix language modeling objective. Without utilizing extra data or task-specific customization, the resulting model significantly outperforms previous pretraining methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of discriminative and generative vision-language benchmarks, including VQA (+3.74% vqa-score), NLVR2 (+1.17% accuracy), SNLI-VE (+1.37% accuracy) and image captioning tasks (+10.1% average CIDEr score). Furthermore, we demonstrate that SimVLM acquires strong generalization and transfer ability, enabling zero-shot behavior including open-ended visual question answering and cross-modality transfer."}}

We evaluate this instruction-tuned model, which we call FLAN, on unseen task types. FLAN substantially improves the performance of its unmodified counterpart and surpasses zero-shot 175B GPT-3 on 20 of 25 datasets that we evaluate. FLAN even outperforms few-shot GPT-3 by a large margin on ANLI, RTE, BoolQ, AI2-ARC, OpenbookQA, and StoryCloze.

Standard hyperparameter optimization methods are expensive because of their multi-trial nature: different configurations are tried separately to find the best. In this paper, we propose AutoHAS, an efficient framework for both hyperparameter and architecture search. AutoHAS generalizes the concept of efficient architecture search, ENAS and DARTS, to hyperparameter search and hence can jointly optimize both in a single training. A key challenge in such generalization is that ENAS and DARTS are designed to optimize discrete architecture choices, whereas hyperparameter choices are often continuous. To tackle this challenge, we discretize the continuous space into a linear combination of multiple categorical basis. Furthermore, we extend the idea of weight sharing and augment it with REINFORCE to reduce its memory cost. In order to decouple the shared network weights and controller optimization, we also propose to create temporary weights for evaluating the sampled hyperparameters and updating the controller. Experimental results show AutoHAS can improve the ImageNet accuracy by up to 0.8% for highly-optimized state-of-the-art ResNet/EfficientNet models, and up to 11% for less-optimized models. Compared to random search and Bayesian search, AutoHAS consistently achieves better accuracy with 10x less computation cost."}}

To tackle this issue, we propose the Neural-Symbolic Stack Machine (NeSS). It contains a neural network to generate traces, which are then executed by a symbolic stack machine enhanced with sequence manipulation operations. NeSS combines the expressive power of neural sequence models with the recursion supported by the symbolic stack machine. Without training supervision on execution traces, NeSS achieves 100% generalization performance in four domains: the SCAN benchmark of language-driven navigation tasks, the task of few-shot learning of compositional instructions, the compositional machine translation benchmark, and context-free grammar parsing tasks."}}

AutoHAS learns to alternately update the shared network weights and a reinforcement learning (RL) controller, which learns the probability distribution for the architecture candidates and HP candidates. A temporary weight is introduced to store the updated weight from the selected HPs (by the controller), and a validation accuracy based on this temporary weight serves as a reward to update the controller. In experiments, we show AutoHAS is efficient and generalizable to different search spaces, baselines and datasets. In particular, AutoHAS can improve the accuracy over popular network architectures, such as ResNet and EfficientNet, on CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and four more other datasets."}}

For distributed optimization over a cluster of machines, frequent communication and synchronization of all model parameters (optimization variables) can be very costly. A promising solution is to use parameter servers to store different subsets of the model parameters, and update them asynchronously at different machines using local datasets. In this paper, we focus on distributed optimization of large linear models with convex loss functions, and propose a family of randomized primal-dual block coordinate algorithms that are especially suitable for asynchronous distributed implementation with parameter servers. In particular, we work with the saddle-point formulation of such problems which allows simultaneous data and model partitioning, and exploit its structure by doubly stochastic coordinate optimization with variance reduction (DSCOVR). Compared with other first-order distributed algorithms, we show that DSCOVR may require less amount of overall computation and communication, and less or no synchronization. We discuss the implementation details of the DSCOVR algorithms, and present numerical experiments on an industrial distributed computing system."}}

On the SQuAD dataset, our model is 3x to 13x faster in training and 4x to 9x faster in inference, while achieving equivalent accuracy to recurrent models. The speed-up gain allows us to train the model with much more data. We hence combine our model with data generated by backtranslation from a neural machine translation model. \nOn the SQuAD dataset, our single model, trained with augmented data, achieves 84.6 F1 score on the test set, which is significantly better than the best published F1 score of 81.8."}}
