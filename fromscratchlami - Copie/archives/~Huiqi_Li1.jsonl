However, calcaneus fracture subtype classification is a challenging task due to the nature of multi-label as well as limited annotated data. In this paper, an augmentation strategy called GridDropIn&Out (GDIO) is proposed to increase the uncertainty of the rough input mask and enlarge the dataset. A spatial regularization transformer (SRT) is designed to capture labels' spatial information, while a multi-scale attention SRT (MSRT) is built to synthesize spatial features from different levels. Our final proposal achieves an mAP of 87.54% in classifying six calcaneus fracture types."}}

However, PEs usually appear as dark spots among the bright regions of blood arteries in CTPA images, which can be very similar with veins that are less bright and soft tissues. Even for experienced radiologists, the evaluation of PEs in CTPA is a time-consuming and nontrivial task. In this paper, we propose an artery-aware 3D fully convolutional network (AANet) that encodes artery information as the prior knowledge to detect arteries and PEs at the same time. In our approach, the artery context fusion block (ACF) is proposed to combine the multi-scale feature maps and generate both local and global contexts of vessels as soft attentions to precisely recognize PEs from soft tissues or veins. We evaluate our methods on the CAD-PE dataset with the artery and vein vessel labels. The experimental results with the sensitivity of 78.1%, 84.2%, and 85.1% at one, two, and four false positives per scan have been achieved, which shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrate promising assistance for diagnosis in clinical practice."}}

Both two modalities of images have prominent biomarkers to indicate glaucoma suspected. Clinically, it is often recommended to take both of the screenings for a more accurate and reliable diagnosis. However, although numerous algorithms are proposed based on fundus images or OCT volumes in computer-aided diagnosis, there are still few methods leveraging both of the modalities for the glaucoma assessment. Inspired by the success of Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge (REFUGE) we held previously, we set up the Glaucoma grAding from Multi-Modality imAges (GAMMA) Challenge to encourage the development of fundus \\& OCT-based glaucoma grading. The primary task of the challenge is to grade glaucoma from both the 2D fundus images and 3D OCT scanning volumes. As part of GAMMA, we have publicly released a glaucoma annotated dataset with both 2D fundus color photography and 3D OCT volumes, which is the first multi-modality dataset for glaucoma grading. In addition, an evaluation framework is also established to evaluate the performance of the submitted methods. During the challenge, 1272 results were submitted, and finally, top-10 teams were selected to the final stage. We analysis their results and summarize their methods in the paper. Since all these teams submitted their source code in the challenge, a detailed ablation study is also conducted to verify the effectiveness of the particular modules proposed. We find many of the proposed techniques are practical for the clinical diagnosis of glaucoma. As the first in-depth study of fundus \\& OCT multi-modality glaucoma grading, we believe the GAMMA Challenge will be an essential starting point for future research."}}

Moreover, we introduce center loss to increase the intra-class compactness of the extracted features to further improve the classification performance. Experiments are conducted on three public fundus image datasets: STARE, ODIR and iCHALLENGE-AMD (hereinafter referred to as iAMD).

The shape and region area indicate the pathologic severity of myopia and glaucoma. So it is important to segment PPA area to analyze the progression of these diseases. The shape of PPA area is mostly crescent. In order to combine the prior knowledge, a PPA segmentation method is proposed with a novel active shape model (ASM) loss. The shape constraint is introduced to improve the segmentation accuracy. It is realized by the proposed ASM loss module, which contains three parts, \u03b8 predictor, b predictor and an affine transformation module. Our approach is evaluated on a clinical dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method provides good performance both qualitatively and quantitatively."}}

The proposed SALAD is a reconstruction-based method, which learns the manifold of normal data through an encode-and-reconstruct translation between image and latent spaces. In particular, two constraints ( <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i> , structure similarity loss and center constraint loss) are proposed to regulate the cross-space ( <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i> , image and feature) translation, which enforce the model to learn translation-consistent and representative features from the normal data. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning module is engaged into our framework to further boost the anomaly detection accuracy by deeply exploiting useful information from the raw normal data. An anomaly score, as a measure to separate the anomalous data from the healthy ones, is constructed based on the learned self-supervised-and-translation-consistent features. Extensive experiments are conducted on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and chest X-ray datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}}

While collecting enough samples from each subject would address this issue, it is often too time-consuming and impractical. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end deep domain adaptation method to improve the classification performance on a single subject (target domain) by taking the useful information from multiple subjects (source domain) into consideration. Especially, the proposed method jointly optimizes three modules, including a feature extractor, a classifier, and a domain discriminator. The feature extractor learns the discriminative latent features by mapping the raw EEG signals into a deep representation space. A center loss is further employed to constrain an invariant feature space and reduce the intrasubject nonstationarity. Furthermore, the domain discriminator matches the feature distribution shift between source and target domains by an adversarial learning strategy. Finally, based on the consistent deep features from both domains, the classifier is able to leverage the information from the source domain and accurately predict the label in the target domain at the test time. To evaluate our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on two real public EEG data sets, data set IIa, and data set IIb of brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) Competition IV. The experimental results validate the efficacy of our method. Therefore, our method is promising to reduce the calibration time for the use of BCI and promote the development of BCI."}}

Hyperparameter optimization in DNNs is a computationally expensive problem, and a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm has been recently introduced to automatically search for optimal hyperparameter configurations of DNNs, by applying computationally efficient surrogate models to approximate the validation error function of hyperparameter configurations. Different from existing surrogate models adopting stationary covariance functions (kernels) to measure the difference between hyperparameter points, this article proposes a nonstationary kernel that allows the surrogate model to adapt to functions whose smoothness varies with the spatial location of inputs. A multilevel convolutional neural network (ML-CNN) is built for lung nodule classification, and the hyperparameter configuration is optimized by the proposed nonstationary kernel-based Gaussian surrogate model. Our algorithm searches with a surrogate for optimal setting via a hyperparameter importance-based evolutionary strategy, and the experiments demonstrate our algorithm outperforms manual tuning and several well-established hyperparameter optimization methods, including random search, grid search, the tree-structured parzen estimator (TPE) approach, Gaussian processes (GP) with stationary kernels, and the recently proposed hyperparameter optimization via RBF and dynamic (HORD) coordinate search."}}
