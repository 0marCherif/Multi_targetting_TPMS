In this paper, we attempt to identify such effects by a few active interventions where only the response variable is observable. This task is challenging because the causal graph is unknown and even there may exist latent confounders. To learn the necessary structure for identifying the effects, we provide the graphical characterization that allows us to efficiently estimate all possible causal effects in a partially mixed ancestral graph (PMAG) by generalized back-door criterion. The characterization guides learning a local structure with the interventional data. Theoretical analysis and empirical studies validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach."}}

While MIML learning has achieved success in many applications, it is less clear how the labels are related to the instances. In this paper, we propose to study the causal relation between instances and labels, which on one hand can improve the interpretability of complicated MIML models, and on the other hand may further improve the prediction performance at both instance and bag levels. We exploit prototypes in the instance space as a bridge to represent the examples, and then propose an efficient algorithm to identify the causal relations from prototypes to class labels, which are further utilized for model training and key instance detection. Experiments on various datasets show that in addition to superior classification performance, our approach can identify reasonable causal relations between instances and labels."}}
