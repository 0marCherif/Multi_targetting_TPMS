In this study, we designed a spatiotemporal compliance control strategy for a new self-designed wearable lower limb rehabilitation robot (WLLRR), allowing the users to regulate the spatiotemporal characteristics of their motion. The high-level trajectory planner consists of a trajectory generator, an interaction torque estimator, and a gait speed adaptive regulator, which can provide spatial and temporal compliance for the WLLRR. A radial basis function neural network adaptive controller is adopted as the low-level position controller. Over-ground walking experiments with passive control, spatial compliance control, and spatiotemporal compliance control strategies were conducted on five healthy participants, respectively. The results demonstrated that the spatiotemporal compliance control strategy allows participants to adjust reference trajectory through physical human-robot interaction, and can adaptively modify gait speed according to participants\u2019 motor performance. It was found that the spatiotemporal compliance control strategy could provide greater enhancement of motor variability and reduction of interaction torque than other tested control strategies. Therefore, the spatiotemporal compliance control strategy has great potential in robot-assisted rehabilitation training and other fields involving physical human-robot interaction."}}

Previous studies focus more on robot assistance, i.e., to improve the control strategy so as to fulfill the objective of Assist-As-Needed. In this study, we treat the full process of robot-assisted rehabilitation as a co-adaptive or mutual learning process and emphasize the adaptation of the user to the machine. To this end, we proposed a Co-adaptive MDPs (CaMDPs) model to quantify the learning rates based on cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in the high abstraction layer of the systems. We proposed several approaches to cooperatively adjust the Policy Improvement among the two agents in the framework of Policy Iteration. Based on the proposed co-adaptive MDPs, the simulation study indicates the non-stationary problem can be mitigated using various proposed Policy Improvement approaches."}}

Traditional visual odometry algorithms require the careful fabrication of state-of-the-art building blocks based on geometry. These algorithms are highly sensitive to noise, and performance degradation of a single subprocess compromises the performance of the entire system. On the other hand, learning-based methods automatically learn the features required through motion mapping. However, current learning-based methods are computationally expensive and require a significant amount of time to estimate the pose from a video sequence. This method proposes a lightweight deep neural networks architecture to estimate the odometry by exploiting the refined features through spatial attention. Three different training and test splits of the KITTI benchmark are used to effectively evaluate the proposed approach. The execution time of the proposed approach is $$\\sim$$ \u223c 1 ms, speeded up by 47 times over [1]. Performed experiments demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method to the methods used in the comparison."}}

Several issues should be addressed to avoid the damaging of samples during the quality grading process of apples (e.g., the long detection period and the inability to detect the internal quality of apples). In this study, an electronic nose (e-nose) detection system for apple quality grading based on the K-nearest neighbor support vector machine (KNN-SVM) was designed, and the nasal cavity structure of the e-nose was optimized by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. A KNN-SVM classifier was also proposed to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional SVMs. The performance of the developed device was experimentally verified in the following steps. The apples were divided into three groups according to their external and internal quality. The e-nose data were pre-processed before features extraction, and then Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were used to reduce the dimension of the datasets. The recognition accuracy of the PCA\u2013KNN-SVM classifier was 96.45%, and the LDA\u2013KNN-SVM classifier achieved 97.78%. Compared with other commonly used classifiers, (traditional KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest), KNN-SVM is more efficient in terms of training time and accuracy of classification. Generally, the apple grading system can be used to evaluate the quality of apples during storage."}}

The manual detection of apnea is a time-consuming task, and automatic diagnosis is much more desirable. The contribution of this work is to detect OSA using a multi-error-reduction (MER) classification system with multi-domain features from bio-signals. Methods: Time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear analysis features are extracted from oxygen saturation (SaO2), ECG, airflow, thoracic, and abdominal signals. To analyse the significance of each feature, we design a two-stage feature selection. Stage 1 is the statistical analysis stage, and Stage 2 is the final feature subset selection stage using machine learning methods. In Stage 1, two statistical analyses (the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the rank-sum test) provide a list of the significance level of each kind of feature. Then, in Stage 2, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is used to select a final feature subset based on the significance list. Next, an MER classification system is constructed, which applies a stacking with a structure that consists of base learners and an artificial neural network (ANN) meta-learner. Results: The Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) database is used to provide bio-signals. A total of 66 features are extracted. In the experiment that involves a duration parameter, 19 features are selected as the final feature subset because they provide a better and more stable performance. The SVM model shows good performance (accuracy = 81.68%, sensitivity = 97.05%, and specificity = 66.54%). It is also found that classifiers have poor performance when they predict normal events in less than 60 s. In the next experiment stage, the time-window segmentation method with a length of 60 s is used. After the above two-stage feature selection procedure, 48 features are selected as the final feature subset that give good performance (accuracy = 90.80%, sensitivity = 93.95%, and specificity = 83.82%). To conduct the classification, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, Light GBM, and XGBoost are used as base learners, and the ANN is used as the meta-learner. The performance of this MER classification system has the accuracy of 94.66%, the sensitivity of 96.37%, and the specificity of 90.83%."}}

Hyperparameter optimization in DNNs is a computationally expensive problem, and a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm has been recently introduced to automatically search for optimal hyperparameter configurations of DNNs, by applying computationally efficient surrogate models to approximate the validation error function of hyperparameter configurations. Different from existing surrogate models adopting stationary covariance functions (kernels) to measure the difference between hyperparameter points, this article proposes a nonstationary kernel that allows the surrogate model to adapt to functions whose smoothness varies with the spatial location of inputs. A multilevel convolutional neural network (ML-CNN) is built for lung nodule classification, and the hyperparameter configuration is optimized by the proposed nonstationary kernel-based Gaussian surrogate model. Our algorithm searches with a surrogate for optimal setting via a hyperparameter importance-based evolutionary strategy, and the experiments demonstrate our algorithm outperforms manual tuning and several well-established hyperparameter optimization methods, including random search, grid search, the tree-structured parzen estimator (TPE) approach, Gaussian processes (GP) with stationary kernels, and the recently proposed hyperparameter optimization via RBF and dynamic (HORD) coordinate search."}}

With a gradient-based bi-level optimization, DARTS alternately optimizes the inner model weights and the outer architecture parameter in a weight-sharing supernet. A key challenge to the scalability and quality of the learned architectures is the need for differentiating through the inner-loop optimisation. While much has been discussed about several potentially fatal factors in DARTS, the architecture gradient, a.k.a. hypergradient, has received less attention. In this paper, we tackle the hypergradient computation in DARTS based on the implicit function theorem, making it only depends on the obtained solution to the inner-loop optimization and agnostic to the optimization path. To further reduce the computational requirements, we formulate a stochastic hypergradient approximation for differentiable NAS, and theoretically show that the architecture optimization with the proposed method, named iDARTS, is expected to converge to a stationary point. Comprehensive experiments on two NAS benchmark search spaces and the common NAS search space verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. It leads to architectures outperforming, with large margins, those learned by the baseline methods."}}
