One way to study the tumor microenvironment is to characterize the spatial interactions between various types of nuclei in cancer tissue from H&E whole slide images, which require nucleus segmentation and classification. Current methods of nucleus classification rely on extensive labeling from pathologists and are limited by the number of categories a nucleus can be classified into. In this work, leveraging existing nucleus segmentation and contrastive representation learning methods, we developed a method that learns vector embeddings of nuclei based on their morphology in histopathology images. We show that the embeddings learned by this model capture distinctive morphological features of nuclei and can be used to group them into meaningful subtypes. These embeddings can provide a much richer characterization of the statistics of the spatial distribution of nuclei in cancer and open new possibilities in the quantitative study of the tumor microenvironment."}}

Leveraging computation methods to aid in WSI assessment poses unique challenges. WSIs, being extremely high resolution giga-pixel images, cannot be directly processed by convolutional neural networks (CNN) due to huge computational cost. For this reason, state-of-the-art methods for WSI analysis adopt a two-stage approach where the training of a tile encoder is decoupled from the tile aggregation. This results in a trade-off between learning diverse and discriminative features. In contrast, we propose end-to-end part learning (EPL) which is able to learn diverse features while ensuring that learned features are discriminative. Each WSI is modeled as consisting of $k$ groups of tiles with similar features, defined as parts. A loss with respect to the slide label is backpropagated through an integrated CNN model to $k$ input tiles that are used to represent each part. Our experiments show that EPL is capable of clinical grade prediction of prostate and basal cell carcinoma. Further, we show that diverse discriminative features produced by EPL succeeds in multi-label classification of lung cancer architectural subtypes. Beyond classification, our method provides rich information of slides for high quality clinical decision support."}}

It is a challenging task due to the significant inter/intra-class variation of cellular morphology. The problem is aggravated by the need for additional accurate localization of the nuclei for downstream applications. Most of the existing methods regress the probability of each pixel being a nuclei centroid, while relying on post-processing to implicitly infer the rough location of nuclei centers. To solve this problem we propose a novel multi-task learning framework called vector oriented confidence accumulation (VOCA) based on deep convolutional encoder-decoder. The model learns a confidence score, localization vector and weight of contribution for each pixel. The three tasks are trained concurrently and the confidence of pixels are accumulated according to the localization vectors in detection stage to generate a sparse map that describes accurate and precise cell locations. A detailed comparison to the state-of-the-art based on a publicly available colorectal cancer dataset showed superior detection performance and significantly higher localization accuracy."}}
