Budget pacing systems seek to optimize advertiser returns subject to budget constraints through smooth spending of advertiser budgets. In the past few years, autobidding products that provide real-time bidding as a service to advertisers have seen a prominent rise in adoption. A popular autobidding stategy is value maximization subject to return-on-spend (ROS) constraints. For historical or business reasons, the algorithms that govern these two services, namely budget pacing and RoS pacing, are not necessarily always a single unified and coordinated entity that optimizes a global objective subject to both constraints. The purpose of this work is to study the benefits of coordinating budget and RoS pacing services from an empirical and theoretical perspective. We compare (a) a sequential algorithm that first constructs the advertiser's ROS-pacing bid and then lowers that bid for budget pacing, with (b) the optimal joint algorithm that optimizes advertiser returns subject to both budget and ROS constraints. We establish the superiority of joint optimization both theoretically as well as empirically based on data from a large advertising platform. In the process, we identify a third algorithm with minimal interaction between services that retains the theoretical properties of the joint optimization algorithm and performs almost as well empirically as the joint optimization algorithm. This algorithm eases the transition from a sequential to a fully joint implementation by minimizing the amount of interaction between the two services."}}

Our mechanism is a simple posted-price mechanism that sets a take-it-or-leave-it per-item price that depends on k and the total number of buyers, but does not depend on the demand structure or the downstream contracts. Next we generalize our result to the case when the items are not identical. We assume that the item valuations are separable, i.e. v_{i j} = \u03b7_j v_i for buyer i and item j, with each private v_i drawn i.i.d. from a known \u03bb-regular distribution. For this case, we design a mechanism that obtains at least a constant fraction of the optimal welfare, by using a menu of posted prices. This mechanism is also independent of the demand structure, but makes a relatively stronger assumption on the contracts between intermediaries and buyers, namely that each intermediary prefers outcomes with a higher sum of utilities of the subset of buyers represented by it."}}

Our framework encompasses applications that include traditional transportation networks (e.g., airplanes, buses) and their more modern counterparts (e.g., ride-sharing systems). We describe a simple combinatorial model, in which each edge in the network is endowed with a curve that gives the demand for traveling between its endpoints at any given price. We are supplied with a number of vehicles and a time budget to serve the demands induced by the prices that we set, seeking to maximize revenue. We first focus on a (preliminary) special case of our model with unit distances and unit time horizon. We show that this version of the problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time. Switching to the general case of our model, we first present a two-stage approach that separately optimizes for prices and routes, achieving a logarithmic approximation to revenue in the process. Next, using the insights gathered in the first two results, we present a constant factor approximation algorithm that jointly optimizes for prices and routes for the supply vehicles. Finally, we discuss how our algorithms can handle capacitated vehicles, impatient demands, and selfish (wage-maximizing) drivers."}}
