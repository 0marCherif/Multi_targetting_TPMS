On the other hand, human learn to perform tasks not only from interaction or demonstrations, but also by reading unstructured text documents, e.g., instruction manuals. Instruction manuals and wiki pages are among the most abundant data that could inform agents of valuable features and policies or task-specific environmental dynamics and reward structures. Therefore, we hypothesize that the ability to utilize human-written instruction manuals to assist learning policies for specific tasks should lead to a more efficient and better-performing agent.\n\nWe propose the Read and Reward framework. Read and Reward speeds up RL algorithms on Atari games by reading manuals released by the Atari game developers. Our framework consists of a QA Extraction module that extracts and summarizes relevant information from the manual and a Reasoning module that evaluates object-agent interactions based on information from the manual. Auxiliary reward is then provided to a standard A2C RL agent, when interaction is detected. When assisted by our design, A2C improves on 4 games in the Atari environment with sparse rewards, and requires 1000x less training frames compared to the previous SOTA Agent 57 on Skiing, the hardest game in Atari."}}

The optimization of calibration is essential to many online advertising recommendation systems because it directly affects the downstream bids in ads auctions and the amount of money charged to advertisers. Despite its importance, calibration often suffers from a problem called \u201cmaximization bias\u201d. Maximization bias refers to the phenomenon that the maximum of predicted values overestimates the true maximum. The problem is introduced because the calibration is computed on the set selected by the prediction model itself. It persists even if unbiased predictions are achieved on every datapoint and worsens when covariate shifts exist between the training and test sets. To mitigate this problem, we quantify maximization bias and propose a variance-adjusting debiasing (VAD) meta-algorithm in this paper. The algorithm is efficient, robust, and practical as it is able to mitigate maximization bias problem under covariate shifts, without incurring additional online serving costs or compromising the ranking performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm  using a state-of-the-art recommendation neural network model on a large-scale real-world dataset."}}

Existing work focuses on specific families of distributions (e.g., exponential families) and/or certain structures of graphs, and most of them can only handle variables of a single data type (continuous or discrete). In this work, we characterize the conditional independence structure in general distributions for all data types (i.e., continuous, discrete, and mixed-type) with a Generalized Precision Matrix (GPM). Besides, we also allow general functional relations among variables, thus giving rise to a Markov network structure learning algorithm in one of the most general settings. To deal with the computational challenge of the problem, especially for large graphs, we unify all cases under the same umbrella of a regularized score matching framework. We validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the scalability empirically in various settings."}}
