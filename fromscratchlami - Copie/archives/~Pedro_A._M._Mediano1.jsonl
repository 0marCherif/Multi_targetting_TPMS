Specifically, neural information can be decomposed into synergistic, redundant, and unique features, with synergistic components being particularly aligned with complex cognition. However, two fundamental questions remain unanswered: (a) precisely how and why a cognitive system can become highly synergistic; and (b) how these informational states map onto artificial neural networks in various learning modes. To address these questions, here we employ an information-decomposition framework to investigate the information processing strategies adopted by simple artificial neural networks performing a variety of cognitive tasks in both supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Our results show that synergy increases as neural networks learn multiple diverse tasks. Furthermore, performance in tasks requiring integration of multiple information sources critically relies on synergistic neurons. Finally, randomly turning off neurons during training through dropout increases network redundancy, corresponding to an increase in robustness. Overall, our results suggest that while redundant information is required for robustness to perturbations in the learning process, synergistic information is used to combine information from multiple modalities -- and more generally for flexible and efficient learning. These findings open the door to new ways of investigating how and why learning systems employ specific information-processing strategies, and support the principle that the capacity for general-purpose learning critically relies in the system's information dynamics."}}

(arXiv:2110.06023) provide a comprehensive overview of how investigations of complex systems should take into account interactions between more than two elements, which can be modelled by hypergraphs and studied via topological data analysis. Following a separate line of enquiry, a broad literature has developed information-theoretic tools to characterize high-order interdependencies from observed data. While these could seem to be competing approaches aiming to address the same question, in this correspondence we clarify that this is not the case, and that a complete account of higher-order phenomena needs to embrace both."}}

Interestingly, while structural connectivity is by definition pairwise (white-matter fibers project from one region to another), FC is not. However, most FC analyses only focus on pairwise statistics and they neglect higher order interactions. A promising tool to study high-order interdependencies is the recently proposed O-Information, which can quantify the intrinsic statistical synergy and the redundancy in groups of three or more interacting variables. Methods: We analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained at rest from 164 healthy subjects with ages ranging in 10 to 80 years and used O-Information to investigate how high-order statistical interdependencies are affected by age. Results: Older participants (from 60 to 80 years old) exhibited a higher predominance of redundant dependencies compared with younger participants, an effect that seems to be pervasive as it is evident for all orders of interaction. In addition, while there is strong heterogeneity across brain regions, we found a \u201credundancy core\u201d constituted by the prefrontal and motor cortices in which redundancy was evident at all the interaction orders studied. Discussion: High-order interdependencies in fMRI data reveal a dominant redundancy in functions such as working memory, executive, and motor functions. Our methodology can be used for a broad range of applications, and the corresponding code is freely available. Impact statement Past research has showcased multiple changes to the brain's structural and functional properties caused by aging. Here we expand prior work through recent advancements in multivariate information theory, which provide richer and more theoretically principled analyses than existing alternatives. We show that the brains of older participants contain more redundant information at multiple spatial scales\u2014that is, activation in different brain regions is less diverse, compared with younger participants\u2014and identify a \u201credundancy core\u201d constituted by prefrontal and motor cortices, which might explained impaired performance in the old population in functions such as working memory and executive control."}}

But what does it mean for a physical system to exhibit emergence? The literature on this topic contains various conflicting approaches, many of which are unable to provide quantitative, falsifiable statements. Having a rigorous, quantitative theory of emergence could allow us to discover the exact conditions that allow a flock to be more than individual birds, and to better understand how the mind emerges from the brain. Here we provide exactly that: a formal theory of what constitutes causal emergence, how to measure it, and what different \u201ctypes\u201d of emergence exist. To do this, we leverage recent developments in information dynamics\u2014the study of how information flows through and is modified by dynamical systems. As part of this framework, we provide a mathematical definition of causal emergence, and also practical formulae for analysing empirical data. Using these, we are able to confirm emergence in the iconic Conway\u2019s Game of Life, in certain flocking patterns, and in representations of motor movements in the monkey\u2019s brain."}}

Here we consider a NMLbased decision strategy for supervised classification problems, and show that it attains heuristic PAC learning when applied to a wide variety of models.
