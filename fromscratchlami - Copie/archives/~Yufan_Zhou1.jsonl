However, generating images of novel concept provided by the user input image is still a challenging task. To address this problem, researchers have been exploring various methods for customizing pre-trained text-to-image generation models. Currently, most existing methods for customizing pre-trained text-to-image generation models involve the use of regularization techniques to prevent over-fitting. While regularization will ease the challenge of customization and leads to successful content creation with respect to text guidance, it may restrict the model capability, resulting in the loss of detailed information and inferior performance. In this work, we propose a novel framework for customized text-to-image generation without the use of regularization. Specifically, our proposed framework consists of an encoder network and a novel sampling method which can tackle the over-fitting problem without the use of regularization. With the proposed framework, we are able to customize a large-scale text-to-image generation model within half a minute on single GPU, with only one image provided by the user. We demonstrate in experiments that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods, and preserves more fine-grained details."}}

Most of such models are trained on web-scale image-text paired datasets, which may not be affordable for many researchers. In this paper, we propose a novel method for pre-training text-to-image generation model on image-only datasets. It considers a retrieval-then-optimization procedure to synthesize pseudo text features: for a given image, relevant pseudo text features are first retrieved, then optimized for better alignment. The low requirement of the proposed method yields high flexibility and usability: it can be beneficial to a wide range of settings, including the few-shot, semi-supervised and fully-supervised learning; it can be applied on different models including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models. Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. On MS-COCO dataset, our GAN model obtains Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 6.78 which is the new state-of-the-art (SoTA) of GANs under fully-supervised setting. Our diffusion model obtains FID of 8.42 and 4.28 on zero-shot and supervised setting respectively, which are competitive to SoTA diffusion models with a much smaller model size."}}

Corgi is based on our proposed shifted diffusion model, which achieves better image embedding generation from input text. Unlike the baseline diffusion model used in DALL-E 2, our method seamlessly encodes prior knowledge of the pre-trained CLIP model in its diffusion process by designing a new initialization distribution and a new transition step of the diffusion. Compared to the strong DALL-E 2 baseline, our method performs better in generating image embedding from the text in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness, resulting in better text-to-image generation. Extensive large-scale experiments are conducted and evaluated in terms of both quantitative measures and human evaluation, indicating a stronger generation ability of our method compared to existing ones. Furthermore, our model enables semi-supervised and language-free training for text-to-image generation, where only part or none of the images in the training dataset have an associated caption. Trained with only 1.7% of the images being captioned, our semi-supervised model obtains FID results comparable to DALL-E 2 on zero-shot text-to-image generation evaluated on MS-COCO. Corgi also achieves new state-of-the-art results across different datasets on downstream language-free text-to-image generation tasks, outperforming the previous method, Lafite, by a large margin."}}

This topic has received increased attention in recent years through refinement of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs); however, most existing works are limited to single-round interaction, which is not reflective of real world interactive image editing workflows. Furthermore, previous works dealing with multi-round scenarios are limited to predefined feedback sequences, which is also impractical. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Text-based Interactive image generation and manipulation (TiGAN) that responds to users' natural-language feedback. TiGAN utilizes the powerful pre-trained CLIP model to understand users' natural-language feedback and exploits contrastive learning for a better text-to-image mapping. To maintain the image consistency during interactions, TiGAN generates intermediate feature vectors aligned with the feedback and selectively feeds these vectors to our proposed generative model. Empirical results on several datasets show that TiGAN improves both interaction efficiency and image quality while better avoids undesirable image manipulation during interactions."}}

However, as a double-looped optimization problem, MAML needs to differentiate through the whole inner-loop optimization path for every outer-loop training step, which may lead to both computational inefficiency and sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we generalize MAML to allow meta-learning to be defined in function spaces, and propose the first meta-learning paradigm in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) induced by the meta-model's Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). Within this paradigm, we introduce two meta-learning algorithms in the RKHS, which no longer need a sub-optimal iterative inner-loop adaptation as in the MAML framework. We achieve this goal by 1) replacing the adaptation with a fast-adaptive regularizer in the RKHS; and 2) solving the adaptation analytically based on the NTK theory. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate advantages of our paradigm in both efficiency and quality of solutions compared to related meta-learning algorithms. Another interesting feature of our proposed methods is that they are demonstrated to be more robust to adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution adaptation than popular baselines, as demonstrated in our experiments."}}

In this paper, we introduce new techniques to formulate the problem as solving Fokker-Planck equation in a lower-dimensional latent space, aiming to mitigate challenges in high-dimensional data space. Our proposed model consists of latent-distribution morphing, a generator and a parameterized Fokker-Planck kernel function. One fascinating property of our model is that it can be trained with arbitrary steps of latent distribution morphing or even without morphing, which makes it flexible and as efficient as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Furthermore, this property also makes our latent-distribution morphing an efficient plug-and-play scheme, thus can be used to improve arbitrary GANs, and more interestingly, can effectively correct failure cases of the GAN models. Extensive experiments illustrate the advantages of our proposed method over existing models."}}

Nevertheless, the improved results are attained at the price of bigger models, more power consumption, and slower inference, which hinder their applicability to low-resource (both memory and computation) platforms. Knowledge distillation (KD) has been demonstrated as an effective framework for compressing such big models. However, large-scale neural network systems are prone to memorize training instances, and thus tend to make inconsistent predictions when the data distribution is altered slightly. Moreover, the student model has few opportunities to request useful information from the teacher model when there is limited task-specific data available. To address these issues, we propose MixKD, a data-agnostic distillation framework that leverages mixup, a simple yet efficient data augmentation approach, to endow the resulting model with stronger generalization ability. Concretely, in addition to the original training examples, the student model is encouraged to mimic the teacher's behavior on the linear interpolation of example pairs as well. We prove from a theoretical perspective that under reasonable conditions MixKD gives rise to a smaller gap between the generalization error and the empirical error. To verify its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on the GLUE benchmark, where MixKD consistently leads to significant gains over the standard KD training, and outperforms several competitive baselines. Experiments under a limited-data setting and ablation studies further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach."}}
