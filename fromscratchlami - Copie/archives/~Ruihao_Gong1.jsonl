Existing benchmarks mainly focus on evaluating the defenses, but there are no comprehensive studies of how architecture design and general training techniques affect robustness. Comprehensively benchmarking their relationships will be highly beneficial for better understanding and developing robust DNNs. Thus, we propose RobustART, the first comprehensive Robustness investigation benchmark on ImageNet (including open-source toolkit, pre-trained model zoo, datasets, and analyses) regarding ARchitecture design (44 human-designed off-the-shelf architectures and 1200+ networks from neural architecture search) and Training techniques (10+ general techniques, e.g., data augmentation) towards diverse noises (adversarial, natural, and system noises). Extensive experiments revealed and substantiated several insights for the first time, for example: (1) adversarial training largely improves the clean accuracy and all types of robustness for Transformers and MLP-Mixers; (2) with comparable sizes, CNNs > Transformers > MLP-Mixers on robustness against natural and system noises; Transformers > MLP-Mixers > CNNs on adversarial robustness; (3) for some light-weight architectures (e.g., EfficientNet, MobileNetV2, and MobileNetV3), increasing model sizes or using extra training data cannot improve robustness."}}

Without access to data, conventional data-driven model compression faces a higher risk of performance degradation. Recently, some works propose to generate images from a specific pretrained model to serve as training data. However, the inversion process only utilizes biased feature statistics stored in one model and is from low-dimension to high-dimension. As a consequence, it inevitably encounters the difficulties of generalizability and inexact inversion, which leads to unsatisfactory performance. To address these problems, we propose MixMix based on two simple yet effective techniques:(1) Feature Mixing: utilizes various models to construct a universal feature space for generalized inversion;(2) Data Mixing: mixes the synthesized images and labels to generate exact label information. We prove the effectiveness of MixMix from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Extensive experiments show that MixMix outperforms existing methods on the mainstream compression tasks, including quantization, knowledge distillation and pruning. Specifically, MixMix achieves up to 4% and 20% accuracy uplift on quantization and pruning, respectively, compared to existing data-free compression work."}}

Besides inference, low-bit training with quantized gradients can further bring more considerable acceleration, since the backward process is often computation-intensive. Unfortunately, the inappropriate quantization of backward propagation usually makes the training unstable and even crash. There lacks a successful unified low-bit training framework that can support diverse networks on various tasks. In this paper, we give an attempt to build a unified 8-bit (INT8) training framework for common convolutional neural networks from the aspects of both accuracy and speed. First, we empirically find the four distinctive characteristics of gradients, which provide us insightful clues for gradient quantization. Then, we theoretically give an in-depth analysis of the convergence bound and derive two principles for stable INT8 training. Finally, we propose two universal techniques, including Direction Sensitive Gradient Clipping that reduces the direction deviation of gradients and Deviation Counteractive Learning Rate Scaling that avoids illegal gradient update along the wrong direction. The experiments show that our unified solution promises accurate and efficient INT8 training for a variety of networks and tasks, including MobileNetV2, InceptionV3 and object detection that prior studies have never succeeded. Moreover, it enjoys a strong flexibility to run on off-the-shelf hardware, and reduces the training time by 22% on Pascal GPU without too much optimization effort. We believe that this pioneering study will help lead the community towards a fully \u2026"}}

Different from CNNs, ViTs enjoy unique architectures, e.g., self-attention and image-embedding, which are commonly-shared features among various types of transformer-based models. However, existing adversarial methods suffer from weak transferable attacking ability due to the overlook of these architectural features. To address the problem, we propose an Architecture-oriented Transferable Attacking (ATA) framework to generate transferable adversarial examples by activating the uncertain attention and perturbing the sensitive embedding.Specifically, we first locate the patch-wise attentional regions that mostly affect model perception, therefore intensively activating the uncertainty of the attention mechanism and confusing the model decisions in turn.Furthermore, we search the pixel-wise attacking positions that are more likely to derange the embedded tokens using sensitive embedding perturbation, which could serve as a strong transferable attacking pattern.By jointly confusing the unique yet widely-used architectural features among transformer-based models, we can activate strong attacking transferability among diverse ViTs. Extensive experiments on large-scale dataset ImageNet using various popular transformers demonstrate that our ATA outperforms other baselines by large margins (at least +15% Attack Success Rate).

Despite the preliminary understandings devoted to adversarially robust generalization, little is known from the architectural perspective. To bridge the gap, this paper for the first time systematically investigated the relationship between adversarially robust generalization and architectural design. Inparticular, we comprehensively evaluated 20 most representative adversarially trained architectures on ImageNette and CIFAR-10 datasets towards multiple `p-norm adversarial attacks. Based on the extensive experiments, we found that, under aligned settings, Vision Transformers (e.g., PVT, CoAtNet) often yield better adversarially robust generalization while CNNs tend to overfit on specific attacks and fail to generalize on multiple adversaries. To better understand the nature behind it, we conduct theoretical analysis via the lens of Rademacher complexity. We revealed the fact that the higher weight sparsity contributes significantly towards the better adversarially robust generalization of Transformers, which can be often achieved by the specially-designed attention blocks. We hope our paper could help to better understand the mechanism for designing robust DNNs. Our model weights can be found at http://robust.art."}}
