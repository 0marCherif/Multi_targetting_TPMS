Existing detection approaches rely on machine learning algorithms with a variety of news characteristics to detect fake news. However, such approaches have a major limitation on detecting fake news early, i.e., the information required for detecting fake news is often unavailable or inadequate at the early stage of news propagation. As a result, the accuracy of early detection of fake news is low. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel model for early detection of fake news on social media through classifying news propagation paths. We first model the propagation path of each news story as a multivariate time series in which each tuple is a numerical vector representing characteristics of a user who engaged in spreading the news. Then, we build a time series classifier that incorporates both recurrent and convolutional networks which capture the global and local variations of user characteristics along the propagation path respectively, to detect fake news. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can detect fake news with accuracy 85% and 92% on Twitter and Sina Weibo respectively in 5 minutes after it starts to spread, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art baselines."}}

It is then illustrated with an example of discovering knowledge from competitors' websites. The knowledge to be discovered is in the form of association rules. A user's background knowledge is represented as a concept hierarchy developed from documents on his/her own website. The concept hierarchy captures the semantic usage of words and relationships among words in background documents. Association rules are identified among the noun phrases extracted from documents on competitors' websites. The interestingness measure, i.e. novelty, which measures the semantic distance between the antecedent and the consequent of a rule in the background knowledge, is computed from the co-occurrence frequency of words and the connection lengths among words in the concept hierarchy. A user evaluation of the novelty of discovered rules demonstrates that the correlation between the algorithm and the human judges is comparable to that between human judges."}}

The infrastructure generates the vast majority of link anchors and links automatically through the use of structural relationship rules, in addition to lexical analysis."}}
