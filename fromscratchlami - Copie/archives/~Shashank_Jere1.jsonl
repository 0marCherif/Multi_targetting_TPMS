The particular RC implementation considered in this paper is the echo state network (ESN), and the generalization bound is derived via the empirical Rademacher complexity (ERC) approach. While recent work in deriving risk bounds for RC frameworks makes use of a non-standard empirical Rademacher Complexity (ERC) measure and a direct application of its definition, our work uses the standard ERC measure and tools which allow easier extension to deep RC structures and a fair comparison with other RNN structures including the vanilla RNNs. Finally, we train an ESN for the task of symbol detection, a key component in the receive processing of 5G systems and show with an example how the derived generalization bound can guide the underlying system design. To be specific, we utilize the derived generalization error together with the characterized training loss to analytically identify the optimum number of neurons in the reservoir for the symbol detection task. Simulation results using 3GPP specified channels corroborate our theoretical findings, illustrating the significance and practical relevance of our work."}}

This paper introduces an anonymous jamming detection model for 5G and beyond based on critical signal parameters collected from the radio access and core network\u2019s protocol stacks on a 5G testbed. The introduced system leverages both supervised and unsupervised learning to detect jamming with high-accuracy in real time, and allows for robust detection of unknown jamming types. Based on the given types of jamming, supervised instantaneous detection models reach an Area Under the Curve (AUC) within a range of 0.964 to 1 as compared to temporal-based long short-term memory (LSTM) models that reach AUC within a range of 0.923 to 1. The need for data annotation effort and the required knowledge of a vocabulary of known jamming limits the usage of the introduced supervised learning-based approach. To mitigate this issue, an unsupervised auto-encoder-based anomaly detection is also presented. The introduced unsupervised approach has an AUC of 0.987 with training samples collected without any jamming or interference and shows resistance to adversarial training samples within certain percentage. To retain transparency and allow domain knowledge injection, a Bayesian network model based causation analysis is further introduced."}}

To this end, Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) is considered as a promising technology to handle this spectrum scarcity. However, standard DSA techniques often rely on analytical modeling wireless networks, making its application intractable in under-measured network environments. Therefore, utilizing neural networks to approximate the network dynamics is an alternative approach. In this article, we introduce a Federated Learning (FL) based framework for the task of DSA, where FL is a distributive machine learning framework that can reserve the privacy of network terminals under heterogeneous data distributions. We discuss the opportunities, challenges, and opening problems of this framework. To evaluate its feasibility, we implement a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based FL as a realization associated with its initial evaluation results."}}

We first introduce the Time-Frequency RC to take advantage of the structural information inherent in OFDM signals. Using the time domain RC and the time-frequency RC as building blocks, we provide two extensions of the shallow RC to RCNet: 1) Stacking multiple time domain RCs; 2) Stacking multiple time-frequency RCs into a deep structure. The combination of RNN dynamics, the time-frequency structure of MIMO-OFDM signals, and the deep network enables RCNet to handle the interference and nonlinear distortion of MIMO-OFDM signals to outperform existing methods. Unlike most existing NN-based detection strategies, RCNet is also shown to provide a good generalization performance even with a limited online training set (i.e, similar amount of reference signals/training as standard model-based approaches). Numerical experiments demonstrate that the introduced RCNet can offer a faster learning convergence and as much as 20% gain in bit error rate over a shallow RC structure by compensating for the nonlinear distortion of the MIMO-OFDM signal, such as due to power amplifier compression in the transmitter or due to finite quantization resolution in the receiver."}}

Specifically, we introduce a symmetric and decomposed neural network structure, which is fully interpretable in terms of the functionality of its constituent components. By taking advantage of the underlying pattern of the integer constraint, as well as of the affine nature of the objective function, the introduced neural network offers superior generalization performance with limited training, as compared to other generic neural network structures that do not exploit the inherent structure of the integer constraint. In addition, we show that the introduced decomposed approach can be further extended to semi-decomposed frameworks. The introduced learning approach is evaluated via the classification/symbol detection task in the context of wireless communication systems where available training sets are usually limited. Evaluation results demonstrate that the introduced learning strategy is able to effectively perform the classification/symbol detection task in a wide variety of wireless channel environments specified by the 3GPP community."}}

In this work, we introduce a Deep Echo State Network (DESN) to serve as the symbol detector for 5G communication networks. Our DESN employs memristive synapses as the dynamic reservoir layer to accelerate the learning algorithm and computation. By cascading multiple dynamic reservoir layers in a hierarchical processing structure, our DESN processes received signal in both spatial and temporal domains. The resulting hybrid memristor-CMOS co-design provides the nonlinear computation required by the reservoir layer while significantly reduces the power consumption. From the benchmark on nonlinear system prediction, our DESN exhibits 10.31 X reduction on the prediction error compared to state-of-the-art neural network designs.

By provisioning computing resources at the network edge, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has become a promising technology capable of collaborating with distributed IoT devices to facilitate federated learning, and thus realize real-time training. However, considering the large volume of sensed data and the limited resources of both edge servers and IoT devices, it is challenging to ensure the training efficiency and accuracy of delay-sensitive training tasks. Thus, in this paper, we design a novel edge computing-assisted federated learning framework, in which the communication constraints between IoT devices and edge servers and the effect of various IoT devices on the training accuracy are taken into account. On one hand, we employ machine learning methods to dynamically configure the communication resources in real-time to accelerate the interactions between IoT devices and edge servers, thus improving the training efficiency of federated learning. On the other hand, as various IoT devices have different training datasets which have varying influence on the accuracy of the global model derived at the edge server, an IoT device selection scheme is designed to improve the training accuracy under the resource constraints at edge servers. Extensive simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the introduced edge computing-assisted federated learning framework."}}
