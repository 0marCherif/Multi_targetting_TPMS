TLM pre-training requires high computational resources and introduces many unresolved design choices, such as selecting its pre-training hyperparameters. We propose a multi-armed bandit framework for the sequential selection of TLM pre-training hyperparameters, aimed at optimizing language model performance, in a resource efficient manner. We design a Thompson sampling algorithm, with a surrogate Gaussian process reward model of the Masked Language Model (MLM) pre-training objective, for its sequential minimization. Instead of MLM pre-training with fixed masking probabilities, the proposed Gaussian process-based Thompson sampling (GP-TS) accelerates pre-training by sequentially selecting masking hyperparameters that improve performance. We empirically demonstrate how GP-TS pre-trains language models efficiently, i.e., it achieves lower MLM loss in fewer epochs, across a variety of settings. In addition, GP-TS pre-trained TLMs attain competitive downstream performance, while avoiding expensive hyperparameter grid search. GP-TS provides an interactive framework for efficient and optimized TLM pre-training that, by circumventing costly hyperparameter selection, enables substantial computational savings."}}

However, such data streams have questionable reliability since they hinge on user adherence to the app. Therefore, it is crucial for researchers to separate true behavior from self-tracking artifacts. By taking a machine learning approach to modeling self-tracked cycle lengths, we can both make more informed predictions and learn the underlying structure of the observed data. In this work, we propose and evaluate a hierarchical, generative model for predicting next cycle length based on previously-tracked cycle lengths that accounts explicitly for the possibility of users skipping tracking their period. Our model offers several advantages: 1) accounting explicitly for self-tracking artifacts yields better prediction accuracy as likelihood of skipping increases; 2) because it is a generative model, predictions can be updated online as a given cycle evolves, and we can gain interpretable insight into how these predictions change over time; and 3) its hierarchical nature enables modeling of an individual's cycle length history while incorporating population-level information. Our experiments using mHealth cycle length data encompassing over 186,000 menstruators with over 2 million natural menstrual cycles show that our method yields state-of-the-art performance against neural network-based and summary statistic-based baselines, while providing insights on disentangling menstrual patterns from self-tracking artifacts. This work can benefit users, mHealth app developers, and researchers in better understanding cycle patterns and user adherence."}}

We here investigate the use of patient-generated health data and data-driven phenotyping to characterize endometriosis patient subtypes, based on their reported signs and symptoms. We aim at unsupervised learning of endometriosis phenotypes using self-tracking data from personal smartphones. We leverage data from an observational research study of over 4000 women with endometriosis that track their condition over more than 2 years. We extend a classical mixed-membership model to accommodate the idiosyncrasies of the data at hand, i.e., the multimodality and uncertainty of the self-tracked variables. The proposed method, by jointly modeling a wide range of observations (i.e., participant symptoms, quality of life, treatments), identifies clinically relevant endometriosis subtypes. Experiments show that our method is robust to different hyperparameter choices and the biases of self-tracking data (e.g., the wide variations in tracking frequency among participants). With this work, we show the promise of unsupervised learning of endometriosis subtypes from self-tracked data, as learned phenotypes align well with what is already known about the disease, but also suggest new clinically actionable findings. More generally, we argue that a continued research effort on unsupervised phenotyping methods with patient-generated health data via new mobile and digital technologies will have significant impact on the study of enigmatic diseases in particular, and health in general."}}

Previously, menstruation was primarily studied through survey results; however, as menstrual tracking mobile apps become more widely adopted, they provide an increasingly large, content-rich source of menstrual health experiences and behaviors over time. By exploring a database of user-tracked observations from the Clue app by BioWink GmbH of over 378,000 users and 4.9 million natural cycles, we show that self-reported menstrual tracker data can reveal statistically significant relationships between per-person cycle length variability and self-reported qualitative symptoms. A concern for self-tracked data is that they reflect not only physiological behaviors, but also the engagement dynamics of app users. To mitigate such potential artifacts, we develop a procedure to exclude cycles lacking user engagement, thereby allowing us to better distinguish true menstrual patterns from tracking anomalies. We uncover that women located at different ends of the menstrual variability spectrum, based on the consistency of their cycle length statistics, exhibit statistically significant differences in their cycle characteristics and symptom tracking patterns. We also find that cycle and period length statistics are stationary over the app usage timeline across the variability spectrum. The symptoms that we identify as showing statistically significant association with timing data can be useful to clinicians and users for predicting cycle variability from symptoms, or as potential health indicators for conditions like endometriosis. Our findings showcase the potential of longitudinal, high-resolution self-tracked data to improve understanding of menstruation and women\u2019s health as a whole."}}

Reconstructing and forecasting the evolution of hormonal dynamics is a challenging task, but a critical one to improve general understanding of the menstrual cycle and personalized detection of potential health issues. Our goal is to infer and forecast individual hormone daily levels over time, while accommodating pragmatic and minimally invasive measurement settings. To that end, our approach combines the power of probabilistic generative models (i.e., multi-task Gaussian processes) with the flexibility of neural networks (i.e., a dilated convolutional architecture) to learn complex temporal mappings. To attain accurate hormone level reconstruction with as little data as possible, we propose a sampling mechanism for optimal reconstruction accuracy with limited sampling budget. Our results show the validity of our proposed hormonal dynamic modeling framework, as it provides accurate predictive performance across different realistic sampling budgets and outperforms baselines methods."}}
