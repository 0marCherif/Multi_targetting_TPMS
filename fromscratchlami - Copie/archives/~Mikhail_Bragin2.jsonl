However, when fixed costs are included, prices become non-monotonic with respect to demand, which can adversely impact market transparency. To overcome this issue, convex hull (CH) pricing has been introduced for unit commitment with fixed costs. Several CH pricing methods have been presented, and a feasible cost has been used as a quality measure for the CH price. However, obtaining a feasible cost requires a computationally intensive optimization procedure, and the associated duality gap may not provide an accurate quality measure. This paper presents a new approach for quantifying the quality of the CH price by establishing an upper bound on the optimal dual value. The proposed approach uses Surrogate Lagrangian Relaxation (SLR) to efficiently obtain near-optimal CH prices, while the upper bound decreases rapidly due to the convergence of SLR. Testing results on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate that the novel quality measure is more accurate than the measure provided by a feasible cost, indicating the high quality of the upper bound and the efficiency of SLR."}}

However, the typical three-stage pipeline significantly increases the overall training time. In this paper, we develop a systematic weight-pruning optimization approach based on Surrogate Lagrangian relaxation, which is tailored to overcome difficulties caused by the discrete nature of the weight-pruning problem. We prove that our method ensures fast convergence of the model compression problem, and the convergence of the SLR is accelerated by using quadratic penalties. Model parameters obtained by SLR during the training phase are much closer to their optimal values as compared to those obtained by other state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate our method on image classification tasks using CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with state-of-the-art MLP-Mixer, Swin Transformer, and VGG-16, ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and ResNet-110, MobileNetV2. We also evaluate object detection and segmentation tasks on COCO, KITTI benchmark, and TuSimple lane detection dataset using a variety of models. Experimental results demonstrate that our SLR-based weight-pruning optimization approach achieves a higher compression rate than state-of-the-art methods under the same accuracy requirement and also can achieve higher accuracy under the same compression rate requirement. Under classification tasks, our SLR approach converges to the desired accuracy $3\\times$ faster on both of the datasets. Under object detection and segmentation tasks, SLR also converges $2\\times$ faster to the desired accuracy. Further, our SLR achieves high model accuracy even at the hard-pruning stage without retraining, which reduces the traditional three-stage pruning into a two-stage process. Given a limited budget of retraining epochs, our approach quickly recovers the model's accuracy."}}

However, heavy-duty diesel trucks that deliver goods contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions within many large metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. To facilitate freight electrification, this paper proposes joint routing and charging (JRC) scheduling for electric trucks. The objective of the associated optimization problem is to minimize the cost of transportation, charging, and tardiness. As a result of a large number of combinations of road segments, electric trucks can take a large number of combinations of possible charging decisions and charging duration as well. The resulting mixed-integer linear programming problem (MILP) is extremely challenging because of the combinatorial complexity even in the deterministic case. Therefore, a Level-Based Surrogate Lagrangian Relaxation method is employed to decompose and coordinate the overall problem into truck subproblems that are significantly less complex. In the coordination aspect, each truck subproblem is solved independently of other subproblems based on charging cost, tardiness, and the values of Lagrangian multipliers. In addition to serving as a means of guiding and coordinating trucks, multipliers can also serve as a basis for transparent and explanatory decision-making by trucks. Testing results demonstrate that even small instances cannot be solved using the over-the-shelf solver CPLEX after several days of solving. The new method, on the other hand, can obtain near-optimal solutions within a few minutes for small cases, and within 30 minutes for large ones. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that as battery capacity increases, the total cost decreases significantly; moreover, as the charging power increases, the number of trucks required decreases as well."}}

While MILP problems suffer from combinatorial complexity, Lagrangian Relaxation has been a beacon of hope to resolve the associated difficulties through decomposition. Due to the non-smooth nature of Lagrangian dual functions, the coordination aspect of the method has posed serious challenges. This paper presents several significant historical milestones (beginning with Polyak's pioneering work in 1967) toward improving Lagrangian Relaxation coordination through improved optimization of non-smooth functionals. Finally, this paper presents the most recent developments in Lagrangian Relaxation for fast resolution of MILP problems. The paper also briefly discusses the opportunities that Lagrangian Relaxation can provide at this point in time."}}

Its scheduling has recently been formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem to take advantages of popular mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) methods, e.g., branch-and-cut. When considering a large number of parts, MILP methods may experience difficulties. To address this, a critical but much overlooked issue is formulation tightening. The idea is that if problem constraints can be transformed to directly delineate the problem convex hull in the data preprocessing stage, then a solution can be obtained by using linear programming (LP) methods without combinatorial difficulties. The tightening process, however, is fundamentally challenging because of the existence of integer variables. In this article, an innovative and systematic approach is established for the first time to tighten the formulations of individual parts, each with multiple operations, in the data preprocessing stage. It is a major advancement of our previous work on problems with binary and continuous variables to integer variables. The idea is to first link integer variables to binary variables by innovatively combining constraints so that the integer variables are uniquely determined by the binary variables. With binary and continuous variables only, it is proved that the vertices of the convex hull can be obtained based on vertices of the LP problem after relaxing binary requirements. These vertices are then converted to tightened constraints for general use. This approach significantly improves our previous results on tightening individual operations. Numerical results demonstrate significant benefits on solution quality and computational efficiency. This approach also applies to other complex ILP and MILP problems with similar characteristics and fundamentally changes the way how such problems are formulated and solved. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Note to Practitioners</i> \u2014Scheduling is an important but difficult problem in planning and operation of job shops. The problem has been recently formulated in an integer linear programming (ILP) form to take advantage of popular mixed-integer linear programming methods. Given an ILP problem, there must exist a linear programming (LP) formulation so that all of its vertices are also the vertices to the ILP problem. If such an LP problem can be found in the data preprocessing stage, then the corresponding ILP problem is tight and can be solved by using an LP method without difficulties. In this article, an innovative and systematic approach is established to tighten the formulations of individual parts, each with one or multiple operations. It is a major advancement of our previous work on problems with binary and continuous variables by novel exploitation of the relationship between integer and binary variables in job-shop scheduling. The resulting tightened constraints are characterized by part parameters and the length of the scheduling horizon and can be easily adjusted for other data sets.

The presence of manufacturing defects is, however, inevitable leading to products being discarded, i.e. scrapped. In some cases, defective products can be repaired through rework. Scrap and rework cause a longer completion time, which can contribute to orders being shipped late. Moreover, the presence of uncertainties and combinatorial complexity significantly increases the difficulty of complex manufacturing scheduling. This paper tackles this challenge, exemplified by a case study on stochastic job-shop scheduling in low-volume, high-variety manufacturing contexts. To ensure on-time delivery, high-quality solutions are required, and near-optimal solutions must be obtained within strict time constraints to ensure smooth operations on the job-shop floor. To efficiently solve the stochastic job-shop scheduling (JSS) problem, a recently-developed Surrogate \"Level-Based\" Lagrangian Relaxation is used to reduce computational effort while efficiently exploiting the geometric convergence potential inherent to Polyak's stepsizing formula thereby leading to fast convergence. Numerical testing demonstrates that the new method is two orders of magnitude faster as compared to commercial solvers."}}

Mathematical optimization techniques like dynamic programming, Lagrangian relaxation, and mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) are commonly adopted for UC problems. However, the calculation time of these methods increases at an exponential rate with the amount of generators and energy resources, which is still the main bottleneck in industry. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have demonstrated the capability of reinforcement learning (RL) to solve UC problems. Unfortunately, the existing research on solving UC problems with RL suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the size of UC problems grows. To deal with these problems, we propose an optimization method-assisted ensemble deep reinforcement learning algorithm, where UC problems are formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved by multi-step deep Q-learning in an ensemble framework. The proposed algorithm establishes a candidate action set by solving tailored optimization problems to ensure a relatively high performance and the satisfaction of operational constraints. Numerical studies on IEEE 118 and 300-bus systems show that our algorithm outperforms the baseline RL algorithm and MIQP. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm shows strong generalization capacity under unforeseen operational conditions."}}

The MILP problems, however, suffer from combinatorial complexity. Because of integer decision variables, as the problem size increases, the number of possible solutions increases super-linearly thereby leading to a drastic increase in the computational effort. To efficiently solve MILP problems, a \"price-based\" decomposition and coordination approach is developed to exploit 1. the super-linear reduction of complexity upon the decomposition and 2. the geometric convergence potential inherent to Polyak's stepsizing formula for the fastest coordination possible to obtain near-optimal solutions in a computationally efficient manner. Unlike all previous methods to set stepsizes heuristically by adjusting hyperparameters, the key novel way to obtain stepsizes is purely decision-based: a novel \"auxiliary\" constraint satisfaction problem is solved, from which the appropriate stepsizes are inferred. Testing results for large-scale Generalized Assignment Problems (GAP) demonstrate that for the majority of instances, certifiably optimal solutions are obtained. For stochastic job-shop scheduling as well as for pharmaceutical scheduling, computational results demonstrate the two orders of magnitude speedup as compared to Branch-and-Cut (B&C). The new method has a major impact on the efficient resolution of complex Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problems arising within a variety of scientific fields."}}
