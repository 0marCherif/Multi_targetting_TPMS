The aim of this study was to predict negative symptom severity in CHR after 9 months. Predictive models either included baseline negative symptoms measured with the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS-N), whole-brain gyrification, or both to forecast negative symptoms of at least moderate severity in 94 CHR. We also conducted sequential risk stratification to stratify CHR into different risk groups based on the SIPS-N and gyrification model. Additionally, we assessed the models\u2019 ability to predict functional outcomes in CHR and their transdiagnostic generalizability to predict negative symptoms in 96 patients with recent-onset psychosis (ROP) and 97 patients with recent-onset depression (ROD). Baseline SIPS-N and gyrification predicted moderate/severe negative symptoms with significant balanced accuracies of 68 and 62%, while the combined model achieved 73% accuracy. Sequential risk stratification stratified CHR into a high (83%), medium (40\u201364%), and low (19%) risk group regarding their risk of having moderate/severe negative symptoms at 9 months follow-up. The baseline SIPS-N model was also able to predict social (61%), but not role functioning (59%) at above-chance accuracies, whereas the gyrification model achieved significant accuracies in predicting both social (76%) and role (74%) functioning in CHR. Finally, only the baseline SIPS-N model showed transdiagnostic generalization to ROP (63%). This study delivers a multimodal prognostic model to identify those CHR with a clinically relevant negative symptom severity and functional impairments, potentially requiring further therapeutic consideration."}}

Our cross-sectional study investigated whether brain morphology is altered by antidepressant medication. High-resolution T1-weighted structural MRI scans of 33 CHR-P and FEP subjects treated with antidepressants, 102 CHR-P and FEP individuals without antidepressant treatment and 55 controls, were automatically segmented using Freesurfer 6.0. Linear mixed-effects modelling was applied to assess the differences in subcortical volume, surface area and cortical thickness in treated, non-treated and healthy subjects, taking into account converted dosages of antidepressants. Increasing antidepressant dose was associated with larger volume of the pallidum and the putamen, and larger surface of the left inferior temporal gyrus. In a pilot subsample of separately studied subjects of known genomic risk loci, we found that in the right postcentral gyrus, the left paracentral lobule and the precentral gyrus antidepressant dose-associated surface increase depended on polygenic schizophrenia-related-risk score. As the reported regions are linked to the symptoms of psychosis, our findings reflect the possible beneficial effects of antidepressant treatment on an emerging psychosis."}}

Persecutory delusions are core symptoms of psychosis, and social cognition is particularly impaired in first-episode psychosis patients and individuals at risk for developing psychosis. Here, we propose new avenues for translation provided by hierarchical Bayesian models of behaviour and neuroimaging data applied in the context of social learning to target persecutory delusions. As it comprises a mechanistic model embedded in neurophysiology, the findings of this approach may shed light onto inference and neurobiological causes of transition to psychosis."}}

As yet, no reliable biological marker has been established to delineate CHR individuals who will develop psychosis from those who will not.\n\nObjectives  To investigate abnormalities in a graph-based gyrification connectome in the early stages of psychosis and to test the accuracy of this systems-based approach to predict a transition to psychosis among CHR individuals.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  This investigation was a cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study with follow-up assessment to determine the transition status of CHR individuals. Participants were recruited from a specialized clinic for the early detection of psychosis at the Department of Psychiatry (Universit\u00e4re Psychiatrische Kliniken [UPK]), University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. Participants included individuals in the following 4 study groups: 44 healthy controls (HC group), 63 at-risk mental state (ARMS) individuals without later transition to psychosis (ARMS-NT group), 16 ARMS individuals with later transition to psychosis (ARMS-T group), and 38 antipsychotic-free patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP group). The study dates were November 2008 to November 2014. The dates of analysis were March to November 2017.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Gyrification-based structural covariance networks (connectomes) were constructed to quantify global integration, segregation, and small-worldness. Group differences in network measures were assessed using functional data analysis across a range of network densities. The extremely randomized trees algorithm with repeated 5-fold cross-validation was used to delineate ARMS-T individuals from ARMS-NT individuals. Permutation tests were conducted to assess the significance of classification performance measures.\n\nResults  The 4 study groups comprised 161 participants with mean (SD) ages ranging from 24.0 (4.7) to 25.9 (5.7) years. Small-worldness was reduced in the ARMS-T and FEP groups and was associated with decreased integration and increased segregation in both groups (Hedges g range, 0.666-1.050). Using the connectome properties as features, a good classification performance was obtained (accuracy, 90.49%; balanced accuracy, 81.34%; positive predictive value, 84.47%; negative predictive value, 92.18%; sensitivity, 66.11%; specificity, 96.58%; and area under the curve, 88.30%).\n\nConclusions and Relevance  These findings suggest that there is poor integration in the coordinated development of cortical folding in patients who develop psychosis. These results further suggest that gyrification-based connectomes might be a promising means to generate systems-based measures from anatomical data to improve individual prediction of a transition to psychosis in CHR individuals."}}
