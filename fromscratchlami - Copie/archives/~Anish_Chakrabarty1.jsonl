The underlying requirement for effective few-shot generalization is to learn a good representation of the task manifold. This becomes more difficult when only a limited number of tasks are available for training. In such a few-task few-shot setting, it is beneficial to explicitly preserve the local neighborhoods from the task manifold and exploit this to generate artificial tasks for training. To this end, we introduce the notion of interval bounds from the provably robust training literature to few-shot learning. The interval bounds are used to characterize neighborhoods around the training tasks. These neighborhoods can then be preserved by minimizing the distance between a task and its respective bounds. We then use a novel strategy to artificially form new tasks for training by interpolating between the available tasks and their respective interval bounds. We apply our framework to both model-agnostic meta-learning as well as prototype-based metric-learning paradigms. The efficacy of our proposed approach is evident from the improved performance on several datasets from diverse domains in comparison to recent methods."}}

Numerous variants, with Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) at their forefront, have shown remarkable empirical performance. The involvement of two unalike data spaces and the existence of multiple solution maps between them are some of the facets that make such architectures unique. In this study, we investigate the statistical properties of such unpaired data translator networks between distinct spaces, bearing the additional responsibility of cycle-consistency. In a density estimation setup, we derive sharp non-asymptotic bounds on the translation errors under suitably characterized models. This, in turn, points out sufficient regularity conditions that maps must obey to carry out successful translations. We further show that cycle-consistency is achieved as a consequence of the data being successfully generated in each space based on observations from the other. In a first-of-its-kind attempt, we also provide deterministic bounds on the cumulative reconstruction error. In the process, we establish tolerable upper bounds on the discrepancy responsible for ill-posedness in such networks."}}

Firstly, we provide statistical guarantees that WAE achieves the target distribution in the latent space, utilizing the Vapnik\u2013Chervonenkis (VC) theory. The main result, consequently ensures the regeneration of the input distribution, harnessing the potential offered by Optimal Transport of measures under the Wasserstein metric.
