Despite its success in certain problems, in many real-world scenarios the observed variables are not the target variables of interest, but the imperfect measures of the target variables. Causal discovery under measurement error aims to recover the causal graph among unobserved target variables from observations made with measurement error. We consider a specific formulation of the problem, where the unobserved target variables follow a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model, and the measurement process follows the random measurement error model. Existing methods on this formulation rely on non-scalable over-complete independent component analysis (OICA). In this work, we propose the Transformed Independent Noise (TIN) condition, which checks for independence between a specific linear transformation of some measured variables and certain other measured variables. By leveraging the non-Gaussianity and higher-order statistics of data, TIN is informative about the graph structure among the unobserved target variables. By utilizing TIN, the ordered group decomposition of the causal model is identifiable. In other words, we could achieve what once required OICA to achieve by only conducting independence tests. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our method."}}

This paper presents a first attempt at addressing a fundamental question: What are the benefits from supervision and how does it benefit? Starting from seeing that SCL is not better than random guessing if the learning target is non-identifiable a priori, we propose a two-phase paradigm for SCL by explicitly considering structure identifiability. Following this paradigm, we tackle the problem of SCL on discrete data and propose ML4C. The core of ML4C is a binary classifier with a novel learning target: it classifies whether an Unshielded Triple (UT) is a v-structure or not. Starting from an input dataset with the corresponding skeleton provided, ML4C orients each UT once it is classified as a v-structure. These v-structures are together used to construct the final output. To address the fundamental question of SCL, we propose a principled method for ML4C featurization: we exploit the vicinity of a given UT (i.e., the neighbors of UT in skeleton), and derive features by considering the conditional dependencies and structural entanglement within the vicinity. We further prove that ML4C is asymptotically perfect. Last but foremost, thorough experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ML4C remarkably outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy, robustness and transferability. In summary, ML4C shows promising results on validating the effectiveness of supervision for causal learning."}}

However, despite the high performance, the training and prediction process remains to be a black box, leaving it a mystery to extract what neurons learn in CNN. In this paper, we address the problem of interpreting a CNN from the aspects of the input image's focus and preference, and the neurons' domination, activation and contribution to a concrete final prediction. Specifically, we use two techniques - visualization and clustering - to tackle the problems above. Visualization means the method of gradient descent on image pixel, and in clustering section two algorithms are proposed to cluster respectively over image categories and network neurons. Experiments and quantitative analyses have demonstrated the effectiveness of the two methods in explaining the question: what do neurons learn."}}
