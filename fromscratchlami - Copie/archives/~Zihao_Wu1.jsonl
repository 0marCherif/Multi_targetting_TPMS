Mappings of an NLP model's representations of and the brain activities evoked by linguistic input are typically deployed to reveal this symbiosis. However, two critical problems limit its advancement: 1) The model's representations (artificial neurons, ANs) rely on layer-level embeddings and thus lack fine-granularity; 2) The brain activities (biological neurons, BNs) are limited to neural recordings of isolated cortical unit (i.e., voxel/region) and thus lack integrations and interactions among brain functions. To address those problems, in this study, we 1) define ANs with fine-granularity in transformer-based NLP models (BERT in this study) and measure their temporal activations to input text sequences; 2) define BNs as functional brain networks (FBNs) extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to capture functional interactions in the brain; 3) couple ANs and BNs by maximizing the synchronization of their temporal activations. Our experimental results demonstrate 1) The activations of ANs and BNs are significantly synchronized; 2) the ANs carry meaningful linguistic/semantic information and anchor to their BN signatures; 3) the anchored BNs are interpretable in a neurolinguistic context. Overall, our study introduces a novel, general, and effective framework to link transformer-based NLP models and neural activities in response to language and may provide novel insights for future studies such as brain-inspired evaluation and development of NLP models."}}

To achieve this, AGI researchers draw inspiration from the human brain and seek to replicate its principles in intelligent machines. Brain-inspired artificial intelligence is a field that has emerged from this endeavor, combining insights from neuroscience, psychology, and computer science to develop more efficient and powerful AI systems. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of brain-inspired AI from the perspective of AGI. We begin with the current progress in brain-inspired AI and its extensive connection with AGI. We then cover the important characteristics for both human intelligence and AGI (e.g., scaling, multimodality, and reasoning). We discuss important technologies toward achieving AGI in current AI systems, such as in-context learning and prompt tuning. We also investigate the evolution of AGI systems from both algorithmic and infrastructural perspectives. Finally, we explore the limitations and future of AGI."}}

However, the data-intensive nature of the transformer architecture requires much labeled data, which is challenging in low-resource scenarios (i.e., few-shot learning (FSL)). The main challenge of FSL is the difficulty of training robust models on small amounts of samples, which frequently leads to overfitting. Here we present Mask-BERT, a simple and modular framework to help BERT-based architectures tackle FSL. The proposed approach fundamentally differs from existing FSL strategies such as prompt tuning and meta-learning. The core idea is to selectively apply masks on text inputs and filter out irrelevant information, which guides the model to focus on discriminative tokens that influence prediction results. In addition, to make the text representations from different categories more separable and the text representations from the same category more compact, we introduce a contrastive learning loss function. Experimental results on public-domain benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Mask-BERT."}}

This challenge is especially prominent in the few-shot learning scenario, where the data in the target domain is generally much scarcer and of lowered quality. A natural and widely-used strategy to mitigate such challenges is to perform data augmentation to better capture the data invariance and increase the sample size. However, current text data augmentation methods either can't ensure the correct labeling of the generated data (lacking faithfulness) or can't ensure sufficient diversity in the generated data (lacking compactness), or both. Inspired by the recent success of large language models, especially the development of ChatGPT, which demonstrated improved language comprehension abilities, in this work, we propose a text data augmentation approach based on ChatGPT (named AugGPT). AugGPT rephrases each sentence in the training samples into multiple conceptually similar but semantically different samples. The augmented samples can then be used in downstream model training. Experiment results on few-shot learning text classification tasks show the superior performance of the proposed AugGPT approach over state-of-the-art text data augmentation methods in terms of testing accuracy and distribution of the augmented samples."}}

Previous studies, by post-hoc analysis, have found that the best-performing ANNs surprisingly resemble biological neural networks (BNN), which indicates that ANNs and BNNs may share some common principles to achieve optimal performance in either machine learning or cognitive/behavior tasks. Inspired by this phenomenon, we proactively instill organizational principles of BNNs to guide the redesign of ANNs. We leverage the Core-Periphery (CP) organization, which is widely found in human brain networks, to guide the information communication mechanism in the self-attention of vision transformer (ViT) and name this novel framework as CP-ViT. In CP-ViT, the attention operation between nodes is defined by a sparse graph with a Core-Periphery structure (CP graph), where the core nodes are redesigned and reorganized to play an integrative role and serve as a center for other periphery nodes to exchange information. We evaluated the proposed CP-ViT on multiple public datasets, including medical image datasets (INbreast) and natural image datasets. Interestingly, by incorporating the BNN-derived principle (CP structure) into the redesign of ViT, our CP-ViT outperforms other state-of-the-art ANNs. In general, our work advances the state of the art in three aspects: 1) This work provides novel insights for brain-inspired AI: we can utilize the principles found in BNNs to guide and improve our ANN architecture design; 2) We show that there exist sweet spots of CP graphs that lead to CP-ViTs with significantly improved performance; and 3) The core nodes in CP-ViT correspond to task-related meaningful and important image patches, which can significantly enhance the interpretability of the trained deep model."}}

HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) mandates removing re-identifying information before the dissemination of medical records. Thus, effective and efficient solutions for de-identifying medical data, especially those in free-text forms, are highly needed. While various computer-assisted de-identification methods, including both rule-based and learning-based, have been developed and used in prior practice, such solutions still lack generalizability or need to be fine-tuned according to different scenarios, significantly imposing restrictions in wider use. The advancement of large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have shown great potential in processing text data in the medical domain with zero-shot in-context learning, especially in the task of privacy protection, as these models can identify confidential information by their powerful named entity recognition (NER) capability. In this work, we developed a novel GPT4-enabled de-identification framework (\"DeID-GPT\") to automatically identify and remove the identifying information. Compared to existing commonly used medical text data de-identification methods, our developed DeID-GPT showed the highest accuracy and remarkable reliability in masking private information from the unstructured medical text while preserving the original structure and meaning of the text. This study is one of the earliest to utilize ChatGPT and GPT-4 for medical text data processing and de-identification, which provides insights for further research and solution development on the use of LLMs such as ChatGPT/GPT-4 in healthcare.

In particular, we formulate the task as an answer selection problem, fine-tune the trained language model with the help of an external source of knowledge (e.g., FoodOn ontology), and establish a baseline for this task.

Considering the high dimensionality of fMRI data, various computational techniques have been developed to perform the dimension reduction such as independent component analysis (ICA) or sparse dictionary learning (SDL). These methods decompose the fMRI as compact functional brain networks, and then build the correspondence of those brain networks across individuals by viewing the brain networks as one-hot vectors and performing their matching. However, these one-hot vectors do not encode the regularity and variability of different brains, and thus cannot effectively represent the functional brain activities in different brains and at different time points. To bridge the gaps, in this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised embedding framework based on Transformer to encode the brain function in a compact, stereotyped and comparable latent space where the brain activities are represented as dense embedding vectors. The framework is evaluated on the publicly available Human Connectome Project (HCP) task based fMRI dataset. The experiment on brain state prediction downstream task indicates the effectiveness and generalizability of the learned embeddings. We also explore the interpretability of the embedding vectors and achieve promising result. In general, our approach provides novel insights on representing regularity and variability of human brain function in a general, comparable, and stereotyped latent space."}}

The situation becomes even more serious in medical imaging, where the clinical data (e.g., MR images with pathology) are limited and scarce while the reliability, generalizability and transparency of the learned model are highly required. To address this problem, we propose to infuse human experts' intelligence and domain knowledge into the training of deep neural networks. The core idea is that we infuse the visual attention information from expert radiologists to proactively guide the deep model to focus on regions with potential pathology and avoid being trapped in learning harmful shortcuts. To do so, we propose a novel eye-gaze-guided vision transformer (EG-ViT) for diagnosis with limited medical image data. We mask the input image patches that are out of the radiologists' interest and add an additional residual connection in the last encoder layer of EG-ViT to maintain the correlations of all patches. The experiments on two public datasets of INbreast and SIIM-ACR demonstrate our EG-ViT model can effectively learn/transfer experts' domain knowledge and achieve much better performance than baselines. Meanwhile, it successfully rectifies the harmful shortcut learning and significantly improves the EG-ViT model's interpretability. In general, EG-ViT takes the advantages of both human expert's prior knowledge and the power of deep neural networks. This work opens new avenues for advancing current artificial intelligence paradigms by infusing human intelligence."}}
