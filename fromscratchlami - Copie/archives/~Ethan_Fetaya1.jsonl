While previous research provides differential privacy bounds for SGLD at the initial steps of the algorithm or when close to convergence, the question of what differential privacy guarantees can be made in between remains unanswered. This interim region is of great importance, especially for Bayesian neural networks, as it is hard to guarantee convergence to the posterior. This paper shows that using SGLD might result in unbounded privacy loss for this interim region, even when sampling from the posterior is as differentially private as desired."}}

However, these benefits come at a steep computational cost as Bayesian inference, in most cases, is computationally intractable. One popular approach to alleviate this problem is using a Monte-Carlo estimation with an ensemble of models sampled from the posterior. However, this approach still comes at a significant computational cost, as one needs to store and run multiple models at test time. In this work, we investigate how to best distill an ensemble's predictions using an efficient model. First, we argue that current approaches are limited as they are constrained to classification and the Dirichlet distribution. Second, in many limited data settings, all ensemble members achieve nearly zero training loss, namely, they produce near-identical predictions on the training set which results in sub-optimal distilled models. To address both problems, we propose a novel and general distillation approach, named Functional Ensemble Distillation (FED), and we investigate how to best distill an ensemble in this setting. We find that learning the distilled model via a simple augmentation scheme in the form of mixup  augmentation significantly boosts the performance. We evaluated our method on several tasks and showed that it achieves superior results in both accuracy and uncertainty estimation compared to current approaches."}}

However, the exchange of data between the workers and the model aggregator for parameter training incurs a heavy communication burden, especially when the learning system is built upon capacity-constrained wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical distributed learning framework, where each worker separately learns a low-dimensional embedding of their local observed data. Then, they perform communication efficient distributed max-pooling for efficiently transmitting the synthesized input to the aggregator. For data exchange over a shared wireless channel, we propose an opportunistic carrier sensing-based protocol to implement the max-pooling operation for the output data from all the learning workers. Our simulation experiments show that the proposed learning framework is able to achieve almost the same model accuracy as the learning model using the concatenation of all the raw outputs from the learning workers, while requiring a communication load that is independent of the number of workers."}}

While it is true that these models have shown remarkable results, evaluating their performance is challenging. This issue is of vital importance to push research forward and identify meaningful gains from random noise. Currently, heuristic metrics such as the Inception score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) are the most common evaluation metrics, but what they measure is not entirely clear. Additionally, there are questions regarding how meaningful their score actually is. In this work, we study the evaluation metrics of generative models by generating a high-quality synthetic dataset on which we can estimate classical metrics for comparison. Our study shows that while FID and IS do correlate to several f-divergences, their ranking of close models can vary considerably making them problematic when used for fain-grained comparison. We further used this experimental setting to study which evaluation metric best correlates with our probabilistic metrics. Lastly, we look into the base features used for metrics such as FID."}}
