To address this issue, practitioners often use adversarial training to learn models that are robust against such attacks at the cost of higher generalization error on unperturbed test sets. The conventional wisdom is that more training data should shrink the gap between the generalization error of adversarially-trained models and standard models. However, we study the training of robust classifiers for both Gaussian and Bernoulli models under \u2113\u221e attacks, and we prove that more data may actually increase this gap. Furthermore, our theoretical results identify if and when additional data will finally begin to shrink the gap. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate that our results also hold for linear regression models, which may indicate that this phenomenon occurs more broadly."}}

The first one, Mono-Frank-Wolfe, reduces the number of per-function gradient evaluations from $T^{1/2}$  [Chen2018Online] and $T^{3/2}$ [chen2018projection] to 1, and achieves a $(1-1/e)$-regret bound of $O(T^{4/5})$. The second one, Bandit-Frank-Wolfe, is the first bandit algorithm for continnuous DR-submodular maximization, which achieves a $(1-1/e)$-regret bound of $O(T^{8/9})$. Finally, we extend Bandit-Frank-Wolfe to a bandit algorithm for discrete submodular maximization, Responsive-Frank-Wolfe, which attains a $(1-1/e)$-regret bound of $O(T^{8/9})$ in the responsive bandit setting."}}
