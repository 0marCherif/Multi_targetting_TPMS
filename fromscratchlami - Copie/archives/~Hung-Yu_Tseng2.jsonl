The translation is difficult as there exist infinite possibilities and the different users usually expect different outcomes. Therefore, we propose a unified framework supporting a three-dimensional control over the image synthesis from sketches and strokes based on diffusion models. Users can not only decide the level of faithfulness to the input strokes and sketches, but also the degree of realism, as the user inputs are usually not consistent with the real images. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing flexibility in generating customized images with control over shape, color, and realism. Moreover, our method unleashes applications such as editing on real images, generation with partial sketches and strokes, and multi-domain multi-modal synthesis."}}

However, most existing techniques can only synthesize novel views within a limited range of camera motion or fail to generate consistent and high-quality novel views under significant camera movement. In this work, we propose a pose-guided diffusion model to generate a consistent long-term video of novel views from a single image. We design an attention layer that uses epipolar lines as constraints to facilitate the association between different viewpoints. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed diffusion model against state-of-the-art transformer-based and GAN-based approaches."}}

However, the continuous translation problem that synthesizes intermediate results between two domains has not been well-studied in the literature. Generating a smooth sequence of intermediate results bridges the gap of two different domains, facilitating the morphing effect across domains. Existing I2I approaches are limited to either intra-domain or deterministic inter-domain continuous translation. In this work, we present an effectively signed attribute vector, which enables continuous translation on diverse mapping paths across various domains. In particular, we introduce a unified attribute space shared by all domains that utilize the sign operation to encode the domain information, thereby allowing the interpolation on attribute vectors of different domains. To enhance the visual quality of continuous translation results, we generate a trajectory between two sign-symmetrical attribute vectors and leverage the domain information of the interpolated results along the trajectory for adversarial training. We evaluate the proposed method on a wide range of I2I translation tasks. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed framework generates more high-quality continuous translation results against the state-of-the-art methods."}}

However, such instance-level learning ignores the semantic relationship among instances and sometimes undesirably repels the anchor from the semantically similar samples, termed as \"false negatives\". In this work, we show that the unfavorable effect from false negatives is more significant for the large-scale datasets with more semantic concepts. To address the issue, we propose a novel self-supervised contrastive learning framework that incrementally detects and explicitly removes the false negative samples. Specifically, following the training process, our method dynamically detects increasing high-quality false negatives considering that the encoder gradually improves and the embedding space becomes more semantically structural. Next, we discuss two strategies to explicitly remove the detected false negatives during contrastive learning. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms other self-supervised contrastive learning methods on multiple benchmarks in a limited resource setup."}}
