However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, i.e., assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably than prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios. "}}

Existing methods train a low-precision network by fine-tuning from a pre-trained model. However, training a low-precision network often requires large-scale labeled data to achieve superior performance. In many real-world scenarios, only limited labeled data are available due to expensive labeling costs or privacy protection. With limited training data, fine-tuning methods may suffer from the overfitting issue and substantial accuracy loss. To alleviate these issues, we introduce transfer learning into network quantization to obtain an accurate low-precision model. Specifically, we propose a method named deep transferring quantization (DTQ) to effectively exploit the knowledge in a pre-trained full-precision model. To this end, we propose a learnable attentive transfer module to identify the informative channels for alignment. In addition, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to further help train a low-precision model. Extensive experiments on both image classification and face recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of DTQ."}}

To alleviate the data burden, a practical approach is to adapt a pre-trained model learned on the large source domain to the target domain, but the performance can be limited when the source and target domain data distributions have large differences. Some recent works attempt to alleviate this issue by imposing feature alignment over the intermediate feature maps between the source and target networks. However, for a source model, many of the channels/spatial-features for each layer can be irrelevant to the target task. Thus, directly applying feature alignment may not achieve promising performance. In this paper, we propose an Attentive Feature Alignment (AFA) method for effective domain knowledge transfer by identifying and attending on the relevant channels and spatial features between two domains. To this end, we devise two learnable attentive modules at both the channel and spatial levels. We then sequentially perform attentive spatial- and channel-level feature alignments between the source and target networks, in which the target model and attentive module are learned simultaneously. Moreover, we theoretically analyze the generalization performance of our method, which confirms its superiority to existing methods. Extensive experiments on both image classification and face recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, we consider reasoning on complex referring expression comprehension (c-REF) task that seeks to localise the target objects in an image guided by complex queries. Such queries often contain complex logic and thus impose two key challenges for reasoning: (i) It can be very difficult to comprehend the query since it often refers to multiple objects and describes complex relationships among them. (ii) It is non-trivial to reason among multiple objects guided by the query and localise the target correctly. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Modular Graph Attention Network (MGA-Net). Specifically, to comprehend the long queries, we devise a language attention network to decompose them into four types: basic attributes, absolute location, visual relationship and relative locations, which mimics the human language understanding mechanism. Moreover, to capture the complex logic in a query, we construct a relational graph to represent the visual objects and their relationships, and propose a multi-step reasoning method to progressively understand the complex logic. Extensive experiments on CLEVR-Ref+, GQA and CLEVR-CoGenT datasets demonstrate the superior reasoning performance of our MGA-Net."}}
