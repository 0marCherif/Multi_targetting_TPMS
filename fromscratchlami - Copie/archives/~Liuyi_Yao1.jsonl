We conduct the first study of backdoor attacks in the pFL framework, testing 4 widely used backdoor attacks against 6 pFL methods on benchmark datasets FEMNIST and CIFAR-10, a total of 600 experiments. The study shows that pFL methods with partial model-sharing can significantly boost robustness against backdoor attacks. In contrast, pFL methods with full model-sharing do not show robustness. To analyze the reasons for varying robustness performances, we provide comprehensive ablation studies on different pFL methods. Based on our findings, we further propose a lightweight defense method, Simple-Tuning, which empirically improves defense performance against backdoor attacks. We believe that our work could provide both guidance for pFL application in terms of its robustness and offer valuable insights to design more robust FL methods in the future. We open-source our code to establish the first benchmark for black-box backdoor attacks in pFL: https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope/tree/backdoor-bench."}}

Due to the heterogeneity of clients' local data distribution, recent studies explore the personalized FL that learns and deploys distinct local models with the help of auxiliary global models. However, the clients can be heterogeneous in terms of not only local data distribution, but also their computation and communication resources. The capacity and efficiency of personalized models are restricted by the lowest-resource clients, leading to sub-optimal performance and limited practicality of personalized FL. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach named pFedGate for efficient personalized FL by adaptively and efficiently learning sparse local models. With a lightweight trainable gating layer, pFedGate enables clients to reach their full potential in model capacity by generating different sparse models accounting for both the heterogeneous data distributions and resource constraints. Meanwhile, the computation and communication efficiency are both improved thanks to the adaptability between the model sparsity and clients' resources. Further, we theoretically show that the proposed pFedGate has superior complexity with guaranteed convergence and generalization error. Extensive experiments show that pFedGate achieves superior global accuracy, individual accuracy and efficiency simultaneously over state-of-the-art methods, by up to 4.53\\% accuracy improvement and 12x smaller model size. We also demonstrate that pFedGate performs better than competitors in the novel clients participation and partial clients participation scenarios, and can learn meaningful sparse local models adapted to different data distributions."}}

Nowadays, estimating causal effect from observational data has become an appealing research direction owing to the large amount of available data and low budget requirement, compared with randomized controlled trials. Embraced with the rapidly developed machine learning area, various causal effect estimation methods for observational data have sprung up. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of causal inference methods under the potential outcome framework, one of the well-known causal inference frameworks. The methods are divided into two categories depending on whether they require all three assumptions of the potential outcome framework or not. For each category, both the traditional statistical methods and the recent machine learning enhanced methods are discussed and compared. The plausible applications of these methods are also presented, including the applications in advertising, recommendation, medicine, and so on. Moreover, the commonly used benchmark datasets as well as the open-source codes are also summarized, which facilitate researchers and practitioners to explore, evaluate and apply the causal inference methods."}}

Among different fairness definitions, path-specific causal fairness is a widely adopted one with great potentials, as it distinguishes the fair and unfair effects that the sensitive attributes exert on algorithm predictions. Existing methods based on path-specific causal fairness either require graph structure as the prior knowledge or have high complexity in the calculation of path-specific effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel casual graph based fair prediction framework, which integrates graph structure learning into fair prediction to ensure that unfair pathways are excluded in the causal graph. Furthermore, we generalize the proposed framework to the scenarios where sensitive attributes can be non-root nodes and affected by other variables, which is commonly observed in real-world applications but hardly addressed by existing works. We provide theoretical analysis on the generalization bound for the proposed fair prediction method, and conduct a series of experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate that the proposed framework can provide better prediction performance and algorithm fairness trade-off.

Existing ITE estimation methods mainly focus on balancing the distributions of control and treated groups, but ignore the local similarity information that is helpful. In this paper, we propose a local similarity preserved individual treatment effect (SITE) estimation method based on deep representation learning. SITE preserves local similarity and balances data distributions simultaneously, by focusing on several hard samples in each mini-batch. Experimental results on synthetic and three real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed SITE method, compared with the state-of-the-art ITE estimation methods."}}
