By considering the functional correspondences between object parts, we conceptualize functional actions, such as pouring and constrained placing, as combinations of different correspondence constraints. CPM comprises a collection of composable diffusion models, where each model captures a different inter-object correspondence. These diffusion models can generate parameters for manipulation skills based on the specific object parts. Leveraging part-based correspondences coupled with the task decomposition into distinct constraints enables strong generalization to novel objects and object categories. We validate our approach in both simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving robust and generalized manipulation capabilities."}}

Previous methods primarily rely on hand-engineering or learning generators for specific constraint types and then rejecting the value assignments when other constraints are violated. By contrast, our model, the compositional diffusion continuous constraint solver (Diffusion-CCSP) derives global solutions to CCSPs by representing them as factor graphs and combining the energies of diffusion models trained to sample for individual constraint types. Diffusion-CCSP exhibits strong generalization to novel combinations of known constraints, and it can be integrated into a task and motion planner to devise long-horizon plans that include actions with both discrete and continuous parameters."}}

Additionally, we can flexibly combine various skills to devise long-term plans. In this paper, we present a framework that enables machines to acquire such manipulation skills, referred to as \"mechanisms,'' through a single demonstration and self-play. Our key insight lies in interpreting each demonstration as a sequence of changes in robot-object and object-object contact modes, which provides a scaffold for learning detailed samplers for continuous parameters. These learned mechanisms and samplers can be seamlessly integrated into standard task and motion planners, enabling their compositional use."}}

We formulate this problem as a sequential prediction task: at each step, our model reads the manual, locates the components to be added to the current shape, and infers their 3D poses. This task poses the challenge of establishing a 2D-3D correspondence between the manual image and the real 3D object, and 3D pose estimation for unseen 3D objects, since a new component to be added in a step can be an object built from previous steps. To address these two challenges, we present a novel learning-based framework, the Manual-to-Executable-Plan Network (MEPNet), which reconstructs the assembly steps from a sequence of manual images. The key idea is to integrate neural 2D keypoint detection modules and 2D-3D projection algorithms for high-precision prediction and strong generalization to unseen components. The MEPNet outperforms existing methods on three newly collected LEGO manual datasets and a Minecraft house dataset."}}

Towards this goal, recent works have integrated semantic representations from large-scale pretrained vision-language (VL) models into manipulation models, imparting them with more general reasoning capabilities. However, we show that the conventional {\\it pretraining-finetuning} pipeline for integrating such representations entangles the learning of domain-specific action information and domain-general visual information, leading to less data-efficient training and poor generalization to unseen objects and tasks. To this end, we propose \\ours, a {\\it modular} approach to better leverage pretrained VL models by exploiting the syntactic and semantic structures of language instructions. Our framework uses a semantic parser to recover an executable program, composed of functional modules grounded on vision and action across different modalities. Each functional module is realized as a combination of deterministic computation and learnable neural networks. Program execution produces parameters to general manipulation primitives for a robotic end-effector. The entire modular network can be trained with end-to-end imitation learning objectives. Experiments show that our model successfully disentangles action and perception, translating to improved zero-shot and compositional generalization in a variety of manipulation behaviors.

Specifically, we focus on how HyperGNNs can learn from finite datasets and generalize structurally to graph reasoning problems of arbitrary input sizes.  Our first contribution is a fine-grained analysis of the expressiveness of HyperGNNs, that is, the set of functions that they can realize. Our result is a hierarchy of problems they can solve, defined in terms of various hyperparameters such as depths and edge arities. Next, we analyze the learning properties of these neural networks, especially focusing on how they can be trained on a finite set of small graphs and generalize to larger graphs, which we term structural generalization. Our theoretical results are further supported by the empirical results.\n"}}

In this paper, we present an approach for learning to solve problems of this kind in large, real-world domains, using sparse and local hypergraph neural networks (SpaLoc). SpaLoc is motivated by two observations from traditional logic-based reasoning: relational inferences usually apply locally (i.e., involve only a small number of individuals), and relations are usually sparse (i.e., only hold for a small percentage of tuples in a domain). We exploit these properties to make learning and inference efficient in very large domains by (1) using a sparse tensor representation for hypergraph neural networks, (2) applying a sparsification loss during training to encourage sparse representations, and (3) subsampling based on a novel information sufficiency\u2013based sampling process during training. SpaLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance on several real-world, large-scale knowledge graph reasoning benchmarks, and is the first framework for applying hypergraph neural networks on real-world knowledge graphs with more than 10k nodes."}}

LORL builds upon recent advances in unsupervised object discovery and segmentation, notably MONet and Slot Attention. While these algorithms learn an object-centric representation just by reconstructing the input image, LORL enables them to further learn to associate the learned representations to concepts, i.e., words for object categories, properties, and spatial relationships, from language input. These object-centric concepts derived from language facilitate the learning of object-centric representations. LORL can be integrated with various unsupervised object discovery algorithms that are language-agnostic. Experiments show that the integration of LORL consistently improves the performance of unsupervised object discovery methods on two datasets via the help of language. We also show that concepts learned by LORL, in conjunction with object discovery methods, aid downstream tasks such as referring expression comprehension."}}

HandMeThat contains 10,000 episodes of human-robot interactions. In each episode, the robot first observes a trajectory of human actions towards her internal goal. Next, the robot receives a human instruction and should take actions to accomplish the subgoal set through the instruction. \nIn this paper, we present a textual interface for our benchmark, where the robot interacts with a virtual environment through textual commands. We evaluate several baseline models on HandMeThat, and show that both offline and online reinforcement learning algorithms perform poorly on HandMeThat, suggesting significant room for future work on physical and social human-robot communications and interactions."}}

However, most existing physical and causal reasoning benchmarks are exclusively based on synthetically generated events and synthetic natural language descriptions of the causal relationships. This design brings up two issues. First, there is a lack of diversity in both event types and natural language descriptions; second, causal relationships based on manually-defined heuristics are different from human judgments. To address both shortcomings, we present the CLEVRER-Humans benchmark, a video reasoning dataset for causal judgment of physical events with human labels. We employ two techniques to improve data collection efficiency: first, a novel iterative event cloze task to elicit a new representation of events in videos, which we term Causal Event Graphs (CEGs); second, a data augmentation technique based on neural language generative models. We convert the collected CEGs into questions and answers to be consistent with prior work. Finally, we study a collection of baseline approaches for CLEVRER-Humans question-answering, highlighting great challenges set forth by our benchmark."}}
