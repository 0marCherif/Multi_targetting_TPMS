As one of the key components for GNN design is to select a tailored spectral filter, we take the first step towards analyzing anomalies via the lens of the graph spectrum. Our crucial observation is the existence of anomalies will lead to the `right-shift' phenomenon, that is, the spectral energy distribution concentrates less on low frequencies and more on high frequencies. This fact motivates us to propose the Beta Wavelet Graph Neural Network (BWGNN). Indeed, BWGNN has spectral and spatial localized band-pass filters to better handle the `right-shift' phenomenon in anomalies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BWGNN on four large-scale anomaly detection datasets."}}

Our analysis is based on the observation that the GW problem satisfies the Luo-Tseng error bound condition, which relates to estimating the distance of a point to the critical point set of the GW problem based on the optimality residual.\nThis observation allows us to provide an approximation bound for the distance between the fixed-point set of BAPG and the critical point set of GW. Moreover, under a mild  technical assumption, we can  show that BAPG converges to its fixed point set.\nThe effectiveness of BAPG has been validated through comprehensive numerical experiments in graph alignment and partition tasks, where it outperforms existing methods in terms of both solution quality and wall-clock time."}}

Different from early researches that needed to rely on extra human resources and expertise to build the system, recent researches focused on how to build DSMD in a data-driven manner. However, the previous data-driven DSMD methods largely overlooked the system interpretability, which is critical for a medical application, and they also suffered from the data sparsity issue at the same time. In this paper, we explore how to bring interpretability to data-driven DSMD. Specifically, we propose a more interpretable decision process to implement the dialogue manager of DSMD by reasonably mimicking real doctors' inquiry logics, and we devise a model with highly transparent components to conduct the inference. Moreover, we collect a new DSMD dataset, which has a much larger scale, more diverse patterns, and is of higher quality than the existing ones. The experiments show that our method obtains 7.7%, 10.0%, 3.0% absolute improvement in diagnosis accuracy respectively on three datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of its rational decision process and model design. Our codes and the GMD-12 dataset are available at https://github.com/lwgkzl/BR-Agent."}}
