Meanwhile, there exists tremendous knowledge curated by humans in the text format describing proteins' high-level properties. Yet, whether the incorporation of such text data can help protein design tasks has not been explored. To bridge this gap, we propose ProteinDT, a multi-modal framework that leverages textual descriptions for protein design. ProteinDT consists of three subsequent steps: ProteinCLAP that aligns the representation of two modalities, a facilitator that generates the protein representation from the text modality, and a decoder that generates the protein sequences from the representation. To train ProteinDT, we construct a large dataset, SwissProtCLAP, with 441K text and protein pairs. We empirically verify the effectiveness of ProteinDT from three aspects: (1) consistently superior performance on four out of six protein property prediction benchmarks; (2) over 90% accuracy for text-guided protein generation; and (3) promising results for zero-shot text-guided protein editing."}}

Designing novel proteins with specific structures and desired functions has been a long-standing challenge in the field of bioengineering. Existing approaches generate both protein sequence and structure using either autoregressive models or diffusion models, both of which suffer from high inference costs. In this paper, we propose a new approach capable of protein sequence and structure co-design, which iteratively translates both protein sequence and structure into the desired state from random initialization, based on context features given a priori. Our model consists of a trigonometry-aware encoder that reasons geometrical constraints and interactions from context features, and a roto-translation equivariant decoder that translates protein sequence and structure interdependently. Notably, all protein amino acids are updated in one shot in each translation step, which significantly accelerates the inference process. Experimental results across multiple tasks show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin, and is able to design proteins of high fidelity as regards both sequence and structure, with running time orders of magnitude less than sampling-based methods."}}

Such understandings can open up a unified perspective and provide guidelines for essential tasks like controllable generation. In this paper, we first examine the representation space of the recent deep generative model trained for graph data, observing that the learned representation space is not perfectly disentangled. Based on this observation, we then propose an unsupervised method called GraphCG, which is model-agnostic and task-agnostic for discovering steerable factors in graph data. Specifically, GraphCG learns the semantic-rich directions via maximizing the corresponding mutual information, where the edited graph along the same direction will possess certain steerable factors. We conduct experiments on two types of graph data, molecular graphs and point clouds. Both the quantitative and qualitative results show the effectiveness of GraphCG for discovering steerable factors. The code will be public in the near future.\n"}}

However, existing works use machine learning to mainly utilize the chemical structures of molecules yet ignore the vast textual knowledge available in chemistry. Incorporating textual knowledge enables us to realize new drug design objectives, adapt to text-based instructions, and predict complex biological activities. We present a multi-modal molecule structure-text model, MoleculeSTM, by jointly learning molecule's chemical structures and textual descriptions via a contrastive learning strategy. To train MoleculeSTM, we construct the largest multi-modal dataset to date, namely PubChemSTM, with over 280K chemical structure-text pairs. To demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of MoleculeSTM, we design two challenging zero-shot tasks based on text instructions, including structure-text retrieval and molecule editing. MoleculeSTM possesses two main properties: open vocabulary and compositionality via natural language. In experiments, MoleculeSTM obtains the state-of-the-art generalization ability to novel biochemical concepts across various benchmarks."}}
