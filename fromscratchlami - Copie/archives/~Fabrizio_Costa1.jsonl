Since different types of interactions between genes yield distinct gene networks, there is the need to integrate different heterogeneous sources to improve the reliability of prioritization systems.\nResults\nWe propose an approach based on three phases: first, we merge all sources in a single network, then we partition the integrated network according to edge density introducing a notion of edge type to distinguish the parts and finally, we employ a novel node kernel suitable for graphs with typed edges. We show how the node kernel can generate a large number of discriminative features that can be efficiently processed by linear regularized machine learning classifiers. We report state-of-the-art results on 12 disease\u2013gene associations and on a time-stamped benchmark containing 42 newly discovered associations."}}

We benchmark GraphProt, demonstrating that the modeled binding preferences conform to the literature, and showcase the biological relevance and two applications of GraphProt models. First, estimated binding affinities correlate with experimental measurements. Second, predicted Ago2 targets display higher levels of expression upon Ago2 knockdown, whereas control targets do not. Computational binding models, such as those provided by GraphProt, are essential for predicting RBP binding sites and affinities in all tissues.

The new feature mapping is efficient in space and time, and provides a metric transformation that is non parametric and not implicit in nature (i.e. not expressed via a kernel matrix), nor limited to the transductive setup. The main advantage of the proposed mapping lies in its flexibility to adapt to several types of learning tasks ranging from regression to multi-label classification, and to deal in a natural way with missing values. Finally, we provide an extensive empirical study of the properties of the learned feature representation over real and artificial datasets."}}

We present ShaKer to predict SHAPE data for RNA using a graph-kernel-based machine learning approach that is trained on experimental SHAPE information. While other available methods require a manually curated reference structure, ShaKer predicts reactivity data based on sequence input only and by sampling the ensemble of possible structures. Thus, ShaKer is well placed to enable experiment-driven, transcriptome-wide SHAPE data prediction to enable the study of RNA structuredness and to improve RNA structure and RNA\u2013RNA interaction prediction. For performance evaluation, we use accuracy and accessibility comparing to experimental SHAPE data and competing methods. We can show that Shaker outperforms its competitors and is able to predict high quality SHAPE annotations even when no reference structure is provided."}}

As a consequence, a high number of disease gene prioritization methods have been proposed. Among them, graph-based methods are the most promising paradigms due to their ability to naturally represent many types of relations using a graph representation. One key factor of success of graph-based learning methods is the definition of a proper graph node similarity measure normally measured by graph node kernels. However, most approaches share two common limitations: first, they are based on the diffusion phenomenon which does not effectively exploit the nodes\u2019 context; second, they are not able to process the auxiliary information associated to graph nodes. In this paper, we propose an efficient graph node kernel, based on graph decompositions, that not only is able to effectively take into account nodes\u2019 context, but also to exploit additional information available on graph nodes. The key idea is to learn and generalize from small network fragments present in the neighborhood of genes of interest. An empirical evaluation on several biological databases shows that our proposal achieves state-of-the-art results."}}
