These classifiers must be fair and avoid discriminatory decisions by being invariant to perturbations of sensitive attributes such as gender or ethnicity. However, there is a gap between human intuition about these perturbations and the formal similarity specifications capturing them. While existing research has started to address this gap, current methods are based on hardcoded word replacements, resulting in specifications with limited expressivity or ones that fail to fully align with human intuition (e.g., in cases of asymmetric counterfactuals). This work proposes novel methods for bridging this gap by discovering expressive and intuitive individual fairness specifications. We show how to leverage unsupervised style transfer and GPT-3's zero-shot capabilities to automatically generate expressive candidate pairs of semantically similar sentences that differ along sensitive attributes. We then validate the generated pairs via an extensive crowdsourcing study, which confirms that a lot of these pairs align with human intuition about fairness in toxicity classification. We also show how limited amounts of human feedback can be leveraged to learn a similarity specification."}}

For example, to learn a model for deciding whom to give a loan, the available training data includes individuals who were given a loan in the past, but not those who were not. This missingness, if ignored, nullifies any fairness guarantee of the training procedure when the model is deployed. Using causal graphs, we characterize the missingness mechanisms in different real-world scenarios. We show conditions under which various distributions, used in popular fairness algorithms, can or can not be recovered from the training data. Our theoretical results imply that many of these algorithms can not guarantee fairness in practice. Modeling missingness also helps to identify correct design principles for fair algorithms. For example, in multi-stage settings where decisions are made in multiple screening rounds, we use our framework to derive the minimal distributions required to design a fair algorithm. Our proposed algorithm decentralizes the decision-making process and still achieves similar performance to the optimal algorithm that requires centralization and non-recoverable distributions."}}

As shown by a recent study under controlled settings, reputation systems can eliminate social biases on these platforms by building trust between the users. However, for this to work in practice, the reputation systems must themselves be non-discriminatory. In fact, a biased reputation system will further reinforce the bias and create a vicious feedback loop. Given that the reputation scores are generally aggregates of ratings provided by human users to one another, it is not surprising that the scores often inherit the human bias. In this paper, we address the problem of making reputation systems on sharing economy platforms more fair and unbiased. We show that a game-theoretical incentive mechanism can be used to encourage users to go against common bias and provide a truthful rating about others, obtained through a more careful and deeper evaluation. In situations where an incentive mechanism can\u2019t be implemented, we show that a simple post-processing approach can also be used to correct bias in the reputation scores, while minimizing the loss in the useful information provided by the scores. We evaluate the proposed solution on synthetic and real datasets from Airbnb."}}

Furthermore, we discuss the relative saving that can be achieved by the mechanism, compared to the rational outcome, if no such mechanism was implemented. Our work is motivated by distributed platforms, where decentralized data oracles collect information about real-world events, based on the aggregate information provided by often self-interested participants. We compare our theoretical observations with numerical simulations on two public real datasets."}}

However, these systems often rely on a trusted third party (oracle) to get correct information about the real-world events, which trigger the financial transactions. In this paper, we identify two biggest challenges in building decentralized, trustless and transparent oracles. The first challenge is acquiring correct information about the real-world events without relying on a trusted information provider. We show how a peer-consistency incentive mechanism can be used to acquire truthful information from an untrusted and self-interested crowd, even when the crowd has outside incentives to provide wrong informations. The second is a system design and implementation challenge. For the first time, we show how to implement a trustless and transparent oracle in Ethereum. We discuss various non-trivial issues that arise in implementing peer-consistency mechanisms in Ethereum, suggest several optimizations to reduce gas cost and provide empirical analysis."}}

The other classic mechanism is to have the workers solve some gold standard tasks and pay them according to their accuracy on gold tasks. This mechanism ensures stronger incentive compatibility than the peer based mechanisms but assigning gold tasks to all workers becomes inefficient at large scale. We propose a novel mechanism that assigns gold tasks to only a few workers and exploits transitivity to derive accuracy of the rest of the workers from their peers\u2019 accuracy. We show that the resulting mechanism ensures a dominant notion of incentive compatibility and fairness."}}

In this work, we address the problem of fair and diverse data collection from a crowd under budget constraints. We propose a novel algorithm which maximizes the expected accuracy of the collected data, while ensuring that the errors satisfy desired notions of fairness. We provide guarantees on the performance of our algorithm and show that the algorithm performs well in practice through experiments on a real dataset."}}

Data-centric synchronization complements function-centric synchronization based on using stale updates to increase the throughput of distributed ML computations. Experiments to validate our framework suggest that we can attain substantial improvement over BSP while guaranteeing sequential correctness of ML tasks."}}
