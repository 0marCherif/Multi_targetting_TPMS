However, most OoD detection methods are evaluated on a standard set of datasets, arbitrarily different from training data. There is no clear definition of what forms a ``good\" OoD dataset. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art OoD detection methods already achieve near perfect results on these standard benchmarks. In this paper, we define 2 categories of OoD data using the subtly different concepts of perceptual/visual and semantic similarity to in-distribution (iD) data. We define Near OoD samples as perceptually similar but semantically different from iD samples, and Shifted samples as points which are visually different but semantically akin to iD data. We then propose a GAN based framework for generating OoD samples from each of these 2 categories, given an iD dataset. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, we show that a) state-of-the-art OoD detection methods which perform exceedingly well on conventional benchmarks are significantly less robust to our proposed benchmark. Moreover, b) models performing well on our setup also perform well on conventional real-world OoD detection benchmarks and vice versa, thereby indicating that one might not even need a separate OoD set, to reliably evaluate performance in OoD detection."}}

Known as Test-Time Adaptation, most prior work studying this task follows two assumptions in their evaluation where (1) test samples come together as a large batch, and (2) all from a single test distribution. However, in practice, these two assumptions may not stand, the reasons for which we propose two new evaluation settings where batch sizes are arbitrary and multiple distributions are considered. Unlike the previous methods that require a large batch of single distribution during test time to calculate stable batch-norm statistics, our method avoid any dependency on large online batches and is able to estimate accurate batch-norm statistics with a single sample. The proposed method significantly outperforms the State-Of-The-Art in the newly proposed settings in Test-Time Adaptation Task and also demonstrates improvements in various other settings such as Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and Zero-Shot Classification."}}

Unlike prior methods that focus on detecting low-level artifacts generated during the manipulation process, we use an image retrieval approach to tackle this problem. When given a spliced query image, our goal is to retrieve the original image from a database of authentic images. To achieve this goal, we propose representing an image by its constituent objects based on the intuition that the finest granularity of manipulations is oftentimes at the object-level. We introduce a framework, object embeddings for spliced image retrieval (OE-SIR), that utilizes modern object detectors to localize object regions. Each region is then embedded and collectively used to represent the image. Further, we propose a student-teacher training paradigm for learning discriminative embeddings within object regions to avoid expensive multiple forward passes. Detailed analysis of the efficacy of different feature embedding models is also provided in this study. Extensive experimental results show that the OE-SIR achieves state-of-the-art performance in spliced image retrieval."}}

In this paper, we investigate k-Nearest-Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers, a classical model-free learning method from the pre-deep learning era, as an augmentation to modern neural network based approaches. As a lazy learning method, k-NN simply aggregates the distance between the test image and top-k neighbors in a training set. We adopt k-NN with pre-trained visual representations produced by either supervised or self-supervised methods in two steps: (1) Leverage k-NN predicted probabilities as indications for easy vs. hard examples during training. (2) Linearly interpolate the k-NN predicted distribution with that of the augmented classifier. Via extensive experiments on a wide range of classification tasks, our study reveals the generality and flexibility of k-NN integration with additional insights: (1) k-NN achieves competitive results, sometimes even outperforming a standard linear classifier. (2) Incorporating k-NN is especially beneficial for tasks where parametric classifiers perform poorly and / or in low-data regimes. We hope these discoveries will encourage people to rethink the role of pre-deep learning, classical methods in computer vision. Our code is available at: https://github.com/KMnP/nn-revisit."}}

The advent of image sharing platforms and the easy availability of advanced photo editing software have resulted in a large quantities of manipulated images being shared on the internet. While the intent behind such manipulations varies widely, concerns on the spread of false news and misinformation is growing. Current state of the art methods for detecting these manipulated images suffers from the lack of training data due to the laborious labeling process. We address this problem in this paper, for which we introduce a manipulated image generation process that creates true positives using currently available datasets. Drawing from traditional work on image blending, we propose a novel generator for creating such examples. In addition, we also propose to further create examples that force the algorithm to focus on boundary artifacts during training. Strong experimental results validate our proposal."}}
