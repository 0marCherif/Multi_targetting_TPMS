How noncoding DNA determines gene expression in different cell types is a major unsolved problem, and critical downstream applications in human genetics depend on improved solutions. Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from DNA sequence through the use of a new deep learning architecture called Enformer that is able to integrate long-range interactions (up to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Notably, Enformer outperformed the best team on the critical assessment of genome interpretation (CAGI5) challenge for noncoding variant interpretation with no additional training. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict promoter-enhancer interactions directly from DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of growing human disease associations to cell-type-specific gene regulatory mechanisms and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution. To foster these downstream applications, we have made the pre-trained Enformer model openly available, and provide pre-computed effect predictions for all common variants in the 1000 Genomes dataset."}}

Here, we present scNym, a semi-supervised, adversarial neural network that learns to transfer cell identity annotations from one experiment to another. scNym takes advantage of information in both labeled datasets and new, unlabeled datasets to learn rich representations of cell identity that enable effective annotation transfer. We show that scNym effectively transfers annotations across experiments despite biological and technical differences, achieving performance superior to existing methods. We also show that scNym models can synthesize information from multiple training and target datasets to improve performance. In addition to high performance, we show that scNym models are well-calibrated and interpretable with saliency methods."}}

While the human genome has been extensively annotated and studied, model organisms have been less explored. Model organism genomes offer both additional training sequences and unique annotations describing tissue and cell states unavailable in humans. Here, we develop a strategy to train deep convolutional neural networks simultaneously on multiple genomes and apply it to learn sequence predictors for large compendia of human and mouse data. Training on both genomes improves gene expression prediction accuracy on held out sequences. We further demonstrate a novel and powerful transfer learning approach to use mouse regulatory models to analyze human genetic variants associated with molecular phenotypes and disease. Together these techniques unleash thousands of non-human epigenetic and transcriptional profiles toward more effective investigation of how gene regulation affects human disease."}}

However, current methods often result in two or more cells that share the same cell-identifying barcode; these \u201cdoublets\u201d violate the fundamental premise of single cell technology and can lead to incorrect inferences. Here, we describe Solo, a semi-supervised deep learning approach that identifies doublets with greater accuracy than existing methods. Solo can be applied in combination with experimental doublet detection methods to further purify scRNA-seq data to true single cells beyond any previous approach."}}

Representations learned by Akita underscore the importance of CTCF and reveal a complex grammar underlying genome folding. Akita enables rapid in silico predictions for sequence mutagenesis, genome folding across species, and genetic variants."}}
