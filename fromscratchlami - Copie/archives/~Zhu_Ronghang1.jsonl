Unlike existing 3D face reconstruction methods, our proposed method directly regresses dense 3D face shapes from single 2D images, and tackles identity and residual (i.e., non-identity) components in 3D face shapes explicitly and separately based on a composite 3D face shape model with latent representations. We devise a training process for the proposed network with a joint loss measuring both face identification error and 3D face shape reconstruction error. We develop a multi image 3D morphable model (3DMM) fitting method for multiple 2D images of a subject to construct training data. Comprehensive experiments have been done on MICC, BU3DFE, LFW and YTF databases. The results show that our method expands the capacity of 3DMM for capturing discriminative shape features and facial detail, and thus outperforms existing methods both in 3D face reconstruction accuracy and in face recognition accuracy."}}

DG leverages multiple source domains for model training, while single domain generalization (SDG) further restricts such setting by exploiting only a single source domain. Nevertheless, both DG and SDG assume that the source domains are fully labeled, which might not be practical in many real world scenarios. In this paper, we present a new problem, i.e., semi-supervised single domain generalization (SS-SDG), which aims to train a model with a partially labeled single source domain to generalize to multiple unseen testing domains. We propose an effective framework to address this problem. In particular, we design a label-free adversarial data augmentation strategy to diversify the source domain, and propose a novel multi-pair FixMatch loss to generalize classifiers to unseen testing domains. Extensive experiments on OfficeHome, PACS and DomainNet20 datasets show that our method surpasses the latest SDG and semi-supervised methods. Moreover, on PACS and DomainNet20, our method approaches the fully supervised ERM upper bound within $5\\%$ gap, but only uses less than $8\\%$ of the labels."}}

Traditional domain generalization or adaptation methods cannot directly work since there is no sufficient target domain distribution serving as the transfer object. The multi-source setting further prevents the transfer task as excessive domain gap introduced from all the source domains. To tackle this problem, we newly propose a progressive mix-up (P-Mixup) mechanism to introduce an intermediate mix-up domain, pushing both the source domains and the few-shot target domain aligned to this mix-up domain. Further by enforcing the mix-up domain to progressively move towards the source domains, we achieve the domain transfer from multi-source domains to the single one-shot target domain. Our P-Mixup is different from traditional mix-up that ours is with a progressive and adaptive mix-up ratio, following the curriculum learning spirit to better align the source and target domains. Moreover, our P-Mixup combines both pixel-level and feature-level mix-up to better enrich the data diversity. Experiments on two benchmarks show that our P-Mixup significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, i.e., 6.0\\% and 6.8\\% improvements on Office-Home and DomainNet."}}

Typical SDG methods are based on the adversarial data augmentation strategy, which complements the diversity of source domain to learn a robust model. Existing SDG methods require the source and target domains to have the same label space. However, as target domains may contain novel categories unseen in source label space, this assumption is not practical in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a challenging and untouched problem: \\textit{Open-Set Single Domain Generalization} (OS-SDG), where target domains include unseen categories out of source label space. The goal of OS-SDG is to learn a model, with only one source domain, to classify a target sample with correct class if it belongs to source label space, or assign it to unknown classes. We design a \\textit{CrossMatch} approach to improve the performance of SDG methods on identifying unknown classes by leveraging a multi-binary classifier. CrossMatch generates auxiliary samples out of source label space by using an adversarial data augmentation strategy. We also adopt a consistency regularization on generated auxiliary samples between multi-binary classifiers and the model trained by SDG methods, to improve the model\u2019s capability on unknown class identification. Experimental results on benchmark datasets prove the effectiveness of CrossMatch on enhancing the performance of SDG methods in the OS-SDG setting."}}

However, when the classes in source and target domains are imbalanced, most existing UDA methods experience significant performance drop, as the decision boundary usually favors the majority classes. Some recent class-imbalanced domain adaptation (CDA) methods aim to tackle the challenge of biased label distribution by exploiting pseudo-labeled target data during training process. However, these methods may be challenged with the problem of unreliable pseudo labels and error accumulation during training. In this paper, we propose a pairwise adversarial training approach to augment training data for unsupervised class-imbalanced domain adaptation. Unlike conventional adversarial training in which the adversarial samples are obtained from the $\\ell_p$ ball of the original data, we obtain the semantic adversarial samples from the interpolated line of the aligned pair-wise samples from source domain and target domain. Experimental results and ablation study show that our method can achieve considerable improvements on the CDA benchmarks compared with the state-of-art methods focusing on the same problem.\n"}}

To reduce discrepancy between source and target domains, adversarial learning methods are typically selected to seek domain-invariant representations by confusing the domain discriminator. However, classifiers may not be well adapted to such a domain-invariant representation space, as the sample-level and class-level data structures could be distorted during adversarial learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Transferable Feature Learning approach on Graphs (TFLG) for unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation, which jointly incorporates sample-level and class-level structure information across two domains. TFLG first constructs graphs for mini-batch samples, and identifies the class-wise correspondence across domains. A novel cross-domain graph convolutional operation is designed to jointly align the sample-level and class-level structures in two domains. Moreover, a memory bank is designed to further exploit the class-level information. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, compared to the representative unsupervised domain adaptation methods."}}
