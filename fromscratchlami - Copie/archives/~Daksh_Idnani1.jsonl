Nullspace occupancy as a mechanism for out of distribution failure", "abstract": "Out of distribution (OoD) generalization has received considerable interest in recent years. In this work, we identify a particular failure mode of OoD generalization for discriminative classifiers that is based on test data (from a new domain) lying in the nullspace of features learnt from source data. We demonstrate the existence of this failure mode across multiple networks trained across RotatedMNIST, PACS, TerraIncognita, DomainNet and ImageNet-R datasets. We then study different choices for characterizing the feature space and show that projecting intermediate representations onto the span of directions that obtain maximum training accuracy provides consistent improvements in OoD performance. Finally, we show that such nullspace behavior also provides an insight into neural networks trained on poisoned data. We hope our work galvanizes interest in the relationship between the nullspace occupancy failure mode and generalization."}}

We show that the implicit regularization coming from training with Stochastic Gradient Descent with a high learning-rate and small batch size plays an important role in learning minimal sufficient representations for the task. In the process of arriving at a minimal sufficient representation, we find that the content of the representation changes dynamically during training. In particular, we find that semantically meaningful but ultimately irrelevant information is encoded in the early transient dynamics of training, before being later discarded. In addition, we evaluate how perturbing the initial part of training impacts the learning dynamics and the resulting representations. We show these effects on both perceptual decision-making tasks inspired by neuroscience literature, as well as on standard image classification tasks."}}

We use this to characterize the transient dynamics of deep neural networks on perceptual decision-making tasks inspired by neuroscience literature. In particular, we show that both the random initialization and the implicit regularization from Stochastic Gradient Descent play an important role in learning minimal sufficient representations for the task. If the network is not randomly initialized, we show that the training may not recover an optimal representation, increasing the chance of overfitting."}}
