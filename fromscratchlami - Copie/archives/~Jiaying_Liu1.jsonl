Inspired by the dynamic deep networks that adapt the model structures or parameters conditioned on the inputs, we propose a DCP-guided hierarchical dynamic mechanism for image enhancement to adapt the model parameters and features from local to global as well as to keep spatial adjacency within the region. Specifically, channel-spatial-level, structure-level, and region-level dynamic components are sequentially applied. Channel-spatial-level dynamics obtain channel- and spatial-wise representation variations, and structure-level dynamics enable modeling geometric transformations and augment sampling locations for the varying local features to better describe the structures. In addition, a novel region-level dynamic is proposed to generate spatially continuous masks for dynamic features which capitalizes on the Dark Channel Priors (DCP). The proposed region-level dynamics benefit from exploiting the statistical differences between distorted and undistorted images. Moreover, the DCP-guided region generations are inherently spatial coherent which facilitates capturing local coherence of the images. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and generates visually pleasing images for multiple enhancement tasks,i.e. , image dehazing, image deraining and low-light image enhancement.

Moreover, dehazing performance of the learned model may deteriorate significantly when the training hazy-clean image pairs are insufficient and are different from real hazy images in applications. In this paper, we show that exploiting large scale training set and adapting to real hazy images are two critical issues in learning effective deep dehazing models. Under the depth guidance estimated by a well-trained depth estimation network, we leverage the conventional atmospheric scattering model to generate massive hazy-clean image pairs for the self-supervised pre-training of dehazing network. Furthermore, self-supervised adaptation is presented to adapt pre-trained network to real hazy images. Learning without forgetting strategy is also deployed in self-supervised adaptation by combining self-supervision and model adaptation via contrastive learning. Experiments show that our proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods, and is quite efficient, i.e., handling a 4K image in 23 ms.

Since sketches are difficult to collect, previous methods mainly use edge maps instead of sketches to train models (referred to as edge-based models). However, sketches display great structural discrepancy with edge maps, thus failing edge-based models. Moreover, sketches often demonstrate huge variety among different users, demanding even higher generalizability and robustness for the editing model to work. In this paper, we propose Deep Plastic Surgery, a novel, robust and controllable image editing framework that allows users to interactively edit images using hand-drawn sketch inputs. We present a sketch refinement strategy, as inspired by the coarse-to-fine drawing process of the artists, which we show can help our model well adapt to casual and varied sketches without the need for real sketch training data. Our model further provides a refinement level control parameter that enables users to flexibly define how ``reliable'' the input sketch should be considered for the final output, balancing between sketch faithfulness and output verisimilitude (as the two goals might contradict if the input sketch is drawn poorly). To achieve the multi-level refinement, we introduce a style-based module for level conditioning, which allows adaptive feature representations for different levels in a singe network. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in improving the visual quality and user controllablity of image editing over the state-of-the-art methods."}}

The major component in Local Vision Transformer, local attention, performs the attention separately over small local windows. We rephrase local attention as a channel-wise locally-connected layer and analyze it from two network regularization manners, sparse connectivity and weight sharing, as well as dynamic weight computation. We point out that local attention resembles depth-wise convolution and its dynamic variants in sparse connectivity: there is no connection across channels, and each position is connected to the positions within a small local window. The main differences lie in (i) weight sharing - depth-wise convolution shares connection weights (kernel weights) across spatial positions and attention shares the connection weights across channels, and (ii) dynamic weight computation manners - local attention is based on dot-products between pairwise positions in the local window, and dynamic convolution is based on linear projections conducted on the center representation or the globally pooled representation. The connection between local attention and dynamic depth-wise convolution is empirically verified by the ablation study about weight sharing and dynamic weight computation in Local Vision Transformer and (dynamic) depth-wise convolution. We empirically observe that the models based on depth-wise convolution and the dynamic variants with lower computation complexity perform on-par with or slightly better than Swin Transformer, an instance of Local Vision Transformer, for ImageNet classification, COCO object detection and ADE semantic segmentation.

Rather than employing the fixed pair of target text and source style images, our unsupervised framework establishes an implicit mapping for them by using an abstract imagery of the style image as bridges. Based on the mapping, we progressively narrow the visual discrepancy between text and style images by the proposed legibility-preserving structure transfer and texture transfer algorithms, which effectively balance the text legibility and style consistency. Furthermore, we explore a seamless composition of the stylized text and a background image, in which the optimal text layout is determined by a context-aware layout design algorithm utilizing cues for both seamlessness and aesthetics. Given the layout, the text can be seamlessly embedded into the background by texture synthesis under a context-aware boundary constraint. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for automatic artistic typography creation over state-of-the-art style transfer methods. In addition, we validate the effectiveness of our algorithm with extensive experiments on various tasks, such as visual-textual presentation synthesis and symbol rendering."}}

Recent style transfer methods have considered texture control to enhance usability. However, controlling the stylistic degree in terms of shape deformation remains an important open challenge. In this paper, we present the first text style transfer network that allows for real-time control of the crucial stylistic degree of the glyph through an adjustable parameter. Our key contribution is a novel bidirectional shape matching framework to establish an effective glyph-style mapping at various deformation levels without paired ground truth. Based on this idea, we propose a scale-controllable module to empower a single network to continuously characterize the multi-scale shape features of the style image and transfer these features to the target text. The proposed method demonstrates its superiority over previous state-of-the-arts in generating diverse, controllable and high-quality stylized text.\n"}}

However, previous style transfer methods either study the model for general style, which cannot handle the highly-structured text effects along the glyph, or require manual design of subtle matching criteria for text effects. In this paper, we focus on the use of the powerful representation abilities of deep neural features for text effects transfer. For this purpose, we propose a novel Texture Effects Transfer GAN (TET-GAN), which consists of a stylization subnetwork and a destylization subnetwork. The key idea is to train our network to accomplish both the objective of style transfer and style removal, so that it can learn to disentangle and recombine the content and style features of text effects images. To support the training of our network, we propose a new text effects dataset with as much as 64 professionally designed styles on 837 characters. We show that the disentangled feature representations enable us to transfer or remove all these styles on arbitrary glyphs using one network. Furthermore, the flexible network design empowers TET-GAN to efficiently extend to a new text style via oneshot learning where only one example is required. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in generating high-quality stylized text over the state-of-the-art methods."}}

In this paper, we present a novel framework to stylize the text with exquisite decor, which is ignored by the previous text stylization methods. Decorative elements pose a challenge to spontaneously handle basal text effects and decor, which are two different styles. To address this issue, our key idea is to learn to separate, transfer and recombine the decors and the basal text effect. A novel text effect transfer network is proposed to infer the styled version of the target text. The stylized text is finally embellished with decor where the placement of the decor is carefully determined by a novel structure-aware strategy. Furthermore, we propose a domain adaptation strategy for decor detection and a one-shot training strategy for text effects transfer, which greatly enhance the robustness of our network to new styles. We base our experiments on our collected topography dataset including 59,000 professionally styled text and demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art style transfer methods."}}

VCM is committed to address the requirement of compact signal representation for both machine and human vision in a more or less scalable way. To this end, we make endeavors in leveraging the strength of predictive and generative models to support advanced compression techniques for both machine and human vision tasks simultaneously, in which visual features serve as a bridge to connect signal-level and task-level compact representations in a scalable manner. Specifically, we employ a conditional deep generation network to reconstruct video frames with the guidance of learned motion pattern. By learning to extract sparse motion pattern via a predictive model, the network elegantly leverages the feature representation to generate the appearance of to-be-coded frames via a generative model, relying on the appearance of the coded key frames. Meanwhile, the sparse motion pattern is compact and highly effective for high-level vision tasks, e.g. action recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that our method yields much better reconstruction quality compared with the traditional video codecs (0.0063 gain in SSIM), as well as state-of-the-art action recognition performance over highly compressed videos (9.4% gain in recognition accuracy), which showcases a promising paradigm of coding signal for both human and machine vision."}}

For (1), we design a deep network with both progressive rethinking and collaborative learning mechanisms to improve quality of the reconstructed intra-frames and inter-frames, respectively. For intra coding, a Progressive Rethinking Network (PRN) is designed to simulate the human decision mechanism for effective spatial modeling. Our designed block introduces an additional inter-block connection to bypass a high-dimensional informative feature before the bottleneck module across blocks to review the complete past memorized experiences and rethinks progressively. For inter coding, the current reconstructed frame interacts with reference frames (peak quality frame and the nearest adjacent frame) collaboratively at the feature level. For (2), we extract both intra-frame and inter-frame side information for better context modeling. A coarse-to-fine partition map based on HEVC partition trees is built as the intra-frame side information. Furthermore, the warped features of the reference frames are offered as the inter-frame side information. Our PRN with intra-frame side information provides 9.0% BD-rate reduction on average compared to HEVC baseline under All-intra (AI) configuration. While under Low-Delay B (LDB), Low-Delay P (LDP) and Random Access (RA) configuration, our PRN with inter-frame side information provides 9.0%, 10.6% and 8.0% BD-rate reduction on average respectively.
