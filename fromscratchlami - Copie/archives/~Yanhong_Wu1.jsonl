Previous methods on dynamic graph learning are usually sensitive to noisy graph information such as missing or spurious connections, which can yield degenerated performance and generalization. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Transformer-based dynamic graph learning method named Dynamic Graph Transformer (DGT) with spatial-temporal encoding to effectively learn graph topology and capture implicit links. To improve the generalization ability, we introduce two complementary self-supervised pre-training tasks and show that jointly optimizing the two pre-training tasks results in a smaller Bayesian error rate via an information-theoretic analysis. We also propose a temporal-union graph structure and a target-context node sampling strategy for efficient and scalable training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets illustrate that DGT presents superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art baselines."}}

Previous methods on graph representation learning mainly focus on static graphs, however, many real-world graphs are dynamic and evolve over time. In this paper, we present Dynamic Self-Attention Network (DySAT), a novel neural architecture that operates on dynamic graphs and learns node representations that capture both structural properties and temporal evolutionary patterns. Specifically, DySAT computes node representations by jointly employing self-attention layers along two dimensions: structural neighborhood and temporal dynamics. We conduct link prediction experiments on two classes of graphs: communication networks and bipartite rating networks. Our experimental results show that DySAT has a significant performance gain over several different state-of-the-art graph embedding baselines."}}
