Unlike existing steganography schemes which treat the DNN parameters as bit strings, \\textit{Cans} for the first time exploits the learning capacity of the carrier model via a novel parameter sharing mechanism. Extensive evaluation shows, Cans is the first working scheme which can covertly transmit over $10000$ real-world data samples within a carrier model which has $220\\times$ less parameters than the total size of the stolen data, and simultaneously transmit multiple heterogeneous datasets within a single carrier model, under a trivial distortion rate ($<10^{-5}$) and with almost no utility loss on the carrier model ($<1\\%$). Besides, Cans implements by-design redundancy to be resilient against common post-processing techniques on the carrier model before the publishing."}}

In this paper, we propose a geographical convolutional neural tensor network (GeoCNTN) as a generic embedding model. GeoCNTN first takes the raw location data and extracts from it a more well-conditioned representation by our proposed Geo-CMeans algorithm. We then use a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an embedding structure to extract individual latent structural patterns from the preprocessed data. Finally, we apply a neural tensor network (NTN) to craft the implicitly related features we have obtained into a unified geographical feature. The advantages of our GeoCNTN mainly come from its novel neural network structure, which intrinsically offers a mechanism to extract latent structural features from the geographical data, as well as its wide applicability in various LBSN-related tasks. From two case studies, i.e. link prediction and entity classification in user-group LBSN, we evaluate the embedding efficacy of our model. Results show that GeoCNTN significantly performs better on at least two tasks, with improvement by 9% w.r.t. NDCG and 11% w.r.t. F1 score respectively, using the Meetup-USA dataset."}}
