A lot of research has been done for either multi-label text categorization or image annotation. However, there is a lack of published work that targets at item tagging specifically for IR. Directly applying a traditional multi-label classification model for item tagging is sub-optimal, due to the ignorance of unique characteristics in IR. In this work, we propose to formulate item tagging as a link prediction problem between item nodes and tag nodes. To enrich the representation of items, we leverage the query logs available in IR tasks, and construct a query-item-tag tripartite graph. This formulation results in a TagGNN model that utilizes heterogeneous graph neural networks with multiple types of nodes and edges. Different from previous research, we also optimize both full tag prediction and partial tag completion cases in a unified framework via a primary-dual loss mechanism. Experimental results on both open and industrial datasets show that our TagGNN approach outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-label classification approaches."}}

However, they still suffer from two critical problems: (1) Mini-batch Sampling Effects (MSE), where the alignment easily fails due to the outcome imbalance or outliers in the batch; (2) Unobserved Confounder Effects (UCE), where the unobserved confounders damage the correct alignment. To tackle these problems, we propose a principled approach named Entire Space CounterFactual Regression (ESCFR) based on a generalized sinkhorn discrepancy for distribution alignment within the stochastic optimal transport framework. Based on the framework, we propose a relaxed mass preserving regularizer to address the MSE issue and design a proximal factual outcome regularizer to handle the UCE issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ESCFR can successfully tackle the treatment selection bias and achieve significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods."}}

Despite its impressive success so far, it is still unclear how to appropriately schedule the important hyperparameters to achieve adequate performance, such as the real data ratio for policy optimization in Dyna-style model-based algorithms. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze the role of real data in policy training, which suggests that gradually increasing the ratio of real data yields better performance. Inspired by the analysis, we propose a framework named AutoMBPO to automatically schedule the real data ratio as well as other hyperparameters in training model-based policy optimization (MBPO) algorithm, a representative running case of model-based methods. On several continuous control tasks, the MBPO instance trained with hyperparameters scheduled by AutoMBPO can significantly surpass the original one, and the real data ratio schedule found by AutoMBPO shows consistency with our theoretical analysis."}}
