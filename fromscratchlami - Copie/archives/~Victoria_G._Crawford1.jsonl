In contrast to most existing work on \\scp, it is not assumed that $f$ is monotone. Two bicriteria approximation algorithms are presented for \\scp that, for input parameter $0 < \\epsilon < 1$, give $O( 1 / \\epsilon^2 )$ ratio to the optimal cost and ensures the function $f$ is at least $\\tau(1 - \\epsilon)/2$. A lower bound shows that under the value query model shows that no polynomial-time algorithm can ensure that $f$ is larger than $\\tau/2$. Further, the algorithms presented are scalable to large data sets, processing the ground set in a stream. Similar algorithms developed for \\scp also work for the related optimization problem of \\smpl (\\smp). Finally, the algorithms are demonstrated to be effective in experiments involving graph cut and data summarization functions."}}

Existing approximation ratios for the greedy algorithm assume a value oracle to the benefit function. However, access to a value oracle is not a realistic assumption for many applications of this problem, where the benefit function is difficult to compute. We present two incomparable approximation ratios for this problem with an approximate value oracle and demonstrate that the ratios take on empirically relevant values through a case study with the Influence Threshold problem in online social networks."}}

This problem is relevant to network reliability through the important metric of network clustering coefficient of order k. We formulate two algorithms to be both scalable and have good solution quality in practice: CARL and DARC. DARC is able to efficiently update its solution under dynamic node and edge insertion and removal to the network. In our experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that DARC is able to run on networks with billions of 3-cycles within 2 h and is able to dynamically update its solution in microseconds."}}
