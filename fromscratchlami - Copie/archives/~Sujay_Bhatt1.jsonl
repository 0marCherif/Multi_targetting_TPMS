The algorithm is de-signed for the offline setting, where the objective is to detect changes when all data are received. We only make weak moment assumptions on the inliers (uncorrupted data) to handle a large class of distributions. The robust scan statistic in the change detection algorithm is fashioned using mean estimators based on influence functions. We establish the consistency of the estimated change point indexes as the number of samples increases, and provide empirical evidence to support the consistency results."}}
