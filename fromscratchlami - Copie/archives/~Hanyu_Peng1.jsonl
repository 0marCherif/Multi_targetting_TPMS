However, existing approaches that assume feature subsets to be independent are imperfect when considering the dependency between features. To address this limitation, we propose to incorporate the Gaussian copula, a powerful mathematical technique for capturing correlations between variables, into the current feature selection framework with no additional changes needed. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets, in terms of performance comparison and interpretability, demonstrate that our method is capable of capturing meaningful correlations."}}

This poses crucial questions that, do all training data contribute to model's performance? How much does each individual training sample or a sub-training-set affect the model's generalization, and how to construct a smallest subset from the entire training data as a proxy training set without significantly sacrificing the model's performance? To answer these, we propose dataset pruning, an optimization-based sample selection method that can (1) examine the influence of removing a particular set of training samples on model's generalization ability with theoretical guarantee, and (2) construct a smallest subset of training data that yields strictly constrained generalization gap. The empirically observed generalization gap of dataset pruning is substantially consistent with our theoretical expectations. Furthermore, the proposed method prunes 40% training examples on the CIFAR-10 dataset, halves the convergence time with only 1.3% test accuracy decrease, which is superior to previous score-based sample selection methods."}}

Distinctive from conventional recognition is that it posits that the allocation of the training set is supremely distorted. Predictably, it will pose challenges to the generalisation behaviour of the model. Approaches to these challenges revolve into two groups: firstly, training-aware methods, with the aim of enhancing the generalisability of the model by exploiting its potential in the training period; and secondly, post-hoc correction, liberally coupled with training-aware methods, which is intended to refine the predictions to the extent possible in the post-processing stage, offering the advantages of simplicity and effectiveness. This paper introduces an alternative direction to do the post-hoc correction, which goes beyond the statistical methods. Mathematically, we approach this issue from the perspective of optimal transport (OT), yet, choosing the exact cost matrix when applying OT is challenging and requires expert knowledge of various tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose to employ linear mapping to learn the cost matrix without necessary configurations adaptively. Testing our methods in practice, along with high efficiency and excellent performance, our method surpasses all previous methods and has the best performance to date."}}

Yet we are still at a fairly preliminary stage in the exploration of this task, so more attempts are needed. In this paper, we work on a seamless marriage of imbalanced regression and self-supervised learning. But with this comes the first question of how to measure the similarity and dissimilarity under the regression sense, for which the definition is clear in the classification. To overcome the limitation, the formal definition of similarity in the regression task is given. On top of this, through experimenting on a simple neural network, we found that self-supervised learning could help alleviate the problem. However, the second problem is, it is not guaranteed that the noisy samples are similar to original samples when scaling to a deep network by adding random noise to the input, we specifically propose to limit the volume of noise on the output, and in doing so to find meaningful noise on the input by back propagation. Experimental results show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance."}}
