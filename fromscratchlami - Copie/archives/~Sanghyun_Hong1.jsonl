While shown effective in achieving robustness to these foreseen variations, these approaches are ineffective in learning unforeseen robustness, i.e., robustness to data variations with unknown characterization or without training examples reflecting them. In this work, we learn such unforeseen robustness by harnessing the variations in the abundant out-of-distribution data. As we attribute the main challenge of using these data to the domain gap, we consider using a domain translator to bridge the gap, with which we bound the intractable robustness on the target distribution. As implied by our analysis, we propose a two-step algorithm that first trains an equivariant domain translator to map out-of-distribution data to the target distribution while preserving the variation, and then regularizes a model\u2019s output consistency on the domain-translated data to improve its robustness. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving both unforeseen and foreseen robustness in comparison to existing baselines. We also show that training the equivariant domain translator serves as an effective criterion for source data selection."}}

Among those many methods, neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) are one of the most fundamental work. NODEs have been applied to general downstream tasks such as image classification, time series classification, and image generation. The ODE function of NODEs can be understood as a special type of differential operators, which had been overlooked before.  In this paper, therefore, we study the feasibility of modeling NODEs (or the ODE function of NODEs) as neural operators. Our neural operator-based methods are more rigorous than existing approaches when it comes to learning the differential operator (or the ODE function). To this end, we design a new neural operator structure called branched Fourier neural operator (BFNO), which is suitable for modeling the ODE function. It shows improved performance for several general machine learning tasks, as compared to existing various NODE models."}}

These mechanisms enable the construction of a small, efficient version of commercial-scale models with comparable accuracy, accelerating their deployment to resource-constrained devices. \n\nIn this paper, we study the security considerations of publishing on-device variants of large-scale models. We first show that an adversary can exploit on-device models to make attacking the large model easier. In evaluations across 19 DNNs, by exploiting the published on-device models as a prior, the adversarial vulnerability of the original commercial-scale models increases by up to 100x. We then show that the vulnerability increases as the similarity between a full-scale and its efficient model increase. Based on the insights, we propose a defense, similarity-unpairing, that fine-tunes smaller models with the objective of reducing the similarities. We evaluated our defense on all the 19 DNNs and found that it reduces the transferability up to 90% and the number of queries required by a factor of 10-100x. Our results suggest that further research is needed on the security (or even privacy) threats caused by publishing those efficient siblings."}}

This direct modification gives our attacker more degrees of freedom compared to poisoning, and we show it can be used to evade many backdoor detection or removal defenses effectively.

We show that an adversary who can poison a training dataset can cause models trained on this dataset to leak significant private details of training points belonging to other parties. Our active inference attacks connect two independent lines of work targeting the integrity and privacy of machine learning training data. Our attacks are effective across membership inference, attribute inference, and data extraction. For example, our targeted attacks can poison <0.1% of the training dataset to boost the performance of inference attacks by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. Further, an adversary who controls a significant fraction of the training data (e.g., 50%) can launch untargeted attacks that enable 8x more precise inference on all other users' otherwise-private data points. Our results cast doubts on the relevance of cryptographic privacy guarantees in multiparty computation protocols for machine learning, if parties can arbitrarily select their share of training data."}}

Users can perturb images they post online, so that models will misclassify future (unperturbed) pictures.\n  \n We demonstrate that this strategy provides a false sense of security, as it ignores an inherent asymmetry between the parties: users' pictures are perturbed once and for all before being published (at which point they are scraped) and must thereafter fool all future models---including models trained adaptively against the users' past attacks, or models that use new technologies discovered after the attack.\n  \nWe evaluate two systems for poisoning attacks against large-scale facial recognition, Fawkes (500,000+ downloads) and LowKey. We demonstrate how an \"oblivious\" model trainer can simply wait for future developments in computer vision to nullify the protection of pictures collected in the past. We further show that an adversary with black-box access to the attack can (i) train a robust model that resists the perturbations of collected pictures and (ii) detect poisoned pictures uploaded online.\n  \nWe caution that facial recognition poisoning will not admit an \"arms race\" between attackers and defenders. Once perturbed pictures are scraped, the attack cannot be changed so any future successful defense irrevocably undermines users' privacy."}}

No, It's a Sloth: Slowdown Attacks on Adaptive Multi-Exit Neural Network Inference", "abstract": "Recent increases in the computational demands of deep neural networks (DNNs), combined with the observation that most input samples require only simple models, have sparked interest in input-adaptive multi-exit architectures, such as MSDNets or Shallow-Deep Networks. These architectures enable faster inferences and could bring DNNs to low-power devices, e.g., in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, it is unknown if the computational savings provided by this approach are robust against adversarial pressure. In particular, an adversary may aim to slowdown adaptive DNNs by increasing their average inference time\u2014a threat analogous to the denial-of-service attacks from the Internet. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of this threat by experimenting with three generic multi-exit DNNs (based on VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNet56) and a custom multi-exit architecture, on two popular image classification benchmarks (CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet). To this end, we show that adversarial example-crafting techniques can be modified to cause slowdown, and we propose a metric for comparing their impact on different architectures. We show that a slowdown attack reduces the efficacy of multi-exit DNNs by 90\u2013100%, and it amplifies the latency by 1.5\u20135\u00d7 in a typical IoT deployment. We also show that it is possible to craft universal, reusable perturbations and that the attack can be effective in realistic black-box scenarios, where the attacker has limited knowledge about the victim. Finally, we show that adversarial training provides limited protection against slowdowns. These results suggest that further research is needed for defending multi-exit architectures against this emerging threat. Our code is available at https://github.com/sanghyun-hong/deepsloth."}}

Until now, the mechanism to inject backdoors has been limited to $poisoning$. We argue that such a supply-chain attacker has more attack techniques available. To study this hypothesis, we introduce a handcrafted attack that directly manipulates the parameters of a pre-trained model to inject backdoors. Our handcrafted attacker has more degrees of freedom in manipulating model parameters than poisoning. This makes it difficult for a defender to identify or remove the manipulations with straightforward methods, such as statistical analysis, adding random noises to model parameters, or clipping their values within a certain range. Further, our attacker can combine the handcrafting process with additional techniques, $e.g.$, jointly optimizing a trigger pattern, to inject backdoors into complex networks effectively$-$the meet-in-the-middle attack. In evaluations, our handcrafted backdoors remain effective across four datasets and four network architectures with a success rate above 96%. Our backdoored models are resilient to both parameter-level backdoor removal techniques and can evade existing defenses by slightly changing the backdoor attack configurations. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of suppressing unwanted behaviors otherwise caused by poisoning. Our results suggest that further research is needed for understanding the complete space of supply-chain backdoor attacks."}}
