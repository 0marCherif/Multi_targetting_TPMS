Formulated as Influence maximization (IM) in 2003, this NP-hard problem has received a multitude of studies with diverse angles. However, these works often unable to provide reliable solutions, due to the loss of an exact metric for evaluating users\u2019 contributions on information cascading in the state-of-the-art sampling based IM schemes. In this paper, we evaluate users in IM based on the collective influence (CI), a metric on the structural features of the users in network graph that reflects the contributions of the users\u2019 neighborhoods on shaping collective dynamics of the users over the whole network. For conducting the influencer identification under probabilistic diffusion model based on the CI, we specify a quantified structural feature of the most influential users from the scope of diffusion over the whole network, and reveal that the structural influence power (CI value) of each user is a weighted cumulation of the diffusion probabilities from neighbors within certain hops. Utilizing CI, we design a novel algorithm which identifies the influencers via iteratively choosing the users with top CI values. Moreover, we point out that directly computing CI values requires to traverse the network which is originally represented by a high-dimensional matrix, and leads to huge complexity of influencer identification. To improve scalability, we further trade precision for efficiency by incorporating network embedding, a dimensionality reduction technology for networks, into algorithm design, and propose a minor variant, where CI is jointly recapitulated by low-dimensional user representations and user degrees. The superiority of our algorithms is empirically validated over 8 datasets, with an increment in influence size up to 50 percent and a comparable or even less running time comparing with existing baselines."}}

An important class of privacy concerns that arises in data sharing scenarios regards the underlying distribution of data. For example, the total traffic volume of data from a networking company can reveal the scale of its business, which may be considered a trade secret. Unfortunately, existing privacy frameworks (e.g., differential privacy, anonymization) do not adequately address such concerns. In this paper, we propose summary statistic privacy, a framework for analyzing and protecting these summary statistic privacy concerns. We propose a class of quantization mechanisms that can be tailored to various data distributions and statistical secrets, and analyze their privacy-distortion trade-offs under our framework. We prove corresponding lower bounds on the privacy-utility tradeoff, which match the tradeoffs of the quantization mechanism under certain regimes, up to small constant factors. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed quantization mechanisms achieve better privacy-distortion tradeoffs than alternative privacy mechanisms on real-world datasets."}}

In this paper, we propose distributional privacy, a framework for analyzing and protecting these distributional privacy concerns in data sharing scenarios. Distributional privacy is applicable in multiple data sharing settings, including synthetic data release. Theoretically, we analyze the lower and upper bounds of privacy-distortion trade-offs. Practically, we propose data release mechanism for protecting distributional privacy concerns, and demonstrate that they achieve better privacy-distortion trade-offs than alternative privacy mechanisms on real-world datasets."}}

These difficulties arise because: (a) defenders in FL do not have access to raw training data, and (b) a new phenomenon we identify called backdoor leakage causes models trained continuously to eventually suffer from backdoors due to cumulative errors in defense mechanisms. We propose shadow learning, a framework for defending against backdoor attacks in the FL setting under long-range training. Shadow learning trains two models in parallel: a backbone model and a shadow model. The backbone is trained without any defense mechanism to obtain good performance on the main task. The shadow model combines filtering of malicious clients with early-stopping to control the attack success rate even as the data distribution changes. We theoretically motivate our design and show experimentally that our framework significantly improves upon existing defenses against backdoor attacks."}}

Without ground-truth mapping, prior literature proposes various cost functions in hope of measuring the quality of mappings. However, their cost functions, whose minimizers may remain algorithmically unknown, usually bring imponderable mapping errors when the true mapping cannot minimize these cost functions. We jointly tackle above concerns under a more practical social network model parameterized by overlapping communities, which, neglected by prior art, can serve as side information for de-anonymization. Regarding the unavailability of ground-truth mapping to adversaries, by virtue of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), our first contribution is a well-justified cost function minimizing the expected number of mismatched users over all possible true mappings. While proving the NP-hardness of minimizing MMSE, we validly transform it into the weighted-edge matching problem (WEMP), which, as disclosed theoretically, resolves the tension between optimality and complexity: 1) WEMP asymptotically returns a negligible mapping error in large network size under mild conditions facilitated by higher overlapping strength; 2) WEMP can be algorithmically characterized via the convex-concave based de-anonymization algorithm (CBDA), effectively finding the optimum of WEMP. Extensive experiments further confirm the effectiveness of CBDA under overlapping communities: 90% users are re-identified averagely in a series of networks when communities overlap densely, and the re-identification ratio is enhanced about 70% compared to non-overlapping cases."}}
