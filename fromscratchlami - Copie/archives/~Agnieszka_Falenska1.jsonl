Yet, efforts in understanding what inequalities in portraying women and men occur in Wikipedia focused so far only on *biographies*, leaving open the question of how often such harmful patterns occur in other topics. In this paper, we investigate gender-related asymmetries in Wikipedia titles from *all domains*. We assess that for only half of gender-related articles, i.e., articles with words such as *women* or *male* in their titles, symmetrical counterparts describing the same concept for the other gender (and clearly stating it in their titles) exist. Among the remaining imbalanced cases, the vast majority of articles concern sports- and social-related issues. We provide insights on how such asymmetries can influence other Wikipedia components and propose steps towards reducing the frequency of observed patterns."}}

However, targeting specific groups also carries the risk of reflecting disparate social norms and subtle stereotypes. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which how-to guides from one particular platform, wikiHow, differ in practice depending on the intended audience. We conduct two case studies in which we examine qualitative features of texts written for specific audiences. In a generalization study, we investigate which differences can also be systematically demonstrated using computational methods. The results of our studies show that guides from wikiHow, like other text genres, are subject to subtle biases. We aim to raise awareness of these inequalities as a first step to addressing them in future work."}}

Such ambiguity occurs at the lexical as well as syntactic level. At the lexical level, the same word can represent different concepts and objects. At the syntactic level, one phrase or a sentence can have more than one interpretation. Language ambiguity is one of the biggest challenges of Natural Language Processing (NLP), i.e., the research field that sits at the intersection of machine learning and linguistics, and that deals with automatic processing of language data. This challenge arises when automatic NLP tools need to resolve ambiguities and select one possible interpretation of a text to approach understanding its meaning. This dissertation focuses on one of the essential Natural Language Processing tasks - dependency parsing. The task involves assigning a syntactic structure called a dependency tree to a given sentence. Parsing is usually one of the processing steps that helps downstream NLP tasks by resolving some of the syntactic ambiguities occurring in sentences. Since human language is highly ambiguous, deciding on the best syntactic structure for a given sentence is challenging. As a result, even state-of-the-art dependency parsers are far from being perfect. Ensemble methods allow for postponing the decision about the best interpretation until several single parsing models express their opinions. Such complementary views on the same problem show which parts of the sentence are the most ambiguous and require more attention. Ensemble parsers find a consensus among such single predictions, and as a result, provide robust and more trustworthy results. Ensemble parsing architectures are commonly regarded as solutions only for experts and overlooked in practical applications. Therefore, this dissertation aims to provide a deeper understanding of ensemble dependency parsers and answer practical questions that arise when designing such approaches. We investigate ensemble models from three core methodological perspectives: parsing time, availability of training resources, and the final accuracy of the system. We demonstrate that in applications where the complexity of the architecture is not a bottleneck, an integration of strong and diverse parsers is the most reliable approach. Such integration provides robust results regardless of the language and the domain of application. However, when the final accuracy of the system can be sacrificed, more efficient ensemble architectures become available. The decision on how to design them has to take into consideration the desired parsing time, the available training data, and the involved single predictors. The main goal of this thesis is to investigate ensemble parsers. However, to design an ensemble architecture for a particular application, it is crucial to understand the similarities and differences in the behavior of its components. Therefore, this dissertation makes contributions of two sorts: (1) we provide guidelines on practical applications of ensemble dependency parsers, but also (2) through the ensembles, we develop a deeper understanding of single parsing models. We primarily focus on differences between the traditional parsers and their recent successors, which use deep learning techniques."}}

We submitted systems for both of the Subtasks of Task 1. In Subtask (A), which was about dependency parsing, we used our ensemble system from the CoNLL 2017 UD Shared Task. The system first preprocesses the sentences with a CRF POS/morphological tagger and predicts supertags with a neural tagger. Then, it employs multiple instances of three different parsers and merges their outputs by applying blending. The system achieved the second place out of four participating teams. In this paper we show which components of the system were the most responsible for its final performance. The goal of Subtask (B) was to predict enhanced graphs. Our approach consisted of two steps: parsing the sentences with our ensemble system from Subtask (A), and applying 12 simple rules to obtain the final dependency graphs. The rules introduce additional enhanced arcs only for tokens with \"conj\" heads (conjuncts). They do not predict semantic relations at all. The system ranked first out of three participating teams. In this paper we show examples of rules we designed and analyze the relation between the quality of automatically parsed trees and the accuracy of the enhanced graphs."}}

The set moves the corpus to a document level. It includes a full mapping of sentences to documents, as well as additional sentence-level and document-level annotations. The sentence-level annotations refer to the role of a sentence in the document. They introduce structure to the TIGER documents by separating headers and meta-level information from article content. Document-level annotations recover information which has been neglected in the intermediate releases of the TIGER corpus, such as document categories and publication dates of the articles. Additionally, we introduce new document-level annotations: authors and their gender. We describe the process of corpus annotation, show statistics of the obtained data and present baseline experiments for lemmatization, part-of-speech and morphological tagging, and dependency parsing. Finally, we present two example use cases: sentence boundary detection and authorship attribution. These use cases take the data from TIGER into account and illustrate the usefulness of the new annotation layers from TIGER 2.2-doc."}}
