The model infers a latent 3D representation of the scene in the form of 3D feature points, where each continuous world 3D point is mapped to its corresponding feature vector. The model is trained for contrastive view prediction by rendering 3D feature clouds in queried viewpoints and matching against the 3D feature point cloud predicted from the query view. Notably, the representation can be queried for any 3D location, even if it is not visible from the input view. Our model brings together three powerful ideas of recent exciting research work: 3D feature grids as a neural bottleneck for view prediction, implicit functions for handling resolution limitations of 3D grids, and contrastive learning for unsupervised training of feature representations. We show the resulting 3D visual feature representations effectively scale across objects and scenes, imagine information occluded or missing from\nthe input viewpoints, track objects over time, align semantically related objects in 3D, and improve 3D object detection. We outperform many existing state-of-the-art methods for 3D feature learning and view prediction, which are either limited by 3D grid spatial resolution, do not attempt to build amodal 3D representations, or do not handle combinatorial scene variability due to their non-convolutional\nbottlenecks."}}

In this 3D feature space, objects do not interfere with one another and their appearance persists over time and across viewpoints. This permits our model to predict future scenes long in the future by simply \"moving\" 3D object features based on cumulative object motion predictions. Object motion predictions are computed by a graph neural network that operates over the object features extracted from the 3D neural scene representation. Our model's simulations can be decoded by a neural renderer into2D image views from any desired viewpoint, which aids the interpretability of our latent 3D simulation space. We show our model generalizes well its predictions across varying number and appearances of interacting objects as well as across camera viewpoints, outperforming existing 2D and 3D dynamics models. We further demonstrate sim-to-real transfer of the learnt dynamics by applying our model trained solely in simulation to model-based control for pushing objects to desired locations under clutter on a real robotic setup"}}

Many existing systems can identify objects and infer 3D poses, but they heavily rely on human labels and 3D annotations. The challenge here is to achieve this without relying on strong supervision signals. To address this challenge, we propose a model that maps RGB-D images to a set of 3D visual feature maps in a differentiable fully-convolutional manner, supervised by predicting views. The 3D feature maps correspond to a featurization of the 3D world scene depicted in the images. The object 3D feature representations are invariant to camera viewpoint changes or zooms, which means feature matching can identify similar objects under different camera viewpoints. We can compare the 3D feature maps of two objects by searching alignment across scales and 3D rotations, and, as a result of the operation, we can estimate pose and scale changes without the need for 3D pose annotations. We cluster object feature maps into a set of 3D prototypes that represent familiar objects in canonical scales and orientations. We then parse images by inferring the prototype identity and 3D pose for each detected object. We compare our method to numerous baselines that do not learn 3D feature visual representations or do not attempt to correspond features across scenes, and outperform them by a large margin in the tasks of object retrieval and object pose estimation. Thanks to the 3D nature of the object-centric feature maps, the visual similarity cues are invariant to 3D pose changes or small scale changes, which gives our method an advantage over 2D and 1D methods."}}
