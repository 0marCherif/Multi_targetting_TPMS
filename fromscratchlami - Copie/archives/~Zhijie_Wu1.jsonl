Since the seminal work of Gatys et al. first demonstrates the power of stylization through optimization in the deep feature space, quite a few approaches have achieved real-time arbitrary style transfer with straightforward statistic matching techniques. In this work, our key observation is that only considering features in the input style image for the global deep feature statistic matching or local patch swap may not always ensure a satisfactory style transfer; see e.g., Figure 1. Instead, we propose a novel transfer framework, EFANet, that aims to jointly analyze and better align exchangeable features extracted from the content and style image pair. In this way, the style feature from the style image seeks for the best compatibility with the content information in the content image, leading to more structured stylization results. In addition, a new whitening loss is developed for purifying the computed content features and better fusion with styles in feature space. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the advantages of our approach."}}

However, existing state-of-the-art approaches often generate insufficiently stylized results under challenging cases. We believe a fundamental reason is that these approaches try to generate the stylized result in a single shot and hence fail to fully satisfy the constraints on semantic structures in the content images and style patterns in the style images. Inspired by the works on error-correction, instead we propose a self-correcting model to predict what is wrong with the current stylized result and refine it iteratively. For each refinement, we transit the error features across both the spatial and scale domain and invert the processed features into a residual image, with a network we call Error Transition Network (ETNet). The proposed model improves over the state-of-the-art methods with better semantic structures and more adaptive style pattern details. Various qualitative and quantitative experiments show that the key concept of both progressive strategy and error-correction yield better results."}}

Given a set of segmented objects of a certain class, the geometry of their parts and the pairwise relationships between them (the structure) are jointly learned and embedded in a latent space by an autoencoder. The encoder intertwines the geometry and structure features into a single latent code, while the decoder disentangles the features and reconstructs the geometry and structure of the 3D model. Our autoencoder consists of two branches, one for the structure and one for the geometry. The key idea is that during the analysis, the two branches exchange information between them, thereby learning the dependencies between structure and geometry and encoding two augmented features, which are then fused into a single latent code. This explicit intertwining of information enables separately controlling the geometry and the structure of the generated models. We evaluate the performance of our method and conduct an ablation study. We explicitly show that encoding of shapes accounts for both similarities in structure and geometry. A variety of quality results generated by SAGNet are presented."}}
