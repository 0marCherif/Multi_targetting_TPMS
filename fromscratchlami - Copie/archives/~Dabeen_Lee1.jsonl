We design an online primal-dual projection-free framework that can take any projection-free algorithms developed for online convex optimization with no long-term constraint. With this general template, we deduce sublinear regret and constraint violation bounds for various settings. Moreover, for the case where the loss and constraint functions are smooth, we develop a primal-dual conditional gradient method that achieves $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret and $O(T^{3/4})$ constraint violations. Furthermore, for the setting where the loss and constraint functions are stochastic and strong duality holds for the associated offline stochastic optimization problem, we prove that the constraint violation can be reduced to have the same asymptotic growth as the regret."}}

In particular, we study the setting where data samples are drawn from a Markov chain and thus are not independent and identically distributed. We generalize the drift-plus-penalty framework, a primal-dual stochastic gradient method developed for the i.i.d. case, to the Markov chain sampling setting. We propose two variants of drift-plus-penalty; one is for the case when the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain is known while the other is for the case of unknown mixing time. In fact, our algorithms apply to a more general setting of constrained online convex optimization where the sequence of constraint functions follows a Markov chain. Both algorithms are adaptive in that the first works without knowledge of the time horizon while the second uses AdaGrad-style algorithm parameters, which is of independent interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through numerical experiments on classification with fairness constraints."}}

We formulate the problem as an online allocation problem in an episodic finite-horizon constrained Markov decision process with an unknown non-stationary transition function and stochastic non-stationary reward and resource consumption functions. We propose the observe-then-decide regime and improve the existing decide-then-observe regime, while the two settings differ in how the observations and feedback about the reward and resource consumption functions are given to the decision-maker. We develop an online dual mirror descent algorithm that achieves near-optimal regret bounds for both settings. For the observe-then-decide regime, we prove that the expected regret against the dynamic clairvoyant optimal policy is bounded by $\\tilde O(\\rho^{-1}{H^{3/2}}S\\sqrt{AT})$ where $\\rho\\in(0,1)$ is the budget parameter, $H$ is the length of the horizon, $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and actions, and $T$ is the number of episodes. For the decide-then-observe regime, we show that the regret against the static optimal policy that has access to the mean reward and mean resource consumption functions is bounded by $\\tilde O(\\rho^{-1}{H^{3/2}}S\\sqrt{AT})$ with high probability. We test the numerical efficiency of our method for a variant of the resource-constrained inventory management problem."}}

In this paper, we first revisit basic mixing sets by establishing a strong and previously unrecognized connection to submodularity. In particular, we show that mixing inequalities with binary variables are nothing but the polymatroid inequalities associated with a specific submodular function. This submodularity viewpoint enables us to unify and extend existing results on valid inequalities and convex hulls of the intersection of multiple mixing sets with common binary variables. Then, we study such intersections under an additional linking constraint lower bounding a linear function of the continuous variables. This is motivated from the desire to exploit the information encoded in the knapsack constraint arising in joint linear CCPs via the quantile cuts. We propose a new class of valid inequalities and characterize when this new class along with the mixing inequalities are sufficient to describe the convex hull."}}

We prove that the continuous greedy algorithm achieves an $[(1-1/e)\\OPT-\\epsilon]$ guarantee when the function is monotone and H\\\"older-smooth, meaning that it admits a H\\\"older-continuous gradient. For functions that are non-differentiable or non-smooth, we propose a variant of the mirror-prox algorithm that attains an $[(1/2)\\OPT-\\epsilon]$ guarantee. We apply our algorithmic frameworks to robust submodular maximization and distributionally robust submodular maximization under Wasserstein ambiguity. In particular, the mirror-prox method applies to robust submodular maximization to obtain a single feasible solution whose value is at least $(1/2)\\OPT-\\epsilon$. For distributionally robust maximization under Wasserstein ambiguity, we deduce and work over a submodular-convex maximin reformulation whose objective function is H\\\"older-smooth, for which we may apply both the continuous greedy and the mirror-prox algorithms."}}

Two key ingredients for our proof are Jaeger\u2019s 8-flow theorem for graphs, and Seymour\u2019s characterization of the binary matroids with the sums of circuits property. As further evidence for our conjecture, we also note that it follows from an unpublished conjecture of Seymour from 1975. We also discuss connections to the chromatic number of a clutter, projective geometries over the two-element field, uniform cycle covers in graphs, and quarter-integral packings of value two in ideal clutters."}}

The existing MIP formulations are known to have weak continuous relaxation bounds, and, consequently, for hard instances with small radius, or with large problem sizes, the branch-and-bound based solution processes suffer from large optimality gaps even after hours of computation time. This significantly hinders the practical application of the DR-CCP paradigm. Motivated by these challenges, we conduct a polyhedral study to strengthen these formulations. We reveal several hidden connections between DR-CCP and its nominal counterpart (the sample average approximation), mixing sets, and robust 0\u20131 programming. By exploiting these connections in combination, we provide an improved formulation and two classes of valid inequalities for DR-CCP. We test the impact of our results on a stochastic transportation problem numerically. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach; in particular our improved formulation and proposed valid inequalities reduce the overall solution times remarkably. Moreover, this allows us to significantly scale up the problem sizes that can be handled in such DR-CCP formulations by reducing the solution times from hours to seconds."}}

Recently, we generalized this result by considering strengthened CG inequalities that use all variable bounds. In this paper, we generalize further by considering not just variable bounds, but general linear constraints on variables. We show that all points in a rational polyhedron that satisfy such strengthened CG inequalities form a rational polyhedron. We also extend this polyhedrality result to mixed-integer sets defined by linear constraints."}}

In each time slot, the server can process a job while receiving the realized random holding costs of the jobs remaining in the system. Our algorithm is a learning-based variant of the $c\\mu$ rule for scheduling: it starts with a preemption period of fixed length which serves as a learning phase, and after accumulating enough data about individual jobs, it switches to nonpreemptive scheduling mode. The algorithm is designed to handle instances with large or small gaps in jobs' parameters and achieves near-optimal performance guarantees. The performance of our algorithm is captured by its regret, where the benchmark is the minimum possible cost attained when the statistical parameters of jobs are fully known.  We prove upper bounds on the regret of our algorithm, and we derive a regret lower bound that is almost matching the proposed upper bounds. Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and show that our theoretical regret analysis is nearly tight."}}
