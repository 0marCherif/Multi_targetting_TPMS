In this article, we propose a real-time augmented reality virtual cosmetics try-on system for smartphones (ARCosmetics), taking speed, accuracy, and stability into consideration at each step to ensure a better user experience. A novel and very fast face tracking method utilizes the face detection box and the average position of facial landmarks to estimate the faces in continuous frames. A dynamic weight Wing loss is introduced to assign a dynamic weight to every landmark by the estimated error during training. It balances the attention between small, medium, and large range error and thus increases the accuracy and robustness. We also designed a weighted average method to utilize the information of the adjacent frame for landmark refinement, guaranteeing the stability of the generated landmarks. Extensive experiments conducted on a large 106-point facial landmark dataset and the 300-VW dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art methods. We also conducted user satisfaction studies further to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our ARCosmetics system."}}

Existing attacks are primarily conducted on the visible light spectrum (e.g., pixel-wise texture perturbation). However, attacks targeting texture-free X-ray images remain underexplored, despite the widespread application of X-ray imaging in safety-critical scenarios such as the X-ray detection of prohibited items. In this paper, we take the first step toward the study of adversarial attacks targeted at X-ray prohibited item detection, and reveal the serious threats posed by such attacks in this safety-critical scenario. Specifically, we posit that successful physical adversarial attacks in this scenario should be specially designed to circumvent the challenges posed by color/texture fading and complex overlapping. To this end, we propose X-adv to generate physically printable metals that act as an adversarial agent capable of deceiving X-ray detectors when placed in luggage. To resolve the issues associated with color/texture fading, we develop a differentiable converter that facilitates the generation of 3D-printable objects with adversarial shapes, using the gradients of a surrogate model rather than directly generating adversarial textures. To place the printed 3D adversarial objects in luggage with complex overlapped instances, we design a policy-based reinforcement learning strategy to find locations eliciting strong attack performance in worst-case scenarios whereby the prohibited items are heavily occluded by other items. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed X-Adv, we conduct extensive experiments in both the digital and the physical world (employing a commercial X-ray security inspection system for the latter case). Furthermore, we present the physical-world X-ray adversarial attack dataset XAD."}}

However, the intense computation and non-negligible delay hinder its application in the real world. As a widespread model compression technique, existing post-training quantization methods still cause severe performance drops. We find the main reasons lie in (1) the existing calibration metric is inaccurate in measuring the quantization influence for extremely low-bit representation, and (2) the existing quantization paradigm is unfriendly to the power-law distribution of Softmax. Based on these observations, we propose a novel Accurate Post-training Quantization framework for Vision Transformer, namely APQ-ViT. We first present a unified Bottom-elimination Blockwise Calibration scheme to optimize the calibration metric to perceive the overall quantization disturbance in a blockwise manner and prioritize the crucial quantization errors that influence more on the final output. Then, we design a Matthew-effect Preserving Quantization for Softmax to maintain the power-law character and keep the function of the attention mechanism. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale classification and detection datasets demonstrate that our APQ-ViT surpasses the existing post-training quantization methods by convincing margins, especially in lower bit-width settings (e.g., averagely up to 5.17% improvement for classification and 24.43% for detection on W4A4). We also highlight that APQ-ViT enjoys versatility and works well on diverse transformer variants."}}

We observe that these outliers are asymmetric and concentrated in specific channels. To address this issue, we propose the Outlier Suppression+ framework. First, we introduce channel-wise shifting and scaling operations to eliminate asymmetric presentation and scale down problematic channels. We demonstrate that these operations can be seamlessly migrated into subsequent modules while maintaining equivalence. Second, we quantitatively analyze the optimal values for shifting and scaling, taking into account both the asymmetric property and quantization errors of weights in the next layer. Our lightweight framework can incur minimal performance degradation under static and standard post-training quantization settings. Comprehensive results across various tasks and models reveal that our approach achieves near-floating-point performance on both small models, such as BERT, and large language models (LLMs) including OPTs, BLOOM, and BLOOMZ at 8-bit and 6-bit settings. Furthermore, we establish a new state of the art for 4-bit BERT."}}

Recently, advanced binarization methods have been greatly improved by minimizing the quantization error directly in the forward process. However, a significant performance gap still exists between the 1-bit model and the 32-bit one. The empirical study shows that binarization causes a great loss of information in the forward and backward propagation which harms the performance of binary neural networks (BNNs). We present a novel distribution-sensitive information retention network (DIR-Net) that retains the information in the forward and backward propagation by improving internal propagation and introducing external representations. The DIR-Net mainly relies on three technical contributions: (1) Information Maximized Binarization (IMB): minimizing the information loss and the binarization error of weights/activations simultaneously by weight balance and standardization; (2) Distribution-sensitive Two-stage Estimator (DTE): retaining the information of gradients by distribution-sensitive soft approximation by jointly considering the updating capability and accurate gradient; (3) Representation-align Binarization-aware Distillation (RBD): retaining the representation information by distilling the representations between full-precision and binarized networks. The DIR-Net investigates both forward and backward processes of BNNs from the unified information perspective, thereby providing new insight into the mechanism of network binarization. The three techniques in our DIR-Net are versatile and effective and can be applied in various structures to improve BNNs. Comprehensive experiments on the image classification and objective detection tasks show that our DIR-Net consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art binarization approaches under mainstream and compact architectures, such as ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet, DARTS, and MobileNet. Additionally, we conduct our DIR-Net on real-world resource-limited devices which achieves $$11.1\\times $$ 11.1 \u00d7 storage saving and $$5.4\\times $$ 5.4 \u00d7 speedup."}}

Current observation-based attacks, constrained by white-box assumptions, overlook c-MARL's complex multi-agent interactions and cooperative objectives, resulting in impractical and limited attack capabilities. To address these shortcomes, we propose Adversarial Minority Influence (AMI), a practical and strong for c-MARL. AMI is a practical black-box attack and can be launched without knowing victim parameters. AMI is also strong by considering the complex multi-agent interaction and the cooperative goal of agents, enabling a single adversarial agent to unilaterally misleads majority victims to form targeted worst-case cooperation. This mirrors minority influence phenomena in social psychology. To achieve maximum deviation in victim policies under complex agent-wise interactions, our unilateral attack aims to characterize and maximize the impact of the adversary on the victims. This is achieved by adapting a unilateral agent-wise relation metric derived from mutual information, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of victim influence on the adversary. To lead the victims into a jointly detrimental scenario, our targeted attack deceives victims into a long-term, cooperatively harmful situation by guiding each victim towards a specific target, determined through a trial-and-error process executed by a reinforcement learning agent. Through AMI, we achieve the first successful attack against real-world robot swarms and effectively fool agents in simulated environments into collectively worst-case scenarios, including Starcraft II and Multi-agent Mujoco.

Data-end defense, which improves robustness by operations on input data instead of modifying models, has attracted intensive attention due to its high feasibility in practice. However, previous data-end defenses show low generalization against diverse noises and weak transferability across multiple models. Motivated by the fact that robust recognition depends on both local and global features, we propose a defensive patch generation framework to address these problems by helping models better exploit these features. For the generalization against diverse noises, we inject class-specific identifiable patterns into a confined local patch prior, so that defensive patches could preserve more recognizable features towards specific classes, leading models for better recognition under noises. For the transferability across multiple models, we guide the defensive patches to capture more global feature correlations within a class, so that they could activate model-shared global perceptions and transfer better among models. Our defensive patches show great potentials to improve model robustness in practice by simply sticking them around target objects. Extensive experiments show that we outperform others by large margins (improve 20+% accuracy for both adversarial and corruption robustness on average in the digital and physical world)."}}

As a more threatening type for practical deep learning systems, physical adversarial examples have received extensive research attention in recent years. However, without exploiting the intrinsic characteristics such as model-agnostic and human-specific patterns, existing works generate weak adversarial perturbations in the physical world, which fall short of attacking across different models and show visually suspicious appearance. Motivated by the viewpoint that attention reflects the intrinsic characteristics of the recognition process, this paper proposes the Dual Attention Suppression (DAS) attack to generate visually-natural physical adversarial camouflage with strong transferability by suppressing both model and human attention. As for attacking, we generate transferable adversarial camouflages by distracting the model-shared similar attention patterns from the target to non-target regions. Meanwhile, based on the fact that human visual attention always focuses on salient items (e.g., suspicious distortions), we evade the human-specific bottom-up attention to generate visually-natural camouflage which is correlated to the scenario context. We conduct extensive experiments in both the digital and physical world for classification and detection tasks on up to date models (e.g., Yolo-V5) and significantly demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}}
