This has serious ramifications for the fairness, privacy, robustness, and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of machine learning. Hence, we theoretically characterize the inherent generalization of SGD-learned overparameterized linear regression to intra- and extra-population groups. We do this by proving an excess risk bound for an arbitrary group in terms of the full eigenspectra of the data covariance matrices of the group and population. We additionally provide a novel interpretation of the bound in terms of how the group and population data distributions differ and the group effective dimension of SGD, as well as connect these factors to real-world challenges in practicing trustworthy machine learning. We further empirically study our bound on simulated data."}}

This, in conjunction with graph structure and known feature biases, can cause graph feature imputation algorithms to predict values for unknown features that make the marginalized group's feature values more distinct from the the dominant group's feature values than they are in reality. We call this distinction the discrimination risk. We prove that a higher discrimination risk can amplify the unfairness of a machine learning model applied to the imputed data. We then formalize a general graph feature imputation framework called mean aggregation imputation and theoretically and empirically characterize graphs in which applying this framework can yield feature values with a high discrimination risk. We propose a simple algorithm to ensure mean aggregation-imputed features provably have a low discrimination risk, while minimally sacrificing reconstruction error (with respect to the imputation objective). We evaluate the fairness and accuracy of our solution on synthetic and real-world credit networks."}}

This challenge is further compounded when language modeling occurs in a multilingual context. Considering the implication of evaluation biases for large multilingual language models, we situate the discussion of bias evaluation within a wider context of social scientific research with computational work.\nWe highlight three dimensions of developing multilingual bias evaluation frameworks: (1) increasing transparency through documentation, (2) expanding targets of bias beyond gender, and (3) addressing cultural differences that exist between languages.\nWe further discuss the power dynamics and consequences of training large language models and recommend that researchers remain cognizant of the ramifications of developing such technologies."}}

{"id": "qcKh_Msv1GP", "cdate": 1601308309132, "mdate": null, "content": {"title": "Motif-Driven Contrastive Learning of Graph Representations", "abstract": "Graph motifs are significant subgraph patterns occurring frequently in graphs, and they play important roles in representing the whole graph characteristics. For example, in the chemical domain, functional groups are motifs that can determine molecule properties. Mining and utilizing motifs, however, is a non-trivial task for large graph datasets. Traditional motif discovery approaches mostly rely on exact counting or statistical estimation, which are hard to scale for a large number of graphs with continuous and high-dimension features. In light of the significance and challenges of motif mining, we propose : MICRO-Graph: a framework for \\underline{M}ot\\underline{I}f-driven \\underline{C}ontrastive lea\\underline{R}ning \\underline{O}f \\underline{G}raph representations to: 1) pre-train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in a self-supervised manner to automatically extract graph motifs from large graph datasets; 2) leverage learned motifs to guide the contrastive learning of graph representations, which further benefit various graph downstream tasks. Specifically, given a graph dataset, a motif learner cluster similar and significant subgraphs into corresponding motif slots. Based on the learned motifs, a motif-guided subgraph segmenter is trained to generate more informative subgraphs, which are used to conduct graph-to-subgraph contrastive learning of GNNs. Our discovering strategy is to simutaneously do clustering and contrastive learning on dynamically sampled subgraphs. The clustering part pull together similar subgraphs across different whole graphs, as the contrastive part push away dissimilar ones. Meanwhile, our learnable sampler will generate subgraph samples better aligned with the discoverying procedure. By pre-training on ogbn-molhiv molecule dataset with our proposed MICRO-Graph, the pre-trained GNN model can enhance various chemical property prediction downstream tasks with scarce label by 2.0%, and significantly higher than other state-of-the-art self-supervised learning baselines. \n"}}
