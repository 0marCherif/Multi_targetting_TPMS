To date, researchers have produced impressive state-of-the-art performance in the age of deep learning. Most of these state-of-the-art, however, requires large volume of annotated image-caption pairs in order to train their models. When given an image dataset of interests, practitioner needs to annotate the caption for each image in the training set and this process needs to happen for each newly collected image dataset. In this paper, we explore the task of unsupervised image captioning which utilizes unpaired images and texts to train the model so that the texts can come from different sources than the images. A main school of research on this topic that has been shown to be effective is to construct pairs from the images and texts in the training set according to their overlap of objects. Unlike in the supervised setting, these constructed pairings are however not guaranteed to have fully overlapping set of objects. Our work in this paper overcomes this by harvesting objects corresponding to a given sentence from the training set, even if they don\u2019t belong to the same image. When used as input to a transformer, such mixture of objects enables larger if not full object coverage, and when supervised by the corresponding sentence, produced results that outperform current state of the art unsupervised methods by a significant margin. Building upon this finding, we further show that (1) additional information on relationship between objects and attributes of objects also helps in boosting performance; and (2) our method also extends well to non-English image captioning, which usually suffers from a scarcer level of annotations. Our findings are supported by strong empirical results. Our code is available at https://github.com/zihangm/obj-centric-unsup-caption ."}}

We show how this reparametrization (into structured matrices), simple in hindsight, directly presents an opportunity to repurpose/adjust mature techniques for numerical optimization on Riemannian manifolds. Our developments nicely complement existing methods for this problem which either require $O(d^3)$ time complexity per iteration with $O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{t}})$ convergence rate (where $d$ is the dimensionality) or only extract the top $1$ component with $O(\\frac{1}{t})$ convergence rate. In contrast, our algorithm offers a strict improvement for this classical problem: it achieves $O(d^2k)$ runtime complexity per iteration for extracting the top $k$ canonical components with $O(\\frac{1}{t})$ convergence rate. While the paper primarily focuses on the formulation and technical analysis of its properties, our experiments show that the empirical behavior on common datasets is quite promising, We also explore a potential application in training fair models where the label of protected attribute is missing or otherwise unavailable.

We show how adopting a set of ingenious ideas proposed by Mangasarian for 1-norm SVMs -- which advocates for solving LPs with a generalized Newton method -- provides a simple and effective solution that can be run on the GPU. In particular, this strategy needs little unrolling, which makes it more efficient during backward pass. Further, even when the constraint matrix is too large to fit on the GPU memory (say large minibatch settings), we show that running the Newton method in a lower dimensional space yields accurate gradients for training, by utilizing a statistical concept called {\\em sufficient}  dimension reduction. While a number of specialized algorithms have been proposed for the models that we describe here, our module turns out to be applicable without any  specific adjustments or relaxations. We describe each use case, study its properties and demonstrate the efficacy of the approach over alternatives which use surrogate lower bounds and often, specialized optimization schemes. Frequently, we achieve superior computational behavior and performance improvements on common datasets used in the literature. "}}

Loosely speaking, our formulation is related to both explicit and implicit strategies for data augmentation and group equivariance, but is derived from new results in the SDE literature on estimating infinitesimal generators of a class of stochastic processes. If and when there is nominal agreement between the needs of an application/task and the inherent properties and behavior of the types of processes that we can efficiently handle, we obtain a very simple and efficient plug-in layer that can be incorporated within any existing network architecture, with minimal modification and only a few additional parameters. We show promising experiments on a number of vision tasks including few shot learning, point cloud transformers and deep variational segmentation obtaining efficiency or performance improvements."}}

Our work is built on top of the recent Localized Narratives annotation framework, where each word of a given caption is paired with a mouse trace segment. We propose two novel tasks: (1) predict a trace given an image and caption (i.e., visual grounding), and (2) predict a caption and a trace given only an image. Learning the grounding of each word is challenging, due to noise in the human-provided traces and the presence of words that cannot be meaningfully visually grounded. We present a novel model architecture that is jointly trained on dual tasks (controlled trace generation and controlled caption generation). To evaluate the quality of the generated traces, we propose a local bipartite matching (LBM) distance metric which allows the comparison of two traces of different lengths. Extensive experiments show our model is robust to the imperfect training data and outperforms the baselines by a clear margin. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model pre-trained on the proposed tasks can be also beneficial to the downstream task of COCO's guided image captioning. Our code and project page are publicly available."}}

In this paper, we show how emerging ideas in graph neural networks can yield a solution to various problems that broadly fall under relative attribute learning. Our main idea is the observation that relative attribute learning naturally benefits from exploiting the graph of dependencies among the different relative attributes of images, especially when only partial ordering is provided at training time. We use message passing to perform end to end learning of the image representations, their relationships as well as the interplay between different attributes. Our experiments show that this simple framework is effective in achieving competitive accuracy with specialized methods for both relative attribute learning and binary attribute prediction, while relaxing the requirements on the training data and/or the number of parameters, or both."}}
