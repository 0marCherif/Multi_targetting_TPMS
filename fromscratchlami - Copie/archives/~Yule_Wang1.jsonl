To be specific, we first consider various dependency types between item nodes and perform dependency-aware heterogeneous attention for denoising and obtaining accurate sequence item representations. Secondly, for multiple interests extraction, multi-head attention is conducted on top of the graph embedding. To filter out noisy inter-item correlations and enhance the robustness of extracted interests, self-supervised interest learning is introduced to the above two steps. Thirdly, to aggregate the multiple interests, interest experts corresponding to different interest routes give rating scores respectively, while a specialized network assigns the confidence of each score. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed DemiNet significantly improves the overall recommendation performance over several state-of-the-art baselines. Further studies verify the efficacy and interpretability benefits brought from the fine-grained user interest modeling."}}

However, the observed data used to train the recommender model suffers from severe bias issues. Practically, the item frequency distribution of the dataset is a highly skewed power-law distribution. Interactions of a small fraction of head items account for almost the whole training data. The normal training paradigm from such biased data tends to repetitively generate recommendations from the head items, which further exacerbates the biases and affects the exploration of potentially interesting items from the niche set. In this work, we innovatively explore the central theme of recommendation debiasing from an item cluster-wise multi-objective optimization perspective. Aiming to balance the learning on various item clusters that differ in popularity during the training process, we propose a model-agnostic framework namely Item Cluster-Wise Pareto-Efficient Recommendation (ICPE). In detail, we define our item cluster-wise optimization target as the recommender model should balance all item clusters that differ in popularity, thus we set the model learning on each item cluster as a unique optimization objective. To achieve this goal, we first explore items' popularity levels from a novel causal reasoning perspective. Then, we devise popularity discrepancy-based bisecting clustering to separate the item clusters. Next, we adaptively find the overall harmonious gradient direction for cluster-wise optimization objectives from a Pareto-efficient solver. Finally, in the prediction stage, we perform counterfactual inference to further eliminate the impact of global propensity. Extensive experimental results verify the superiorities of ICPE on overall recommendation performance and biases elimination."}}

However, existing works leverage the social relationship to aggregate user features from friends' historical behavior sequences in a user-level indirect paradigm. A significant defect of the indirect paradigm is that it ignores the temporal relationships between behavior events across users. In this paper, we propose a novel time-aware sequential recommendation framework called Social Temporal Excitation Networks (STEN), which introduces temporal point processes to model the fine-grained impact of friends' behaviors on the user s dynamic interests in an event-level direct paradigm. Moreover, we propose to decompose the temporal effect in sequential recommendation into social mutual temporal effect and ego temporal effect. Specifically, we employ a social heterogeneous graph embedding layer to refine user representation via structural information. To enhance temporal information propagation, STEN directly extracts the fine-grained temporal mutual influence of friends' behaviors through the mutually exciting temporal network. Besides, the user s dynamic interests are captured through the self-exciting temporal network. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that STEN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods. Moreover, STEN provides event-level recommendation explainability, which is also illustrated experimentally."}}
