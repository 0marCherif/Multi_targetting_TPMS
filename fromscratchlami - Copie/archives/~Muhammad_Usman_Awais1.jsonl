DevOps is a software development framework that fits best in the context of ever-emerging cloud technologies. DevOps has made it possible to automate each stage of software development, this is why it is gaining popularity rapidly. For the Pakistani software industry, the acceptance of DevOps is hindered by many factors. The most important of them all is the ever-widening disparity between the industry and academia. To assess the knowledge and acceptance of DevOps in the Pakistani software industry, a survey was conducted. Apart from other results, one conclusion is clear from the survey; Pakistani software engineers are completely aware of the changes taking place in the international market and they are trying to cope up with them, but the lack of theoretical knowledge is not allowing them to get to the pace they should have been. At the end of the article, some suggestions are presented to improve the situation."}}

As parts of a common hybrid system may belong to different domains of study, it is some-times beneficial to use specialized simulation packages (SPs) for each domain. In this case, parts of a system are simulated in different SPs. The idea may seem simple, but coupling more than one simulation component presents challenges related to numerical stability. The presented article suggests an implicit solver coupling technique enhanced to facilitate simulation of hybrid models using multiple simulation components. The technique is developed using two of the most popular simulation interoperability standards,namely, the High Level Architecture and the Functional Mock-up Interface. By using these standards, the developed algorithm will be useful for a large number of practitioners and researchers. The developed algorithm is described using a generic distributed computation model, which makes it reproducible even without using the standards. For the verification of results, the algorithm is tested on two case studies. The results are compared to a monolithic simulator and the proximity of results initiates the validity of the developed algorithm"}}

The interdependency of both domains requires a combined analysis of physical and ICT processes, but simulating these together is a major challenge due to the fundamentally different modeling and simulation concepts. After outlining these challenges, such as time synchronization and event handling, this paper presents an overview of state-of-the-art solutions to interface power system and ICT simulators. Due to their prominence in recent research, a special focus is set on co-simulation approaches and their challenges and potentials. Further, two case studies analyzing the impact of ICT on applications in power system operation illustrate the necessity of a holistic approach and show the capabilities of state-of-the-art co-simulation platforms."}}

In this paper, it is presented how the strengths of both, the HLA and the FMI, can be utilized to realize a distributed hybrid (or heterogeneous) simulation platform. Two different algorithms are proposed for such a platform. To demonstrate the correctness of algorithms, and their performance comparison, a simulation example is chosen from the domain of complex energy systems."}}
