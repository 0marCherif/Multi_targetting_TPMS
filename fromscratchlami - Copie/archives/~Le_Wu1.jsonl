In recent years, we have witnessed significant progress in developing neural recommender models, which generalize and surpass traditional recommender models owing to the strong representation power of neural networks. In this survey paper, we conduct a systematic review on neural recommender models from the perspective of recommendation modeling with the accuracy goal, aiming to summarize this field to facilitate researchers and practitioners working on recommender systems. Specifically, based on the data usage during recommendation modeling, we divide the work into collaborative filtering and information-rich recommendation: 1) <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">collaborative filtering</i> , which leverages the key source of user-item interaction data; 2) <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">content enriched recommendation</i> , which additionally utilizes the side information associated with users and items, like user profile and item knowledge graph; and 3) <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">temporal/sequential recommendation</i> , which accounts for the contextual information associated with an interaction, such as time, location, and the past interactions.

Effective feature selection can help to reduce dimensionality, improve prediction accuracy, and increase result comprehensibility. It is traditionally challenging to find the optimal feature subset from the feature subset space as the space could be very large. While much effort has been made on feature selection, reinforcement learning can provide a new perspective towards a more globally-optimal searching strategy. In the preliminary work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for the feature selection problem. Specifically, we first reformulate feature selection with a reinforcement learning framework by regarding each feature as an agent. Besides, we obtain the state of the environment in three ways, i.e., statistic description, autoencoder, and graph convolutional network (GCN), in order to derive a fixed-length state representation as the input of reinforcement learning. In addition, we study how the coordination among feature agents can be improved by a more effective reward scheme. Also, we provide a GMM-based generative rectified sampling strategy to accelerate the convergence of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our method searches the feature subset space more globally and can be easily adapted to real-time scenarios due to the nature of reinforcement learning. In the extended version, we further accelerate the framework from two aspects. From the sampling aspect, we show the indirect acceleration by proposing a rank-based softmax sampling strategy. From the exploration aspect, we show the direct acceleration by proposing an interactive reinforcement learning (IRL)-based exploration strategy. Extensive experimental results show the significant improvement of the proposed method over conventional approaches."}}

Much recent progress has been made in this area, especially attention-based methods and pretrained language model-based methods. However, most of these methods focus on all the important parts in sentences in a static way and only emphasize how important the words are to the query, inhibiting the ability of the attention mechanism. In order to overcome this problem and boost the performance of the attention mechanism, we propose a novel dynamic reread (DRr) attention, which can pay close attention to one small region of sentences at each step and reread the important parts for better sentence representations. Based on this attention variation, we develop a novel DRr network (DRr-Net) for sentence semantic matching. Moreover, selecting one small region in DRr attention seems insufficient for sentence semantics, and employing pretrained language models as input encoders will introduce incomplete and fragile representation problems. To this end, we extend DRr-Net to locally aware dynamic reread attention net (LadRa-Net), in which local structure of sentences is employed to alleviate the shortcoming of byte-pair encoding (BPE) in pretrained language models and boost the performance of DRr attention. Extensive experiments on two popular sentence semantic matching tasks demonstrate that DRr-Net can significantly improve the performance of sentence semantic matching. Meanwhile, LadRa-Net is able to achieve better performance by considering the local structures of sentences. In addition, it is exceedingly interesting that some discoveries in our experiments are consistent with some findings of psychological research."}}

R Recently, the fairness issue of recommendation has become more and more essential. A recommender system is considered unfair when it does not perform equally well for different user groups according to users' sensitive attributes~(e.g., gender, race). Plenty of methods have been proposed to alleviate unfairness by optimizing a predefined fairness goal or changing the distribution of unbalanced training data. However, they either suffered from the specific fairness optimization metrics or relied on redesigning the current recommendation architecture. In this paper, we study how to improve recommendation fairness from the data augmentation perspective. The recommendation model amplifies the inherent unfairness of imbalanced training data. We augment imbalanced training data towards balanced data distribution to improve fairness. The proposed framework is generally applicable to any embedding-based recommendation, and does not need to pre-define a fairness metric. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework. We publish the source code at https://github.com/newlei/FDA."}}

By utilizing the auxiliary review information accompanied with user ratings, many of the existing review-based recommendation models enriched user/item embedding learning ability with historical reviews or better modeled user-item interactions with the help of available user-item target reviews. Though significant progress has been made, we argue that current solutions for review-based recommendation suffer from two drawbacks. First, as review-based recommendation can be naturally formed as a user-item bipartite graph with edge features from corresponding user-item reviews, how to better exploit this unique graph structure for recommendation? Second, while most current models suffer from limited user behaviors, can we exploit the unique self-supervised signals in the review-aware graph to guide two recommendation components better? To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Review-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (RGCL) framework for review-based recommendation. Specifically, we first construct a review-aware user-item graph with feature-enhanced edges from reviews, where each edge feature is composed of both the user-item rating and the corresponding review semantics. This graph with feature-enhanced edges can help attentively learn each neighbor node weight for user and item representation learning. After that, we design two additional contrastive learning tasks (i.e., Node Discrimination and Edge Discrimination) to provide self-supervised signals for the two components in recommendation process. Finally, extensive experiments over five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RGCL compared to the state-of-the-art baselines."}}

The existing basic mode of attracting investment is to collect information about enterprises and entrepreneurs through manual methods, determine the target enterprise from the list of enterprises, and then attract investment through visits, negotiations, and other methods. As contacting and visiting companies one by one requires huge amounts of manpower and time, the choice of target companies is critical for attracting investments. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has conducted research from the perspective of knowledge-graph-based recommendation. In this study, we define the problem of target company recommendation in the process of investment promotion, and analyze the characteristics of the problem and the challenges it faces based on the background of the actual problem. Then, a two-tier model for solving this problem is provided from the perspective of knowledge graph reasoning. Aiming at the problem that the knowledge graph will frequently change, the model is designed based on the idea of combining the advantages of global and local link prediction. The experimental results on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model."}}

Plenty of methods have been proposed to exploit student-exercise interactions, especially graph-based methods. However, most of them treat student behaviors to exercises as a binary interaction (i.e., interacted or not), neglecting diverse behavior patterns (i.e., correct and incorrect interactions). Moreover, the number of concepts is much smaller than exercises, presenting a challenge for measuring student proficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Relational Cognitive Diagnosis\u00a0(MRCD) framework. Specifically, we first divide students\u2019 answer behaviors into correct and incorrect interactions with exercises, and form the corresponding two student-exercise relation graphs. We then leverage Graph Convolutional Network to learn exercise-level representations of students and exercises based on different relation graphs. Since dividing operation exacerbate the data sparsity problem, we employ graph contrastive learning to enhance MRCD\u00a0on representation learning. Moreover, considering the relatively small number of concepts, we directly employ attention mechanism to generate student and exercise representations based on relevant concepts. After that, we fuse exercise-level and concept-level representations, and send them to a cognitive diagnosis model to predict student performance.

Recently, with the rapid demand for explanations of recommendation results, reviews are used to train the encoder\u2013decoder models for explanation text generation. As most of the reviews are general text without detailed evaluation, some researchers leveraged auxiliary information of users or items to enrich the generated explanation text. Nevertheless, the auxiliary data is not available in most scenarios and may suffer from data privacy problems. In this article, we argue that the reviews contain abundant semantic information to express the users\u2019 feelings for various aspects of items, while these information are not fully explored in current explanation text generation task. To this end, we study how to generate more fine-grained explanation text in review based recommendation without any auxiliary data. Though the idea is simple, it is non-trivial since the aspect is hidden and unlabeled. Besides, it is also very challenging to inject aspect information for generating explanation text with noisy review input. To solve these challenges, we first leverage an advanced unsupervised neural aspect extraction model to learn the aspect-aware representation of each review sentence. Thus, users and items can be represented in the aspect space based on their historical associated reviews. After that, we detail how to better predict ratings and generate explanation text with the user and item representations in the aspect space. We further dynamically assign review sentences which contain larger proportion of aspect words with larger weights to control the text generation process, and jointly optimize rating prediction accuracy and explanation text generation quality with a multi-task learning framework. Finally, extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model for both recommendation accuracy and explainability."}}
