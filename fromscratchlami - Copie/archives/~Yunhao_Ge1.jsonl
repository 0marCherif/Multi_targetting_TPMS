While the top-5 zero-shot accuracies of these models are very high, the top-1 accuracies are much lower (over 25% gap in some cases). We investigate the reason for this performance gap and find that many of the failure cases are caused by ambiguity in the text prompts. First,we develop a simple and efficient zero-shot post-hoc method to identify images where the top-1 prediction is likely to be incorrect, by measuring consistency of the predictions w.r.t. multiple prompts and image transformations. We show that our procedure better predicts mistakes, outperforming the popular max logit baseline on selective prediction tasks. Next, we propose a simple and efficient way to improve accuracy on such uncertain images by making use of the WordNet hierarchy; specifically we use information from parents in the hierarchy to add superclass to prompts, and use information from children in the hierarchy to devise fine-grained prompts. We conduct experiments on both CLIP and LiT models with five different ImageNet-based datasets. For CLIP, our method improves the top-1 accuracy by 17.13% on the uncertain subset and 3.6% on the entire ImageNet validation set. We also show that our method consistently improvement on other ImageNet shifted datasets and other model architectures such as LiT. Our proposed method is hyperparameter-free, requires no additional model training and can be easily scaled to other large multi-modal architectures. Code for our experiments is opensourced at link hidden for anonymity."}}

The proposed method consists of three main components. The first component generates high-quality foreground object masks. To this end, an EM-like approach is proposed that iteratively refines an initial set of object mask proposals generated by a generic entity segmentation method. Next, in the second component, high-quality context-aware background images are generated using a text-to-image compositional synthesis method like DALL-E. Finally, the third component creates a large-scale pseudo-labeled instance segmentation training dataset by compositing the foreground object masks onto the original and generated background images. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art weakly-supervised instance segmentation results on both the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO dataset by using only image-level, weak label information. In particular, it outperforms the best baseline by +7.4 and +2.8 mAP-0.50 on PASCAL and COCO, respectively. Further, the method provides a new solution to the long-tail weakly-supervised instance segmentation problem (when many classes may only have few training samples), by selectively augmenting under-represented classes."}}

Most current LL is limited to a single agent that learns tasks sequentially. Dedicated LL machinery is then deployed to mitigate the forgetting of old tasks as new tasks are learned. This is inherently slow. We propose a new Shared Knowledge Lifelong Learning (SKILL) learning paradigm, which deploys a population of LL agents that each learn different tasks independently and in parallel. After learning their respective tasks, agents share and consolidate their knowledge over a communication network, so that, in the end, all agents can master all tasks. Our approach relies on a frozen backbone embedded in all agents at manufacturing time, so that only the last layer head plus some small adjustments to the backbone beneficial biases are learned for each task. To eliminate the need for a task oracle, agents also learn and share summary statistics about their training datasets (Gaussian Mixture Clusters), or share a few training images, to help other agents assign test samples to the correct head using a Mahalanobis task mapper. On a new, very challenging dataset with 102 image classification tasks, we achieve significant speedup over 18 LL baselines (e.g., >9,000x speedup over single-agent EWC) while also achieving higher (and SOTA) accuracy."}}

We build a humanoid vision engine (HVE) that explicitly and separately computes shape, texture, and color features from images. The resulting feature vectors are then concatenated to support the final classification. We show that HVE can summarize and rank-order the contributions of the three features to object recognition. We use human experiments to confirm that both HVE and humans predominantly use some specific features to support the classification of specific classes (e.g., texture is the dominant feature to distinguish a zebra from other quadrupeds, both for humans and HVE). With the help of HVE, given any environment (dataset), we can summarize the most important features for the whole task (task-specific; e.g., color is the most important feature overall for classification with the CUB dataset), and for each class (class-specific; e.g., shape is the most important feature to recognize boats in the iLab-20M dataset). To demonstrate more usefulness of HVE, we use it to simulate the open-world zero-shot learning ability of humans with no attribute labeling. Finally, we show that HVE can also simulate human imagination ability with the combination of different features."}}

The proposed approach decouples training data generation into foreground object mask generation and background (context) image generation. For foreground object mask generation, we use a simple textual template with object class name as input to DALL-E to generate a diverse set of foreground images. A foreground-background segmentation algorithm is then used to generate foreground object masks. Next, in order to generate context images, first a language description of the context is generated by applying an image captioning method on a small set of images representing the context. These language descriptions are then used to generate diverse sets of context images using the DALL-E framework. These are then composited with object masks generated in the first step to provide an augmented training set for a classifier. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach on four object detection datasets including on Pascal VOC and COCO object detection tasks. Furthermore, we also highlight the compositional nature of our data generation approach on out-of-distribution and zero-shot data generation scenarios."}}

It not only can learn and benefit from experience, but also can adapt to new situations. In contrast, deep neural networks only learn one sophisticated but fixed mapping from inputs to outputs. This limits their applicability to more dynamic situations, where the input to output mapping may change with different contexts. A salient example is continual learning-learning new independent tasks sequentially without forgetting previous tasks. Continual learning of multiple tasks in artificial neural networks using gradient descent leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereby a previously learned mapping of an old task is erased when learning new mappings for new tasks. Herein, we propose a new biologically plausible type of deep neural network with extra, out-of-network, task-dependent biasing units to accommodate these dynamic situations. This allows, for the first time, a single network to learn potentially unlimited parallel input to output mappings, and to switch on the fly between them at runtime. Biasing units are programed by leveraging beneficial perturbations (opposite to well-known adversarial perturbations) for each task. Beneficial perturbations for a given task bias the network toward that task, essentially switching the network into a different mode to process that task. This largely eliminates catastrophic interference between tasks. Our approach is memory-efficient and parameter-efficient, can accommodate many tasks, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance across different tasks and domains."}}

This process is incredibly time-consuming, and it is challenging to ensure that the captured data distribution maps well to the target domain of an application scenario. Recently, synthetic data has emerged as a way to address both of these issues. However, existing approaches either require human experts to manually tune each scene property or use automatic methods that provide little to no control; this requires rendering large amounts of random data variations, which is slow and is often suboptimal for the target domain. We present the first fully differentiable synthetic data pipeline that uses Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in a closed-loop with a target application\u2019s loss function. Our approach generates data on-demand, with no human labor, to maximize accuracy for a target task. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on synthetic and real-world object detection tasks.

We propose a novel framework, Invariant Structure Learning (ISL), that is designed to improve causal structure discovery by utilizing generalization as an indication. ISL splits the data into different environments, and learns a structure that is invariant to the target across different environments by imposing a consistency constraint. An aggregation mechanism then selects the optimal classifier based on a graph structure that reflects the causal mechanisms in the data more accurately compared to the structures learnt from individual environments. Furthermore, we extend ISL to a self-supervised learning setting where accurate causal structure discovery does not rely on any labels. This self-supervised ISL utilizes invariant causality proposals by iteratively setting different nodes as targets. On synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that ISL accurately discovers the causal structure, outperforms alternative methods, and yields superior generalization for datasets with significant distribution shifts."}}

Yet they suffer from a lack of transparency and interpretability, which hinders intuitive and effective human interactions with them. Especially when NN makes mistakes, humans can hardly locate the reason for the error, and correcting it is even harder. While recent advances in explainable AI have substantially improved the explainability of NNs, effective knowledge exchange between humans and NNs is still under-explored. To fill this gap, we propose Human-NN-Interface (HNI), a framework using a structural representation of visual concepts as a \u201dlanguage\u201d for humans and NN to communicate, interact, and exchange knowledge. Take image classification as an example, HNI visualizes the reasoning logic of a NN with class-specific Structural Concept Graphs (c-SCG), which are human-interpretable. On the other hand, humans can effectively provide feedback and guidance to the NN by modifying the c-SCG, and transferring the knowledge back to NN through HNI. We demonstrate the efficacy of HNI with image classification tasks and 3 different types of interactions: (1) Explaining the reasoning logic of NNs so humans can intuitively identify and locate errors of NN; (2) human users can correct the errors and improve NN\u2019s performance by modifying the c-SCG and distilling the knowledge back to the original NN; (3) human users can intuitively guide NN and provide a new solution for zero-shot learning."}}

Two general problems remain underexplored in current methods: (1) They lack comprehensive disentanglement constraints, especially missing the minimization of mutual information between different attributes across latent and observation domains. (2) They lack convexity constraints in disentangled latent space, which is important for meaningfully manipulating specific attributes for downstream tasks. To encourage both comprehensive C-Dis-RL and convexity simultaneously, we propose a simple yet efficient method: Controllable Interpolation Regularization (CIR), which creates a positive loop\nwhere the disentanglement and convexity can help each other. Specifically, we conduct controlled interpolation in latent space during training and \u2019reuse\u2019 the encoder to help form a \u2019perfect disentanglement\u2019 regularization. In that case, (a) disentanglement loss implicitly enlarges the potential \u2019understandable\u2019 distribution to encourage convexity; (b) convexity can in turn improve robust and precise disentanglement. CIR is a general module and we merge CIR with three different algorithms: ELEGANT, I2I-Dis, and GZS-Net to show the compatibility and effectiveness. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show improvement in C-Dis-RL and latent convexity by CIR. This further improves downstream tasks: controllable image synthesis, cross-modality image translation and zero-shot synthesis. More\nexperiments demonstrate CIR can also improve other downstream tasks, such as new attribute value mining, data augmentation, and eliminating bias for fairness."}}
