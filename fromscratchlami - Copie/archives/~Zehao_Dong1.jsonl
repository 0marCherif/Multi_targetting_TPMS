Prediction of the same patient events at different time horizons can have very different applications and interpretations; however, limited number of events in each potential time window hurts the effectiveness of conventional machine learning algorithms. We propose a novel time associated meta learning (TAML) method to make effective predictions at multiple future time points. We view time-associated disease prediction as classification tasks at multiple time points. Such closely-related classification tasks are an excellent candidate for model-based meta learning. To address the sparsity problem after task splitting, TAML employs a temporal information sharing strategy to augment the number of positive samples and include the prediction of related phenotypes or events in the meta-training phase. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAML on multiple clinical datasets, where it consistently outperforms a range of strong baselines. We also develop a MetaEHR package for implementing both time-associated and time-independent few-shot prediction on EHR data."}}

In the past decades, intensive research efforts have only been paid to automate the transistor sizing with a given circuit topology. By recognizing the graph nature of circuits, this paper presents a Circuit Graph Neural Network (CktGNN) that simultaneously automates the circuit topology generation and device sizing based on the encoder-dependent optimization subroutines. Particularly, CktGNN encodes circuit graphs using a two-level GNN framework (of nested GNN) where circuits are represented as combinations of subgraphs in a known subgraph basis. In this way, it significantly improves efficiency by reducing the number of subgraphs to perform message passing.\n\nNonetheless, another critical roadblock to advancing learning-assisted circuit design automation is a lack of public benchmarks to perform canonical assessment and reproducible research. To tackle the challenge, we introduce Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB), an open-sourced dataset that contains $10$K distinct operational amplifiers with carefully-extracted circuit specifications from physical implementations. OCB also equips with communicative circuit generation and evaluation capabilities such that it can be used to generalize the applicability of CktGNN to design various analog circuits by efficiently producing corresponding datasets. Experiments on OCB show the extraordinary advantages of CktGNN through representation-based optimization frameworks over other recent powerful GNN baselines and manual design from human experts. Our work paves the way toward a learning-based open-sourced design automation flow for analog circuits."}}

However, effective and synergistic drug combination prediction remains an open question because of the unknown causal disease signaling pathways. Though various deep learning (AI) models have been proposed to quantitatively predict the synergism of drug combinations. The major limitation of existing deep learning methods is that they are inherently not interpretable, which makes the conclusion of AI models un-transparent to human experts, henceforth limiting the robustness of the model conclusion and the implementation ability of these models in the real-world human-AI healthcare. In this paper, we develop an interpretable graph neural network (GNN) that reveals the underlying essential therapeutic targets and mechanism of the synergy (MoS) by mining the sub-molecular network of great importance. The key point of the interpretable GNN prediction model is a novel graph pooling layer, Self-Attention based Node and Edge pool (henceforth SANEpool), that can compute the attention score (importance) of nodes and edges based on the node features and the graph topology. As such, the proposed GNN model provides a systematic way to predict and interpret the drug combination synergism based on the detected crucial sub-molecular network. We evaluate SANEpool on molecular networks formulated by genes from 46 core cancer signaling pathways and drug combinations from NCI ALMANAC drug combination screening data. The experimental results indicate that 1) SANEpool can achieve the current state-of-art performance among other popular graph neural networks; and 2) the sub-molecular network detected by SANEpool are self-explainable and salient for identifying synergistic drug combinations."}}

Encoding DAGs into real vectors is a dominant component in most neural-network-based DAG optimization frameworks. Currently, most popular DAG encoders use an asynchronous message passing scheme which sequentially processes nodes according to the dependency between nodes in a DAG. That is, a node must not be processed until all its predecessors are processed. As a result, they are inherently not parallelizable. In this work, we propose a Parallelizable Attention-based Computation structure Encoder (PACE) that processes nodes simultaneously and encodes DAGs in parallel. We demonstrate the superiority of PACE through  encoder-dependent optimization subroutines that search the optimal DAG structure based on the learned DAG embeddings. Experiments show that PACE not only improves the effectiveness over previous sequential DAG encoders with a significantly boosted training and inference speed, but also generates smooth latent (DAG encoding) spaces that are beneficial to downstream optimization subroutines."}}
