We\nexploit the known form of the value function along with a time reversal\ntransformation that nicely addresses the boundary condition consistency.\nWe provide the results of an experimental investigation with the aim of\nshowing how the proposed solution performs with respect to the optimal\nsolution. Finally, we also show that the proposed solution turns out to be\na valid alternative to model predictive control strategies, whose computational burden is dramatically reduced."}}

While subscribing to this view, this book criticizes the supposed scientific progress in the field and proposes the investigation of vision within the framework of information-based laws of nature. Specifically, the present work poses fundamental questions about vision that remain far from understood, leading the reader on a journey populated by novel challenges resonating with the foundations of machine learning. The central thesis is that for a deeper understanding of visual computational processes, it is necessary to look beyond the applications of general purpose machine learning algorithms and focus instead on appropriate learning theories that take into account the spatiotemporal nature of the visual signal."}}
