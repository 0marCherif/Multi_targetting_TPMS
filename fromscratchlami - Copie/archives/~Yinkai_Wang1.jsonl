Specifically, we first formulate the problem of deep graph generation and discuss its difference with several related graph learning tasks. Secondly, we divide the state-of-the-art methods into three categories based on model architectures and summarize their generation strategies.

However, the advance of deep generative models is limited by the challenges to generate objects that possess multiple desired properties because: 1) the existence of complex correlation among real-world properties is common but hard to identify; 2) controlling individual property enforces an implicit partially control of its correlated properties, which is difficult to model; 3) controlling multiple properties under variour manners simultaneously is hard and underexplored. We address these challenges by proposing a novel deep generative framework that recovers semantics and correlation of properties through disentangled latent vectors. The correlation is handled via an explainable mask pooling layer, and properties are precisely retained by the generated objects via the mutual dependence between latent vectors and properties. Our generative model preserves properties of interest while handles correlation and conflicts of properties under a multi-objective optimization framework. The experiments demonstrate our model's superior performance in generating objects with desired properties."}}

In-silico molecular design remains challenging, primarily due to the complexity of the chemical space and the non-trivial relationship between chemical structures and biological properties. Deep generative models that learn directly from data are intriguing, but they have yet to demonstrate interpretability in the learned representation, so we can learn more about the relationship between the chemical and biological space. In this paper, we advance research on disentangled representation learning for small molecule generation. We build on recent work by us and others on deep graph generative frameworks, which capture atomic interactions via a graph-based representation of a small molecule. The methodological novelty is how we leverage the concept of disentanglement in the graph variational autoencoder framework both to generate biologically-relevant small molecules and to enhance model interpretability."}}

Large datasets of small molecules have allowed training deep models that have been shown capable of exploring the underlying chemical space and generating valid, novel, and unique molecules. While this is a noteworthy achievement, what impedes operationalizing these models in the wet laboratory is the ability to link the chemical and biological space of small molecules. A central challenge to this is the lack of activity data on these entities. In this paper we relate a computational pipeline that permits linking the chemical and biological space of an important class of small molecules, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). Our experimental collaborators have characterized the activity of many QACs against Staphylococcus aureus. We train various generative models and evaluate their ability to generate valid, novel, and unique QACs. We then leverage classification models trained over activity data to evaluate the generated QACs. The resulting pipeline identifies valid, novel, unique, membrane-active QACs. This work opens the way to further avenues of research in machine learning models capable of jointly sampling the chemical and biological space of small molecules."}}

Meeting this challenge promises great translational impacts across drug discovery, material sciences, biotechnology, and more. Recent momentum in deep learning promises to advance our computational capabilities on molecule generation. In particular, deep graph generative models which treat molecule design as a graph generation problem are allowing us to directly learn from existing databases of small molecules and generate novel, valid molecules. Currently, these models have many shortcomings, including poor controllability of desired molecular properties, especially in practical application where the training data is usually small, noisy, and incomplete. This paper focuses on equipping graph variational autoencoders with the ability to control for desired properties and its practical application in a practical application which is the generation of Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (QAC). Several controllable graph generation mechanisms are investigated for their effectiveness. A general framework is then proposed to extend these mechanisms by our newly proposed objective function to handle the challenges in practical applications where the property value annotations are usually censored and not fully available in all training samples. The experimental evaluation considers an experimentally-characterized dataset of antimicrobial small molecules with wet-lab characterized activity against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models and control of desired properties."}}
