The highly combinatorial nature of the problems commonly addressed by MCTS requires the use of efficient exploration strategies for navigating the planning tree and quickly convergent value backup methods. These crucial problems are particularly evident in recent advances that combine MCTS with deep neural networks for function approximation. In this work, we introduce a mathematical framework based on using the $\\alpha$-divergence for backup and exploration in MCTS. We show that this theoretical formulation unifies different approaches, including our newly introduced ones (Power-UCT and E3W), under the same mathematical framework, allowing us to obtain different methods by simply changing the value of $\\alpha$. In practice, our unified perspective offers a flexible way to balance exploration and exploitation by tuning the single $\\alpha$ parameter according to the problem at hand. We validate our methods through a rigorous empirical study of a basic toy task Synthetic Tree problem."}}

Notoriously, these methods heavily rely on the application of the optimal Bellman operator, which needs to be approximated from samples. Most approaches consider only a single Bellman iteration, which limits their power. In this paper, we introduce iterated Deep Q-Network (iDQN), a new DQN-based algorithm that incorporates several consecutive Bellman iterations into the training loss. iDQN leverages the online network of DQN to build a target for a second online network, which in turn serves as a target for a third online network, and so forth, thereby taking into account future Bellman iterations. While using the same number of gradient steps, iDQN allows for better learning of the Bellman iterations than DQN. After providing some theoretical guarantees, we evaluate iDQN against relevant baselines on $54$ Atari $2600$ games to showcase its benefit in terms of approximation error and performance. iDQN outperforms DQN while being orthogonal to more advanced DQN-based approaches."}}

In problems with unknown models, the Bellman operator requires transition samples that strongly determine its behavior, as uninformative samples can result in negligible updates or long detours before reaching the fixed point. In this work, we introduce the novel idea of obtaining an approximation of the Bellman operator, which we call projected Bellman operator (PBO). Our PBO is a parametric operator on the parameter space of a given value function. Given the parameters of a value function, PBO outputs the parameters of a new value function and converges to a fixed point in the limit, as a standard Bellman operator. Notably, our PBO can approximate repeated applications of the true Bellman operator at once, as opposed to the sequential nature of the standard Bellman operator. We prove the important consequences of this finding for different classes of problems by analyzing PBO in terms of stability, convergence, and approximation error. Eventually, we propose an approximate value-iteration algorithm to show how PBO can overcome the limitations of classical methods, opening up multiple research directions as a novel paradigm in reinforcement learning."}}

However, finding an exact way of reusing action-values in this setting is still a poorly understood problem. In this paper, we introduce the concept of boosting to curriculum value-based RL, by approximating the action-value function as a sum of residuals trained on each task. This approach, which we refer to as boosted curriculum reinforcement learning (BCRL), has the benefit of naturally increasing the representativeness of the functional space by adding a new residual each time a new task is presented. This procedure allows reusing previous action-values while promoting expressiveness of the action-value function. We theoretically study BCRL as an approximate value iteration algorithm, discussing advantages over regular curriculum RL in terms of approximation accuracy and convergence to the optimal action-value function. Finally, we provide detailed empirical evidence of the benefits of BCRL in problems requiring curricula for accurate action-value estimation and targeted exploration."}}

Despite empirical successes, an open question in CRL is how to automatically generate a curriculum for a given reinforcement learning (RL) agent, avoiding manual design. In this paper, we propose an answer by interpreting the curriculum generation as an inference problem, where distributions over tasks are progressively learned to approach the target task. This approach leads to an automatic curriculum generation, whose pace is controlled by the agent, with solid theoretical motivation and easily integrated with deep RL algorithms. In the conducted experiments, the curricula generated with the proposed algorithm significantly improve learning performance across several environments and deep RL algorithms, matching or outperforming state-of-the-art existing CRL algorithms."}}

The lack of a tractable but principled exploration approach unnecessarily complicates the application of reinforcement learning to a broader range of problems. Efficient exploration can be accomplished by relying on the uncertainty of the stateaction value function. To obtain the uncertainty, we maintain an ensemble of value function estimates and present an optimistic Bellman equation (OBE) for such ensembles. This OBE is derived from a relative entropy maximization principle and yields an implicit exploration bonus resulting in improved exploration during action selection. The implied exploration bonus can be seen as a well-principled type of intrinsic motivation and exhibits favorable theoretical properties. OBE can be applied to a wide range of algorithms. We propose two algorithms as an application of the principle: Optimistic Q-learning and Optimistic DQN which outperform comparison methods on standard benchmarks"}}

Meanwhile, their inherent sample efficiency warrants utility for most robot applications, limiting potential damage to the robot and its environment during training. Inspired by information theoretic model predictive control and advances in deep reinforcement learning, we introduce Model Predictive Actor-Critic (MoPAC), a hybrid model-based/model-free method that combines model predictive rollouts with policy optimization as to mitigate model bias. MoPAC leverages optimal trajectories to guide policy learning, but explores via its model-free method, allowing the algorithm to learn more expressive dynamics models. This combination guarantees optimal skill learning up to an approximation error and reduces necessary physical interaction with the environment, making it suitable for real-robot training. We provide extensive results showcasing how our proposed method generally outperforms current state-of-the-art and conclude by evaluating MoPAC for learning on a physical robotic hand performing valve rotation and finger gaiting--a task that requires grasping, manipulation, and then regrasping of an object."}}

For reinforcement learning (RL), curricula are especially interesting, as the underlying optimization has a strong tendency to get stuck in local optima due to the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Recently, a number of approaches for an automatic generation of curricula for RL have been shown to increase performance while requiring less expert knowledge compared to manually designed curricula. However, these approaches are seldomly investigated from a theoretical perspective, preventing a deeper understanding of their mechanics. In this paper, we present an approach for automated curriculum generation in RL with a clear theoretical underpinning. More precisely, we formalize the well-known self-paced learning paradigm as inducing a distribution over training tasks, which trades off between task complexity and the objective to match a desired task distribution. Experiments show that training on this induced distribution helps to avoid poor local optima across RL algorithms in different tasks with uninformative rewards and challenging exploration requirements."}}

The recent AlphaGo and AlphaZero algorithms have shown how to successfully combine these two paradigms to solve large scale sequential decision problems. These methodologies exploit a variant of the well-known UCT algorithm to trade off the exploitation of good actions and the exploration of unvisited states, but their empirical success comes at the cost of poor sample-efficiency and high computation time. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by studying the benefit of convex regularization in Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to drive exploration efficiently and to improve policy updates, as already observed in RL. First, we introduce a unifying theory on the use of generic convex regularizers in MCTS, deriving the first regret analysis of regularized MCTS and showing that it guarantees an exponential convergence rate. Second, we exploit our theoretical framework to introduce novel regularized backup operators for MCTS, based on the relative entropy of the policy update and on the Tsallis entropy of the policy. We provide an intuitive demonstration of the effect of each regularizer empirically verifying the consequence of our theoretical results on a toy problem. Finally, we show how our framework can easily be incorporated in AlphaGo and AlphaZero, and we empirically show the superiority of convex regularization w.r.t. representative baselines, on well-known RL problems across several Atari games."}}
