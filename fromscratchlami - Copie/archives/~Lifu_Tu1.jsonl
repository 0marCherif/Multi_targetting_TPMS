This is partly due to the high cost of obtaining non-English conversational data, which results in limited coverage. In this work, we introduce XSGD, a parallel and large-scale multilingual conversation dataset that we created by translating the English-only Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset (Rastogi et al., 2020) into 105 other languages. XSGD contains approximately 330k utterances per language. To facilitate aligned cross-lingual representations, we develop an efficient prompt-tuning-based method for learning alignment prompts. We also investigate two different classifiers: NLI-based and vanilla classifiers, and test cross-lingual capability enabled by the aligned prompts. We evaluate our model's cross-lingual generalization capabilities on two conversation tasks: slot-filling and intent classification. Our results demonstrate the strong and efficient modeling ability of NLI-based classifiers and the large cross-lingual transfer improvements achieved by our aligned prompts, particularly in few-shot settings."}}

In this work, we aim to develop unsupervised methods by proposing two methods that create pseudo query-document pairs and train dense retrieval models in an annotation-free and scalable manner: query extraction and transferred query generation. The former method produces pseudo queries by selecting salient spans from the original document. The latter utilizes generation models trained for other NLP tasks (e.g., summarization) to produce pseudo queries. Extensive experiments show that models trained with the proposed augmentation methods can perform comparably well (or better) to multiple strong baselines. Combining those strategies leads to further improvements, achieving the state-of-the-art performance of unsupervised dense retrieval on both BEIR and ODQA datasets."}}

The prevalence of large language models advances the state-of-the-art for program synthesis, though limited training resources and data impede open access to such models. To democratize this, we train and release a family of large language models up to 16.1B parameters, called CODEGEN, on natural language and programming language data, and open source the training library JAXFORMER. We show the utility of the trained model by demonstrating that it is competitive with the previous state-of-the-art on zero-shot Python code generation on HumanEval. We further investigate the multi-step paradigm for program synthesis, where a single program is factorized into multiple prompts specifying subproblems. To this end, we construct an open benchmark, Multi-Turn Programming Benchmark (MTPB), consisting of 115 diverse problem sets that are factorized into multi-turn prompts. Our analysis on MTPB shows that the same intent provided to CODEGEN in multi-turn fashion significantly improves program synthesis over that provided as a single turn. We make the training library JAXFORMER and model checkpoints available as open source contribution: https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen."}}

Tu & Gimpel (2018) developed an efficient framework for energy-based models by training \u201cinference networks\u201d to approximate structured inference instead of using gradient descent. However, their alternating optimization approach suffers from instabilities during training, requiring additional loss terms and careful hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we contribute several strategies to stabilize and improve this joint training of energy functions and inference networks for structured prediction. We design a compound objective to jointly train both cost-augmented and test-time inference networks along with the energy function. We propose joint parameterizations for the inference networks that encourage them to capture complementary functionality during learning. We empirically validate our strategies on two sequence labeling tasks, showing easier paths to strong performance than prior work, as well as further improvements with global energy terms."}}

Prior work used gradient descent for inference, relaxing the structured output to a set of continuous variables and then optimizing the energy with respect to them. We replace this use of gradient descent with a neural network trained to approximate structured argmax inference. This\n\u201cinference network\u201d outputs continuous values that we treat as the output structure. We develop large-margin training criteria for joint training of the structured energy function and inference network. On multi-label classification we report speed-ups\nof 10-60x compared to (Belanger et al., 2017) while also improving accuracy. For sequence labeling with simple structured energies, our approach performs comparably to exact inference while being much faster at test time. We then demonstrate improved accuracy by augmenting the energy with a \u201clabel language model\u201d that scores entire output label sequences, showing it can improve handling of long-distance dependencies in part-of-speech tagging. Finally, we show how inference networks can replace dynamic programming for test-time inference in conditional random fields, suggestive for their general use for fast inference in structured settings."}}

We develop neural network models for scoring tuples on arbitrary phrases and evaluate them by their ability to distinguish true held-out tuples from false ones.

We manually evaluate our trained model\u2019s ability to assign quality scores to novel tuples, finding that it can propose tuples at the same quality level as mediumconfidence tuples from ConceptNet."}}
