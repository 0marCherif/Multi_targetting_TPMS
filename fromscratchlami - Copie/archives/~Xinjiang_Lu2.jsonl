However, as the heterogeneity brought by the higher cardinality of edges and relations climbs up, more trivial relations are taken into account for the downstream task since they are often highly correlated to the target. As a result, with being forced to fit the non-causal relational patterns on the training set, the downstream model, like graph neural network (GNN), may suffer from poor generalizability on the testing set since the inference is mainly made according to misleading clues. In this paper, under the paradigm of graph convolution, we probe the multi-relational message passing process from the perspective of causality and then propose a Message Intervention method for learning generalizable muLtirElational gRaph representations, coined MILER. In particular, MILER first encodes the vertices and relations into embeddings with relational and directional awareness, then a message diverter is employed to split the original message flow into two flows of interest, i.e., the causal and trivial message flows. Afterward, the message intervention is carried out with the guidance of the backdoor adjustment rule. Extensive experiments on several knowledge graph benchmarks validate the effectiveness as well as the superior generalization ability of MILER."}}

However, the invariance assumptions may not hold in real-world time-series data, and the infamous negative sampling could bring in new biases for representation learning. In this work, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach toward time series representation learning on top of trend-seasonality decomposition, namely TS-DC. TS-DC differentiates itself from prior methods in three folds: 1) a time series decomposition approach is devised to distill different aspects/components of a complex time series; 2) a novel component-wise contrastive loss is proposed in which negative sampling is not necessary; 3) the informative signals of time series can be captured comprehensively by means of adaptive contrasting. Extensive experiments on different public benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of our proposed representation learning method. "}}

However, it is common that real-world time series data are recorded in a short time period, which results in a big gap between the deep model and the limited and noisy time series. In this work, we propose to address the time series forecasting problem with generative modeling and propose a bidirectional variational auto-encoder (BVAE) equipped with diffusion, denoise, and disentanglement, namely D3VAE. Specifically, a coupled diffusion probabilistic model is proposed to augment the time series data without increasing the aleatoric uncertainty and implement a more tractable inference process with BVAE. To ensure the generated series move toward the true target, we further propose to adapt and integrate the multiscale denoising score matching into the diffusion process for time series forecasting. In addition, to enhance the interpretability and stability of the prediction, we treat the latent variable in a multivariate manner and disentangle them on top of minimizing total correlation. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that D3VAE outperforms competitive algorithms with remarkable margins. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSpatial/tree/main/research/D3VAE."}}

It is a non-trivial task since the searching space is vast, which may lead to distinct travel experiences in different out-of-town regions and eventually confuse decision-making. Besides, users' out-of-town travel behaviors are affected not only by their personalized preferences but heavily by others' travel behaviors. To this end, we propose a Crowd-Aware Pre-Travel Out-of-town Recommendation framework (CAPTOR) consisting of two major modules: spatial-affined conditional random field (SA-CRF) and crowd behavior memory network (CBMN). Specifically, SA-CRF captures the spatial affinity among POIs while preserving the inherent information of POIs. Then, CBMN is proposed to maintain the crowd travel behaviors w.r.t. each region through three affiliated blocks reading and writing the memory adaptively. We devise the elaborated metric space with a dynamic mapping mechanism, where the users and POIs are distinguishable both inherently and geographically. Extensive experiments on two real-world nationwide datasets validate the effectiveness of CAPTOR against the pre-travel out-of-town recommendation task."}}

Previous transportation recommendation solutions fail to deliver satisfactory user experience because their recommendations only consider routes in one transportation mode (uni-modal, e.g., taxi, bus, cycle) and largely overlook situational context. In this work, we propose <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf {Hydra}$</tex-math></inline-formula> , a multi-task deep learning based recommendation system that offers multi-modal transportation planning and is adaptive to various situational context (e.g., nearby point-of-interest (POI) distribution and weather). We leverage the availability of existing routing engines and big urban data, and design a novel two-level framework that integrates uni-modal and multi-modal (e.g., taxi-bus, bus-cycle) routes as well as heterogeneous urban data for intelligent multi-modal transportation recommendation. In addition to urban context features constructed from multi-source urban data, we learn the latent representations of users, origin-destination (OD) pairs and transportation modes based on user implicit feedbacks, which captures the collaborative transportation mode preferences of users and OD pairs. Moreover, we propose two models to recommend the proper route among various uni-modal and multi-modal transportation routes: (1) a light-weight gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) based recommendation model; and (2) a multi-task wide and deep learning (MTWDL) based recommendation model. We also optimize the framework to support real-time, large-scale route query and recommendation.
