Most of this work has focused on relatively \"easy'' PDE operators (e.g., elliptic and parabolic), with less emphasis on relatively ``hard'' PDE operators (e.g., hyperbolic).  Within numerical PDEs, the latter need to maintain a type of volume element or conservation constraint for a desired physical quantity, which is known to be challenging. Delivering on the promise of SciML requires seamlessly incorporating both types of problems into the learning process.  To address this issue, we propose ProbConserv, a framework for incorporating constraints into a black-box probabilistic deep-learning architecture. To do so, ProbConserv combines the integral form of a conservation law with a Bayesian update. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProbConserv via a case study of the Generalized Porous Medium Equation (GPME), a parameterized family of equations that includes both easier and harder PDEs. On the challenging Stefan variant of the GPME, we show that ProbConserv seamlessly enforces physical conservation constraints, maintains probabilistic uncertainty quantification (UQ), and deals well with shocks and heteroscedasticity. In addition, it achieves superior predictive performance on downstream tasks."}}

These constraints carry important physical meaning, and guarantee the existence and the uniqueness of the PDE solution. Current neural-network based approaches that aim to solve PDEs rely only on training data to help the model learn BCs implicitly, however, there is no guarantee of BC satisfaction by these models during evaluation. In this work, we propose Boundary enforcing Operator Network (BOON) that enables the BC satisfaction of neural operators by making structural changes to the operator kernel. We provide our refinement procedure, and demonstrate the satisfaction of physics-based BCs such as Dirichlet, Neumann, and periodic by the solutions obtained by BOON. Numerical experiments based on multiple PDEs with a wide variety of applications indicate that the proposed approach ensures satisfaction of BCs, and leads to more accurate solutions over the whole domain. The proposed method exhibits a (2X-20X) improvement in accuracy (0.000084 relative $L^2$ error for Burgers' equation). Code available at: https://github.com/amazon-science/boon."}}
