Temporal link prediction (TLP) is a classic yet challenging inference task on dynamic graphs, which predicts possible future linkage based on historical topology. The predicted future topology can be used to support some advanced applications on real-world systems (e.g., resource pre-allocation) for better system performance. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing TLP methods. Concretely, we first give the formal problem statements and preliminaries regarding data models, task settings, and learning paradigms that are commonly used in related research. A hierarchical fine-grained taxonomy is further introduced to categorize existing methods in terms of their data models, learning paradigms, and techniques. From a generic perspective, we propose a unified encoder-decoder framework to formulate all the methods reviewed, where different approaches only differ in terms of some components of the framework. Moreover, we envision serving the community with an open-source project OpenTLP that refactors or implements some representative TLP methods using the proposed unified framework and summarizes other public resources. As a conclusion, we finally discuss advanced topics in recent research and highlight possible future directions."}}

Due to the NP-hardness, to balance the CD quality and efficiency remains a challenge. Most existing CD methods are transductive, which are independently optimized only for the CD on a single graph. Some of these methods use advanced machine learning techniques to obtain high-quality CD results but usually have high complexity. Other approaches use fast heuristic approximation to ensure low runtime but may suffer from quality degradation. In contrast to these transductive methods, we propose an alternative inductive community detection (ICD) method across graphs of a system or scenario to alleviate the NP-hard challenge. ICD first conducts the offline training of an adversarial dual GNN on historical graphs to capture key properties of the system. The trained model is then directly generalized to new unseen graphs for online CD without additional optimization, where a better trade-off between quality and efficiency can be achieved. ICD can also capture the permutation invariant community labels in the offline training and tackle the online CD on new graphs with non-fixed number of nodes and communities. Experiments on a set of benchmarks demonstrate that ICD can achieve a significant trade-off between quality and efficiency over various baselines."}}

Due to the NP-hardness, to balance the quality and efficiency of GP remains a challenge. Existing methods use machine learning techniques to obtain high-quality solutions but usually have high complexity. Some fast GP methods adopt heuristic strategies to ensure low runtime but suffer from quality degradation. In contrast to conventional transductive GP methods applied to a static graph, we propose an inductive graph partitioning (IGP) framework across multiple evolving graph snapshots to alleviate the NP-hard challenge. IGP first conducts the offline training of a novel dual graph neural network on historical snapshots to capture the structural properties of a system. The trained model is then generalized to newly generated snapshots for fast high-quality online GP without additional optimization, where a better trade-off between quality and efficiency is achieved. IGP is also a generic framework that can capture the permutation invariant partitioning ground-truth of historical snapshots in the offline training and tackle the online GP on graphs with non-fixed number of nodes and clusters. Experiments on a set of benchmarks demonstrate that IGP achieves competitive quality and efficiency to various state-of-the-art baselines."}}

In this study, we focus on the hybrid identification of overlapping communities with network topology (e.g., user interaction) and edge-induced content (e.g., user messages). Conventional hybrid methods tend to combine topology and node-induced content to explore disjoint communities, but fail to integrate edge-induced content and to derive overlapping communities. Moreover, although several semantic community detection approaches have been developed, which can generate the semantic description for each community besides the partition result, they can only incorporate the word-level content to derived coarse-grained descriptions. We propose a novel Semantic Link Community Detection (SLCD) model based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). It adopts the perspective of link communities to integrate topology and edge-induced content, where the partitioned link communities can be further transformed into an overlapping node-induced membership. Moreover, SLCD incorporates both the word-level and sentence-level content while considering the diversity of user messages. Hence, it can also derive strongly interpretable and multi-view community descriptions simultaneously when community partition is finished. SLCD's superior performance and powerful application ability over other state-of-the-art competitors are further demonstrated in our experiments on a series of real social networks."}}

Different from conventional techniques of temporal link prediction that ignore the potential non-linear characteristics and the informative link weights in the dynamic network, we introduce a novel non-linear model GCN-GAN to tackle the challenging temporal link prediction task of weighted dynamic networks. The proposed model leverages the benefits of the graph convolutional network (GCN), long short-term memory (LSTM) as well as the generative adversarial network (GAN). Thus, the dynamics, topology structure and evolutionary patterns of weighted dynamic networks can be fully exploited to improve the temporal link prediction performance. Concretely, we first utilize GCN to explore the local topological characteristics of each single snapshot and then employ LSTM to characterize the evolving features of the dynamic networks. Moreover, GAN is used to enhance the ability of the model to generate the next weighted network snapshot, which can effectively tackle the sparsity and the wide-value-range problem of edge weights in real-life dynamic networks. To verify the model's effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on four datasets of different network systems and application scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves impressive results compared to the state-of-the-art competitors."}}
