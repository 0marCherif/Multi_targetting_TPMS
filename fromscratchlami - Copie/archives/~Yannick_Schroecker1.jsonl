We define diversity in terms of state-action occupancy measures, since policies with different occupancy measures visit different states on average. More importantly, defining diversity in this way allows us to derive an intrinsic reward function for maximizing the diversity directly. Our agent, DOMiNO, stands for Diversity Optimization Maintaining Near Optimally. It is based on maximizing a reward function with two components: the extrinsic reward and the diversity intrinsic reward, which are combined with Lagrange multipliers to balance the quality-diversity trade-off. Any RL algorithm can be used to maximize this reward and no other changes are needed. We demonstrate that given a simple reward functions in various control domains, like height (stand) and forward velocity (walk), DOMiNO discovers diverse and meaningful behaviours. We also perform extensive analysis of our approach, compare it with other multi-objective baselines, demonstrate that we can control both the quality and the diversity of the set via interpretable hyperparameters, and show that the set is robust to perturbations of the environment."}}

Recent works enable meta-gradients to adapt faster and learn from experience, by replacing the tuned meta-parameters of fixed update rules with learned meta-parameter functions of selected context features (Almeida et al., 2021; Flennerhag et al., 2022). We refer to these methods as contextual meta-gradients. The context features carry information about agent performance and changes in the environment and hence can inform learned meta-parameter schedules. As the properties of meta-gradient methods in non-stationary environments have not been systematically studied, the aim of this work is to provide such an analysis. Concretely, we ask: (i) how much information should be given to the learned optimizers so as to enable faster adaptation and generalization over a lifetime, (ii) what meta-optimizer functions are learned in this process, and (iii) whether meta-gradient methods provide a bigger advantage in highly non-stationary environments. We find that adding more contextual information is generally beneficial, leading to faster adaptation of meta-parameter values and increased performance. We support these results with a qualitative analysis of resulting meta-parameter schedules and learned functions of context features. Lastly, we find that without context, meta-gradients do not provide a consistent advantage over the baseline in highly non-stationary environments. Our findings suggest that contextualising meta-gradients can play a pivotal role in extracting high performance from meta-gradients in non-stationary settings."}}

The algorithm first bootstraps a target from the meta-learner, then optimises the meta-learner by minimising the distance to that target under some loss. Focusing on meta-learning with gradients, we establish conditions that guarantee performance improvements and show that the improvement is related to the target distance. Thus, by controlling curvature, the distance measure can be used to ease meta-optimization. Further, the bootstrapping mechanism can extend the effective meta-learning horizon without requiring backpropagation through all updates. The algorithm is versatile and easy to implement. We achieve a new state-of-the art for model-free agents on the Atari ALE benchmark, improve upon MAML in few-shot learning, and demonstrate how our approach opens up new possibilities by meta-learning efficient exploration in an epsilon-greedy Q-learning agent."}}

Unlocking this potential involves overcoming a challenging meta-optimisation problem. We propose an algorithm that tackles this problem by letting the meta-learner teach itself. The algorithm first bootstraps a target from the meta-learner, then optimises the meta-learner by minimising the distance to that target under a chosen (pseudo-)metric. Focusing on meta-learning with gradients, we establish conditions that guarantee performance improvements and show that metric can be used to control meta-optimisation. Meanwhile, the bootstrapping mechanism can extend the effective meta-learning horizon without requiring backpropagation through all updates. We achieve a new state-of-the art for model-free agents on the Atari ALE benchmark and demonstrate that it yields both performance and efficiency gains in multi-task meta-learning. Finally, we explore how bootstrapping opens up new possibilities and find that it can meta-learn efficient exploration in an epsilon-greedy Q-learning agent - without backpropagating through the update rule."}}

However, this may be insufficient in more realistic human domains. This work uses imitation learning to enable an agent in a constrained environment to concurrently reason about both its internal learning goals and environmental constraints externally imposed, all within its objective function. Experiments are conducted on a concept learning task to test generalization of the proposed algorithm to different environmental conditions and analyze how time and resource constraints impact efficacy of solving the learning problem. Our findings show the environmentally-aware learning agent is able to statistically outperform all other active learners explored under most of the constrained conditions. A key implication is adaptation for active learning agents to more realistic human environments, where constraints are often externally imposed on the learner."}}

In either case, effective solutions require the agent to reliably reach a specified state (a goal), or set of states (a demonstration). Drawing a connection between probabilistic long-term dynamics and the desired value function, this work introduces an approach that utilizes recent advances in density estimation to effectively learn to reach a given state. We develop a unified view on the two settings and show that the approach can be applied to both. In goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, we show it to circumvent the problem of sparse rewards while addressing hindsight bias in stochastic domains. In imitation learning, we show that the approach can learn from extremely sparse amounts of expert data and achieves state-of-the-art results on a common benchmark."}}

It is intuitively apparent that learning to take optimal actions is a simpler undertaking in situations that are similar to the ones shown by the teacher. However, imitation learning approaches do not tend to use this insight directly. In this paper, we introduce State Aware Imitation Learning (SAIL), an imitation learning algorithm that allows an agent to learn how to remain in states where it can confidently take the correct action and how to recover if it is lead astray. Key to this algorithm is a gradient learned using a temporal difference update rule which leads the agent to prefer states similar to the demonstrated states. We show that estimating a linear approximation of this gradient yields similar theoretical guarantees to online temporal difference learning approaches and empirically show that SAIL can effectively be used for imitation learning in continuous domains with non-linear function approximators used for both the policy representation and the gradient estimate."}}
