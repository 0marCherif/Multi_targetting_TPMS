It is one of the major common ophthalmic diseases worldwide which can potentially affect iris-based biometric systems. India, which hosts the largest biometrics project in the world, has about 8 million people undergoing cataract surgery annually. While existing research shows that cataract does not have a major impact on iris recognition, our observations suggest that the iris segmentation approaches are not well equipped to handle cataract or post cataract surgery cases. Therefore, failure in iris segmentation affects the overall recognition performance. This paper presents an efficient iris segmentation algorithm with variations due to cataract and post cataract surgery.\nThe proposed algorithm, termed as SegDenseNet, is a deep learning algorithm based on DenseNets. The experiments on the\nIIITD Cataract database show that improving the segmentation enhances the identification by up to 25% across different sensors\nand matchers."}}

Conventionally, dropout training invokes random drop of nodes from the hidden layers of a Neural Network. It is our hypothesis that a guided selection of nodes for intelligent dropout can lead to better generalization as compared to the traditional dropout. In this research, we propose \u201cguided dropout\u201d for training deep neural network which drop nodes by measuring the strength of each node. We also demonstrate that conventional dropout is a specific case of the proposed\nguided dropout. Experimental evaluation on multiple datasets including MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed guided dropout."}}

However, due to a large number of parameters in CNNs, they require a large number of training samples which is a limiting factor for small sample size problems. To address this limitation, we propose SSF-CNN which focuses on learning the \u201cstructure\u201d and \u201cstrength\u201d of filters. The structure of\nthe filter is initialized using a dictionary based filter learning algorithm and the strength of the filter is learned using the small sample training data. The architecture provides the flexibility of training with both small and large training databases, and yields good accuracies even with small size training data. The effectiveness of the algorithm is first demonstrated on MNIST, CIFAR10, and NORB databases, with varying number of training samples. The results show that SSF-CNN significantly reduces the number of parameters required for training while providing high accuracies on the test databases. On small sample size problems such as newborn face recognition and Omniglot, it yields state-of-the-art results. Specifically, on the IIITD Newborn Face Database, the results demonstrate improvement in rank-1 identification accuracy by at least 10%."}}

However, the performance of most of the existing supervised DNN algorithms degrade for classes which are unseen in the training set. To learn a discriminative classifier which yields good performance in Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) settings, we propose to generate an Over-Complete Distribution (OCD) using Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) of both seen and unseen classes. In order to enforce the separability between classes and reduce the class scatter, we propose the use of Online Batch Triplet Loss (OBTL) and Center Loss (CL) on the generated OCD. The effectiveness of the framework is evaluated using both Zero-Shot Learning and Generalized Zero-Shot Learning protocols on three publicly available benchmark databases, SUN, CUB and AWA2. The results show that generating over-complete distributions and enforcing the classifier to learn a transform function from overlapping to non-overlapping distributions can improve the performance on both seen and unseen classes."}}

However, very little is known about the relationship between the complexity of the input data along with the type of noise and the depth needed for correct classification.  Existing studies do not address the issue of common corruption adequately, especially in understanding what impact these corruptions leave on the individual part of a deep neural network. Therefore, we can safely assume that the classification (or misclassification) might be happening at a particular layer(s) of a network that accumulates to draw a final correct or incorrect prediction. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept called {\\bf corruption depth}, which identifies the location of the network layer/depth until the misclassification persists. We assert that the identification of such layers will help in better design of the network by pruning certain layers in comparison to the purification of the entire network which is computationally heavy to do. Through our extensive experiments, we present a coherent study in comparison to the existing studies which are diverse in understanding the processing of examples through the network. Our approach also illustrates different philosophies of example memorization and a one-dimensional view of sample or query difficulty. We believe that the understanding of the corruption depth can \\textbf{open a new dimension of model explainability}, where in place of just visualizing the attention map, the classification progress can be seen throughout the network."}}

In addition, the commercial success of mobile devices for iris image acquisition enables the easy acquisition of iris images both in an indoor controlled environment as well as an uncontrolled outdoor environment. At the same time, iris recognition systems can easily be attacked using wearable contact lenses. In the literature, several contact lens detection algorithms are proposed; however, the significant drawback is the generalizability under unseen testing domain images. In this research, a novel 3D contact lens iris presentation attack detection algorithm is developed and extensive experiments are performed. The experiments are performed using multiple challenging iris presentation attack databases including the IIITD and LivDet. For the evaluation, we have utilized the experimental protocols, which reflect in-the-wild settings for 3D contact lens iris presentation attack detection where the images belong to both controlled and adverse imaging conditions. The comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms establishes the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}}

In many cases, the same content with small variations is shared multiple times on different social media platforms. This leads to the circulation of manipulated content on the web. With the rapid advancement in deep learning algorithms, the generation of manipulated images with small variations in original images has become an easy task. These contents raise serious concerns when used for malicious activities. Therefore, detection of manipulated contents is of paramount importance. However, no large-scale dataset having manipulated images generated using both handcrafted and deep learning algorithms is available. Therefore, in this research, we have proposed a large dataset with more than 5.5 million images, termed as ManNet dataset. Additionally, we have benchmarked the performance of existing algorithms for manipulated image detection. The experimental results highlight that inter-set (disjoint training testing) evaluations are the major challenge of manipulated image detection."}}
