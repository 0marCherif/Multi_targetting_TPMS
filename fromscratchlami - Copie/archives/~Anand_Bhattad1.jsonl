Our approach generates images with realistic lighting effects, including cast shadows, soft shadows, inter-reflections, and glossy effects, without the need for paired or CGI data. StyLitGAN uses an intrinsic image method to decompose an image, followed by a search of the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN to identify a set of directions. By prompting the model to fix one component (e.g., albedo) and vary another (e.g., shading), we generate relighted images by adding the identified directions to the latent style codes. Quantitative metrics of change in albedo and lighting diversity allow us to choose effective directions using a forward selection process. Qualitative evaluation confirms the effectiveness of our method."}}

In contrast to all previous NeRF methods, DIVeR uses deterministic rather than stochastic estimates of the volume rendering integral. DIVeR's representation is a voxel based field of features. To compute the volume rendering integral, a ray is broken into intervals, one per voxel; components of the volume rendering integral are estimated from the features for each interval using an MLP, and the components are aggregated. As a result, DIVeR can render thin translucent structures that are missed by other integrators. Furthermore, DIVeR's representation has semantics that is relatively exposed compared to other such methods \u2013 moving feature vectors around in the voxel space results in natural edits. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons to current state-of-the-art methods show that DIVeR produces models that (1) render at or above state-of-the-art quality, (2) are very small without being baked, (3) render very fast without being baked, and (4) can be edited in natural ways.

Applications for such a procedure include generating training data and building authoring environments. Naive methods for doing this fail. One reason is that shading and albedo are quite strongly related; for example, sharp boundaries in shading tend to appear at depth discontinuities, which usually apparent in albedo. The same scene can be lit in different ways, and established theory shows the different lightings form a cone (the illumination cone). Novel theory shows that one can use similar scenes to estimate the different lightings that apply to a given scene, with bounded expected error. Our method exploits this theory to estimate a representation of the available lighting fields in the form of imputed generators of the illumination cone. Our procedure does not require expensive \"inverse graphics\" datasets, and sees no ground truth data of any kind. Qualitative evaluation suggests the method can erase and restore soft indoor shadows, and can \"steer\" light around a scene. We offer a summary quantitative evaluation of the method with a novel application of the FID. An extension of the FID allows per-generated-image evaluation. Furthermore, we offer qualitative evaluation with a user study, and show that our method produces images that can successfully be used for data augmentation."}}

Doing so often results in unrealistic looking images because the inserted object's shading is inconsistent with the target scene's shading. Existing reshading methods require a geometric and physical model of the inserted object, which is then rendered using environment parameters. Accurately constructing such a model only from a single image is beyond the current understanding of computer vision.\n\nWe describe an alternative procedure -- cut-and-paste neural rendering, to render the inserted fragment's shading field consistent with the target scene.  We use a Deep Image Prior (DIP) as a neural renderer trained to render an image with consistent image decomposition inferences.  The resulting rendering from DIP should have an albedo consistent with composite albedo; it should have a shading field that, outside the inserted fragment, is the same as the target scene's shading field; \nand composite surface normals are consistent with the final rendering's shading field. \nThe result is a simple procedure that produces convincing and realistic shading. Moreover, our procedure does not require rendered images or image-decomposition from real images in the training or labeled annotations. In fact, our only use of simulated ground truth is our use of a pre-trained normal estimator. Qualitative results are strong, supported by a user study comparing against state-of-the-art image harmonization baseline."}}

We seek to understand how to improve style transfer.To do so requires quantitative evaluation procedures, but current evaluation is qualitative, mostly involving user studies. We describe a novel quantitative evaluation procedure. Our procedure relies on two statistics: the Effectiveness (E) statistic measures the extent that a given style has been transferred to the target, and the Coherence (C) statistic measures the extent to which the original image's content is preserved. Our statistics are calibrated to human preference: targets with larger values of E and C will reliably be preferred by human subjects in comparisons of style and content, respectively.We use these statistics to investigate relative performance of a number of Neural Style Transfer (NST) methods, revealing a number of intriguing properties. Admissible methods lie on a Pareto frontier (i.e. improving E reduces C, or vice versa). Three methods are admissible: Universal style transfer produces very good C but weak E; modifying the optimization used for Gatys' loss produces a method with strong E and strong C; and a modified cross-layer method has slightly better E at strong cost in C. While the histogram loss improves the E statistics of Gatys' method, it does not make the method admissible. Surprisingly, style weights have relatively little effect in improving EC scores, and most variability in transfer is explained by the style itself (meaning experimenters can be misguided by selecting styles).

Rendering objects using an illumination model of the scene doesn't work, because doing so requires a geometric and material model of the object, which is hard to recover from a single image. In this paper, we introduce a method that corrects shading inconsistencies of the inserted object without requiring a geometric and physical model or an environment map. Our method uses a deep image prior (DIP), trained to produce reshaded renderings of inserted objects via consistent image decomposition inferential losses. The resulting image from DIP aims to have (a) an albedo similar to the cut-and-paste albedo, (b) a similar shading field to that of the target scene, and (c) a shading that is consistent with the cut-and-paste surface normals. The result is a simple procedure that produces convincing shading of the inserted object. We show the efficacy of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively for several objects with complex surface properties and also on a dataset of spherical lampshades for quantitative evaluation. Our method significantly outperforms an Image Harmonization (IH) baseline for all these objects. They also outperform the cut-and-paste and IH baselines in a user study with over 100 users."}}

Such adversarial perturbations are usually restricted by bounding their $\\mathcal{L}_p$ norm such that they are imperceptible, and thus many current defenses can exploit this property to reduce their adversarial impact.  In this paper, we instead introduce \"unrestricted\" perturbations that manipulate semantically meaningful image-based visual descriptors - color and texture - in order to generate effective and photorealistic adversarial examples. We show that these semantically aware perturbations are effective against JPEG compression, feature squeezing and adversarially trained model. We also show that the proposed methods can effectively be applied to both image classification and image captioning tasks on complex datasets such as ImageNet and MSCOCO. In addition, we conduct comprehensive user studies to show that our generated semantic adversarial examples are photorealistic to humans despite large magnitude perturbations when compared to other attacks."}}
