However, the DNN parameter update in CL-based autonomous systems is extremely resource-hungry. The existing DNN accelerators cannot be directly employed in CL because they only support the execution of the forward propagation. Only a few prior architectures execute the backpropagation and weight update, but they lack the control and management for CL. Towards this, we design a hardware architecture, TinyCL, to perform CL on resource-constrained autonomous systems. It consists of a processing unit that executes both forward and backward propagation, and a control unit that manages memory-based CL workload. To minimize the memory accesses, the sliding window of the convolutional layer moves in a snake-like fashion. Moreover, the Multiply-and-Accumulate units can be reconfigured at runtime to execute different operations. As per our knowledge, our proposed TinyCL represents the first hardware accelerator that executes CL on autonomous systems. We synthesize the complete TinyCL architecture in a 65 nm CMOS technology node with the conventional ASIC design flow. It executes 1 epoch of training on a Conv + ReLU + Dense model on the CIFAR10 dataset in 1.76 s, while 1 training epoch of the same model using an Nvidia Tesla P100 GPU takes 103 s, thus achieving a 58 x speedup, consuming 86 mW in a 4.74 mm2 die."}}

To address this problem, a new generation of networks called Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) has emerged, which mimic the behavior of the human brain to improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption. These networks often process large amounts of sensitive information, such as confidential data, and thus privacy issues arise. Homomorphic encryption (HE) offers a solution, allowing calculations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it. This research compares traditional DNNs and SNNs using the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) encryption scheme. The LeNet-5 model, a widely-used convolutional architecture, is used for both DNN and SNN models based on the LeNet-5 architecture, and the networks are trained and compared using the FashionMNIST dataset. The results show that SNNs using HE achieve up to 40% higher accuracy than DNNs for low values of the plaintext modulus t, although their execution time is longer due to their time-coding nature with multiple time-steps."}}
