Their data-driven nature eschews the need for explicit analytical models, while remaining algorithmic components of the filtering process intact. As a result, the gain mechanism -- a critical component of the filtering process -- remains non-differentiable and cannot be adjusted to the specific nature of the task or context. In this paper, we propose an attention-based Multimodal Differentiable Filter ($\\alpha$-MDF) which utilizes modern attention mechanisms to learn multimodal latent representations. Unlike previous differentiable filter frameworks, $\\alpha$-MDF substitutes the traditional gain, e.g., the Kalman gain, with a neural attention mechanism. The approach generates specialized, context-dependent gains that can effectively combine multiple input modalities and observed variables. We validate $\\alpha$-MDF on a diverse set of robot state estimation tasks in real world and simulation. Our results show $\\alpha$-MDF achieves significant reductions in state estimation errors, demonstrating nearly 4-fold improvements compared to state-of-the-art sensor fusion strategies for rigid body robots. Additionally, the $\\alpha$-MDF consistently outperforms differentiable filter baselines by up to 45% in soft robotics tasks. The project  is available at alpha-mdf.github.io and the codebase is at github.com/ir-lab/alpha-MDF"}}

However, NN based estimators and controllers may produce potentially unsafe outputs over previously unseen data points. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for updating NN control policies to satisfy a given set of formal safety constraints, while also optimizing the original loss function.  Given a set of mixed-integer linear constraints, we define the NN repair problem as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP). In extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our repair method in generating safe policies for a lower-leg prosthesis."}}

Learning such policies requires a substantial investment with regards to time and compute resources. Still, the resulting controllers are highly device-specific and cannot easily be transferred to a robot with different morphology, capability, appearance or dynamics. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient approach for training language-conditioned manipulation policies that allows for rapid transfer across different types of robots. By introducing a novel method, namely Hierarchical Modularity, and adopting supervised attention across multiple sub-modules, we bridge the divide between modular and end-to-end learning and enable the reuse of functional building blocks. In both simulated and real world robot manipulation experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods and can transfer policies across 4 different robots in a sample-efficient manner. Finally, we show that the functionality of learned sub-modules is maintained beyond the training process and can be used to introspect the robot decision-making process."}}

A Mixed-Reality Framework for Human Robot Collaboration", "abstract": "Fluency and coordination in human-robot collaborative tasks highly depend on shared situational awareness among the interaction partners. This paper sheds light on a work-in-progress framework for Intention Projection (IntPro). To this end, we propose a  mixed-reality setup for Intention Projection that combines monocular computer vision with adaptive projection mapping to provide information about the robot's intentions and next actions. This information is projected in the form of visual cues into the environment. A human subject study consisting of a generic joint sorting task is proposed to validate the framework. Here, visual cues about the robot's intentions were provided to the human via mainly two modes,  namely a) highlighting the object that the human needs to interact with and b) visualizing the robot's upcoming movements. This work hypothesizes that combining these fundamental modes enables fast and effective signaling, which, in turn, improves task efficiency, transparency, and safety. "}}

In addition to the ability  to  adapt  to  new  environments,  our  approach  also  enables  robots  to  balance their computational needs with improvements in task performance.
