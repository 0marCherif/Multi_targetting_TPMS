In this paper, we present a new approach to exploit the geometry and physics underlying electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) to learn efficiently with a relatively small dataset. We first introduce a non-Euclidean encoding-decoding network that allows us to describe the unknown and measurement variables over their respective geometrical domains. We then explicitly model the geometry-dependent physics in between the two domains via a bipartite graph over their graphical embeddings. We applied the resulting network to reconstruct electrical activity on the heart surface from body-surface potentials. In a series of generalization tasks with increasing difficulty, we demonstrated the improved ability of the network to generalize across geometrical changes underlying the data using less than 10% of training data and fewer variations of training geometry in comparison to its Euclidean alternatives. In both simulation and real-data experiments, we further demonstrated its ability to be quickly fine-tuned to new geometry using a modest amount of data."}}

Compared to univariate time-series forecasting, this adds a new challenge of reasoning about the latent dynamics of an unobserved abstract state. Sequential latent variable models (LVMs) present an attractive solution, although existing works either struggle with long-term forecasting or have difficulty learning across diverse dynamics. In this paper, we first present a conceptual framework of sequential LVMs to unify existing works, contrast their fundamental limitations, and identify an intuitive solution to long-term forecasting for diverse dynamics via meta-learning. We then present the first framework of few-shot forecasting for high-dimensional time-series: instead of learning a single dynamic function, we leverage data of diverse dynamics and learn to adapt latent dynamic functions to few-shot support series. This is realized via Bayesian meta-learning underpinned by: 1) a latent dynamic function conditioned on knowledge derived from few-shot support series, and 2) a meta-model that learns to extract such dynamic-specific knowledge via feed-forward embedding of support set. We compared the presented framework with a comprehensive set of baseline models trained 1) globally on the large meta-training set with diverse dynamics, and 2) individually on single dynamics, both with and without fine-tuning to k-shot support series used by the meta-models. We demonstrated that the presented framework is agnostic to the latent dynamic function of choice and, at meta-test time, is able to forecast for new dynamics given variable-shot of support series."}}

We argue that this is because existing approaches treat continually-arrived data independently, without considering how they are related based on the underlying semantic factors. We address this by a new generative model describing a topologically-connected mixture of spike-and-slab distributions in the latent space, learned end-to-end in a continual fashion via principled variational inference. The learned mixture is able to automatically discover the active semantic factors underlying each data environment and to accumulate their relational structure based on that. This distilled knowledge of different data environments can further be used for generative replay and guiding continual disentangling of new semantic factors. We tested the presented method on a split version of 3DShapes to provide the first quantitative disentanglement evaluation of continually learned representations, and further demonstrated its ability to continually disentangle new representations in benchmark datasets."}}

Second, to perform such disentanglement, the presented method evaluates and compares deep generative models with latent density modeled by nonparametric Indian Buffet Process to account for the complex generative process of ECG data. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Results:</i> In the simulated data, the experiments demonstrate, for the first time, concrete evidence of the possibility to disentangle key generative anatomical factors within ECG data in separation from task-relevant generative factors. We achieve a disentanglement score of 92.1% while disentangling five anatomical generative factors and the task-relevant generative factor. In both simulated and real-data experiments, this work further provides quantitative evidence for the benefit of disentanglement learning on the downstream clinical task of localizing the origin of ventricular activation. Overall, the presented method achieves an improvement of around 18.5%, and 11.3% for the simulated dataset, and around 7.2%, and 3.6% for the real dataset, over baseline CNN, and standard generative model, respectively. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Conclusion:</i> These results demonstrate the importance as well as the feasibility of the disentangled representation learning of inter-subject anatomical variations within ECG data. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Significance:</i> This work suggests the important research direction to deal with the well-known challenge posed by the presence of significant inter-subject variations during an automated analysis of ECG data."}}

Such local activities however can signify important abnormal events in physiological systems, such as an extra foci triggering an abnormal propagation of electrical waves in the heart. We discuss a novel technique for reconstructing such local activity that, while small in signal strength, is the cause of subsequent global activities that have larger signal strength. Our central innovation is to approach this by explicitly modeling and disentangling how the latent state of a system is influenced by potential hidden internal interventions. In a novel neural formulation of state-space models (SSMs), we first introduce causal-effect modeling of the latent dynamics via a system of interacting neural ODEs that separately describes 1) the continuous-time dynamics of the internal intervention, and 2) its effect on the trajectory of the system\u2019s native state. Because the intervention can not be directly observed but have to be disentangled from the observed subsequent effect, we integrate knowledge of the native intervention-free dynamics of a system, and infer the hidden intervention by assuming it to be responsible for differences observed between the actual and hypothetical intervention-free dynamics. We demonstrated a proof-of-concept of the presented framework on reconstructing ectopic foci disrupting the course of normal cardiac electrical propagation from remote observations."}}
