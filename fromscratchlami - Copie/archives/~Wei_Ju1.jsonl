However, the performance of these\nmethods is still far from satisfactory since GNNs usually have\nlimited representation capacity when it comes to complex traffic\nnetworks. Graphs, by nature, fall short in capturing non-pairwise\nrelations. Even worse, existing methods follow the paradigm\nof message passing that aggregates neighborhood information\nlinearly, which fails to capture complicated spatio-temporal highorder interactions. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we\npropose a novel model named Dynamic Hypergraph Structure\nLearning (DyHSL) for traffic flow prediction. To learn nonpairwise relationships, our DyHSL extracts hypergraph structural information to model dynamics in the traffic networks, and\nupdates each node representation by aggregating messages from\nits associated hyperedges. Additionally, to capture high-order\nspatio-temporal relations in the road network, we introduce an\ninteractive graph convolution block, which further models the\nneighborhood interaction for each node. Finally, we integrate\nthese two views into a holistic multi-scale correlation extraction\nmodule, which conducts temporal pooling with different scales\nto model different temporal patterns. Extensive experiments\non four popular traffic benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed DyHSL compared with a broad\nrange of competing baselines."}}

The problem is typically solved by learning graph neural networks with pseudo-labeling or knowledge distillation to incorporate both labeled and unlabeled graphs. However, these methods usually either suffer from overconfident and biased pseudo-labels or suboptimal distillation caused by the insufficient use of unlabeled data. Inspired by the recent progress of contrastive learning and dual learning, we propose DualGraph, a principled framework to leverage unlabeled graphs more effectively for semi-supervised graph classification. DualGraph consists of a prediction module and a retrieval module to model graphs <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$G$</tex> and their labels <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$y$</tex> from opposite while complementary views (i.e., p(y | G) and p(G | y) respectively). The two modules are jointly trained via posterior regularization, which encourages their inter-module consistency on unlabeled graphs. Moreover, we improve model training for each module with a contrastive learning framework to encourage the intra-module consistency on unlabeled data. Experimental results on a range of publicly accessible datasets reveal the effectiveness of our DualGraph."}}

It aims to provide users with the convenience to discover their interested places to visit based on previous visits and current status. Most existing methods usually merely leverage recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to explore sequential influences for recommendation. Despite the effectiveness, these methods not only neglect topological geographical influences among POIs, but also fail to model high-order sequential substructures. To tackle the above issues, we propose a Kernel-Based Graph Neural Network (KBGNN) for next POI recommendation, which combines the characteristics of both geographical and sequential influences in a collaborative way. KBGNN consists of a geographical module and a sequential module. On the one hand, we construct a geographical graph and leverage a message passing neural network to capture the topological geographical influences. On the other hand, we explore high-order sequential substructures in the user-aware sequential graph using a graph kernel neural network to capture user preferences. Finally, a consistency learning framework is introduced to jointly incorporate geographical and sequential information extracted from two separate graphs. In this way, the two modules effectively exchange knowledge to mutually enhance each other. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world LBSN datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts.
